"med & large blasters need some assist.either that or the deimos needs a + to pg and speed"
"i agree that blasters need fixing. at the minute they are horrifying. they are the close range extreme damage weapon that can't hit a space station if you have any transversel. i mean what is going on there? blasters should be terrifying. your counter is simple. stay out of thier range. however if you slip into optimal it should pretty much be game over. a tracking bonused ship ie megathron, should never miss when in fall off and rarely miss in optimal with max skills vs similar sized target with average speed unless you are being td.to summerise,blasters need a huge boost to trackingblasters need a slight boost to base damageleave webs alone. pirates are getting them to go with blaster boats so i worry that they will become super powerful, which they should be anyway with these fixes.leave blaster range as is. its perfect if blasters had these fixesfor the love of eve. fix t2 heavy damage ammo. the draw backs vs benefits are terrible.thank you and goodnight"
"remove the -50% tracking penalty of void ammo, should work?"
"still, void damage is not enough. but that's a good thought, maybe boost hybrid ammo, especifically void and null, and definitely way more tracking."
"this would be great, but the heretic can already tell you all about the awesomeness of rockets. soon as they fix that, then maybe we can talk about such a boat."
"hum, i don't have a smart comment to do, but i support this"
"at fanfest they talked about t3 frigs.frigs> there are 6 basic + 2 assault + 2 ceptors + 2 covops + 1 electronic warfaredestroyers> oh yeah we got interdictors thats typical ccp instead of giving destroyers a powerup and players a reason to train destroyers they boost the already good frigs even more.destroyers are the unwanted stepchild of eve."
"supported.maybe not the changes you propose, but destroyers need some love. even though they are supposed to be frigates with more firepower i think they need a moderate hp boost. also a second dessy for each race would be interesting."

"this will be the 4th csm i think"
"currently, when a player deletes their character, all of the character's items become property of their corporation. however, the items are delivered to the division 1 hangar of that corporation. if the corp doesn't have a hangar at that station, it is put into impound. i'd propose that these items be placed in corp deliveries instead. this allows corps to collect the items without having to rent/cancel an office at each station. furthermore, if you do own a station there, anyone with division 1 access can take the items with no record, as they are just placed on the hangar floor."
"reasonable and very logical change"
"how often do players delete characters without transferring all significant assets anyway? this change seems like it would affect very few people."
"1. poor design should be fixed, regardless of if it affects 100 people or 10,0002. all it takes is one character with random junk in 57 stations to make corp asset pulls a pain. all the sudden, its showing 15 rounds of antimatter is some station we'll never visit, and its a pain to clear it out. i'd like my assets list for my corp to be as tidy as possible."
"supported.make it low priority, that's fine, but it really is a bad way to do it."
"the beauty of this is that is is probably a very small fix, and wouldn't take a lot of coder time. its one of 100 minor things that can be done to improve eve."
"frequently people switch the corporations they do missions with. when they do some lp's are stuck with their old missioning corporation. they don't have enough lp's to be worth getting anything and they can't be traded to their new corporation.to solve this i think you should be able to trade lp's to another corporation at 90% of their original value with the other corporation. if the corporation respects you enough (higher standing) they should give you a higher rate. i'd scale it at another 1% per point of standing. so someone with 5.0 with the corporation they want to transfer to would get 95% of their lp value when traded to the new corporation. someone with 8.0 would get 98%.if i want to trade 30,000 lp's from amarr navy to caldari navy with 2.8 standing i would get 27,840 caldari navy lp's. some corporations might pay lower than 90% if their lp store is felt to be worth more.summary: ccp should allow lp's to be traded between npc corporations depending on your standing with said corporation so that people don't have to abandon their loyalty points when switching the corporations they want to mission for."

"so this friend of mine, who has lots of \"loyalty points\" with me abandons me and decides to spend his time with other people in the future. however, he still wants to retain whatever gratitude i had for him and transfer it to his new friends, so that they like him better. yeah, sure. actually, i'm more likely to call them an tell them what an unreliable jackal he is, causing exactly the opposite effect.doesn't make sense in real world, doesn't make sense in eve."
"while this might be nice to have for some people (me included), it neither makes sense in game mechanics nor in rp. at most, they might give you 30-50% for your lps, but even still...not supported."
"dear god no. different lp stores with different rewards are the few things that directly reward working for some less used corporations and factions. if you use the most popular mission grinding hubs and corps, you get to chain good missions, but can only use those lp on the same rewards all the other lemmings can.there might be some merit in transferring lp within a faction, but the conversion rate should be heavily fined, since certain corps are just so much better suited for grinding lp than others. not all corps have good multiple lvl 4 agents in highsec, so using lol 90% transfer rates, would make running missions for them a bad choice.not to mention you could have just cashed in your lp at the old corp and converted it all to isk. iskies don't weight anything or take any space and they can used everywhere, so i don't really see any issue to be solved."
"nuff said"
"ok so we all know we have the well known slave and crystal sets slave been bonuse to extra hitpoints and crystals been for shield on the shield boost amount, i know someone might have suggested this but i was thinking why not duplicate both sets and change them around.etc for armor we would take the crystal set duplicate it and make it for armor so say lets call it minor (just name off top of me head) and it a) gets the bonuse for armor repair amount or b) gets a bonuse for the duration off the reppers and for shield take the slave set duplicate them for sheidl and call them diamond (name off top of my head again) and give it a bonuse to shield hp both parties then have equal sets and its alot more interesting for everyone as well ^^thoughts/gflames a gogo"
"no. a shield amount set would make passive shield tanks over powered especially on the drake to name one ship off hand."
"correct that it does just give you one preset orbital distance. but i agree it would be better because of the ship you fly at the time, then the change in tatics if required. say if boosting abilities came into play because of fleet bonuses if friendlies warp in then all your settings now change.i agree you need to be able to set distance manually on the fly per ship you fly and per target. it all comes back to more control of the ship which encourages just a little more immersion.supportedp.s. any1 know how to put the little thumbs up underneath the avatar?? yes im sure it been answered somewhewre but since im still in this post writing.... lol"
"it's a very useful topic. as the corporation ceo i can say it has often happened that a person took somebody else's ships or property. for instance, if you leave a carrier under the force field for the night, you can find nothing there in the morning. it could be avoided for example by setting access restrictions in ship maintanance array or under force field by password. i think, it is of vital importance to give the corporation members a chance to keep their personal assets or ships in poses being shure they will be safe."

"dominion viewsdominion is going to be a radical change for many people, especially those who hold or are hoping to hold space in 0.0 space. i have played most of my eve life in 0.0 and have become intimately familiar with the pos warfare, the blobs, dds and station ping pong of the old days. it is my experience with the sov system as it has matured (and broken) in eve that is the primary reason i decided to run for csm. it is the core of the game for people not living in empire and will make or break the playability of the game for the forseable future.sov: i look at the sov changes from both sides of the equation. i currently have high value capital build infrastructure in place in claimed sov space so that part of me does not like the changes to sov 4 specifically. however, the pvp side of me has become fustrated with the lack of movement in the large portion of 0.0 space that forces us to roam for hours to find and form of meaningful combat. call me crazy but i like *most* of the new planned changes as they force the fights away from ducking in and out of pos bubbles and move it out to the open where combat fleets have to commit to the battle from both the defending and attacking side. i approach everything with an open mind. in that regard i do not automatically assume change is bad. i do however believe that as the sov system matures and it is ballanced / added on, that there should be, now more then ever, a council that specifically has experience and understands the mechanics / game play aspects involved to ensure that it evolves in such a manner as to make 0.0 both ballanced and accelerate combat to where we can have many smaller scale battles progressing on the map at any given time vs massive blobbing eve warssupercapitals:i personally do not agree with the roll that motherships..i mean super carriers :) .. have been delegated to within eve. i do however believe that the titan doomsday is very overdue and welcome the change. i make both of these statements as someone who both builds and flies titans and scs on trinity. the changes to sov 4 will make these items even more difficult to produce and as such their value should increase. based on the skill time required and the sacrifices nessesary to put a pilot in one, i beleive they should have relevent roles. especially in the case of the super carriers where if they were specifically re-named to highlight their combat roll vs being a true mothership, they should project firepower at par with thier investment. titans, are well .. titans and should not be the 1 button win button to ruin the day of a roaming gang that just came 20 jumps to find a fight and get taken out with 1 click. i think there could be a roll for titans in the game and that should be somewhere beyond just a glorified jump bridge."
"there are few if any people who have the depth and the knowledge that qual has when it comes to industry and all things related. his character has one of the highest sp totals in eve and he has done it all. if you wanted an expert about all things science and industry in eve this is your man."
"it is probably true that my strongest area of knowledge is in all things industrial, it was where i started in the game.i was in cornexant corp's industrial group when we build the first known battleship in the game in 2003.i was in xanadu and later xancom when back when naga and xanandu were the biggest public players in the early tech 2 market. there was full scale market war between us back then. that was fun.i was the only known char to have all skill related to invetion maxed out even before invention was released, and i did my fair share in the community efford to figure out all the hidden rules behind that.i was gas mining pioneer. (though that was with an alt.)i didn't play that puplic a role when tech 3 hit this spring, but i was out there in wormhole space collecting the resources and building those first rounds of tech 3 ships.so not only do i know the mechanics, i also know the path that lead us to where we are today.as said i play with more than this character, and with the others i have been doing pvp in all scales, agents, cosmos, exploration, out of game forum wars, trading and more.i have been around the block."

":effort: means i haven't read the entire thread, but i just want to point out something that may or may not have been addressed. lowsec piracy, some roam with logistics in fleet and no local reps on the ships (and often every bs has a rr), you're going to make it so they would be forced to stay away from a gate after repping so they could get rid of their 1min aggro timer before jumping through.this means that moving around with a rr fleet, or one supported by logistics is slower than a snail on the salt-flats due to the constant need for ships to \"deagress\" their repping (which is saving their fleetmate from dieing to sentry fire) to jump through.not supported, quit doing empire wars if you don't like the mechanics. also this."

"*with all respect as there still seem to be need of discussion i copied my proposal from the assembly hall into the features and ideas discussion part to unclutter the assembly hall from any ongoing discussion.the proposal is available for discussion here in the features and ideas discussion part.*[proposal] scan-able wrecks and containers/strengthen the salvager professionproposal: make wrecks and containers scan-able with core scan probes.motivation:this would strengthen the salvager as independent profession and would allow them to scan for the wrecks that are left behind by mission runners, rather than the need to scan for the active mission runner in his mission. this would ease on the relation ship between mission runners and salvagers as the salvager does not need to salvage the wrecks under the eyes of an active mission runner, especially since the mission runners still think that salvage belongs to them, which is not the case as stated by ccp several times.it would also relieve the database from maintaining left behind wrecks for the full two hours and could works as player driven \"database cleaning\" of objects.addendum .1as commented by myself here: make it so that deadspace areas cover the sig. radius of wrecks, just like deadspace areas did before during the old scanning system to ships signature radius, so that wrecks in deadspace areas are more difficult to scan down than wrecks in open spacethis would prevent people from abusing core probes to scan down active mission runners via their wrecks as these will be harder to scan down than wrecks in empty space or the mission runner itself with combat probes.it would also direct the active salvager toward the abandoned wrecks first rather than to the wrecks of an active mission runner, seperating the two professions, reducing overlap of the two and reducing the conflict due to subjective percieve ownership rights.addendum .2distinguished the proposel pointing that i want wrecks being able to scan with \"core probes\".i also think that the skill requirements for the different probes are kinda mixed up.the core probes should be useable at astrometics (just like now) lvl i, the deep probes at iii (which is now at v) and the combat at 5 ( now at i).increase expanded probe launcher skill requirement from astrometics ii to iii as well.this would distinguish the dedicated salvager - being able to scan directly for wrecks - from those that are looking for ships."
"i'm not sure if this is a troll or ... - you know, i think it is a troll.there is no way you can actually believe what you wrote.not supported. ninja salvaging is easy enough."
"i can't see any reason why wrecks should not be scannable. ninja salvaging is a legitimate (albeit hated) career and this would expand on it and possibly open it up to those who do not want the in-your-face of the current ninja salvaging stigma.supported."
"yes please, there are so many missions unsalvaged, why waste that?"
"makes perfect sense that you should be able to scan for wrecks to me."
"yes, this is a valid suggestion. i would still prefer it to be flaggable... but whatever."
"some further thoughts:it should be more difficult to get a hit on a wreck than on a ship in general.afaik deadspaces \"cover\" players ships slightly from scanning making it slightly more difficult to scan them when they are in a deadspace (in the old system).in the old system ppl were thus scanning for the drones rather than for the ship itself.im not sure how this works under the new system though.scanning a ship does require special probes, namely the combat probes. so scanning a mission runner indirectly by using core probes to scan the wrecks would become possible, but you wouldnt know if one is inside till you get there.so to not make ppl abuse normal core probes to scan down mission runners \"indirectly\" it should be fairly difficult with cores to scan wrecks.still this would at least allow you to scan down for those wrecks that get left behind by a mission runner or left behind by exploration site users who didnt clean up their exploration site.in addition since deadspaces areas dissapear after a while the \"covering\" of it (as stated above) will dissapear too (if it still exist), so it could be that scanning wrecks in a not active mission could/can be easier than scanning for wrecks in an active missionfurther, as stated in the weekly salvager thread in the general discussion (now moved and locked to features and discussions ): it's not ninja salvaging, since currently you're doing it right under the nose of the mission runner. there is nothing stealthy about it . it would be ninja if you could do it without noticing the salvager. it's not stealing as ccp has stated several times that they want salvaging to be an independent profession. and naturally i support my own idea ;)"
"i've always wondered why wrecks weren't scannable? possibly make it so that any wrecks that are left after the mission is turned in become scannable? i.e. - turn in mission, wrecks now \"become\" scannable. vovi like this idea."
"it makes sense to me! when i was missioning myself, i always went with a salvager and did everything before handing the mission in. probably not very efficient, but in my opinion that small part of \"personal deadspace\" you get from your agent can't be yours for all eternity. salvaging is not \"part\" of missioning either in my opinion, as it is entirely possible to complete a mission by not salvaging a single wreck. so to a missioner, salvage is also a different profession so to say, and should be up for contest!"
"this actually sounds very reasonable."
"love it, make it so!"
"well, ok."
"fully support bringing pvp loot ownership in line with pve loot ownership......it's just that i think the loot should still \"belong\" to the thing that was killed in both cases, not the thing doing the killing. that way, in one action you'd remove the one game mechanic that two groups of whiners like to point at to support their whines (yes, i'm grouping the people in support of this change in with those who complain about ninja salvaging).as has been stated, if you want to be able to shoot the person taking from the wrecks of ships you killed, it's time to come out from under concord's skirt and fight in lowsec/0.0."
"you want a big improvement? i can't believe you don't just let whoever read the hundreds and hundreds of messages complaining about the sounds since apocrypha came out and want everyone to post their problems again. first, fix what is wrong, then worry about improving. hell, this avalanche of problems was caused by what was supposed to be an improvement!(feeling depressed and disappointed)symlin"

"most everything that is done in eve is done on a per-character basis. the majority of transactions involving real-money goods (namely timecodes and plexes) are sold to characters. access to the api keeps the actual account name hidden by using the accounts id number and a simple and full access code.i propose changing the character sale process to make it so that it is no longer a requirement to give out the accounts log-in name. i propose changing it so that a character is sold to another character on the destination account (failing if there are no free slots on said account), or selling it to the simple api key using the same simple api credentials one would put into a program like eve-mon.i figure with all the news of account theft and hacking, every little bit of security that can be added to accounts should."

"t1 sentry are more powerful then t1 heavies, because they are stationary gun platforms. for some reason it is not the case with t2 sentries,.. well, that needs changing.the sheer fact that the drones do not have engines installed and take up same amount of space should mean that there is more space for guns."

"agreed, imy corp currently has 3 ships worth between 40 and 70 million isk, sat impounded in different stations that would each cost 50 to 60 million isk to rent an office at...it would be nice if i could get them out without paying almost as much as each ship is worth to do it..."
"topic says it all."
"i endorse this suggestion."
"i could see some sort of transfer within the faction - but absolutely not for inter-faction exchange.even if caldari likes amarr, why should they accept their coupons (lp)?also, the conversion rate would have to be very complex - rare corps with hardly any agents should be worth more than corps with tons of l4q20 agents.if at all, i'd suggest a new sort of faction-lp, which has to be claimed by converting corp-lp."
"as much as i'd absolutely love a set of implants that increased my shield hp by 53.7% (the same as the current crystal and slave implants increase their relevant bonus'), i have to sadly agree with marlona... it would be far, far, over-powered.rokh would be untouchable, not to mention the soon to be released navy scorp and updated rattlesnake. drakes, nighthawks, and vultures would be... indestructible by anything less than overwhelming odds.let's not even get into the ramifications of that type of an implant on a capital/super-cap ship."
"just make slaves not affect capital ships and you remove the huge imbalance that currently exists between the two implant sets"
"or make crystals apply to capital reps? (yes, i'm aware that this would be vastly op, just saying it to make the point that slaves shouldn't apply either)"
"why would it be op? why would 50% more tank be op in a capital fight defined by 100k dps and where tank is defined by rr?"
"ok, then make the new shield buffer implants increase shield recharge time. problem solved.and it's not op if they give the same amount of buffer as slaves do..."
"not all capital fights are 20+ dreads and 20+ carriers on each side. when you're talking a carrier or two and support vs another carrier or two and support, that extra tanking dps means shield carriers are untouchable until the end of the fight when everything can be focused on them. the phoenix in siege would be a ***** to kill, even by a fairly well fit pos that's going to be quite a bit more difficult."
"yeah, i've always wanted a repair effectiveness implant that wasn't hardwired to slots 6-10."
"i agree with the op, and i would even go a step further as to how it should be implemented: i feel the default orbit and keep at range distances should be a ship setting instead of a pilot setting. i want this taranis to have a default orbit distance of 500m, and this vagabond to have a default orbit distance of 15km. and when i switch from one to the other, i don't want to reset these distances again each time."
"meh, sba doesn't apply on that many ships, they need those midslots for tackle."
"power grid usage is phenomenal compared to other large artillery. the heaviest large rail gun uses 2500 power grid while the second heaviest laser cannon uses 3575. the projectile artillery matches 3575 as well, but again that is the heaviest caliber projectile vs the 2nd heaviest laser.example:large railguns-350mm ii - 1969pg425mm ii - 2625pglarge artillery-1200mm ii - 30251400mm ii - 3575large beam cannons-mega ii - 3575tachyon ii - 4125these grid needs are absurd for any players new or old. the tachyon beam laser ii rack cannot fit on any amarr battleship. i'm suggesting a bonus for the apocalypse that reduces beam laser pg needs, or simply reducing the pg consumption in general regardless of the ship."
"tachyon apocs are already one of the best snipers in the game if not the best. lrn2fit."
"good.lasers are the premiere turret for any role in this game you care to mention and on amarr boats the cap use isn't even an issue- which leaves us with the one remaining downside.fitting.so, i think your thread is horribly misguided."
"i've never had a problem fitting an 8 tach apoc or a 7 tach geddon, reactor control ii's are an important part of the fitting, bit lame to be asking for a boost to the already best weapon system in game tbh"
"meh. sounds good on paper but really not much different from lowering the jam strength.both end up with the same result: more target locks for the opposition. whether you completely jam less often or you jam as often but only half his target locks really doesn't make much difference.also, people would just target lock tons of random ships as fast as possible to make it less probable that the lock that gets jammed is the one on the primary."
"nothing is impossible. i hope"

"yes, you can indeed hit a moving frigate from that far away. the problem is that it's not really useful to do so. at that range you're using spike m, and even with 3 mfs ii you'll only volley for six-hundredish before any resist or tracking is accounted for. also, at 177 km the frigate will be beyond the range of any other ships in your fleet. no other cruiser sized ship will reach those ranges, and battleships likely won't hit the frigate, or will be working on higher priority targets, so your frigate will just warp away.the main strength of the eagle isn't in shooting stuff at that range; it's that you can use faction lead of even move to thorium and still be engaging with the rest of your gang in sniper hacs.the eagle really needs some more pg. of any of the remotely viable sniper hacs, the eagle has the lowest absolute value, and is the only ship of the group that cannot fit a full rack of the largest gun and mwd without a rcu, even at awu 5.the zealot by comparison can fit practically its entire load out without any help at awu 5."

"just one question. what do you think moving all high-quality agents to low-security space would do? it'd be the same story we have now, with maybe a 1% loss in mission profitability (most profit comes from loot and salvage anyways). the high-quality agents would be controlled by pirate corporations as level 5 agents are now, and players would form mission hubs around the quality 0-5 agents. in short, nothing would change.in other topics, ccp has already said that changing the bpo/bpc graphics and/or colors is impossible using the current game structure. dictor modules are banned from low-sec for a reason, and that is not going to change. scanning for macro programs requires access to the kernel (which most players would be against) or a list of macro programs (the macros can be easily renamed to avoid said list). restricted sell and buy orders goes against the laissez-faire attitude of the game, and ccp has already said no to this one.i'm not saying you don't have good ideas, but thought and research would help your platform out incredibly. i see no reason to vote for a candidate who fails to research before tossing his hat into the ring."

"i'm looking for a csm who'll represent my interests. someone who will finally address the issues of suicide ganking and ninja salvaging in missions. how'm i supposed to get anything done when griefers abound, and i can't do a single mission in hisec without having my loot stolen nor haul without getting suicide ganked?it's time someone got serious about bringing these issues to ccp. someone who's not afraid to get in their face in person about these lame game mechanics, and put a stop to them. if they want to kill us or salvage our loot, they should have to legitimately wardec us! i stay in an npc corp for a reason and i think it's just plain dumb that some idiot in a full t1 fit ship can come along and attack and kill me anyway, and make money off of the insurance and loot to boot! isn't concord supposed to stop this sort of crap from happening? why does it take them so long to arrive? why is insurance still paid for these ****ers ships once they get blown up?! this has to end. i want a csm candidate who'll stand up for my rights, to play the game how i want!who will answer my call?!"
"what the heck, this is the second thread i've seen about this. why is everyone all of a sudden complaining about all these anti-carebears. as part of a successful merc group we use 'unethical' means of carrying out our business. a lot of people complain but the truth is you can ninja salvage and suicide gank just as well as anyone else. ccp understands this which is why they haven't put in a mechanic to fix it. i want a csm who knows how to play this game the right way, not some carebear that spends all this time protecting people who are helpless anyway."
"i agree with wapquad!"
"how am i supposed to defend myself from 20 people? just the other day i was afk piloting my fenrir through hisec and when i came back from getting coffee i found that my ship had been destroyed by a bunch of suicide gankers in battleships. how'm i supposed to deal with that? i can't even fit guns on my freighter.the real truth is that this game has been infested by a bunch of zombies masquerading as people who have no real morals or seemingly emotions. they'll easily just **** away hours of other people's hard work in a few short minutes. one time, i even hired a merc corp, but they just took my isk and then didn't wardec the guys who were ganking me, or protect me while i moved my cargo. they're unreliable at best, and if ccp thinks that this is an okay idea, then i will take my four accounts elsewhere. i think lots of other carebears feel the same way, but i'd rather not abandon eve, because it's a beautiful game. this is why we need a csm who'll represent our interests!"
"are you seriously still complaining about this? you have got to be one of the dumbest ones i've seen in a while, gtfo tbh."
"lol i can't believe you are so butthurt cause you got your ship ganked. you need to htfu. my battle hardened corp knows what its like to take a few losses. we've been blobbed so hard by like 1.5 times our numbers and they came in bs. but because we are so good at what we do we make back losses back with insurance and stuff. everyone that knows anything about this game knows that people are harsh and will use any means necessary to get ahead. in a way it is your fault for hauling expensive items that are worth taking. perhaps you should rethink how you play this game and take it more seriously."
"the key word here that cretins like you fail to realize is that this is indeed a game, it shouldn't have to be taken seriously to have fun! maybe because you live in your mother's basement and have no real job or responsibilities, you take eve seriously like it's your life. yeh right i bet your a big successful mercenary though, lol, in your newbcorp. i have a friend who's in a nullsec alliance and they would stomp you flat, i just prefer to play by myself though 'cause i don't really like to pvp. real pvpers go to lowsec and 0.0 unlike these bullcrap griefers in hisec who don't really know anything about pvp. run along, little man, keep thinking your hotstuff for killing people who don't wanna pvp back, let me know when you're ready to get in a real fight and i'll call them, even. this is the last time i'm going to post in this thread, 'cause it's clear that arguing with you is useless, even. i mean."
"thats what the corporations and alliances are made for. you can join the corporation of carebears and you can protect yourself together. you can even form an alliance and hire pvp corporation, if you meet some serious resistance, support them with ships so they can fight for you. there is a lot of opportunities in this game to achieve your goals. true carebear corporation can hire an army to conquer the place in eve."
"why are you supporting this carebear. he obviously has no hope in this game and needs to give up while he still has some ships intact. you won't be getting any votes from my corp."
"didn't i just said no?"
"ccp is.we don't need a carebear csm drowning out the concerns of other faction of the playerbase better able to articulate what is wrong with our game."
"how are you supposed to defend yourself? don't go for coffee when flying a 900m isk ship loaded with who knows how much isk in goods.before my csm term, i was flying my industrial through space when i heard my daughter cry. i ran to her while the ship was on autopilot, and returned to see my pod flying through space. i lost most of my possessions totaling over 2b isk that day, but that's the game of eve, and i recovered and prospered.pvp and pve exist in a mutually-beneficial arrangement, and the game hinges on that balance. while i don't pvp due to personal reasons, i would not elect a pure 'carebear' if he had an unrealistic view of the game. as one anonymous pod pilot long ago said, \"undocking is permission to pvp.\"eve is a tough game. quit treating it like star trek and start to see it as firefly, and the game will be a lot smoother for you."
"first, check dierdra vaal's vote matching service once it is up and running. you may find your candidate there. the survey had questions exactly like what you have listed.second, i don't think i am your candidate. both of the issues you listed are important to the game so it stays true to it's nature of being a place where you have to be careful. no where is safe, not even high sec. high sec is just \"safer\". now, i do back the removal of insurance for concorded kills. it increases the expense of suiciding so that activity would decrease. at the same time it teaches people who accidentally shoot people in high sec an expensive lesson that they will not forget.the truth is, you need to take matters into your own hands. here is a video of my mining alt taking it to a can flipper. (still looking for a good video editor)amber is on a rampagei can't sucker any more of the ninja's in dodixie to steal from me anymore. i killed a pilgrim and a scrop and they stay away. even my proteus sitting in a mission with the mwd on doesn't work. they scan my site down and see it's me and leave. if you take care of yourself then they will leave you alone.good luck, fly safe.ashina sitojita park csm thread"

"my campaign is pretty simple. i intend to represent the interests of small to mid size industry corps as well as address the eternal struggle for balance between the carebears and the yarbears in empire space.i am a 6+ year, 5 account, player that has participated in nearly every facet of eve, including a trip to fan fest. i am serious about the game but maintain a healthy perspective and differentiation between reality and eve.i seek to preserve and refine game balance and improve opportunities for the little guys. and by assisting the small industry corps in thriving, bolster the food chain for the predators. sharks shouldn't be eating krill. let the krill thrive, and the sharks have more whales to eat.here are a few of my talking point:security adjustments in high sec that are more realistic in respect to the game environment and less artifacts of unfortunate game mechanics. specifically i would seek to establish differentiation between the high sec system statuses. i.e. there should be a noticeable difference between security in a .5 and security in a 1.0. there are already mechanics in place that would allow a more tangible security model. included in this point are suicide ganking adjustments and ninja salvaging.ganking: ganking should absolutely be allowed. however, i think that by adjusting where and how is can happen, we could not only stifle the cries of the bears but also provide a more challenging and diverse prey group for the yars.ninja salvaging: this one is easy. apply the same system of ownership to wrecks as to cans. mutual shootage solves problems.writeable api elements, and or a lightweight, work safe, training and monitoring client for adjusting training and monitoring market transactions and lab/factory jobs. this is more of a personal issue that i have found is shared by many. i had a chance to talk with the author of capsuleer in the reykjavik airport returning from fan fest. he gets a lot of feedback in this regard and is also pushing in this direction. i intend to help out.adjustments to lab slots in high sec to provide an option that lies between in station slots and a high sec research pos. as part of a thriving carebear population to bolster the food chain, there should be better access for them to lab slots. what i propose would be a gateway to bigger industry. i believe we can promote new industry corps without significantly affecting the bottom line of the larger corps. this could be done by introducing some sort of module or service to noob players that offers slow, limited research, that isn't attractive to more advanced players, or by providing a means of research in empire to the advanced players that would free up lab slots for the noobs. high sec poss are possible in empire but so difficult to achieve standing wise that most empire moons sit empty. opening this up a bit, or providing a reasonable non-combat route to getting sufficient standing, would help in this endeavor.i am not representing carebears or yars in particular. i am representing both in the sense that one cannot survive without the other. yars feed off of carebears. that is a simple fact. without things to pirate, there are no pirates. carebears do the boring work that creates the niche for the pirates to exploit. i believe that a healthy carebear population means a rich pirate population. there is a better balance to be had, and i believe i can help find it.someone give me a baby to kiss... i am available in game or out for interviews or discussion. drop me an evemail or convo me for further contact info or details.questions, comments, trolling, and general flaming welcome.please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
"following a survey with very interesting results, there where some things missing and some things needed further exploration, so with not much further ado, i present my second eve survey:"
"the first survey is now filled to capacity, which means 100 people participated in it. it's more than i expected, but ofcourse it's only a very tiny portion of the full population of eve. but it's the most that my current tools will allow.the second survey is coming along quite nicely, even quicker than the first survey, and at this speed it'll be filled well before the end of the week.a big thank you to everyone who's participating!more is sure to follow..."
"i would request that anyone who is planning an event like; interviews, debates or something like dierdra vaal's voter match service to contact the csm's through an eve-mail in game.as a csm candidate we can not know of everyone out there that is doing something to educate the voters without you telling us about it. i mentioned dierdra vaal's voter matcher service by name for a reason. at the same time she posted here in jita park she sent me, and i assume all the rest of the csms, an eve-mail telling us of what she was doing.if you want the broadest level of csm participation then you need to make sure they are all notified of your event. since every csm is a pilot in game an eve-mail should reach all of them equally. thank you."

"sent you an eve mail in game zarch.looking forward to the interview if we can hitch up.cheers,"
"the fact is: a t2 af cost is around 40 millions and it can be beated by a 15-20 millions t1 cruiser... and if we put on plate that to fly an assault you need more skills that a t1 cruiser and that the assault should be a \"full combat\" ships that's really nosense. ccp if 75% on afterburner is too much do something else but just do something for a ship class which also veteran players had to fly with honour. by the way i think the 75% in speed was a great idea because an assault had to entering in battle without considering bs bc classes, flying around seeking for other af or inty be carefull to interdictors, destroyers, maybe cruisers and webbers. now the af is the primary target in a fleet because is the easiest ship to take down, even bs lock and fire at you! and when you said ( ccp ) using the speed as a way to fight you also said you are not considering frigates as a positive appoach to a fight from the moment you said that(also giving to all minmatars ships the advantage to choose the range where to fight but that's not real a great problem). giving a speed boost to af or frigate in general is not just a favor you do to us but it will create a better combat! where ships classes will sit perfectly in their role."
"supported"
"yes. if they keep the draw back of -%50 tracking and up the damage alot it would work well.ccp have a month to implement changes and test them before dominion is deployed. i know there is alot happening this expansion but this is a simple fix that can be heavily tested and deployed within this time frame.... come ccp... give us our blasters back!"
"/supportthink of the blasters in eve as a shotgun in counter strike or halo. you gotta move fast or blind side someone to really poon them. aside the kdr being negative, it sure is funny!in eve, i do not feel this way with the blasters' properties. its either tank or gank of course, you cant do both i know this but there could be an upper with tracking (better hits).i dont know how to fix it, but im sure y'all can figure something out.my 2cents"
"worked for amarr"
"blasters do really need some fixing.- a tiny bit more damage- a lot better tracking- make gallente blaster ships the most agile (will be relativated by plates/trimarks anyway)makes for nicely working blaster-boats. in their current state, i just stopped flying them."
"yes yes yes.exactly what blasters need. don't nerf lasers... they work very well (aprt from scorch ammo, i mean wtf??)blasters need much much better tracking.blasters need a slight boost to damage so that they are the heavy damage weaponblaster boats shouldn't have very high agility, just slightly better base speed to close range. seems as blaster boats usually are plated which slows them right down and just not fast enough to be nano'd (even though being very fast in a blaster boat makes you useless)c'mon ccp... get this fixed for dominion. pleeeeeaaaase!!!"
"lets do one better. how about an auto repair attribute added. i has a limited volume and bandwidth. no drones are moved to the bay, but they take up points in this attribute just as bandwidth is consumed when launching fighters/drones. this would help limit the number of fighters and drones max that could be repaired without opening a new bay that could cause abuse. the poor carrier pilots already juggle 3 bays, lets not put a 4th one in there for them to watch over (where did my 15th fighter go? ah damn, it was still in repair when i docked). otherwise, i agree to the idea, especially for super carriers."
"i agree that destroyers need some love. they are no longer the frig-killers they should be. i like the idea of moving a high to a mid/low and change to the -25% rof to -10% rof or complete removal."
"i began reading this a bit wary, but am convinced that this would be a nice tweak. this would be a good use of those wrecks left from standing speed runs."
"the key point in this is that it increases the chances of finding empty missions, which is something the mission runners shouldn't complain about."
"i like this idea, but i have question, would this scan probe be a specialist probe? with the possibility of having a specialist launcher?more carebear tears though"
"supported - if they also fix flagging mechanics so i can actually shoot down ninja salvagers. it's \"risk vs reward\", not \"scan probes + t1 frigates vs reward\". thank you."
"i don't have issues with scanning wrecks that exist in space after a mission has been completed and the deadspace removed. in that situation, the missioner has abandoned the wrecks and anybody who can scan/locate the wrecks should be able to do with them as he/she pleases.where i have problems with scanning down wrecks is when the missioner is actively working a mission. already it's far too common to be in the middle of a mission, killing rats, tractoring wrecks and attempting to salvage all at the same time when some git shows up and starts salvaging.if deadspace prevented wrecks from being scannable i could support your proposal."
"to fix something would have to be broke, the flagging mechanices are not broken, salvage does not belong to you and salvaging a wreck is therefore not stealing, ccp has designed the game that way and has stated it many times. if you don't like it i suggest you start another thread proposing that salvage has ownership rights, not derail this one. plus you mention \"risk vs reward\" but what exactly is the risk for the carebear highsec mission grinder these days? very little is the answer.and stop saying ninja salvager, they have absolutly no relation to ninjas!!"
"no reason why it cannot be done."
"in light of ccps current stance toward salvaging changing flaggin mechanics, is only trying to cure \"symptons\" of something that according to ccp is working as intended: the salvage is not yours.in addition to that the current different proposal regarding salvaging and ownership rights always just and solely focus/surround the issue from the \"it's mine\" and \"it's not\" point of stance, to which ccp already took a decision, which is: it is not. so rather than just opting/looking for new possibilities and changes, ppl have so far just \"argue(d) about something that already has been decided\" ( malcom reynolds - jaynestown - firefly). the changes i suggest are pointing toward a different direction, namely making those wrecks that are really left behind - and imho there are more than enough of them in space, not only in mission spots like motsu - and available to the salvager profession, thus giving the salvager profession more options to find his salvage - and maybe even easier.by making wrecks in \"none deadspace\" easier to scan as suggested, from a salvager isk/hour point of view, there is no reason to further scan down a signal with just e.g. 40%, when you already have a lock on a field of wrecks where you can warp to immediately and start salvaging right away.the expanded probe launcher needs a higher skill level as well, so the \"starting salvager\" could start his profession even at a lower skill level."
"supported.i would like to scan down unscannable t3 cruisers doing escalations in lo sec."
"if implemented in the way the original post suggests this would be a major step towards fixing the ninja salvage problem."
"i'm not a salvager, and i never will be. but i support the idea of scanning wrecks as this would imo make salvager a real mini profession, and not a fake leech off of other profession.the only problem i can see with this is that it would make mission running in lowsec more dangerous, wich isn't a good thing. lowsec is almost completely devoid of any pve activity, and this would just hammer the nail in the coffin.despite that, i'm still in favor of this, as imo as soon as this is implemented, a fix can be found. also, i believe lowec could do with an overhaul, and this could be added in to the mix when that is done (unless they decide to kill off lowsec that is)."
"i'm fully aware of what's been stated. and it makes perfect sense, too. i mean, why would salvaging a wreck flag you to the corporation that shot it down, when removing something from the same wreck does, right?the \"ownership\" issue has already been decided. there's precisely two reasons why ccp is shying away from making salvaging a hostile act.1. mission running in high-sec has a considerably high isk/hour value for relatively low risk.2. it would involve additional coding.yes, mission-running is relatively safe. i'm not asking for it to be made safer. but here we are, and people are asking for easier access to wrecks which they can salvage with 0 risk involved, so they can create extensive revenue from the use of t1 frigates. and every time you mention flags (a.k.a. risk) they go up in arms. because it's unjustified? or perhaps because then they would actually have to pay attention and have risk involved with making their isk?this is a ridiculous discussion, and that's the end of it. oh, and before i forget it: \"ninja salvager\"."
"i think wrecks should be scannable, but not while the deadspace is active (or atleast make it very difficult). this opens up salvaging more as a profession, without the need to ninja salvage - although that activity is not removed.but i also think the deadspace should dissipate between 30-60 mins after the mission objective is completed, rather than waiting until it is handed in."
"very good idea."
"login name is public?but that's half your password!!!wtf? why? hide it. save the brute force password attacks."

"mouse click macros on icons that are on a fixed position on the screen are pretty easy to do already. that's why i'm talking about adding shortcuts to those buttons that are already available as quick actions in the overview.and the solution against macros is clearly not to build a bad ui, since some already use them anyway.by the way, i found a post similar to mine, and actually richer, here."

"for a long time now, mwd's have not been usable in most deadspaces. this was implemented as a pve nerf, and in this regard it has been successful. unfortunately, it has also hampered pvp efforts in deadspaces, as an opportunity to refit an ab upon finding a player in a deadspace is not always present.i propose that mwd's simply behave more like ab's in deadspace, rather than transforming into the equivalent of an empty slot. primarily this would involve reducing the speed bonus for mwd's inside deadspaces to the same seen from an ab, and perhaps eliminating the sig. radius penalty. the mwd would still not be optimal for deadspace (with it's higher fitting and cap penalties), but at least it would still provide a bonus."
"i am sorry but mwds already work in most plexes. ever tried it lately? even some missions support them now."
"i was aware of that. i suppose an alternate solution would be to make them work in all deadspaces. in my experience they do not work in missions with acceleration gates (sometimes not even at the first accel. gate). they also do not work in many lvl 5 missions that do not even have accel. gates.basically, there is no excuse for the module to become absolutely useless inside any deadspace."

"this change would primarily impact available resources in two different areas, to drastically different degrees.it is true that this could be implemented in a way that adds very little extra work for the server. while true custom paint jobs would add significant resource usage, as proposed previously this could be avoided by restricting the levels of customization. this change could easily be implemented with little impact on the usage of server resources or our own bandwidth usage.the problem, however, is the effect that this would have on local resource usage. your computer has to load models/skins for every object in your area, which it then uses to render the image that you see on your screen. you don't have to be a computer scientist to understand that if there are more unique models/skins that have to be loaded, more resources will be used for such. and thus we are presented with an unavoidable trade-off: the maximum quality of rendering is decreased by greater diversity of objects to be rendered. the more unique models/skins you have, the lower the end graphical quality of each rendered object will be (eve is lucky in this regard, as it is able to skip trees, grass, etc.).so it is not a matter of whether or not this can be done, but whether it should be done. at some point we have to find a balance between unique ship models/skins and their graphical quality. it is for this reason that i do not support this proposal - i feel that we should devote our available resources to a game with as many unique ships as possible, rather than the same ships with different paint jobs. whatever balance we decide on, any resources used to make otherwise identical ships simply look different takes away from what could have been more unique ship types. with the introduction of strategic cruisers, ccp seems to agree with me a big thumbs down"
"the choice of where and for whom you do your missions greatly influences the possible gains - and it should stay that way. if you allowed them to be traded over you would see people massively grinding lp's in safety in empire then running to a 0.0 lp store to cash in on the rarer items they sell there.in short, it would totally kill lowsec/0.0 missioning.not supported."

"so you've gotten the best fit on your ship and have 10% cpu or pg to spare + more for another slot?"
"i like the idea, but:the drawback need to be extremely high (30%+), slot layout is one of the major balancing points when ships are created/tweaked so should not be added/removed willy-nilly.ex: i train the rig skill to 5 and can very easily create a five midslot armageddon or an eight highslot dominix suffering just -10% cpu/grid.because you would need to make the drawback so debilitating to prevent massive imbalances across all hulls there is little point to it to begin with.it would also make navy ships kind of obsolete since a good deal of their power comes from the extra slot(s) they get."

"mr sokratesz, where do you stand on the alliance disbanding factor?will u be pushing for there to be a vote or a 24h grace period to disband alliance?"
"i was under the impression that ccp had already fixed this but the recent cva trouble proved otherwise. i'm kind of torn between the following two arguments:pro) spies need a place in eve and alliances need to secure themselves against it - it's part of human nature and diplomatics and has made eve famous in the past, so it should not be removed.con) it's a shame that years of work can end like that.i would be against an alliance disband requiring a majority vote because that would make it 100% foolproof, but something like a grace period of 12 or 24 hours (not too long though!) in which a majority vote can overrule an initiated disband by one of the executors would seem a solution. that means executors have to pay attention and if spies succeed in a thorough infiltration or elusion it would still be possible."
"an original & interesting workaround that does at least appease both sides of the argument.you do appear to be the pvpers politician for this campaign. moving on, where do you stand on present factional warfare mechanics, the ability for say alliances to war dec individual corps in a militia without fear of retribution from associated militia corps? for example the star fraction factor, although i am sure there are other alliances who practise the same methods."
"well you have to admit that in the end, pvp is what makes eve tick, without it the producers would be out of a job and missionrunners out of a market for their lp and named loots. if you have suggestions for the industrial side (carebear sounds so derogatory) please let them hear, because i have little to do with that side of the game in day-to-day eve myself, but improvements to it are needed as much as to anything else in the game. i do not intend to ignore the large amount of players that enjoy eve like that, but my experience there is limited so i may need a little more help i read a bit about that and indeed it sounds wrong but i don't think ccp anticipated on it. in this particular case i would be for treating the militia as an alliance only to the degree that the militia members can initiate combat with the wardeccing entity without concord intervention, but not the other way around, ergo the wardeccing entity can only shoot the specific corp they decced unless one fo the other militia members intervenes by agression or rr, then they are free to shoot back at them too. this way deccing a corp in a militia becomes a more risky enterprise but with a potential for a lot of targets."
"another interesting response, a very lateral way of thinking on the matter that again appeases both sides of the issue without necessarily unbalancing the mechanic to stop larger player alliances becoming too heavily involved."
"out of the current csm crop, very few candidates caught my eye, and you were one of them (about 4, actually, so, yeah, you made my short list, hehe).i happen to remember you pretty vividly even from your earlier days, and we never got into each-other's hair too much on anything that really matter, so that, in my book, means you're either thinking mostly the same way i am, or you're reasonable enough to understand something when told.so far so good, until now you only raked up plus points now however, we come to the tricky part.you're mostly a pvp-oriented player, and your personal interests reflect that, as admitted by you personally and also highlighted by the items you chose to address in the interview, and most of the items on your pdf list.when presented with a limited number of issues, you will have to pick a few to dedicate yourself to... so i'm asking myself - would you bother pushing things that ccp hasn't touched in ages in spite of people posting endlessly about it ? or, would you bother picking things that are heavily economy-oriented, as opposed to combat-oriented ?for instance, there's an upcoming change in dominion that will affect everybody (even if most don't even realize it yet), and from where i'm standing ccp looks like it's about to make a huge mistake (and it could take a while after patch before it's noticed, let alone corrected). what would you do if elected to make fixing it (if it will actually be needed, of course) a top priority ? i mean, even if it's not yet insanely obvious, but it could become nasty in the future ?...you know, things like that"

"lately i have been thinking about how adjustments to a game can change the game.i came to the conclusion that all game balance proposals (as opposed to interface changes--like larger font) is how they create incentives for players.for example ccp wants more people in 0.0, but instead of just saying to players \"go to 0.0\" they are trying to give the current residents a reason to welcome the \"new masses.\"or in a conversation i had yesterday a friend who participates in faction warfare said there were a lot of things he felt were wrong with fw. specifically:a. plexing for system control.b. incentives for controlling a system because right now there isn't one.what he said rocked me back on my heels. what should the reward be? how what should it be rewarded for? (capturing or holding?)the first things to acknowledge is that there is no \"fairness\" policy in fw. the sides aren't externally balanced (i.e. only x players from each faction are allowed to participate in a given incident). for example, all of the caldari-gallente \"contested\" systems are held by the state if for no other reason than caldari has more pilots.so a reward akin to r&d agents is inappropriate (i.e. each day your faction holds a system you get points of some sort). and whatever the bonus is, it shouldn't make it harder for opposition to reclaim a system (i.e. no \"home field advantage\").my next thought was a slight increase in rewards for killing other faction player ships. but again that seems to unfairly favor larger population factions.then i thought maybe a discount on repair charges for ships if the repairs are done in a contested system your side holds. it is small enough to not be unfair, but it rewards system ownership. but is it so small to not be worth fighting for?another thought is special science and industry facilities in contested systems. maybe ones that charge militia lp as part of their cost.this is an example of what i can offer csm. goal based thinking with incentive based solutions."

"i know i am going to get worked over for this but... lolthere's a tiny bit of a point in this guy's issue. don't get me wrong, suicide ganking is a realistic facet of the game from the perspective of reality in eve. but... i don't think suicide ganking should be banned. but i do think it needs to be tuned to make it riskier for the ganker in some high sec levels. like, you might get that 2bil isk score but it's going to cost you more than a crappy t1 fit stabber and a security hit that you can get back with running a few missions.i think the valid portion of the carebare complaint here could be addressed by tuning suicide ganking in, lets say, .8 and higher systems. for example, you gank a ship in one of these systems and you take a sec hit that bans you from those systems in that faction space until you can recover standings. that doesn't stop you from ganking that fenrir loaded with 2bil isk in jita. but you can't make ganking freighters in jita a profession. what you could do though is camp the .7 sides of .8 gates... sounds fair to me...look at it just from a balance perspective. a couple of pilots in crap ships can make billions in a few minutes by ganking. what is the non-combat analog to balance that out? i challenge anyone to even come close. and under current mechanics, they can do that a couple times a week by alternately running missions to keep standing up.yarbears complain that carebears want things to be easier for them, mining in particular. but when you look at how much even a high skilled empire crew can make mining vs what they could make ganking one well loaded freighter... now who has it easy? i say the scavengers and gankers have a waaaay easier time in high sec than the miners. and people who disagree usually don't have any better counter argument than \"that's eve\". and maybe that's it. maybe eve isn't supposed to make logical sense in some areas. maybe the uber religious amarr empire doesn't have a problem with organized groups of minmatar pirates ringing stations in amarr prime and baiting or ganking amarr citizens. doesn't make a lot of sense but maybe. maybe that's the question that needs to be answered. is jita, for example, a crocodile infested watering hole in the kalahari or is it the commercial hub of an advanced civilization? if the latter, then there shouldn't be so many crocodiles and lions. ccp has made it a point to promote people moving to 0.0. psuedo faction alliances and real pvpers already operate there primarily. carebears don't. carebears that go there either don't stay long or learn to deal. the inverse is \"pvpers\" that live in high sec. i use quotes because it's hard to call someone that ganks indys and noobs cruiser mining a pvper. 0.0 is self correcting. high sec isn't currently. low sec is supposed to be a buffer between 0.0 and high sec. but there really isn't much difference between 0.0 and low sec as far actual expectation of security goes. nor is there much difference between .5 and 1.0. that is what needs to be tuned. not for the carebears but for the sake of realism and balance. you want to pirate high sec? fine. but if you want to do it in the highest sec core and home systems, it's going to cost you more than a ship and a minor sec hit. maybe it's a massive sec hit, a fine, or maybe concord pods you. maybe some combination of all of them.can flipping, leave it as is. if you are jetcan mining, you will get flipped. but at least when that happens, you have the option to shoot.ninja salvaging, needs to be fixed. i think the same mechanics that currently apply to jet cans should apply to salvage. mutual shootage.let the carebears thrive in some portion of high sec and the benefits of that will trickle down and out. it's impossible for that to be contained. it would absolutely bleed out to places where it could be exploited to probably even greater effect than now.let the flaming begin!"
"as candidate i'd favor giving all players so much to do, that \"end game players\" (if there were such a thing) but be far too busy to waste time on starting players. i'd be completely against restricting freedoms - but i would be for creating a realistic universe where no player would want to gank. i disfavor restricting freedom. i favor increasing choice and opportunity."
"can you give some examples of what you would give people to do? that's an easy statement to make but a lot harder to backup with something tangible.it's my opinion that there is plenty to do but that certain factors that currently exist in the game breed a class of \"path of least resistance\" players. people who look for the quickest money option to exploit. even if it means not really following the spirit of the game. no matter what options are presented there will always be people who find it easier to take advantage of the loopholes and weaknesses in design.eve is the wild west for sure, but there are still places where law and order would logically be upheld. someone compared it to firefly. i think that's true. but even in firefly you had the core planets. the reavers weren't just floating around every planet waiting for ships to launch. right now, as i see it, the storyline and the mechanics are in conflict. either there are powerful governments that rule over the empire regions or there aren't. if there are, then they wouldn't likely allow people to randomly blow each other up in high powered war vessels outside their stations. for any reason! you blow up a 300 meter long ship a couple of kilometers from a space station and you have crap flying everywhere. even if it's not a danger to the station to have a chunk of hurricane the size of a house hit it, there's still the hazard to navigation from the debris floating everywhere. dominion should go a long way toward making the \"stuff to do\", that currently exists, more accessible. which is certainly a step in the right direction. and it would also open the door to changes in empire that weren't practical before. the changes that i propose only work within dominion. otherwise it would potentially alienate an entire class of player in favor of another by pushing them out of a sizable portion of empire without many options to make up for it.and maybe you are right. maybe after dominion there will be options both easy enough and profitable enough for the ganker types to take advantage of outside of empire. my platform is first and foremost about game balance within the empire food chain. there will always be new issues in that regard. so the specific issues aren't as important as the overall concept. i have taken major hits in eve as a direct result of things we are talking about and i am still playing. i've seen the game evolve since 03. the one constant is that people will complain. no matter what you do. and since it's a pay to play game, ccp has to listen to the largest group complaining. but pretty often people will argue against a change that would benefit them, just because they aren't in a position to visualize the effects or because they fear change.then again some people deciding on change are blind to the cliff they are running toward. time will tell. right now if feels like the game has stagnated into endless 0.0 territory swaps and ubiquitous high sec hub scam and gank routines. seem that ccp has recognized that and is actively addressing the factors that caused it. i feel like i have something to contribute to that process.whatever the case, this is hands down the best mmo i have played. flaws and all."

"what does this even mean? is this like how some games allow people to pay for bonus experience multipliers? if it is, i think \"sp in a can\" is going to flat out rejected.sp i a can? whatever that is - hell no. i am suggesting that the current game is quite onesided in its scope, and i conclude it might have some trouble competing with other franchises. of course established players won't give a flying hoot about that - it may be that some in the current established player base want the game to not grow, contrary to ccp's business interests. i strongly suggest those players to not vote for me. i want this game ten times as big five years from now, in real numbers. so as for power-play, a somewhat diffuse subject - i'd summarize it as adding some \"strategy game\" or \"trade game\" or \"maffia game\" or \"sim city\" aspects to the franchise. this is possible, and it would attract more potential gamers to the eve franchise, without forcing existing players to don't do anything they don't want. but if such a thing were implemented it would have bloody implications to the franchise - old timers would for instance be royally ****ed off if their docking times doubled because of some kind of annoying \"labor dispute\" bull****.please visit your user settings to re-enable images.i am aware that designing and programming and integrating and finally balancing such an addition is a conceptual nightmare for ccp games. however if it somehow dawns on these people that if they can tie this in with robust ambulation and complex gameplay on stations (including talking with npc's and missions) then, hell yah, they might start seeing some serious increase in subscriber numbers. ?currently the game involves flying a spaceship, trading, fitting ships. in traditional game design terms, that is a 3d game half point & click strategy game (it isn't a shooter) and fleet game. the trading part is a very simple trade game. the fitting is a puzzle game, sort of. there aren't very few other \"gameplay\" elements in the game, unless you count mining, and well, if that's the case, i'd call that a bit limited in dimension and depth. now you think of a few boardgames you really like, and try and visualise - how could you shoehorn that into eve? let's take monopoly... that would fit in the above example of power-play almost instantaneously - players investing in real estate on established stations. some investments would be purely about making money by cornering markets. that would in turn be based on selling a product - so what if other parts of the game would involve cutting off supply lines of such products? an investor would be left paying for factory upkeep without being able to produce any deliciously creamy quafe for the local markets. google \"dust 514\"i am aware of dust514 and have been quite some time since before it left stealth. as you may have noticed, dust514 covers planets right now, and it involves characters. i'd love seeing that expanded to a large range of robots, mechs, cyborgs, replicants, androids, droids, veccs, biodroids, drones, microform swarms. i'd love seeing players explore space-structures in zero g conditions. i'd love seeing players develop skills in not merely open doors such as \"laser carbine\" - but how about stuff such as \"laser reflective armor specialisation\" or \"cover maximization\" or \"small team tactical movement increase\" ? pardon me, but this realm of expansion equates several ten million skill points. and, more poignantly, it might also equate an appreciably bigger player base growth."
"?i'll be brief on this topic by inviting you to have a look (or a wiki) at the designs of liftport group and gerald k o'neill. in short, an sf game in space has vast potential for introduction of concepts and both habitats, skyhooks and massive solar arrays do not conflict the current genre and would enrich it - regard it like this ;players can construct a massive several mile big (smallest) to tens of miles huge cylinder and spin it like a centrifuge. inside it would (potentialy) be verdant and lush surface area, and if you read geralds book, quite pleasant a place to live too. now regard this habitat as an investment opportunity, one that costs a load of money and yields a steady income. say, a corporation constructs one and it benefits them mightily. now they'd also have to defend it. a skyhook is a cable from a planetary surface to geo. this concept flies in the face of what many people believe possible or plausible, yet the (rw) liftport group claims they can build one on this earth, maybe before 2030. if they are right they would decrease launch costs for sending stuff to space to tens of thousands per pound to hundreds per pound. if they can pull that off, they would kickstart an industrial explosion with growth rates in the double digits for centuries. this idea, if you look at it critically, is so compelling it would be hard to believe the major planets aren't bristling with dozens of skyhooks. sure, i can think of a few explations why not, but i can also come up with a bunch of descriptions that would make the game a good deal more interesting why they would.?a lot of these sound like \"would be cool\" options, but perhaps don't add to the game.yah well, i heard that a few times. to some players a game is something with a start, a smooth attention curve, a culmination and an end. a game is something conceptually confines and constrained. if you adhere to that game philosophy a game is something that is limited and yes, i would probably have the desire to see (in eve or anywhere else) something that is no longer a game. call it \"everything game worlds\" where you have vastly more options than any single player can ever hope to explore. in my ideal mmorpg i'd love seeing a gameplay experience where each individual player would have (like in real life) have to really choose what to do, because in the game there'd be more things to do than he has days in his lifetime. i have written a small \"kinder, gentler\" pdf on this topic, with a few brief speculations on various possible avenues, and why they would be of use to ccp games - by and large i would like seeing \"something like this\" emerge, and since i am really smitten by the rather ingenuous design architecture of eve i'd really really love seeing ccp implement it here, and as soon as possible. if they don't, some other gaming company will eventually tackle this challenge, and my ideal situation would be it were not someone like lucas arts. the reason i say this is because i am not all that happy about the american-centric design style and intellectual cowardice of some companies - and i really believe that in fifteen years the market for mmorpgs can be well in the hundred millions range. i'd really really love seeing a gifted company like ccp have over ten million in a decade. pdf"

"yes please! eve is the only thing on my computer that constantly makes me lean in for a closer look."
"lissen to us! we are your players!"
"uh no way.lasers take a **** bag of cap to fire. most amarr ships aren't even cap stable only firing their guns. the hybrid capacitor usage is just too small for it to be able to focus energy that far (or in this case launch something). increasing their damage or range will make the already-overpowered gallente battleships even more overpowered."
"i agree blasters need a boost, either more range or more punch. medium blasters need more range for sure."
"you're all forgetting that blaster gunships usually have a superior drone bay. for example the zealot's 0 drone bay, the sacrilege's 15(15 band) drone bay vs the ishtar's 125+250(125band) and the deimos' 50.if gallente weapons were just as versatile as lasers what would the amarr have?"
"and the ishtar has more or less 0 guns and the deimos is just pure broken whether used with blaster or railguns?"
"agreed. im tired of seeing pvp noobs flyin around in caldari ships with fof missiles and do afk pvp cause my deimos can't lay down damage from even abit of range. (especially with t2 blaster ammo).supported"
"in general throw a role bonus(37.5% web strength increase, what makes 60% webs 75% webs) on dedicated blaster ships(thorax, diemos, brutix, astarte, mega, hype) and balance from there(what only leaves minor things). you will end up with good solo ships, deadly close range pvp machines and make them own at short range again instead of being only handy caped with range. simply the same thing you had pre qr."
"let's see: void -25% range, -50% tracking speed, -50% falloff, +25% cap and iirc also slows the boats overall speed when loaded.great formula for disaster when flying a blaster boat."
"hey csm members.where do you all stand on this one?curious as to wether or not this will make it to your recommendations section.any info is appreciated"
"i think these should have the hp boosted by about 200%. they are just 2 paper thin, sig radius too big and too slow to be any good at anything. 2 destroyers should be able to take out atleast a cruiser. possibly a t2 frigate of some description. at this point they could be removed from the game and i dont think anyone would miss them."
"bump for great justice"
"qfteven if the ev and er on rockets is fixed they'll still be pretty fail.i'd be happy to leave them as they are now but double the damage as this makes for a far more interesting weapon that would do high damage but only in the right situation.simply changing them to a weapon what does low damage but will inflict it every hit does not make interesting gameplay or promote teamwork."
"something along these lines would make for a useful security measure. i would even suggest going so far as some sort of verification requirement to unlock characters (i.e. security questions, etc.)."
"i think this proposal would only help \"abandoned\" lvl 4 mission wrecks.seems like when i plan to salvage a lvl 4 mission a \"salvager\" often comes in and starts on the wrecks when i'm in the middle of the mission. i don't always plan to salvage missions, even lvl 4's, when i'm grinding reputation or lp. recently, when i was on my reputation grind in lvl 2 & 3's i rarely seen one. when i did they'd quickly warp off without salvaging. returning a type of deadspace cover for active missions is interesting. ccp would have to make everything harder to scan in deadspace or they'd just scan down the drones/ships."
"first, \"heh\". thanks for bringing back one of my topic threads from before. :)second, yes, wrecks should only be scan-able by combat probes, be generally kinda hard, and only possible outside of a deadspace.it would, in fact, make it possible to probe-out t3 ships in lowsec... whatever. that's what cloaks and observant players are for. plus, sifting through a system's wrecks to find one, active, player is not good odds. if you want to do that, more power to you.this idea, overall, is and always has been designed to give the \"ninja salvager\" a target other than players in active missions. if someone chose to continue to invade missions to salvage, for the tears, then that's their choice, but economically they have other places they can be--unlike now.--krum(ps. ninja salvagers go after bs wrecks, and if they see you're running a l2 or l3, will just skip it for another person's mission. it's their efficiency calculation.)"
"i agree with op."
"it make too easy scanning people in missions (even if the deadspace effect was restored), doing encounter/exploration sites and so on, beside the small problem required by adding sensor strength to all wrecks and at the same time it will create a quantity of signals that will mask ship without wrecks nearby. if they have 0 sensor strength any probe will get a 100% hit at first try: size/0 sensor strength = infinite signature."
"actually i was thinking more of using core probes (allowing this at one skill level earlier and thus with the core probe launcher already), to keep combat probes for \"intact\" ships only.i do also think that the skill requirements for the different probes are kinda mixed up.the core probes should be useable at astrometics (just like now) lvl i, the deep probes at iii (which is now at v) and the combat at 5 ( now at i).and i would move the expanded probe launcher skill requirement from astrometics ii to iii as well.this would distinguish the dedicated salvager - being able to scan directly for wrecks - from those that are looking for ships."
"you can't divide by zero, and in the case of eve will most likely cause a server crash or may result in a not-a-number value. so anything with a signal strength of zero would have to be handled differently from the normal algorithm."
"good stuff! badly needed."
"this. just this."
"fix this plz"
"i hope this issue gets looked into. also, i hope that federation faction gets boost to be in line with amarr."
"amarr navy reactor controlsgallante navy railguns (less dps than the t2 version if spec. = lvl4 or more) the caldari ones have more range, so they're ok i guessrepublic fleet shield boosters (same as t2, but less per boost and shorter cycle)"
"you forget that the domination/rf items use less cap are much easier to fit. which perfectly fits with the ships."

"sounds good, but would the ability to simply \"rightclick -> open market for item\" do almost as well without needed a substantial amount of additional coding?ashina for csm"
"beautiful!"
"daily flog for one of the best/most ignored ideas here."
"i think the biggest problem with eve's ui is the fact that its just got too many buttons. if you reduce the buttons and make the ui slimmer and more streamlined it will only add to the enjoyment of the game.the second factor id like to throw into the mix is one of accessibility. you all know it as that annoying thing that happens when you hit shift 5 times really fast. well, by introducing more keyboard shortcuts you will make eve an easier game to play for people with disabilities. eve isn't the most fast paced game in the world and i would imagine it would draw a lot of people with a mild to major physical disability in. i think if u can do it in a right click menu you should be able to bind a key to it."
"the amount of resources used should be directly proportional to the amount of objects around you (data). so yes, fleet battles will take more resources to record than say a small skirmish. depending on eve's underlying data structure, even objects such as asteroids could add to the recording load.proposed solutions:- a \"use active overview settings\" filter on which data is recorded- fights involving more than a given number of total ships (fleet battles) could be recorded server sidethe cutoff for which \"fleet battles\" are recorded server side should be related to the potential point at which it becomes impractical for a player's personal computer to record the battle adequately. maybe these fights could be linked in the news feeds?"
"yeah, had a corpmate leave us about 100 mil of stuff by accident when he canned the character. unfortunately, it was in jita 4/4, and we had to let it go. would be nice to see this get changed."

"i sympathize with you. pirates just have it too tough, and it's not like they had a choice to enter into their career. pirates should have carebears lining up to be canflipped, podded, or otherwise.[/sarcasm]they call it deadspace for a reason. you can't warp to other locations in the same deadspace or around it, so why would a mwd work there? yes, pirates have special items to allow them to use mwds, but they cheat anyways, so it doesn't matter.if the tractor beam is going too fast for you to retrieve the loot, use a smaller faster ship. if you're trying to kite, learn to do that on an ab. if you have the wrong equipment, switch and come back. in either case, live with the way the game works.not supported."
"how exactly would allowing a mwd to yield the same effective bonuses as an ab be any different than just using an ab? it would probably still be worse, assuming any penalties are retained (higher cap usage, higher fitting requirements, etc.)i do live with the way the game works... but it's dumb. i thought that is what this forum was for: to point out changes that can/should be made?the negative effects that i have listed were never the intention of limiting mwd usage in deadspaces. this was implemented to make missions more difficult (at least at that time, mwd's made many missions too easy). the effects this has had on pvp in deadspaces is an entirely unintended side effect of this.this is not a request to \"buff pirating\", etc. it is a request to remove tedium."

"i almost never lag in eve i don't know what you f*gots are crying about. get off the pentium 3s and join our century. and if you refuse to do that a simple toggle button will solve everything."
"a toggle button would obviously make this more practical, although i suspect anyone who has sound turned off would also have this turned off.again, any resources used to make otherwise identical ships simply look different takes away from what could have been more total unique ship types. do you really want custom paint jobs more than additional t3 ships/subsystems?"
"i do understand your point, but i really would rather have more personal already existing ships than new and incredibly expensive ships."
"i do not feel that adding color variants to existing ships would delay, or in anyway effect development of t3 ships. it's not the same as creating new ships, you're simply changing the shade of the existing texture. this is almost no work for either server or client.the only proposal which has a lag stamp is the addition of corp insignias and designs on ships. color variants would not add any lag, either client side or server side. the main problem with this particular issue is getting enough people to take it seriously and get it implemented. there are no actual technical problems. i'd guess ccp's programmers could implement everything and make it optional in one night."
"just add it two simple recolouring options:- the hull colour.- the colour of the lights."
"so....prophecy is broken and we would like to fix it.original post in s&m can be found herebasically what we are proposing is that the prophecy takes on 3 major changes - 1. missile hardpoints (maybe leave 1 turret)2. energy turret capacitor bonus changed to ham rof.3. extra cpu in order to fit the launchers and ballistic controls if desired."

"below is something i devised a very long time ago, however i honestly doubt ccp would ever entertain the thought of doing this.lien protocol v2.1.7items required to initiate a lien:plex - 2lien amountopen character slot on the lending account - 1a lien would work like a contract in eve however the interface would be through account management. two parties would agree on a lien amount and repayment time frame. this contract is accepted out of game under the account management screen. here the information can be verified and the person taking the lien will be required to enter his/her account password to confirm. once accepted the plex is locked to the lender's account for the course of the lien. should the requester default the plex will be consumed during the auto transfer. in this case the plex is consumed as the transfer fee. should the person pay all monies back as per the contract the plex will be returned to the lender. during the course of the contract one unused character slot will be unavailable to the lender.repayment of the lien would work in the same fashion as redeeming a 60d gtc today using the secure system. the player with the lien would simply click a \"pay lien\" button and the isk would be debited from his eve account. the contract would close and both players would received a in game mail as notification.this process helps ccp with consuming the overabundance of plex on the open market, gives players a more unique system for extending loans, and creates a new depth to the game previously unknown."
"i just had this idea for making exploration more interesting. i'm not sure if anything like this has been proposed already but if you know it has please link it.first of all the problem: wisky space is too safe. anybody that lives in an unknown system knows this. and it's because most of the people that are motivated to take you out can't actually find you. and most of the people that can find you (or should we say stumble upon you) are not motivated enough to engage in anything costly. so a corporation is probably safer in w-space than anywhere else in eve.now for the wish: we all want the exploration profession to get more depth. the probing system is awesome but after you do it for a couple of million times it's not that interesting. unless all that probing can actually amount to something.and finally the solution(i'll go from top to bottom so read till the end for details): give explorers a way to plot a course through w-space so that they can reach any given system. it should be an in game mechanic and it should involve player personal skill(similar to probing but not in the same way). it should also make use the experience you gather meaning that the more time you spend doing it the better you get. also if you stop doing it for a while you loose your edge and go back to where you started.now further details: there are two things that i propose implementing for achieving this: signature prediction and unknown space mapping. signature prediction means that you can analyze a signature in order to predict where it spawns next. you could maybe get not just the next spawn but a few of them each time with a decreasing level of accuracy. the mapping part could mean that you can create a map of the area you have visited. it should be a temporary map as the systems move out of place in time but it should help you find patterns that signatures could take.. that's considering that signatures jump in a certain way.. maybe between systems at a certain distance or something like that. mapping would also help you get somewhere. if you know what's the target system area lets say you should be able to find out if you're getting closer or further from it.a few random thoughts:- it might be too much for one person to handle something like finding a sure way to a system in reasonable time. by reasonable i mean a few days, maybe a week. so maybe cooperation between people each relaying information to the others in a certain area. so the more people you get spread out the bigger your map gets.- predicting whs wouldn't be completely accurate. for example if the wh dies early because of mass it won't go to where you expected it to go. so you could have something like a multiple possibility scenario where a chain of events might take you where you want but another might not. it could include having to collapse a wh on purpose at a certain time to get it where you need it.- cyno jumps might be possible if you have the thing mapped well enough. there could also be failed jumps where your fleet ends up in a near by system(if you don't get 100% lock or whatever and you still want to take the risk)so what is all of this good for ? well imagine corporations you can hire to give you a sure way from one null sec system to another.. like the enemy's back yard maybe. also wh wars where people would go after w-space \"colonists\" because they found out how rich they got... it opens up the thing to a whole range of possibilities. and ultimately it makes you feel like all that probing you did for a meager high sec exit isn't wasted.nekre.ps: i'm not suggesting any changes to the way whs are now... nor am i suggesting for it to be possible to map all the unknown systems. there should be just enough there for people to navigate through it(meaning go wherever they want not where the wind takes them)"
"increase it in recruitment chat ....i personally find recruitment one of the harder things to do ingame if you're a ceo.tying our hands with a 5 min cool down to reply to recruitment threads makes that job harder. now instead of being able to sort through the posts and reply to them in one session ... you're force to constantly go back and find where you left off (if you can) and continue ...the recruitment chat in-game really sucks and over the 5 years i've played the game find it is a poor way to get recruits."
"no, shield and armor tanks are supposed to be different. the current sets seem entirely reasonable to me."
"yeah, it's a real pain to dock up, switch ships, and have my orbit button set at the wrong range. there's a big difference between how the orbits on a blaster ship and a rail ship should look, and i don't always have time to type \"15000\" into the stupid little dialog box between undocking and combat."
"this, and also offices and impound and such."
"that's like saying rockets are fine, just fly a ship with more low slots so you can fit more bcs. or fly a ship with more high slots so you can fit more rockets.it demonstrates than any counterarguments based on some vague idea of diversity are ridiculous."
"not really, because rockets are inherently unbalanced at the moment. they do too little damage to be really useful (they're called roflkets for a reason). shield tanking (active since that's what you seem to be most concerned with), on the other hand is already balanced against the tanking types - and changing the ship you fly to better adapt to a particular type of tanking is a valid option."
"the whole point of this thread is to show that active shield tanks are imbalanced because of the lack of decent rigs. answering \"that's not true, shield tanking is balanced\" isn't really productive.as for sba, i'd fully support the introduction of ara (armor repair amplifier) if shield boost amount rigs are introduced."
"but you're failing to show that shield tanking is unbalanced. the lack of a rig doesn't make them unbalanced, it makes them different. those are not the same thing. all you've said is these rigs don't exist, make them, without offering any convincing arguments why they're needed except for the fact that they don't exist."
"i realize they are trying to make some progress with the epic mission story arcs, but that doesn't go far enough, and everyday missions could use some work as well.this thread is not for repeating the common spam of \"lolmissions\", \"missions give too many rewards\", or \"missions are boring\". this is for improving the mission system.problem:missions, while i enjoy them, could very easily be improved upon. today they are more or less static, with some possible random variations on certain missions.also, there's some discrepancy on things such as \"storyline missions\".solutions:a number of things can be done. below are some ideas:1) storyline missions are currently given out every 16 missions and are, in fact, not storylines (usually). they are one off missions for the purpose of giving good rewards and faction standings. - make storyline missions actual storylines. take the cosmos or epic arc approach. when you get a storyline mission, give it several missions, perhaps each of which giving slightly better rewards with the last one a faction standings boost. i'm not asking for better rewards for my missioning, but calling a short mission where i turn in some ore i bought a storyline not only doesn't make sense but is completely unimaginative.2) make missions make you choose. if you are flying for caldari navy, for example, yes, gallente should hate you. flying for the navy you should also be sent on a larger proportion of gallente kill missions (and minnie), because you are flying for the state's navy. larger proportion of gallente kill missions, though, shouldn't mean just gather more tags. this would throw off the tag market and be more wearisome for the missioners. some of these should just pay you similar to bounties, as in the navy pays you to do the work they ask you to do.2a) in the case of point 2, there should still be corps that you run with that don't have a higher concentration of gallente kill missions for those that want to try to maintain okay standings with all empires. these will probably have more concentration of non-pew pew agents, however, or not be for the major empires.3) more interesting stuff. 3a) choices in the mission should do interesting things. this would be especially helpful to make epic arcs more epic. driving a wedge is a good example. instead of being handed the mission to kill the gallente industrial and, if turned down, handed the same mission but kill the minnie industrial; instead you should get there and kill one of them. your choice while in the mission determines how the mission and subsequent missions turn out. ccp has already demonstrated they have the capability to do these sorts of in mission adjustments.3b) along with 3b there can be easter egg things. for example, i destroy a certain lab and the resulting explosion opens a spatial rift i can follow to a bonus room (or a branch in the mission storyline series). to make these even better, it could be random (destroying that lab won't always open the rift, or the lab won't even be there). any in-mission decisions to affect things would be very nice. perhaps i am handed missions where i am supposed to destroy some rats to retrieve a passenger. the rats randomly offer to pay me off to not destroy them. i could accept this ransom and fail the mission; i'd lose standings with my corp/agent possibly, but gain some standings with the rats. (this could be an interesting way to regain some pirate standings over time.) and/or the payoff would be nice (a faction rat module bpc or something). or i could accept the ransom, shoot the rat anyways. i'd complete the mission, get a pay off, but drastically lose standings with the rat and maybe be punished by the agent (by the next mission not being very good?)"
"3c) more mission variation.it seems that as i gain standings with my corp/agent i am getting a slight variation on some missions that make it slightly harder, or at least a little different, as far as proportion of ships in mission or whatnot.larger variety for each mission would shake things up a bit. instead of knowing the mission will either look like this or like that, i could have 5 or 10 variations. the triggers could change for the different variations, but at least keep them somewhat predictible (like a specially named ship, or whatnot)."
"i agree with this, and pushed for this kind of thing with my term in the csm. ccp has their hands full with mechanics that are in desperate need of a workover (lowsec, mining, bounties, corp ui, wardecs, and missions), and they seem to be focused on fixing those items (with scanning in apocrypha and sovereignty in dominion). while i like these changes, there are some that need more focus (wardecs especially).supported, but don't hold your breath."
"spicing things up a bit ay? i wouldn't call it a total ovehaul, but it's most certainly welcome. there is a thread in the features and ideas section, and that is actually a complete overhaul.i'm not sure a complete overhaul would be good, but spicing things up a bit would indeed make things a lot more interesting./supported"

"another task for the csm that still needs some work is communication with the players. meeting minutes, general information about the council, and other such information are already available, but very little of it is available in any obvious place that a player who doesnt already know about the csm would look. its great to have a category on evelopedia for csm topics, but that will only ever be visited by people who already know its there. in particular, jita park speakers corner needs a stickied thread to provide an archive of meeting minutes for players to see them without having to dig through dozens of pages of forum threads.ultimately though, as much as my campaign is about the concrete promises i have made above, and the additional ones i will make as this campaign progresses, i do not believe that it is my campaign platform that is my greatest strength as a candidate. what i will bring to the csm, more than a list of objectives, is a wide base of knowledge, a desire to make eve the best game it can be, and a reasonable outlook on how we should get there. i know that ccp cant eliminate fleet lag tomorrow, and that they wont eliminate local chat. theyre not going to channel all their effort into improving one minor part of the game, and as much as they respect the csm, were not going to change their corporate strategy  no, we didnt overturn the gtc price increases, and no, we wont get dust 514 as a pc game just because we want it to be. i wont clog the iceland agenda with time-wasting minutia or monopolize it with issues for one part of the game to the exclusion of all others, nor will i fill it with pie-in-the-sky ideas that will take ten years to happen if they happen at all. i understand how the csm process works, and i will work within that process to create the biggest real, lasting improvements that can realistically happen. i have no objection to asking for a lot, but i know how to take no for an answer and get on with business.i am asking for your support in this election because i believe that i can make eve a better game for all of us. i have what it takes to represent the players faithfully and well to ccp, and with your support, i intend to do exactly that. thank you."

"bioname: denis descheneauxage: 40character: z0d votecorp: rubycom matrixalliance: united corporation of modern eve csm affiliation: take carespecialization: market and industryfor the last 20 years i have worked in the it field in canada where i was born, germany, former yugoslavia, haiti and now live and work in the united kingdom.in eve, i have been running my own corporation and alliance for the past3 years, and i have been active in heavy industry and working the market. i have traveled all over new eden and engaged in a broad array of activities. while i operate mostly out of high-sec, i maintain good diplomatic relationships with other corporations and trade organisations.take caretake care has been a csm organisation originally founded by ankhesentapemkah in csm1, and has held a seat on the council ever since. its purpose is to give players a direct voice in the csm process. i do not run for csm to stroke my ego, or to serve my own ingame interests or that of my alliance. i am committed to represent the eve players to the best of my abilities, just like ankhesentapemkah and erik finnegan have done before me. this means you can participate, and your ideas and feedback is taken serious. contact a take care representative and learn how you can get involved!market and industryi consider myself a veteran in this department of the game, and we all know that the trading and industry have been waiting for improvements for a long time now. quantum rise was supposed to be the industry expansion, but as the csm and the players noticed, few actual improvements have made it into the game. the csm has managed to wring a concession out of ccp: from now on, each expansion will have a dedicated industry slot assigned to it. i intend to work closely with ccp to bring up industry and market related issues, and will do my best to make sure important industry issues do not get buried.the contracting system could use upgrades to include shares and build/invention jobs so it becomes possible for players to auction off their services. the courrier contracts are still limited to 120 m3, and despite the csm already bringing this up since the very beginning, ccp still has not improved the situation. being able to contract the transportation of a ship from point a to point b to people being able to fly it would also make a nice addition to the contract system.in regards to corporations and orders, i'd like to see a new role introduced which allows corp members to modify corporation orders, so a corporation can really become a trade syndicate. there should also be a market system to trade shares.on the research and manufacturing side, the interface is in a dire need of a rework to reduce repetive actions. a queue system for jobs should be added, with a 24 hour limit just like the skill queue, so there are no more jobs running out while you are asleep.mining should also receive some improvements. i am aware that not all players wish to pay constant attention to eve, and mining is a relaxing activity for some. i do believe however that mining should become more interesting for those that want to, which include features such as the often-mentioned planetary ring mining, hidden belts, multi-ore roids, and ore veins which need to be found before being harvested."
"registering my support for the player of z0d, which isn't to be taken as an endorsement of take care.all round good bloke with oodles of industry and market experience. will make an excellent csm member and will undoubtedly make his own reasonable decisions!!!"
"factional warfarefw has always been a focus point for take care, as we have several players dedicated to fw in our team. as a result, we have raised many fw-related issues to ccp, but unfortunately only few of them have been implemented in game thus far (such as lag fixes, unique lp rewards like the exciting new navy ships). fw still does not have the features that were promised during the empyrean age hype-up, and even ccp agrees that fw is currently in an unfinished state.i believe ccp should assign fw a higher priority, as it currently takes months for them to fix critical bugs and address balance issues, not to mention implement content that should have been present at launch. these issues need to be pushed further. and i will be your most attentive partner for fw in the csm.role playinggame mechanics support rp very little. it is remarkable, how a few entities go to great lengths even though the current game mechanics do not encourage players to do so. the lack of an immersive avatar representation (as would bring incarna), is one reason. another is the lack of personalized equipment. i see the necessity in eve to \"own\" something. no, we cannot feel attached to a ship, because every ship is like the other of the same type! it is perfectly equal to thousands on the market. personalized equipment needs to be something you need to care for, make it grow, in order to feel attached to it. i call it: the tamagotchi effect.personalized equipment can be introduced unrelated to incarna. ship crews is one such suggestion, which has been brought in last term by erik, and small anchorables is another one brought up by ankhesentapemkah. these feature might also allow to give standing more meaning, as crews might have to be recruited from planets in friendly faction space, and personal standing would be required to anchor their small structures. planetary interaction, similarly, could bring this sense of attachment to something unique, which you own, which you make evolve. and with property comes obligation, the benefit should lack single optimal choices, and force decisions on the players strategy.dynamic contentcurrently, pve content is completely static. missions are always the same, as are exploration sites and complexes. they are boring and predictable. meanwhile, other upcoming games boast about their dynamically generated content, which results in endless replayability and surprise. space should be an environment that always has something new and exciting to offer, and for this reason i believe ccp is taking the wrong approach when they went with epic mission arcs as their pristine pinnacle of pve. sleepers, while interesting and somewhat unpredicatable, aren't having the intended effect either, as players mostly just use a select few working fittings to farm the lower-end ones.while erik already raised the idea of dynamic missions there should be more pve content that is generated dynamically, or at least built from a random sequence of modules. npc factions should respond more to player influence, instead of just churning out a constant stream of bite-ready bounties. and the system should generate random events in the eve world, where players that happen to be in the area can participate in. so that you can actually run into something exiting when flying around, and solar systems are not all the same."
"wardec issuesthe wardec system has been brought up by the csm since its very beginning. ccp even called it a \"pay-to-grief\" mechanic during these meetings. unfortunately, it is not possible for a system to determine if a wardec is intended for griefing, or if it serves a legitimate purpose. any changes to the system should not penalize these legitimate uses. however, wardecs should not be indefinite by default, and should not be as unilateral as they currently are. unless the war is mutual, there should be win and loss conditions upon which the war ends. in addition, the wardec fees may require some rebalancing.views on 0.00.0 has always been seen as the end-game of eve, but there is some controversity around its accessibility for newer organisations, and the level of excitement it produces for current sov-holders. luckily, dominion will do away with the need to eliminate dozens of poses to claim sovereignty and hopefully make the system exciting and volatile again. i strongly believe that more people should actually live in 0.0 and make their income there, and that alliances should be strongly encouraged for having players using their space, be it their own players or neutrals. this would then provide targets for roaming gangs, and encourages alliances to actively patrol their space.i would like to ensure that the game mechanics encourage, and provide targets for, small gang warfare. i am against moon minerals being a huge income source for alliances, i would like to shift this to the taxation of players which are actively using the alliance's space. more players should be able to exploit the resources of a 0.0 system than is currently the case, and 0.0 income should be competetive with high-sec level 4 missions. dominion may be the first step in this direction, and i want to ensure that dominion does deliver and 0.0 becomes the end-game most players have hoped for for a long time now. ccp will ask for feedback from the csm after dominion's launch, and i will keep close communication with the players, especially high-sec inhabitants trying out 0.0 for their first time, to ensure that their interests are represented properly.low-secwhile the csm did make a little bit of progress by having battleship-sized rats introduced to low-sec belts, the risk-reward balance is still not sufficient to motivate ventures into low-sec. instead of increasing the boring pve rewards, we could reduce the risk. while less risk usually means less pvp, player-policing could bring more security (or at least the subjective impression of more security) while increasing pvp. i have observed many pilots enthusiastically pushing this thought, and we may assume that honour one kind of reward, that need not be weighed in isk. the mechanics are sometimes referred to as marshal force or concord mandate.that is not to say that isk-faucets from the environment need to remain as is. the minerals harvested there are often less profitable than high-sec thus mining is out of the question. it also lacks the complexes and exploration sites found in 0.0. on the other hand 0.0 space is often more secure. i believe low-sec should have some resources to fight over, preferably in a way which encourages emergent casual and small-scale pvp.low-sec needs to be an attractive twilight zone."
"player justicei strongly support systems that allow players to deal with crime and punishment. player policing i mentioned above. but also bounty-hunting should be a viable career, where it should be a solid system for players to bring justice to criminal individuals that wronged them. bounty payout should be linked to the value of the ship being destroyed, to prevent players cashing in their own bounties. in addition, kill rights should be tradable, so that players, who are relatively defenseless, can hire a pilot which can avenge them. there should be a market for killrights and bounties, so that players, who wish to pursue the bounty-hunting career, can do so without too much effort.insurance systemcurrently, the insurance system is static and npc driven, one of the few parts of the economy of eve that has not been liberated. this has caused inconsitencies regarding the gap between t1 and higher techlevel ships, as well as insurance payout of t1 ships which does not reflect the actual market value of these ships, which results in an artificial price floor on ships (i.e. if the market price of a ship falls below a certain price, it becomes profitable to self-destruct them for insurance money), as well as a large isk-faucet.while we have had this insurance system for a long time, and it is somewhat adequate despite the downsides, there should be systems in place for player-driven insurance schemes to be competetive, just like any other part of eve. in particular, the t2 and t3 insurance market should be opened up for player-run insurance schemes, based on actual market value. game mechanics should be implemented to support this, so that insurances can actually fight to get their money back. in addition, while i believe suicide ganking should be a valid tactic, i believe that ships destroyed by the police on a warrant (concord or players) should not pay out insurance."

"i support z0d in his campaign.i've always found him at least semi-reasonable :) and open to discussion. if elected, i hope he won't forget some of the pod-pilots' long-standing griefs, such as being able to search in containers from a distance and warp-to-zero under autopilot.there are people out here who aren't all that interested in pvp! i hope that we will see a little balance thrown into the game. suicide ganks and gate-camps can get ridiculous."

"2 votes here alek. having met alek and some of noir in person, i can tell you they are a joy to talk to eve about, and it's clear that they have a real affection for the game. i learned something new about every 5 minutes i spent listening to them talk, and alek is impressive both in his knowledge of eve, and in his personal life. also, he got lavista's endorsement, who is near and dear to my industrialist heart and is the only csm member i've ever voted for. i think alek is also one of the few who really wants to improve the game, and like lavista has the personal integrity to fairly represent the entire eve community."

"listen to siradio tonight for an opportunity to throw questions at me live on air."
"there are a lot of negatives in that sentence.so if i cancel out the first two negatives it becomes \"it makes sense to create something that does not do what it should do\"? that can't be what you meant.did you instead mean \"it doesn't make sense to make changes that don't accomplish the intended goal\"? (just omit the middle negative.) in that case i agree.i say \"incentive based solutions\" because this is a game. players invest time and give multiple ways to use that time, the logical behavior is the one that reaps the highest quantity of a desired reward (be it territory, isk, resources, bragging rights, or \"fun\") at the highest acceptable level of effort (cost can be an effort).i bring this up because it is a known fact that players are willing to push a button for in game rewards. they'll complain the whole time that it is boring, but they will do it in preference over an alternate activity (say negotiating a dungeon or other task) that takes longer for the same amount of reward. if you don't believe me, ask yourself if you would be willing to sit docked in a station if the game gave you 1 million isk a second (3.6 billion isk an hour) you were logged in.i mention this because eve is a game. everything players do has an incentive behind it. even if there is no actual in game advantage. for example, killing someone in low sec, but not looting/salvaging their wreck has no financial gain, and in fact if ammunition is expended in the process it has a financial loss, but there is a non-financial gain (pride at success, bragging rights, killmail stats).that was an old idea that i have since wrote off. i left it there because i did say it was an idea worth considering at one point and i am trying not to edit the first post. but that was before i adopted my \"incentives\" based approach to resolving issues in the game. i credit and thank helen highwater with reminding me of the importance of addressing incentives in games.in her interview with eve-tribune she talked about creating incentives for mining, specifically mentioning unique sources of materials that can't be produced except by refining ores. creating a new niche good. but while that does create a new thing for miners to mine. it doesn't make mining any existing ores any more profitable. i do fully endorse removing meta 0 modules from rat drops (another of helen's ideas). i think that would have the most positive impact on the profitability of mining.i know this sounds like i am jacking helen's platform, but i think it is more important that people acknowledge that few ideas are developed in a vaccuum. the abilities to recognize a great idea and why it is a great idea are way more important than just coming up with them. being able to articulate those things can make the difference between ccp accepting and rejecting a proposed change."
"your bring up good points, and in general i agree that incentive based solutions can have great results. but you also very craftily managed not to answer my question :) even if you introduce incentive based solutions to the issues people have with mining, there is still a choice to be made between a mining mechanic that is semi-afk and allows for simultanious social interaction, or a mining mechanic that is intensive and does not allow for easy combination with social interaction, or would you prefer ccp to make that call?"
"also, i hope you like the challenge of finding an answer to another question that incentive solutions bring to the table...there is plenty of incentive for people to blow other people up, but none for getting blown up. so how do you solve the problem that people who want to blow people up are always looking for more people to shoot and the people getting shot are hiding from them, giving them less game for their buck?giving the losing side some kind of insentive to come to the fight anyway will result in a lot more players finding the pvp action they are looking for. but what's the insentive? one obvious contender is the thrill of the fight itself, but in a lot of cases, the victim isn't looking for that fight in the first place, like miners or haulers who get raided/suicide ganked.as i said before, i do like your approach, even though we have vastly different ones. as a csm candidate i research where the problems are, and you're looking for (insentive based) solutions. a potentially good combination. but since that is your chosen method, i do want to know if you're good at executing it."
"socializing does make up for a lot of the boredom.well my initial thought was \"why not allow for both?\" after all, ccp has said that dominion will feature more exploration sites (perhaps put more profitable ores there). unfortunately i can't think of a way to reward interactive mining that doesn't also invalidate the current mining model.did you just ask how people can be given new incentives to become victims? no, that mechanic isn't broken. additionally, if one side is obviously over matched (such as a hauler vs a pirate gang), there is never enough incentive. there is no way to artificially create such an incentive.instead i would suggest those players go to high sec and just war dec a sizable corp so they have a lot of targets. or go to sisi and goof off there since everything is inexpensive there."
"i'm not sure if rewarding interactive mining with a higher yield than semi-afk mining will invalidate semi-afk mining, as the ability to do things like socializing and web browsing etc. might well be worth the reduction in profit to most people. (unsure of that at this point, but it's an interesting question for one of my surveys) in that case, having your cake and eating it too could be possible.getting people who stand a large chance of losing to come to the fight and enjoy it anyway, that's much harder. and if the csm can't figure it out i hope ccp can. but we can still tell ccp to put more manpower into solving it. p.s i'm not asking for incentive to be victim, i'm asking for incentive to see the fight through, for instance by making sure that the loss of not being there is higher than the loss of losing the fight, or by adding goals to the fight other than killing the opponent so that even if you couldn't do that, you could still complete a different goal during the combat. (just 2 random things that came to mind)"
"there exist incentives to go out and fight. the opportunity to win, to blow someone else up, and to take or defend territory. however your question asked about incentives for people with a low (or no) chance of winning to go out. but you fail to mention what happens if they choose to evade. are their families going to be slaughtered or their homes sacked? no? so why fight if you know you are going to get wrecked more than you wreck?you also single out miners and haulers. in those cases the objective is to protect their investment (ships) and assets (cargo).if you want your target to stand and fight, you have to give them a reason to. that means either getting them in a corner (prevent them from escaping) or pursuing them until they don't want to give up ground any more.and in the case where one side thought it could win, but now feels they can't, retreating to save remaining assets is smart.i guarantee that any gang looking for a fight can find one in null sec by just going to some alliance's territory and kicking sand in a mining fleet's eye. or go join red vs. blue or factional warfare.but your original question doesn't imply a desire to start fights, it implies a desire to start massacres. because even if one group goes in knowing it will lose, there comes a point where they also know they probably won't deal more asset damage than they are going to suffer (i.e. way out numbered).the only thing ccp could do to make such risk taking more alluring is to increase insurance payouts. but that doesn't address the fact that the kind of pilots that look for one sided fights are also the kind of players that are going to pod their victims (that don't have bounties). should ccp also make implants 100% safe? of course not.if someone wants a one-sided battle, they need to find it themselves as the game already has 3 ways to do it. (1) stake out a route, (2) probe, and/or (3) use the on ship scanner.------my idea of interactive mining was to add another set of mechanisms before \"parking and cycling.\" specifically probing out an exploration belt. any sort of \"twitch\" element doesn't really work in eve. however, that doesn't address the hauler issue of mining fleet operations. mining in a fleet is more fun than mining alone. but each hauler in fleet has to make up for not mining.but is that even broken? using haulers means the miners aren't stopping, aligning to a drop off point, warping, docking, unloading, undocking, realigning, warping again, rescanning for a new asteroid, etc. of course on paper 10 hulks look better than 8 hulks and two industrial ships to haul their ore to a station, but is it better in practice?i figure i spend last 3 minutes (one mining cycle without ganglinks) each time i have to go unload (not to mention having to micromanage my 4th cycle to only mine just enough ore to over fill my hold by the barest of amounts). so in 60 minutes of mining, that is a max of 20 cycles. but let's say that 3 cycles fills a hold, and it uses 1 cycle of time to unload. so 15 productive cycles for a hulk that transports its own ore. 10 hulks is 150 cycles/hr. 8 hulks that don't have to move their own ore can conceivably do 160 cycles an hour (8 * 20). that is a net gain of 10 cycles by trading 2 miners for 2 haulers."

"as a \"young\" player (with more than l5 decades of rl) , i'd just suggest that those concerned about balance consider the \"balance\" that occurs here and in rl that is known as the predator / prey dynamic. for those getting ganked.... make 'em pay and pay in the markets. it isn't personal, it is business, only business...."
"i am inclined to agree, with one exception. if you lose your cargo ship loaded with goods in rl, you have insurance on the ship, and the goods. if you don't, you have a serious problem that might remove you from the shipping business for good.in eve, your insurance doesn't cover the whole ship, much less the goods. and even then, all you have really lost is time to the tune of $15/month.there are real world fixed costs that dictate markets. even if you consider your own time free, there is always overhead that factors into price points. in eve there are plenty of people who not only consider their time worthless, but will actually pay more to work more. and you have to compete with those people. if everyone ran profit and loss statistics and adjusted their prices to compensate, then it might work. but there are plenty of people who sell goods far below the cost of manufacturing the item yourself. not to mention that in the real world you can't just go buy a billion dollars with your fake game money to cover the cost of your lost cargo ship full of ipods. which plenty do...i don't think it can really be made into a \"well the way it works in real life is...\" type argument. in real life you live one time and 15 year olds don't dictate foreign policy from the decks of super carriers purchased on their parents dime. there are certain aspects you can apply, like the common human tendency to try and control and order things. but past that there aren't many analogs.i guess maybe the us government nerfing cars in the late 70s is similar to nerfing ships. at least you have more to say than \"waaahhhh i gotted blowed up\" or \"stfu carebear!\""

"i am gallente, i am not going to just press for one race to be raised above the bothers and i do believe that equality does not mean 'all the same'.each race should have its strengths and weaknesses, its give and take. gallente ships seem to have a bit more give and could use some more take, true. but the domi is one of the most traded bc's out there. vexor also holds its place in the hearts of many drone (ahem) users. if there is an imbalance, i would adress it. if you are looking for someone to make the gallente ships all anyone should fly because we iz uber l33t, looke elswheremike"
"my toon may nominally be achura, but i have caldari cruiser at 2 and can fly every gallente ship save the eris and the erebus, so yeah, i'd count myself as gallente. on the topic of balance, i don't think gallente are really all that bad, they just have a couple unresolved issues. blasters are supposed to have the best effective dps and they don't especially, and dampeners are supposed to be effective ew and aren't really. there's some other ship-specific issues, like why the hell the myrm and eos still have 75m3 of bandwidth and extra turrets instead of 125 and fewer turrets, but on the whole, i don't think gallente are too badly broken. they need a few tweaks, not any sort of wholesale revamp."

"hello, i apologize for my tardiness, but i think it is important that i place something here explaining my goals and motivations for applying to be a csm. my name is fndragon, my out of game name is jayson \"randy\" ward. i've been a software developer for almost 10 years now, and i recently came back to eve after leaving for approximately a year. i came back almost exclusively due to the improvements that the last few csm groups achieved, and i thought it would be the right thing to do if i were to participate in that process as a way of showing my appreciation.i apologize in advance for not having a set \"platform\" up to this point. i like to think that i have a generally well-rounded knowledge of the eve universe, even though i haven't had more than 2 years of playtime. i think that the new user experience has been vastly improved, but there are a number of things that i would like to see improve, if not just to have an open discussion with the developers about. as a software developer myself, i know all too well the difficulty of wedding requirements with functionality, and i hope that, if elected, my expertise will help facilitate more discussions.so, without further adieu, my planks of my platform:1) i would like to open up the discussion of wrecks and ownership. currently any player can salvage any other player's wreck, however any player can not tractor any other player's wreck. i think that this could be either an oversight or a design flaw, and i would like to make the ownership issues consistent. this could also extend to cans and tractoring of other players' cans.2) i would also like to address the consistency of player aggro and session changing. currently if you are fired upon, you can dock and use a jump gate without repercussion. even if you are warp scrambled. it would seem logical to me that warp scrambling would inhibit these things from occurring, but that would not be the case. ideally there would be some repercussion for doing such an act, especially when you take into account the fact you are abusing a npc's hospitality to use them as a safe haven, since you are using their facilities to warrant an escape. i would therefore propose either a standings hit with a corporation if you use their facilities while under fire (docking in a station or using a jump gate) or to use the already existing aggression mechanics to prevent such a use while you are under fire.3) i would dearly like to re-open discussion of a full macintosh and linux client. many new players are using netbook class machines, and a mac/linux version of the client software would introduce the game to a new wave of players.i do have more ideas, however those three are more \"fleshed out\" at the moment. i understand that no one representative will be able to represent every single player in eve, and i think that i have the experience and knowledge to help make eve a better world to live in. i would dearly appreciate any votes that come my way, and i promise that i will do my best to represent the community at large."

"just replace these bonuses:deimos - stupid mwd-cap-penalty bonuses (and increase capacitor capacity)brutix/eos/astarte/hyperion - armor rep bonusforstasis web bonus like kronos?"
"i would like to point out a few different problems with blasters. blaster tracking is fine, i have no problems hitting targets, however these must be addressed.1.) all ships which deploy them do not receive the bonuses required to make them work. the deimos can't fit an effective buffer tank without gimping its speed, and can't fit an active tank at all. additionally it lacks the cost effectiveness to fit a glass cannon setup like a thorax. this is a problem with some other blaster boats, but the deimos shows it the worst. so revist the bonuses and ship designs for gallente.2.) give me like 3km more to play in optimal? ffs, if i orbit at 2500 m i hit at optimal, but if i orbit at 4000 m i hit for **** all. that's just not right. (level 4 and 5 skills...) basically a slight buff to optimals. this could even be handled with gallente ships."
"more damage, more tracking, more range on medium / small variants."
"yes i agree 100% with the op.in regards to the deimos i'd like to see the following changes:switch the mwd bonus for an ab speed bonus like the afs on sisi haveswitch the falloff bonus for a tracking bonusit will give the deimos a unique role and allow it complete range control within scrambler range. you'd also have the option to try to disengage if things go bad.you might even be able to fit somthing in that utility hi slot with the lower fitting cost of the ab"
"you know what, i love this idea. i would actually fly a deimos if it had such bonuses :)"
"v"
"good idea"
"in light of the number of pages any salvage threads gets and how fast those threads and up discussing something that has already been decided i think this warrants a bump to my proposal in hope it gets some more attention and support again."
"i like this idea.obviously ccp's stance on ninja looting is do to their being no distinguishing between deepspace active missions and just left over wrecks from a missioner.the one cavet though is that scanning for wrecks should not increase the odds of finding an active mission more then current methods. additionally with the ability to distinguish between active and left over mission wrecks the stance on salvaging a mission while it is actively being completed should be re-examined granting the missioner the first opportunity on his own wrecks. ccp's stance currently is a necessary one for the survival of salvaging as a viable profession, however with these changes flagging ninja salvaging would work without harming the salvaging industry. all about balance."
"i like the idea of scannable wrecks myself. but as to another part of discussion, the claimant rights and abandonment that has been mentioned in different parts, i would like to see an auto abandon option in menu first off. this way i don't need to click anything.second, the ability to abandon jet cans if/while wrecks are unscannable. this way i can dump bookmarks of my mission sites outside of station undock and whoever gets them first can take. to have wrecks scannable and keep server load down, i recommend that the site works on scanning the grid it is on instead of the item itself."
"i approve of this idea (that might have something to do with me not having any encounters with ninja salvagers before...).the amount of people blitzing missions for standings seem to be a lot and there is no reason why those wrecks, and in extension all other wrecks of course, should not be scannable."
"personally, i like the sound of this. i think an important consideration is whether it is desirable to make salvaging a career. if it is, salvage yield might need to be decreased (along with this change) and a new tier of skills and wreck difficulty added, etc.has anything official been said along the lines of whether salvaging is an end or just another thing? (lately it seems like scanning/exploration has been heading in the \"not really a dedicated career\" and toward the \"just something everyone does\" direction, sadly)"
"as stated before ccp is looking to tap into the console market to gain more money. there is a lot of ppl that use console for a gaming platform, more than pc and ccp would be making way more revenue than they would if this title was a computer exclusive.lol to all of you who think mouse and keyboard dominates a controller of the xbox 360, you obviously haven't faced a good console player or have tried playing console and just cant get the hang of the controller.having ps3 and xbox 360 compatibility is alrdy a lot of work since they have to make two different games for each platform and then they have to develop their communication idea so it works for pc ps3 and xbox 360 which is also gunna take some work.pc hackers would have a grand time putting bots up or hacking the game and that would not be cool. pc just has too much code and room for programs and stuff, and if they made a pc dust, they'd have to make a mac and linux version............ now im thinkin that would just be way too much work.to all u pc players that are winning about this i say hahahahahahahah ill be playin dust and you wont be unless you get a console so get out there kitties and get urself a xbox 360 (lol i dont like ps3)and quit supporting this cause ccp aint gunna make it pc, mac and linux lol, too late for that shiz, just be happy playing eve and sit at ur desk chair bed etc. and be happy they aint gunna f up everything in eve with this game"

"you should be able to change your character name for any reason... once. it's obviously possible without breaking the game--as gm's can change a person's name for breaking the rules--so why can't we do it?the original character name should also be listed on his info screen."
"while i do not believe this should be a priority i would like it to see it implemented sometime in the future. as long as the original pilot's name is listed somewhere in the pilot info i do not see much of a problem.limits such as number of times/frequency you could change a pilots name would be important. with the new \"redeem plex\" option showing up in sisi this might be another easy way for ccp to suck those plex off the tq server.ashina for csm"

"i agree. it's also a first step towards moving pve ships to fitting more like pvp ships. currently, engaging in pvp in a pve specific ship is like hanging a sign off the bow reading \"gank me\", which is one of the things mission pirates count on. being able to fit ships for missions more like ships for pvp would enable the mission runners to at least put up a plausible engagement.edit: forgot thumb."

"that's not a reason for missions being as utterly dull and predictable as they are."
"hell yeah!"
"yes, there's mining/production/pvp/exploration/blobs/forum trolling and much more!your point is?each activity in eve get their separate attention. while i could have written the billionth proposal on \"fixing\" ninja salvaging or \"fixing\" the nano nerf... or have a go at fixing pvp so that everybody actually does some of it.i decided to go at it from a different angle and fixing missions so they actually are a part of eve as an mmo again. while keeping it in the back of my head that the ultimate goal is to make mission runners more confident in themselves and their pvp fittings to go out and actually do it against real people.if you had read anything in my proposal you would have known this but my guess is you are just a troll..."
"read the tl;dr version. its worth it.heres the copy/paste from his his idea:the real tl:dr version!my first iteration on this proposal was written over 7 hours in a row, i constantly had new refined versions of my idea come to me and realized that some of these things really needed some extra attention. this is why the proposal, which i initially intended to cover on one post... grew to the massive wall of text it is. needless to say, i was too tired to write a good summary after the first iteration.tl:drmissions are (and have always been) about static content, this gets old and repetitive very fast. the ai (even the sleepers) is all about targeting and shooting you while using magic (yes magic!) effects on you that have no relation to how the game actually works.due to the static nature of missions any sane person would grow tired of seeing the same thing over and over again. even pvp'ers who run missions occasionally will face this reality way too soon.last but not least, missions are not challenging to you after you train a couple of skills to level 3-4 and above and there is no proper teamwork and lacks the competitive atmosphere that we want eve to be. (well most of us anyways)therefore i propose that we (actually ccp) scrap the current mechanic completely and implements a mission generator that can create some much needed randomness to missions. all this randomness is then backed up by an npc enemy that actually use fits to the best of their ability to fight the mission runner the same way a small gang of pvp'ers would fight. using ships and modules that we would use in pvp. added to that, if we beat that ai it will self reflect on it's fitting and try and create a counter to your successful gank of their artificial beings. basically, they copy our fittings used in pvp engagements and try to utilize them against us. this means you might very well see a buffer tanked myrmidon in a mission that can kill not only your own myrmidon, but your friends myrmidon and a failfitted raven. the best part is when a second npc warps in with a dominix and start to transfer armor to that myrmidon just before it's about to go into structure!finally, the best part after completely new and dynamic mission content i propose that we add in a competitive and teamwork encouraging element which i named \"the agent mission board\".no more shall a few solo mission runners talk to their agent and receive a mission \"just for them\", the new system will create missions as a real live element in eve that everybody (with standings to that agent) can take part it. this means that in the new system, whatever mission you subscribe to can be subscribed to by anyone else! you might actually have to compete (or work together) with other players you've never talked to before!some missions will have many objectives to complete and some missions will only have one objective. if there is only one objective you should make damn well sure you complete that objective before anyone else, hopefully you realize you will fare better by doing this together with others as opposed to going solo.if there are many objectives you can at least finish one of those objectives and still consider the mission a success. and without you knowing it, you are actually doing teamwork because with your assistance that mission can be completed by others too!"
"missions are considered \"player vs environment\" for a reason, and i can't see this resolution passing for general missions. forcing people to play in any specific style is against the idea of mmos, let alone the sandbox of eve.however, this is what i thought the faction warfare missions were going to be, and i wouldn't mind seeing that happen. i don't support it in this incarnation, but given a rewrite (to focus on fw missions), i'd gladly support it."
"making missions much more variable and closer to pvp (or alternately pvp closer to pve which might be even better) is an excellent goal.specifics can vary widely but the broad goal? i'm in support."
"good thing i don't visit s&m then.prophecy is fine, learn to fit."
"but then it wouldn't be a gleaming golden laser-spewing death ship at all. i mean, come on, surely your corp should have some respect for the frickin lazerbeams. more seriously, it's a t1 hull. missile bonuses on gallente and amarr only come in on t2 hulls, specifically roden and khanid t2 hulls. t1 is about the plain, vanilla, true-to-racial-philosophy stuff. if you think the proph is bad, make it better at its role, don't give it a new role."

"when a tower goes offline, after a period of time (7 days?) the tower should be considered abandoned and anyone who wants to should be able to unanchor it. it is becoming fairly common to find abandoned towers in wormhole space and it is a shame that they just sit there and rot."
"i'm not really opposed to this idea in 0.0/wormhole space(though i'm not crazy about it either), but it's definitely not the right system for empire."
"all you need is armageddons and time. and towers pass away. you want that tower gone? kill it."
"no problem with it for empire either. maybe require a hacking module to unanchor it though. and while you can blow it up, i'd rather just take it."
"i'd like to see them degrade over time so that it requires a progressively smaller and smaller force to blow up an abandoned tower the longer it sits and rots."
"you mean less then 3-4 4week old toons in geddons? blowing up offline towers is one of easiest things in this game."
"during my term in the csm, we discussed this very thing on our trip to reykjavik. i can't go into details due to the nda, but ccp knows about this problem and are looking into ways to solve it. dominion's avoidance of pos sovereignty is a step in the right direction, but i'm sure we'll see more of this later on."
"i know this might change the way some ships like the lach arazu and all tackle ceptors work, but i think we should make the scram and web hit out the same range now that we've got them designed to work together.either nerf back web range a few km or boost scram range to 10 km, it makes no sense that you need to overheat the scram to hit out to 9k and the web goes out to 11."
"t2 scram goes to 9k. dont need to overheat. problem fixed. really problem is web attributes which slows down ship...its laughing at us."
"fit a faction warp scrambler. they hit out to wooping *11.25*km before bonuses/overload. (true sansha) there are also others reaching to 10k and are a bit cheaper.and nice side effect some have warp scram strength of 3. (hello mr. double stabbed hauler. ;)"
"i like round numbers as much as anyone, but this seems completely unnecessary. no thanks."
"i'm a pirate and i disapprove this message."
"here's a better idea. make it so that you can accept lp store offers in bulk, and add a new offer - 100 isk(or something equally low-end) for 1 lp. anyone who wants to clear out and shrink their list now can. and that way you don't get to convert all your motsu lp into navy domis and slave implants."
"of course it is. hence no support for either idea from me.even if 100isk/lp is low, do you really think this is a good idea? more ways to create isk out of thin air?why not trade them for standings instead? something that is intangible."
"lp are called \"loyalty points\". you earn them for showing loyalty towards the faction they're from. it would make absolutely no sense to be able to transfer them between corporations, or from character to character. lp is not currency.though, perhaps lp can be changed to being given to you directly from the faction the corp belongs to and then you just need a standing above -0.01 to shop at the lp store of any given corp. if not that, then i agree with herschel that lp should be redeemable for small amounts of isk... certainly lesser amounts than you would be able to make from saving up the lp and buying the faction modules and selling them through contracts."
"all isk comes from thin air anyways. this offer will get used so rarely that it won't make any meaningful difference. if you can come up with something else worthwhile to offer for 1 lp, i'd be all for it, but the only things that come to mind are faction ammo, which is too small, and starbase charters, which are too big. hence you need something to offer that costs exactly 1, and a token amount of isk would seem to fit the bill."
"yeah, the role management tools in this game are terrible. i'll definitely be bringing up this topic, or a very similar one, if i'm elected."
"i totally agree there and with the original poster."
"the corporation management system just needs a complete rework in general.it is super complicated, very unorganized, and there's no horizontal scrollbar which is hell even for my fullscreen 1680x1050 resolution... it must be even worse for people with smaller screens.please ccp for the love of god. just delete the current corp management system and start over."
"so let me see if i understand this right. i create an account off the buddy program and activate it with a plex, which costs me exactly nothing. i then hand it two more plex, and forget about it for the rest of time, and have a four-slot account. or hand it six plex and have a six-slot account. in other words, any worthwhile industry/research operation is now going to take exactly one account, no matter how many lines i want to have, and doing this will pay for itself in six months(assuming i don't want to train). or i can do it the other way. say i have three characters to train up for industry. i get three accounts off the buddy system(again, these are free), hive off one of my permanent account's character slots to each of the two temporary accounts, train all three in parallel, and a month later put them all back on the permanent account and let the others expire. bang, character transfers with no $20 fee. i can do the same thing as a business, too - \"i'll train you a hulk alt for your main account mister pirate, and it'll be cheaper than market too because i don't have to price in a $20 fee!\". why would you want to do this? and more importantly, why would ccp ever want do this? i don't see what problem this solves(there's no \"overabundance of plex\", they wouldn't cost north of a quarter bil each if there was a true overabundance. also, why would ccp mind an abundance? it's an interest-free loan for them.), it just seems like a mass of coding and a bunch of headaches to no good purpose. you're allowing a bunch of things that shouldn't be allowed, and i can virtually guarantee that this will be a long-term nerf to ccp's income. either i'm totally missing the point, or this is a very crazy idea with very few redeeming qualities."
"does lien mean loan in that post? dont have a clue what the op is talking about...."
"this makes no sense and seems to mix up the definitions of several words. a lien is something that you would claim if somebody were to default on a loan payment to you. are you talking about loans?what?"
"this is a lien on a character just like a lien on a car or home. failure to pay the lien back results in the loss of the character which the lend could then sell to recoup loss.liennounlaw. the legal claim of one person upon the property of another person to secure the payment of a debt or the satisfaction of an obligation."
"no by using a contract via this method you would lose an open character slot on the account until the contract is finished."
"silly and unneeded imo..."
"and unenforceable.me: takes out loan, accepts lein for 60 days.lender: gleefully claps hands at expected repayment.me: transfers cash to main account, cancels secondary account.lender: also, ccp is going to give you some very funny looks because you hae this working through an out of game interface."
"it uses the same interface as the current 60d gtc system. obviously if someone accepted a lien contract their account must be pre paid for the length of time of the lein contract and they will be unable to cancel their account for the time of the lien.looking for constructive posts here."
"you still haven't said what the lien is. you still seem to be confused as to what a lien is. a lien isn't something that two people can make a contract about, unless it is something written in a contract for a loan or other instance where a regular payment schedule is required.looking for a well-thought-out proposal here."
"this proposal is simple and straightforward- reduce the native ship signature, or add a ship feature based on skill level to do so, for all electronic attack frigates. these frigates have much potential, but seem to be inordinately easy to kill. as ewar ships, it wouldn't be unheard of for them to have some native sensor fuddling gear, that makes the ship \"seem\" smaller in the way halo implants work. this would up their utility and survivability-even with a slight adjustment."
"please make it so you can fit ships you are not in.or say select like 10 ships of the same type, and select a loadout and it loads to all the ships if you have the mods in the hangar.also how about an automatic buyer, you list 10 things you need, and the market automaticaly searches the best price for you and gives you a quote for it all and you can choose to buy it then."
"why? i mean, kudos for good manners, and using the word please, but this isn't an issue.again, why? it's not like you can fly ten ships at once.the problem with this is range. the best price from where you are may be 900% over the actual market value of the item. i can see some poor new player accidentally paying 8 million isk for a shuttle because they don't know any better (\"but the searchy thing said this was the best price!\") looking at items one at a time means i get to actually see the prices - i've actually saved myself a couple million on a single ship by flying one or two more jumps to check the price in the next region over.sorry, not supported."
"mining can use a little boost in 0.0 and low sec. the risk u take should be more rewarded than the current 15-25m hourly income from mining the abc ores.removing/adjusting ore refine rate from lustering alloy, glossy compound, plush compound and opulent compound from drone loot mining will boost the rare ores in 0.0 and make mining worth mining."
"certainly a cool idea, but i don't think it can be implemented sensibly. if you want to get to any one of the ~2000 wormholes in existence in a week, you need an average of three links to other wormhole systems in every wormhole, with absolutely no doubling back, so in practice more like 4-5. do you realize how absurd it would be for w-space to be that tightly interconnected? that's more ways in and out than the average k-space system."
"well as i said... i don't think the wh mechanic should change from what we have now. at least not the things that are clearly defined. point is the mapping system should give you enough information to be able to reach your target. don't forget that k-space is still available so you might go out in null sec, do a few jumps and wait there for the next ride in. it's absolutely possible.also i'm not suggesting that just anybody can find any system in 1 week. you should be a bad arse explorer to even have a chance at doing that. for the more inexperienced folk it this thing should help them find their way back to empire for example so it would still be useful. and by help i don't mean like a clear path out... more like a hint of whether they are moving into the right direction.i'm aware of the difficulties of implementing what i'm proposing but as any developer knows having a clear picture of what you want to do is always the first step. i'd be incredibly happy if ccp would just add anything like this to their backlog."
"it's painful for anyone who wants to do anything on the forums in bulk. i'd love to see them phase in reductions - see if the spammers come back when it's 3 minutes, for example. still, i don't see why the recruitment forum is special. just evemail them."
"the recruitment forums for me are/were hassle free, bulk recruitment tool. i wouldn't have to be in-game to work on the game.i wouldn't have to take notes to make sure i haven't hit the same mark more than once ... i could just look in the thread ...just to name a few drawbacks ...working in bulk would net me 4-5 leads a week ... now that the work is doubled by being forced to eve mail people or wait 5 mins between posts has brought my recruitment almost to a grinding halt ...anyway .. just seeing if others that recruit are in the same boat as me ..."

"vote for z0d he knows eve like the backside of his hands. as others have said he is always reachable and takes time to help individuals learn to strive in the sandbox we all can eve.remember to vote everyone counts!"
"i have had the pleasure to know zod for the past year during my time with eveonline. zod is a knowledgeable player who engages in a variety of aspects of the game and in my opinion would be a suitable candidate for the position of csm. good luck to all canditates."
"he knows how to build and how to sell, he helps newbs and gives advises to experienced. i see no reason not to vote for him.so,vote for z0d"
"i have been a supporter of the take care party since it started. i supported and advised both the previous take care csm members, ankh and eric. i have known z0d in game for a good while now and he is the perfect successor to eric. his knowledge of industry and markets is probably only eclipsed by chribba. his policies are sound and carry on in the direction set out by ankh and eric and i will be happy to lend my full support and advice to z0d and the take care party once again.i especially like that we will continue to push to make lowsec a relevant part of the game, as it is currently being overlooked whilst the focus on gameplay is generally on empire, 0.0 and faction wars. whilst all these should continue to evolve, lowsec should not be overlooked."
"vote z0d!quite possibly the best friend one could have when it comes to manufacturing and trade. helpful, resourceful and extremely knowledgeable.vote z0d."
"greetings, alekid like to hear if you have any thoughts on the gameplay experience in lowsec as well as in factional warfare."
"speaking for our beloved (sick atm) ceo, fellow directors and all members of mv:mv fully endorses and supports elvenlord for csm. elven is one of the coolest, even headed, eve knowledgeable and worthwhile candidates for csm in all of eve.elven, for the miners just make roids that shoot back! oh and on a personal request encourage ccp to make it possible for fc to select which types of ships follow fleet warps."
"the podcast is now up at planet risk. thanks to quivering palm and luminus for giving me the opportunity to take part."
"what i was implying is a problem between the people who want to start fights and the people who are attacked by them who don't want to fight them. with the defending side often running away (mostly since the battle was innitiated on the terms of the attacker) the attacking players, looking for a fight, aren't finding what they seek. sure they can go to 0.0 and run into big alliances who aren't afraid of them, but a lot of players are looking for unfair fights in their favor because that's where the guarenteed positive feedback is at. and in the end, that's why people play games, to get positive feedback. so to give it to them on a regular basis, you need to provide them with targets easy enough to win more often than they lose. and if those targets are other players, those players wouldn't want to be easy pickings, hence the problem. but it's not the problem i'm looking for, it's the solution."
"they aren't trying hard enough.\"thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy's plans, the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces, the next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field, and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.\" -sun tzubut there is no problem. if people want easy kills they can go rat or run missions. or just work harder to corner their quarry. but i guess that wouldn't be an \"easy kill\" if they actually had to run down their target.pirates crying about over matched targets running away need to htfu. if the roles were reversed, they would be running away too. evading a battle that can't be won is a victory in its own right. just as having surviving ships of a convoy escape with their cargoes also a win.so this problem (that doesn't exist) would call for removing the positive feedback of one party (those fleeing combat) in preference of positive feedback of another (those attacking). since neither party deserves preferential treatment, the win goes to the side that does a better job. i.e. if one side escapes, hurray for them. if the other side blows them up first, hurray for them.\"all warfare is based on deception. hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near. hold out baits to entice the enemy. feign disorder, and crush him.\" -sun tzuif a gang is having trouble getting other groups to fight them, perhaps they should be more discreet in their numbers. hide pilots in other systems. or form multi-corp gangs so that not every member in the fleet shows the same corp in the local chat. specifically: \"make other pvp gangs think they can win, then after combat is joined (and they switch back to fleet chat) bring in reinforcements and quickly lock them down.\"of course, this is why battleships hanging out near stargates all \"alone\" look kind of fishy.the point is, there are a variety of alternate strategies that players can employ to be more successful. and none of them require ccp to do anything."
"and then to ask if they are actually applying them, and if not, why not, and how can we stimulate them to, so that they can have a more gratifying experience?"
"are pirates applying these strategies? some are, but you don't hear from them because they aren't complaining. the ones that are vocal are the ones that are not succeeding.how can we stimulate them to use more sophisticated strategies? continue to evade them to force them to give up or adapt. that and tell them to try different things.again i reiterate that pirates having to corner their targets is not an issue that needs to be addressed by csm or ccp.i have expended enough effort on this topic."
"we're pretty much in agreement now, you make a good case."
"why i want to be your csm representative:i believe the csm makes a difference. any time you can sit down with the people who directly effect the direction and composition of game you're playing you should take it. as much as writing in ideas is productive it's not the same as a face to face discussion. by bringing up the points we deem important directly to the developers we can move the game in the direction that we the players, want.i have a diverse background in and out of game as it relates to eve online. like many i've tried my hands on a diverse cross section of professions you can be in eve:as a ceo i deal with the horrible ui for corp management and the associated difficulties managing a corp roles and access including issues with pos operation and want to see them changedas a mission runner and podcaster on them, i deal with questions and mechanics about them routinelyas a trader i've used and abused the market and contract systems and as business executive out of eve i have the personal tools to aid in the improvement of those systemsin addition i also have been part of the out of game community building with my podcast and bloggers. with the upcoming deployment of \"new eden\" i think the insights and experience i have in these will aid in directing the expansion of this servicesince i play in different areas of the sandbox, i want to see them all vibrant and continue to expand.in real life i have years of experience sitting on a number of society and corporate boards as both chairman and as a general directori care about eve online. this game has given me years of fond memories and entertainment. i want to continue to see it improve and bring in more players."
"what i see as priorities:bookmark revision:currently the bookmark system is antiquated and tedious. for any corp/alliance that regularly creates bms and shares them the current system is ridiculous. having to move to hanger, copy, replace then rinse and repeat for everyone. this creates huge amounts of entries into the db which causes lag and server load and is a pain for players.what eve needs is an integrated bm system similar to the new ship fitting interface where bms can be saved for personal or corporate use.drone interface changes:the drone interface is horrible old and clunky. launching and commands requiring tedious menu clicking. the interface needs to be modernised to more reflect the current hud system. allowing drones to be group and assigned a hotkey for major commands: launch group; recall group; attack target.you should be able to see the status of drones while they're in the bay so you know which ones have been damage. having to undock just to group drones is ridiculous and should be added to the fitting interface (actually this should be extended to regular weapons as well).pos access changes:allow members of corps set to a certain standing to freely access the shield.borked mobile lab access to non corp/alliance memberscomplex and arcane role requirements for access pos and labscorporate management:worst interface in game. requires complete overhaul to simplify.contracts page:clunky with poor search refinement.fleet missions:missioners get typed as anti social loners that don't really play the rest of eve. as part of the helpmymission community. i want to see the sleeper ai moved over to a regular stream of missions in empire space to encourage more fleet operations and to get missions more comfortable with the strategies used in pvplow sec:as it stands now low sec is the bastard region of eve. in reality low sec is more the unsecured part of eve then null sec. in null sec there is the infrastructure of alliances and corps to protect allies, in low sec there is no one. high sec has its relative security and null sec has its high rewards but low sec has neither. there needs to be a rethinking on what and how low sec operates to entice more players to live there.your issues:let's face it. no one has all the answers or is aware of all the little issues. these are just a list of mine. i like to think i'm pretty good at seeing a good idea when someone points it out to me. i want to be able to put forward the issues that are important to other players as well. my only agenda is to make eve online a better game for everyone, and if you put forward a good idea, i want to see it implemented."
"bump :)"
"lmao matrixskye for president of sig images!well said. anarchy, while attractive to students of college philosophical and anthropological concepts, isn't exactly sustainable. i have played since just after launch and it's kind of disturbing to see the skyrocket trend of asshattery for asshattery's sake that doesn't add anything to the game. you can be a pirate/scammer/bad guy and not be a tool. it is possible. it's unfortunately also increasingly rare in eve.eve isn't anyone's experiment in social behavior, unless i missed the memo. last i checked it was a video game. he has some good points about treading lightly on game mechanics. maybe he's even correct about the source of the demise of swg. i think eve can endure far more than a game like swg and wow though.time will tell."
"huh. by the same logic one would assume from watching the evening news that humanity is all about murder, ****, war, and whatever ridiculous holiday is currently being celebrated. these are all facets of humanity but they don't define humanity.eve, in my opinion, is an empire building game. you can play and excel in eve without ever fitting an offensive module. counterstrike is a slice of a reality taken out of context. the whole world doesn't wake up in the morning, strap on a tactical vest, and head out to the office to snipe the guys across the street. maybe if you live in mogadishu or something, but probably not even then.there are a lot of people that want it very badly to be a pure combat game. just like there are people who want it to be mining game or a market trading game.however, i am pretty sure that no matter what your slant, you would probably whine to someone if you went to the grocery store in your average modern city and someone mugged you and blew up your car with a rocket launcher. if you went strolling through some \"bad\" neighborhood that you didn't belong in to go grocery shopping, you might expect trouble. and if you lived in a world where there were no \"good\" places, then you would essentially have the dark ages. no progress, just war and famine and sorrow for war famine and sorrows sake. given the highly organized nature of eve, i doubt that is what ccp have in mind. but that's just my take.it's weird how this argument always seems to end up with one extreme or the other being the only way. the pvp folks want, unrealistically, to be able to destroy at will, anyone, anywhere, with no more inconvenience than a lost (insured) ship and a slap on the hand in the form of a security ouchie. and the non pvp folks want, unrealistically, to be able to autopilot freighters from one side of eve to the other and afk mine anywhere without risk of getting ganked.without pvp, industry is worthless. without industry pvp is bumper pods.find a happy medium or whine about it. pretty simple.in my opinion there are two kinds of idiots in this game. high sec grief pilots, meaning the unorganized pilots with no goals beyond blowing up as many people as possible regardless of gains. and the ninnies that want a game that you can play on autopilot while you do your laundry. i like to pretend both of these camps are all in the 12-18yo range so that i don't have to be sad that there are adults that are that deluded, naive, and self important.you want respect as a pirate, try a hard target now and then instead of killing noobs all day and salvaging peoples wrecks. then high fiving your buddies in local like you accomplished something. you want respect as a miner, tank some 0.0 belt rats while ninja mining a rival alliances space and don't cry when a 10 man cov ops roam blows you out of that space. or do a freight run in low sec.the real pirates don't give a **** about high sec because there's not much that ccp could change that would prevent them operating somewhere. and the same goes for real industry pilots.the root of the problem, as i see it, is \"high sec\" is a misnomer. it's not secure and it's certainly not highly secure. no one wants to take away combat. well, no one that matters. people just want it to make sense. currently it doesn't really. high sec is a pile of crap right now. just a giant monkey **** fest of griefers and carebears. solve this and i am pretty sure you solve several interdependent issues like spreading out the population. why would anyone leave high sec? as risky as it is, it's still the safest place for the little guy to mine and build. and the risk keeps the markets relatively even between low and high sec. and considering that there isn't really any risk to the pirates, why not park next to the food bowl and just stay there"
"for the record. i don't think ganking should be outlawed in high sec. i don't think combat should be outlawed in high sec. but the penalties should be adjusted to be more in line with the varying sec ratings. and that doesn't mean more gate cops and concord.the juciest targets should be riskier. for the same reason, there is no arkonor in high sec.and salvage should have ownership like cans. that way when i run into logit he won't be the only one having fun. although i am pretty sure the reason it doesn't was a design issue more than a decision to not apply ownership beyond the loot inside the wreck."
"i stand corrected.this isn't confirmed but it's entirely possible. comes from the ceo of suddenly ninjasninja salvage---"
"i agree. :) i'll be contacting you ingame as soon as i have some free time -t'amber"
"indeed a \"timely fashion\" would be preferable, but failing that some sort of timetable for the notes to be released, and as a bare bottom scraping minimum some sort of semi regular status update.if its to say \"ccp want us to withold the notes untill dominion\" then so be it. if its to say \"notes have been sent to ccp for final approval but they are incredibly busy at the movement\" then this is also fair enough.this blanket silence (except from a semi cryptic comment from the new guy issler that he has \"seen the notes\" - though what this means to the release process nobody knows)) is a disgrace - and should not be allowed to be buried by the plees for votes from the next wave of fanbois, bored housewives, layabout students and paupers seeking free holidays.skunk"
"we're at around the 2 month mark for the meeting at this point. have they canceled the csm at just not told anyone?"
"at the very least it would be nice to know if the present delay is on the csm or ccp side.the last comment from the csm secretary was that the minutes had been held up because something needed further discussion at fanfest. the minutes of the iceland meeting should be the minutes of the iceland meeting minus anything ccp isn't willing to release yet. if the response in iceland is, \"we'll talk about this at fanfest,\" then the minutes should say \"further discussion to be held at fanfest.\" no more, no less. if a supplementary report on what was discussed at fanfest is needed, generate one when the time is ripe. don't hold up the iceland minutes."
"i have also flown with darth sith since january 2006. i have never met a more dedicated man to this game. his integrity without a doubt is one of the most unwavering i have met. in this internet spaceship game, it is easy to do something in question because there are no repercussions. this is a person who holds to his word and doesn't falter in any manner, end of story. flying so long with this man has led me to understand him not only in game, but out of game as well. this is a man who can take responsibility and put it toward the greater good of the game. i have no doubt in my mind he is more than capable of being part of the csm and will be voting for him.i do consider myself a good judge of character, and i have fully faith in darth to do what he actually says above. good luck bud!"
"ashina is responsible for introducing many players to their first intentional pvp and first presence in 0.0. you hear a lot of people talk about wanting more pvp and more people out of empire. they usually are proposing some half-baked idea that would actually result in less pvp. not ashina. ashina's ideas are feasible and will result in more pvp and more players involved in activities outside the safety of empire space. it has already been shown through ashina's work in game."
"please check it outmy csm campagne video and messagevote extreme"
"you have my vote, those care bears must be protected."
"obvious troll is obvious"
"i'll give you an 8 out of 10 for all the serious replies you got. i especially liked how you snuck in a bit where you basically said that you should be invulnerable in an npc corp and no one picked up on it.an excellent troll post sir."
"i don't think he was trolling. i think a lot of mmo players are used to having a \"safe\" portion of the game. i.e. 'if i stick to a, b, and c, i might not ever reach the top but no one can ever hurt me either' cough cough wow cough. eve doesn't and shouldn't have that. but i think the carebears make up a large enough portion of the user base that they should be taken into account. and i think that can be done in a way that not only can everyone be ok with but in a way that could actually add to the game in the long run. from a pirate perspective, how much of a challenge is ganking? it's a practical yawn fest. a couple noobs with half decent skills can freighter gank.i think this topic has been all whining and name calling for so long that it's lost credibility. which sucks because there is a real opportunity here to add realism and more sport to the game."
"well thanks kirana.... 1st time i've tried posting on the forums & it is nice to know that i don't sound like a complete fool.. lolrisk avoidance is a goal, but rl or eve only ever gives us opportunities for risk mitigation - and always with an opportunity cost. like it or not, grim reality includes moments when \"..stuff happens..\" some of those occasions are not good, some are quite adverse; yeah -- stuff happens.while no combat specialist myself, i recognize that this environment is, by its nature, conflict driven be it markets, pvp, or regional dominance. ergo, stuff happens. should i rage against \"the machine\" if my mining barge or hauler is destroyed? i think not; much of what i build, haul, or trade is combat oriented gear!i ask for no sympathy or special status (unless i've already negotiated/paid for that status ) when i am, effectively, an arms dealer. i use the game mechanics as best i can to achieve risk mitigation.let the games go forward!"
"agreed. the one thing people shouldn't do, although almost everyone has at some point, is freak out when they get ganked. whether in a freighter or a retriever. it's pointless. particularly when many gankers operate in the hopes that they can get a good local flame off going. most don't admit it and play the roll of taking the high road. but it's pretty clear from watching local in just about any busy system that many of them love getting railed out by ****ed off carebears. don't feed the trolls, as they say. i think most low or no profit ganks are just bored trolls looking for conflict. but bored trolls aren't the problem. the problem is why they are bored. there's no incentive to be more creative than floating outside of a station waiting for some noob in an ibis to empty out the \"free stuff here\" can. it's absolutely allowed by game mechanics. that doesn't mean it makes for good game play from either side.and yah, it's a combat heavy game, to be sure. but it's not all bombs and bullets. so it goes back to the main question. is eve about staying true to realistic societal storyline concepts or is it about pure neutral game balance. i don't know if those two things are compatible.i've ganked and i have been ganked. hard. and i still play the game and love it. but i wouldn't mind taking care of a few things that just don't make much sense. as an old player it's easy to lose sight of that time waaaayyy back when some player took everything you had just for a chuckle. i still remember the first time i got popped. i had just spent most of my bankroll on a shiny new moa, joined a 0.0 corp, and headed to stain to begin my life as a bad ass. 3 jumps into low sec i got locked down and popped faster than i could even react to. i don't remember if i got ****ed in local or not. i probably did. i was a noob. the last time i got ganked was to the tune of 4.5billion. didn't say a peep. went back to lick my wounds and adjust my strategy. the point is that, while most carebear whining is just that, there is an awful lot of it out there and i think we can silence a lot of it, for the sake of all involved.think about this for example... if you had a class of systems .8+ or .9+ that weren't gank proof but were very difficult to gank in. it would give small industry in high sec a place to flourish more or less unhindered. the result would be to drive prices on manufactured goods down and high end resources up in these areas. this would increase the traffic of large quantities of goods flowing out of these systems to the exposed outlying .8- or .7- areas where they could be sold for huge profit as well as increase traffic of high end resources from low sec/0.0 to supply this industry. right now there's not much margin in price from the market hubs and the high end of low sec. that gives traders and gankers no incentive to spread out. what you end up with is exactly what we have currently. it's a bit dysfunctional when you think about it.what i am talking about benefits both sides. the gankers get a boost in quality and quantity of ganks and the carebears get their safe spot. the only thing that changes is where the ganks happen. a secondary effect would be to give new players a chance to get their bearings before being gun ****d. i have had several people i referred to eve get scared off because of that. it's a different kind of game to get used to.i am not a champion of carebears. i am a champion of mutually beneficial game design. if it helps the carebears, so be it.if nothing else, i can talk like a politician. 15 ways of saying the same thing over and over with as many words as possible."
"the latest on ninja salvaging.read it and weep."
"i stand corrected.this isn't a huge disappointment though. i rarely run missions and mostly salvage sleepers, which i have never been ninja'd on for obvious reasons. i can see why it bugs newer players but if ccp reviewed it and made that call, then that's that.i love your corp name btw. you guys are hilarious. if i was to get ninja'd i would hope it would be by people with a good sense of humor."
"with the results of my second survey now in, i am supported by it that indeed people want to take the whole csm process and move it to within the game's graphical user interface. i've also inquired about what shiptypes players want to see added to the game, since in the previous survey many people stated that they wanted new shiptypes. and the results are remarkably in line with the first survey. adding exploration-oriented ships is most popular, and exploration also scored high in the first survey, meaning that's where a large portion of the players want ccp to put some focus on next.had the results of survey one been very contradictive to the first, i'd have known that this system of finding out what people want doesn't work, but now it shows signs of consistancy. there are plenty more conclusions to be drawn from the surveys, and i'd like for everyone to view them independently, drawing their own conclusions from the data. if your conclusions differ from mine, i'd like to know what you think.in recent interviews, players have been given the chance to ask csm candidates questions. i feel this should be the other way around: we should be asking you questions. so take a look at the results of the second survey here and review the full results of the first survey here and let me know what you think the csm should learn from them.-aynen"
"which is why that ccp is integrating the csm voting process into the eve client. ;)"
"but why stop there? ingame survey tools, ingame assembly halls, there is much more that's possible."
"nice graphics but jesus christ man, this isn't elite 2also, the second picture reminds me of tropico or something i do like the thought you've put into these ideas, and you've fleshed them out to a surprising extent, which is far more than most candidates do. so props to you, for that. if i was voting at all this year i'd probably vote for you, just on the strength of the commitment you seem to have given this thing."
"the second survey is filling up rapidly, and soon there will be results to give you. if you haven't allready gone and filled it in, please hop over to"
"the results are in! this survey filled up much faster than the previous one. a big thank you to everyone who participated. the results can be found here"

"when the speed changes hit the server and everything slowed down and webbers were changed i said \"okay what's a reasonable amount of time for ccp to realize that my gallente bs's are screwed over and i'll give em that time to 'fix' the problem before i do something drastic.\" the goal was 60 days. **i will now make fun of the ammar race for the rest of this post.**60 days hit and nothing, so i said \"well, i hate missiles, and i don't want to fly duct tape into battle so that leaves ammar and their l4z0rz of death...\"so i started training ammar, with the notion that by the time i could fly all ammmmarr ships with level 4 skills they would fix gallente and i can keep flying the ships i've known and loved for the last 3+ years till the nerf. but no, months have ticked by and i looked up today.i can fly every single amaaaaaaaaaaaaaar ship in the game except capitals and i can use full tech 2 on both. but still not even a peep about 'fixing' gallente....k...so here i am, i love my blaster boats. charge up to an enemy, double web them to gumby in winter mode and lay down some justice!!!!. yeah that's how it used to be. now it's charge up to enemy slowly (mwd nerf) but fleets are still the same distance apart it seems! oh noes! so more of my precious capacitor is gone. finally get in range and 'ha ha!' i exclaim as i fire my web on that damn other bs going 800m/s he'll slow to 100 m/s like before! nope. he's still going 400 m/s. (webber nerf) so obviously i need a second web to get the same effect, np *opens eft and has 4 mids to work with* k, webber check, cap injector check, scram check, mwd 100mn check. \"hrm, seems i don't have enough slots.\" and can't take anything off, interesting.\"well i could work with the tacklers but warping around even once messes up any plan. i could take off my scram, but then he could just warp off. i can't take off my capa injector or i won't last more then 2 minutes in combat, of which 4 to 5 mintues will be spent mwding into the super close range. well i can throw that idea out the window :) even with 3 ccc rigs this thing gets a tad expensive whether hyper or mega. and when people see you going that close in, your going to get primaried into the stone age.i don't want this to come off as whiny, it's more of a 'well, i hope they take a look at it at least!' many people have brought this issue up before and it hasn't been addressed. hopefully with enough 'supports' csm will at least address the issue many of us seem to be having.as for me?i'm flying aaammmarr till it's fixed. do i like aarrmammar? not really, lasers are cool and all but i love the thump of a railgun tearing the air (that doesn't exist) in space like a giant... air.. ripping... device. with laz0rs i get to hit from 30km, and usually tear apart the megat's trying to close the gap long before they arrive. even with our similar 'close range fits'. so my ammamaamrmrrrr*hickup*rrars battleships, and such have my attention. i hope ccp will at least 'consider' fixing the gallente issues atm. and i hope the my beloved blaster boats get some loving :)till then tho...-amararrarrraaaaaaar victor!*laugh damn you, laugh!*"

"i'm guessing this was implemented to cut down on the server usage. to that extent, i do not support an implementation of the scanner that is using too much resources. that said, this delay seems to be only a temporary solution. it does not reduce the resource cost of each scan, only limits the rate at which any individual player can scan (i.e. 2 people scanning once every 2 seconds = 1 person scanning every second).i do, however, believe that the efficiency of the directional scanner could probably be improved. properly implemented, i see no reason why the directional scanner shouldn't simply be turned on/off (constant scan).i do support a more permanent fix to the directional scanners resource usage"

"issue: information warfare links, while not completely useless, are of far less attractiveness than armored, skirmish and siege warfare links. also, information warfare doesn't really suit gallente at all, as far as rp is concerned.-------------------solution: scrap iw links in favor of assault warfare links. these deal with damage application.assault warfare link - target leadingincreases all turret tracking by 2-3% (before skills/mindlinks/commandships)assault warfare link - gun drillincrease all turret falloff by 2-3% (before skills/mindlinks/commandships)assault warfare link - surrogate combatincrease all drone speed and tracking by 2-3% (before skills/mindlinks/commandships)-------------------q: why no optimal range link?a: because they would become pretty much mandatory for fleet fights, whereas all other gang links are only \"nice to have\"."
"nice idea, but only fair if the target leading and gun drill links would give a bonus to missile systems too.maybe a explosionradius/velocity boost?if there would be another set of assault links like those for missiles only nobody would fit them anyway probably because lolcalamari"

"i think it's ok that missiles not get a boost because, as it's been said above, it wouldn't be very \"gallente\". and it kinda falls in with the other races' links, since they too can have limited use on other races' ships (i.e. siege warfare links are pretty irrelevant for most non-caldari ships, excluding some minnie ships).at best, maybe target leading could be changed to giving a bonus to turret sig radius and missile explosion radius. in effect, it's still a boost to turret tracking, but it also helps missiles some."
"these seem interesting, but i'm not actually sure that they'd be any better than the information links are now. these provide a fairly small boost to a lot of ships, instead of a fairly big boost to a few ships, but neither one is going to be obsoleting damnations any time soon."
"a max-skilled eos pilot with mindlink would be giving a sniper bs fleet between 25 and 38% extra turret tracking with the target leading ganglink. that's a considerable bonus."
"yeah, that's the one most likely to see use. still though, it's nothing special - nowhere near as powerful as either of the resistance links, for example. and what about the other two links you propose? who would ever fit a falloff link besides maybe a solo sleipnir(and even then, they'd probably prefer shield resists or tackle range)? and the drone speed link is handy, but it's really nothing to write home about either. which of these is going to make the eos a viable fleet command ship?"
"currently, it is not more profitable to go to lowsec systems since you get killed by pirates pretty often. this annoys pirates because lowsec is often barren of targets, and deprives mission runners of exposure to other aspects of eve online since most of them stay in highsec.more mission runners will go to lowsec if the following changes (in no particular order) are implemented:1) tweak pve equipment to make it better at pvp, so that mission runners stand a fighting chance when they get attacked in-mission. (note: this is a bigger problem for drakes and ravens than for other ships fit for pve, and part of it is due to mission runners' insistence on using passive tanking drakes in low-sec instead of, say, harbingers.)2) tweak some level 4 missions so that, like level 5 missions, they need more than one player to easily complete. the mission runners will survive more because there will be more of them in the same mission, so pirates will have to fight two or more mission runners instead of just swarming one. often there are not enough pirates to take out two drakes at the same time, so the pirates will retreat and both mission runners will survive.3) make many missions have an npc that warps away. this will make mission runners carry warp scramblers or warp disruptors, which will make it more risky for pirates to attack them.4) substantially increase lowsec mission rewards. they should be increased beyond the loss incurred by doing a mission with your buddy and splitting the reward. so, a level 4 two-person mission should have more than double the current level 4 mission reward.5) leave some level 4 agents in highsec, but decrease the rewards. having a few level 4 highsec agents will allow mission runners who just bought their first battleship to be able to cover the cost of that battleship before having to go into lowsec. lowsec mission running will not be initially profitable till the mission runner learns to fend off pirates; if someone loses their first battleship in lowsec and cannot replace it they are less likely to go there in the future. even with lowsec rewards being increased, many mission runners will stay in highsec if the highsec rewards remain the same since they will still be profitable enough."
"thoughts:1) good luck, this is a balancing issue that could be a problem.2) again, good luck, the problem? here is that with mission running in general, except 5s, it is much more profitable and easier to solo than it is with groups. if ccp had intended for groups to be the main thing, they would have done that way before now. it seems that it isn't.3) no. 4) they have pretty much already done this5) already donewhat is the problem and why? its because if and when pirates find out that people are missioning in a certain system/area, they'll just constantly camp the area, making it useless for ppl to try and get in. this is a problem with low-sec in general tbh. only place i've seen exempt from this is certain caldari areas and lower domain. (due to the deliverance campaign)good ideas but its not enough."
"2) re-engineering missions to require groups will mainly be for the mission runners' safety, not so much to make level 4 mission running more of a co-operative (as opposed to an online single player) activity.3) in particular, having a warp disruptor will make it riskier to solo tackle a mission runner. often, one pirate will scan down and tackle a mission runner, and then ask his buddies in corp chat (or vent or whatnot) to help him out.right now, mission runners can choose to carry warp distruptors, but they still don't. not being able to be scrambled drastically decreases the risk for the often solo first tackler since he just warps away if he can't hold the mission runner till his buddies arrive.4, 5) these weren't done enough. mission runners can make 20 million isk/hour (at least the ones i've talked to claim this) doing high sec level 4 missions. motsu has a quality 18 level 4 agent (though the 9 sec status takes out a big chunk of his rewards). perhaps level 4 high sec missions could give rewards somewhere between level 3 and 2 lowsec agents (of course, these level lowsec agents will have increased rewards too).also, pirates would aggregate less if ccp further dissipated agents away from hubs. converting highsec space in general to lowsec could help this, as there wouldn't be enough pirates to roam it all.edit: added 2)"
"1. your amarr mission ship with dual rep is dying as fast as the passive fit drake. you might be able to hold the attacker while he is killing you. doesnt make you win anything.2. while i would appreciate that ... i think that role went to the level5 missions. for giggles my corp some times does lvl4s in hacs as a group. just to give it a bit more challenge. (not much though) also afs dont really get into sweat with lvl4s.3. that would require fixing npc warping mechanic in first place. atm they warp happily away even when warp scrambled. iirc they are not affected by any ewar atm. (except for sleepers)4. the reward *is* already much higher. i am not sure if boosting it even more wouldnt make it unbalanced.5. the current balance of lvl4 agents between highsec and lowsec is ok."

"the first round debate was really a good listen--hearing candidates speak about their ideas and their platforms and what they envision for csm offers a lot of insight into how seriously they take their candidacy and the job of csm delegate.as i stated in a discussion post on my blog today and in a previous post a week or so ago, i have a hard time taking any candidate seriously who's not making an effort to reach players by whatever means possible and tell us why we should vote for them.if you're a serious candidate and haven't gotten in touch with lumi to participate in csm round two on the planet risk show, why the hell not? get your ass in gear, man. prove you deserve a vote."

"i do not support the idea of permitting a name change. as has been previously stated, your name carries with it certain baggage, that should remain. even the notion of having a history that would include all name changes is flawed imo.i believe in the crime and punishment principle. if you create a character/or use a character to commit a crime ingame, then that crime should always directly be linked to that character name, not in the form of a history of name changes which can become quite convoluted.my two isk on the subject,"
"my first question is why? why do you need to be able to change your name? i mean i realize people have some downright stupid and/or offensive names, but it's not like they didnt have a choice when they signed up for them.so why is it necessary to support changing a character's name?"
"why do people do that? i've never understood."
"no, i will, because it is on a ******ed topic.here is why namechanges are not viable:1. i sucicide gank you in a raven, proving im not afraid to lose money to troll2. you remember my name and dock up whenever i enter system4. i change my name. my old name goes in some kind of list on my bio, but next time i enter system you dont notice because you dont check the bio of every single person in a system with 100+ people in it.5. i gank you againthere are a large number of people in this game who i would dock up if they entered system. its an upshot of their prior actions.even if you add names to some kind of list, the instant recognition will be gone, along with any consequences of prior actions.not supported!"

"this applies to all security status systems. i'm not sure what exactly made you think i was referring to high-sec.as for your painfully obvious pvp advice, it was not requested and is not relevant. \"make sure you are prepared for anything at all times, m'kay\"by your logic we may as well disable all forms of warp disruption inside deadspaces as well."

"woo support for this idea because i think it is awesome and would benefit the eve online community."
"not supported.currently missions are a very solid and steady source of income for people whose friends either aren't online, or don't exist. your proposed change would make them more dynamic, sure. but it would also make it impossible to plan for what you'll be running into (making specific damage-type hardeners totally useless in nearly all facets of the game), extraordinarily likely that your ship will be killed, another pointless extension of pvp (really what is the difference between missions and pvp if the npcs act and fit exactly like players in pvp?), and no longer viably soloable.very very against something which takes a unique (albeit a little bit boring) part of the game and makes it exactly like something that already exists, as well as being against something which completely shuts out of the game anyone who happens to be going it solo at the time and actually wants to fight, and not just shoot a rock for 5 hours."
"i like this idea. i like it a lot. there's some changes i might want to make, though. for one, don't make the mission board agent-by-agent, make it corp-by-corp. for example, say that the caldari navy offers missions in forge, citadel, lonetrek, and black rise. they're heavy combat and large in number. you want to work a cn mission, you look up the cn mission board, and filter it - \"okay, missions where i meet the standings requirement, within two jumps...17 hits. sort by lp payout...ooh, that one looks nice. damn, lowsec. okay, guess i'll do that one instead.\" have missions update regularly(like, every few minutes, not just at downtime), and players can claim missions just like they do now. this will naturally make lowsec/faction-shoot/other annoying mission types balanced, since they'll be taken less often and thus it'll be more valuable ones that are left. similarly, i think the balance point for npcs should be that they are equal to min-skill human players with t1 gear. stop npc cheating, make them use the same stuff we use at the same effect. this might make each individual npc laggier, but there should be enough fewer of them to make that not actually negatively affect performance. ideally, there'd be enough fewer to let npcs actually use drones below l5 missions, which should make gallente play a bit less stupidly with these rules. from there, make npcs actually fit their ships with real gear, not just random stat effects. a npc blackbird might have one t1 jam of each type, a sensor booster with range script, and an afterburner - and they'll have actual aggro mechanics, so they point those jams at the player they feel to be the most dangerous. a l4 guristas mission might have a couple of those, a couple rr osprey, a couple ogre-spewing gilas, a rattlesnake, a drake, and a few frigs to tackle, and it'd expect you to bring probably 3-4 players to fight it. the rattlesnake and gilas will have higher than minimum skills, and will have chances of dropping fancy gear(good chance of named, low chance of faction), whereas the other stuff will have minimum skills, and a chance of named gear dropping(faction-shoot missions will replace faction ships with t2 ships - the same mission vs caldari rats might have a widow, a gang-linked vulture, and a basilisk as high-end rats instead). as with the original proposal, it'll only drop gear that actually showed up in its stats when you were fighting it. as for the objections that they won't be soloable, that seems easy enough to fix. go back to the old-school definitions of mission levels - l3s are intended to be soloable, l4s are not. jack up the rewards so that l3s are at least close to current l4 rewards, though - i don't want to nerf solo missioners too badly. but still, this is an mmo, it should encourage gang work. similarly, make l5s actually scary - those carrier rats sure as hell can't be killed with a solo nighthawk, they're genuine carriers, 1.5m ehp and all. if you want to do l5s sanely, you should need several players, including capital ships. give us some actual high-end content for pve that doesn't require 0.0 exploration. i'm sympathetic to arguments about soloers, and i want to see their lifestyle remain viable, but i'm completely cool with knocking down what they do to lower levels as long as it doesn't bugger up the income streams too much. in any case, yes, something in this vein is desperately needed."
"if you read the linked suggestion and not the reduct (that sound reasonable) you will notice that he has no idea how to balance mission risk and rewards and that, to cite his words \"i don't see how balance has anything to do with it, the end sum should be able to cover each and every ones ability to fight, they can decide what missions they want to attempt and there will be plenty to go round.\"his suggested system will give 0 information to the one doing the mission. the briefing will be something like:\"go and take that hill\"\"who is the enemy?\"\"some insurgent, from 1 to 10.000, maybe some enemy regular troop, perhaps some gun emplacement.now go, you have your orders.\"while the current system give too much information thank to the point by point description of every mission, his system will go too much in the opposite way. with his \"lego\" suggestion you could have one mission where the target is in the first room of a multi room dungeon and you need only to kill 2-3 ships to get a 10 million reward while the next mission will push you in the equivalent of ae with all the ships in the first room and instant aggro with a reward of 1 million.the autobalancer would be incapable of matching missions success and rewards and the suggested system will have practically random rewards for what you do. his suggestion is to move from a broken mechanic to another broken mechanic, only in the different direction. to work a system like this will require the equivalent of a real military briefing (one where, like in reality, the information cold be wrong or insufficient) but i really doubt that cc can implement it without a lot of work. and naturally the old \"npc should have fitting like ours\" problem. fitting like ours require more server power and more coding. it can be lazy but ccp don't want to devote that kind of resources to pve."
"i've yet to see a big, long, detailed proposal of any sort on the forums that made me truly with how the idea was to be implemented. i include ones i have written myself in that. the bigger and more complex an idea is, the more pitfalls there are to it, the more qa work it'll need, the longer it'll take to balance, all that fun stuff. after a certain point - and this proposal is far beyond that point - i generally start to care less about detail work and more about the big picture. you're right, his system has some real holes in it, but they seem less relevant to me. they're the sort that will get fixed along the way, i think. as for the \"fitting like ours\" thing, we currently have a big mission spawn 20-30 ships at a time. with fits like ours, you might get a fifth of that, because a bs won't be doing 80 dps any more. i don't know whether it'd ultimately be more or less work for the hamsters, but an 80% reduction in number of ships allows for a pretty hefty increase in complexity without actually upping server stress at all. remember, we're talking about a game that fairly routinely puts a thousand people on one grid at one time, and while the lag from that is awful, a lot of the problem there comes from everyone being on one grid. even if npcs are exactly as much server strain as players after this change(which they won't be, no networking needs), putting 20 players on grid doesn't break anything. i'm no server-room guy, but it doesn't seem obviously insane to me."
"there seems to be a lot of controversy in new eden over the role of smartbombs. though i came up with this idea independently, i'm not the first to suggest that a cpu driven module like smartbombs could use sripts to give them a wider array of use.rather than fixing the weakness of smartbombs with a module range, or damage adjustment that will surely have divided sentiments across the community, why not just introduce 5-10 scripts to grant them what they really need: versatility. a assault frigate is not going to use smartbombs in the same way that a capital ship, or mining vessel is going to, so load a script like you would your ammo type to deal with issues like:friendly firedrone onlyextended/limited rangestructural damagekamikaze pilotingi only hope that ccp can invent something like this soon and drop them on the market with dominion."

"while i understand the desire to fix the deeper things of this game (internal mechanics and such), there are a few problems with this:* ccp worked hard on a patch a few expansions ago that fixed 100 of the most reported bugs, and oveur could count the number of positive responses he got on one hand and have fingers left over.* new players are attracted by the bigger, news-making mechanics of the game. while bug fixes are a constant struggle, a whole expansion dedicated them would probably draw people away from the game.i'm not saying it's bad to fix these aspects of the game, but that the method ccp is using right now is best. they're fixing one major mechanic per patch while releasing new content."

"velocity prime i agree 100% with kirana.... love the corp name! let's see... i'm on the open ocean in a sailboat, i find some \"stuff\" just floating there, and as i'm picking it up another boat comes by and says \"hey, that is mine 'cause i made it.\" international rules: first one there owns it.they take you to maritime court. court says: \"first one there owns it\". other boat's owner is royally poed: \"it ain't fair\"me: \"get over it.\"worried about ninjas? bring along a friend who knows how to salvage, quickly and efficiently and safely, at the same time that you're generating all those lovely wrecks.kirana, i've been giving some thought to your idea of a \"safer\" safe haven for light industry. it might work, but the same issues would apply once a newer player like me begins to move out into the colder, crueler, wider world. same issues, just delayed.besides, \"ganking\" and \"piracy\" are just as common in rl as in gl. ask anyone in a commercial or private ship traveling off of east africa or through any indonesian shipping lane.rl or gl, it happens. plan, adjust, strategize, prepare... and if need be bring along friends with guns."
"sure, but the difference is in the distinction between piracy off the coast of long beach california vs piracy passing the somali coast. i haven't seen many news reports of pirates ganking ships coming out of seattle or tokyo.and yes, the same conditions would exist outside the \"safer space\", but that's the point. we wouldn't remove the conditions that currently exist, because they are realistic. we would just shift them to a position that accentuates the realism. you go outside the hight security population centers and you are fair game. but that's where the money is. and yah, from time to time there will be a high sec heist. just not these constant arbitrary ganks of noobs and low isk soft targets. in my eys they hinder the game. the longer it takes some noob to build up enough to actually be worth killing, the longer they take to add value. not to mention how many of them quit before they every make it. character judgments aside, it's a waste of everyone's time. eve can and should be a brutal place. but is making it brutal from end to end really the best way?it's more about diversifying eve and less about protecting anyone. that is really just a side effect. the more similar the rules and conditions are throughout the game, the more homogenous and boring it can be. because then people will have the tendency to aggregate into limited areas and play the entire game within a few jumps of that area. you just have to look at jita or rens or any market hub to see that. too many just hang out there.the usual argument against my sort of thinking is that if we create a safer space, everyone will just stay there and there won't be anyone to hunt outside of the safe space. but i don't think that would be the case at all. there will be some that will be true for. but i think the majority will venture out and penetrate every area. and besides, it would be \"safer\" not safe.i would also redistribute missions. move most of the combat missions outside of the safer zones. because one would imagine that the factional navy of that space wouldn't need mercs to patrol their core space for them. but they would in the outer reaches where there are less patrols. add more freight run missions that go out. etc. etc.on you salvage scenario... that's not really a ninja situation, if i am reading you right. if someone abandons salvage, even to go swap ships, then it's abandoned. ninja to me is when you are there salvaging your wrecks, or still killing them, and someone comes and salvages you.again, i don't think this should be banned. but i do think i should be able to shoot you. but it sounds like ccp ruled on that. i'd be curious to know their thinking behind it. it's hard to know their mind sometimes."
"well done kirana.... now i get it! excellent comparison using the geography. it sometimes takes a while but i can, usually, get there. i'm not sure if ccp would go with it, but the idea might have merit with the following as suggested \"add-ons\":those who choose to reside in these \"safer\" safe havens get clear notice that they are inhabiting \"safer\" safe havens... step outside and nobody will be remotely interested in any boo-hoo-hoos.there is no such thing as a free lunch. want the higher level of safety, then you register with an npc in that safe haven and pay a substantially higher tax to offset the cost of the protection.for the salvaging / ninja topic.... apologies for being unclear! when i salvage for team members i am as close to the action as i can safely manuever the salvager, doing everything possible to clear wrecks asap without getting blown up. ruins my day, that and i get no end of joking from my team.kinda tough to get ninja salvaged.... as long as i'm not supplying one of the wrecks. fly safe."
"yeah, i am not looking to make gallente fotm although it would be nice ccp has been systematically nerfed gallente ships over the last 3 years and that must stop. my vote goes to the candidate who is willing to protect gallente ships from further nerfing and put all the balancing issues affecting gallente in the agenda (blaster boats, diemost, sleepers hate of drones, helios model , etc)"
"the last 2 surveys have been a great success, but there is still far more to learn, and far more questions to ask.in the first survey, ship ballancing scored high in the question of what ccp should be focussing on, and i'd like to know more about where the balancing is needed according to you, the players.the questions will be pretty general, giving me a guideline to work with. from there on i can better determine where and how i need to get more specific.please take a moment to fill in this survey, and let everybody know what you feel needs to change in terms of ship balancing herethank you.-aynen"

"that might fit into cosmos, certainly not the eve client.there is a balance that needs to be achieved. survey tools could be very very immersion-breaking. in general i don't think that surveys are worth doing on a regular basis as people will become apathetic to them."
"there is another way to study accurately what the players want which might be used. since ccp can see what people do on their servers, they have loads of statistics about player behavior, those statistics could be usefull to the csm too if they get access to them. unfortunately the risk of apathy towards surveys is real, but for now it's the best tool at my disposal and i plan to run it into the ground."

"lv5 skills used:zealot has 0 drones and 5 guns (276 dps, scorch, 1039.5pg/5 slots used, 34+5 range)ishtar has 5 drones and 3 guns (475 dps no guns, 0pg/slots used, 85km drone range, sentries do similar damage)quit crying you sack of sh*t, till heavy drones take power grid and slots, your argument is completely stupid. the ishtar doesn't have to fit a single thing to worry about damage while the zealot needs to sacrifice 3 low slots to compare to the ishtar's damage. also gunboats have to worry about tracking when something gets too close too, the zealot can't track any kind of frigate that tackles it up close while the ishtar can neut the **** out of it and sic drones on it.the only change that should be done to the deimos is another medium slot for a web and maybe one less high slot in exchange."

"hail, eft warrior for the win.you do realise that what looks good in eft dont necessarily mean its gonna be useful in battle?1: heavy drones require 80-100 seconds (and that is with drone navigation lvl5) to travel 85km to target. i can align and escape in a frieghter 5 times in 100 seconds. a sniper that actually requires 80 seconds to touch its target? lol.2: sentry drone is instant but only curator hits to 70km and its the worst damage sentry,a sniper hac can easily hit 100km and laugh at the sentry as a stationary sentry is just completely incapable of chasing down any thing. 3. same old argument: you can destroy drones(easily), you cannot destroy someone's turrent. 4. a drone boat cannot agro anyone at station or gate in low-sec otherwise its byebye omfpwned drones. and that is 95% of the battle in low-sec cannot be fought in a ishtar.and, your argument just fails: a 85km sniper is never a good sniper, let alone it rely on drones to \"snipe\", lol.neither is calling someone a bag of whatever add any weight to your argument, if you have any sort of argument in the first place. which is, a big fat no.-nafiy"

"as you may be aware, ccp plan to dramatically improve the 0.0 experience with the dominion patch.players will have the opportunity to drop billions of isk on fun sovereignty charges, and will really enjoy spending even more to upgrade space so that the limit on how many players a system can support can be around 10-12.further, isk returns from activity may in some cases reach 80% of level 4 mission rates in empire.empire players you are missing out on all the fun.high sec needs to be boosted in the same way.give the high sec corps the same enjoyment from paying a few hundred million a month to earn the right to dock in jita.lets give mission runners the chance to pay regular fees to set a limit of 15 pilots missioning in motsu.also, lets limit payout to the more enjoyable rate enjoyed by anomaly rats in 0.0 (about 70% of belt rat bounties).if 0.0 is getting this huge boost, then empire pos owners should also have the chance to be forced to pay for happy-fun upgrades so that they too can enjoy 2 extra anomalies in system.for too long, empire players have suffered under risk free generation of limitless missions, and have been deprived of the opportunity to pay arbitrary rent to faceless beaureaucrats.people of empire!claim your birthright! demand the same buffs that 0.0 players are receiving with this patch!"
"why yes deldrac, this is a fine proposal which i support wholeheartedly, you handsome lovable rogue you."
"as per the recent blog, it appears to be a widely held view that none of the proposed resource upgrades will have anything like the power of a single level 4 agent, and that people will be drawn towards increased highsec mission running to support the new maintenance bills. in particular, it is difficult to see how any one system could support the activities of 100-150 people, which was apparently ccp's stated goal.thus, for systems with suitable upgrades anchored, i propose unlocking npc agents (at pre-existing outposts) as the system's military index increases, starting with level 1 and eventually reaching level 5 as more missions are completed."
"i can support this, if ccp would introduce a way for people to actually run these agents in the space they hold.chances are, if you've been living in 0.0, the local pirate agents wont like you very much"
"shouldn't be difficult, make the agents employees of the sov holder, and spawn mission encounters in systems with that sov.ccp have said that creating agents in the first place is 'hard'tm, but as they've made clear doing anything useful is also out of the question, and as they are desperate to make missions the only viable source of individual isk in the game, they are left with this as their only choice."
"i'd support a similar idea - instead of having you run missions for the local pirates import agents from pirate factions hostile to them.as an example: lets say you were constantly butchering blood raider rats in belts, eventually this brings angel cartel and serpentis agents to your outposts (the factions blood raiders mostly send you against in missions) to subvert their influence, which allows you to run missions for them in your space. this allows and rewards people to continue ratting (the more you rat the bigger and better the agents get) while making mission running a viable option.i have no idea how this would work for drone space."
"first option that comes to mind - have a military-based upgrade, where if you have military x, you can hire level x agents at your outpost. you have a choice of 2-3 factions, based on region, and choice in agent type. agents will cost money for upkeep, and a lot of money at higher levels(l4-l5 should be measured in billions a month). no cap on agents, but each one costs individually - if you want to pay triple the cash for 3 l4 combat agents, so you can have mission selection, go for it. this doesn't need to be the system used, of course. anything that allows big population densities(100+ online in a system, not fighting) is fine by me, and i don't much care if it's by upgrading a system to having a couple l4 agents or by having 60 belts, with an effective truesec of -2, and quadruple faction/officer rat spawn rates. but it needs to be able to support population densities at least within hailing distance of highsec for any of the other stuff to work sensibly. i'm fine with cynojammers costing an arm and a leg, but the systems are going to need to be able to earn those arms and legs reasonably. i'm no 0.0 expert, but i don't see how that is supposed to be the case in the current proposal."
"i believe they talked about this or answered a short question regarding this on fanfest, could be wrong though.good idea anyway"
"nothing more to say."
"atleast make somethin that may benefit holders of space even though small their members will actually use the agents. i would also go so far as to say a 1% tax on all mission rewards go to holder alliance. but atleast these agents would be useful =)"
"ok, the cries from pvpers about a upgrade that will require people to do pve would be fun. even more when they will be required to protect them \"for the good of the alliance\". /supportedseriously, it is a good option, but from my experience in 0.0 most pvpers will simply ate on first sight those using the agents in 0.0."
"they won't eat their own and might tolerate others too, if some of their income gets taxed to the wallet of the sov holder. something that might happen with the implementation of contracts between corps and alliances. even in the worst case they might be treated more like cattle. they would be tolerated and protected, since the income they provide allows pvp people to focus on other things.even though i'm not a fan of missions, they are so convenient and lucrative, that for a combat oriented character it is a very good option to have even if you have other income sources. not to mention, taht pvp doesn't just happen and you don't always have the time or inclination for it, so you need other activities to keep people from getting bored. making some decent money while doing it certainly wouldn't hurt either."
"/signedi support this proposal, as it would create additional taxable income for alliances and reduce the need for high-sec alts.however, i would love to hear some thoughts on how this idea would work out with regards to low-sec mission hubs and npc 0.0.imho low-sec, npc 0.0 and 0.0 with sov should retain (or get?) clearly separated roles in the game and this proposal would eliminate one of the central differences between them..."
"i'll support the idea based on the principle but the fact is ccp will take many detours just to avoid this because their current system is heavily reliant upon there being real stations in the area. however, i will not go into further details about this. instead let me just say, ccp shrug as soon as someone mentions it.some day soon we might see this happen but only if there is enough room for them to squeeze it in side by side with another \"simple\" feature.in reality (afaik), there is nothing simple about it!"
"a few more thoughts:this would be more of a constellation-wide upgrade, as missions often involve moving around a bit. it would make sense for agents only to appear once sov has been held across an entire constellation for a considerable length of time, so that people are not sent out behind enemy lines.it would also involve coming up with a means of dynamically generating agents, which are currently static, and avoiding complications arising from agents disappearing or being downgraded after reduced activity (i.e. it would need to happen slowly enough for people to have time for their missions to be completed or to expire naturally).courier missions would be out of the question, as there's no guarantee that people running them would have the required docking rights. mining & market-based missions would make a decent substitute."
"yeah voting for the win"
"noif you want agents go to npc space. or go to empire."
"/supported. this is one of the upgrades that should be done. and done quickly."
"totally supporting this. plz dont tell us that it wont work. you already have agents in space. what the db issue with just getting some more into 0.0?"
"agents are the only \"major\" income source that is taxable by corporations in this game that allow population scaling; if they want diffuse active sources of income (as stated by one devblog), this is the main goal they should strive for."
"do it.do it."
"id like 0.0 as a place where you can attract neutral agents to your outposts who can give you unique ships like the fury, styx, ixion, swordspine, medusa etc.i don't think the mechanic should rely on upgrades though and alliances should be able to take away agents from one another and/or damage outposts to stop the agent missions temporarily/permeantely."
"if ccp allow me to run level 4 missions from alliance outposts id actually move back to 0.0 again.however, rather then locking people out by automatically assigning this or that faction or by allowing an alliance to pick a single faction to have agents from they should let players communicate with their existing agents from inside the outposts, the level of agent you can talk to would depend on the infrastructure level.this will allow all alliance members to move back to 0.0 to run missions there without adding new problems related to everyone's standings, it allows for a nearly unlimited number of alliance members to generate isk per star system owned, this increases activity in 0.0 allowing for more pvp."
"so were just giving up and admitting null sec corps= carebears?"
"please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
"these changes are pretty cool."
"don't forget that for each mission runner running solo there is a pocket with those 20-30 ships shooting at that mission runner.so for a system with 30 players each running a pocket it grows to 600 - 900 npc's shooting at them.in my proposal there will be a set number of missions active at the same time, many of those missions will have more than one person in each pocket either working as a team or trying to beat each other to the objective(s). less missions actively running means even more room for cpu cycles.you didn't read the first post in the thread i assume. there is a sample of what the briefing should look like. and that sample is just that, a sample.that particular sample was written to highlight the exploration concept, the one type of mission where you would need a scanner ship to find the enemy and carefully assess the situation before going in guns blazing.so your statement about my \"system giving 0 information\" is incorrect and all you are managing to accomplish here is being an ass about my idea.if one gang of 10 players manage to do one mission that nets them 200 million isk and that takes them 2 hours to complete they share 20 million isk each. that is quite possible what the average mission runner makes today. (10 million per hour)now, if another gang of 10 players do 10 missions that each reward 20 million and they are done in the same time (two hours) then the net effect is that each member gained 20 million over 2 hours.it is up to each and every gang/player to decide if they can do the mission or not. some players will have less skills and experience and might settle for the less rewarding missions, but every once in a while they will encounter a mission that rewards them greatly for something quite trivial and sometimes they might be underpaid. that's all part of the dynamic system. you have to do your research before you embark on your mission instead of just hitting undock, warp to the mission, activate your tank and wait for your drones or fof missiles to do the job for you.edit: whoops...edit 2:if the rewards are imbalanced ccp can easily adjust some figures in the mission generator as opposed to the current mechanic where they have to re-balance many different missions."
"yeah srry dude, i might have answered a bit bitter but the fact is that mission in its current state is the best isk making way in eve. and that in the safety of empire and still are people not happy about it. i understand its dull after running the 2000st mission with a heavly faction pimped cnr. u should try some plexes in 0.0 they are good fun to do..."
"you are so enamoured of you presentation that don't see the flaws. as herschel pointed out and as it was said several times in the linked thread, you have overdone it, drowning the good point in a lot of useless jabber.about your comment: computer generate briefing for a lego mission will not work decently!you really think that a briefing with: \"ours guy were slaughtered by [insert npc group in mission], they had [insert descriptive work from some/several/a few] [insert ship class] [both depending from mission composition]. find them in [insert bookmark]\" will be really useful? or it will end like you suggest in the thread with people jumping in noob frigates to see the enemy?then look what you suggested as a possible briefing:- blood raiders- have killed a paladin- search for them starting at point xwow, informative. you see, you should scrap that thread and keep only the reduced version in this thread, it is way better than your lengthy presentation.to repeat it again, seeing how ccp work, complex lego structure like the one you suggest will not work. to much different parts to join together to make a mission. the end result will be a frankenstein monster.a functional system should have more variables that the current one, but can't have so many that it will become uncontrollable. you, as most people trying to balance missions, are trying to balance them only around old pilots doing level 4 with ships worth several hundred millions at least, forgetting that they should be doable by new players too. it is almost granted that mission done with your system will kill new players mopst of the tiem.sigh, you again show total disregard about how balancing work with a absurd example.first, even the simple act of warping to 10 different missions will eat enough time to make very hard to do them in 2 hours;second, your proposed system has no controls to avoid easy missions with high payout;third, 10 players running the same mission. wow refugee? i don't want to have to assemble a damned 10 players gang every time i want to run a mission. if i assemble 10 players is for something different and it require preparation.making 10 man raids the norm is the worst thing you can do to this game. scrapping mission totally will be less destructive."
"i understand, no worries. i too agree that missions are way biased in terms of risk vs reward and the potential they have of slinging out massive rewards in contrast to other activities in eve. that is the sole reason why i suggest that missions will actually kill the runner if he's not paying attention. going in with a cookie cutter setup cnr will only amount to them losing that ship.in other words, they are expected to lose ships once in a while and the rewards therefore will not be as great as before all things considered.what makes you so sure this is exactly how it's going to be?also, thanks for the constructive suggestion. that being, allow the npc's to pod you if you show up on their doorstep.those missions that will get you kill will also allow you to warp in with a cloaked ship such as a covert ops and assess the situation.the only missions that will have acceleration gates are the ones that are as easy as the current level 4 missions but they will have the crappiest rewards and the npc's in there will have a bunch of fail-fits. those missions are what you might refer to:* go in and kill all targets in the deadspace area.* return with the objective.for everything else, while it may take a lot of testing and fine tuning, there will be nicely constructed briefings that give you just enough information to not be killed in the mission. if the mission is to assess the situation the briefing will tell you to assess the situation, if you don't then you didn't want that ship anyways.it's good that you have an opinion about what i really meant but i can tell you this much... i don't agree with what you are insinuating about me.the only thing i had in mind as for who can run these missions was that no matter what you fly, you will be killed in it eventually if you don't take the necessary steps to prevent it from happening.there will be super difficult missions and there will be super easy mission to pick from in the pool. if new players pick the difficult versions they might be able to complete them with real skills.in the current mechanic the npc's are at a set difficulty per mission. new players attempting attack of the drones for example will quickly learn that killing the initial 4 cruiser sized drones will get them killed. so they won't do that next time and now they can finish that mission perfectly every time.then they get worlds collide, which they will die in if they don't have enough tanking skills no matter what they do.in the new system they get a chance to (with some experience) avoid getting killed. especially since subscribing to a mission isn't the same as accepting one in the current system. if they decline a mission they accepted in the current system they lose standings. they don't want that."
"it is a very simple solution. we know ccp is monitoring player activity in the system now anyway to determine eligibility for upgrades. why not use this activity to reduce the upkeep paid? more activity = less upkeep. this way we solve multiple problems in one fell swoop:- no difficulty in taxation of players, since their activity indirectly pays for the upgrades by reducing their cost- players who are not part of the alliance that has sovereignity still contribute, solving cva's problem amongst others- it will still prevent afk empires by having those alliances without activity pay the full amount"
"i'm supporting this after reading the latest devblog about ccps solution to allow more people to make a living in 0.0. my preferred solution would be to provide more rewards and activities, that actually allow much more people to make a full time living in 0.0. this solution won't affect that, but would help to convince alliances to be more tolerant to small operators in their area, so it might be a good thing regardless what happens with the infrastructure upgrades."
"i like this proposal. it'd address a lot of the concerns going around - not nearly all, but enough to be worth doing."
"when i read the title, i thought you were suggesting more activity=more upkeep.....i like your idea"
"it's a start."
"after reading the latest dev blog about sov upgrades it is nice to see we have a development team so out of wack with our community and how 0.0 works we get idiotic ideas like this? was it that hard to buff the rat bounties and remove cruiser and below spawns? 0.0 systems will not hold anywhere near the 50-100 people the dev have been spouting but i guess someone who never actually played the game wouldn't know this....."
"/signedfix the price!!"
"obvious issue is obvious."
"in agreement with every other 0.0 pilot on this."
"well done ccp what an epic fail! theres now way they can actualy play this game & come up with what they have"
"fully agreed.and finally nerf that truesec **** in 0.0. boost the ore values of 0.0, boost the rat spawns, at least get rid of the plex-bounties in 0.0 plexes and anomalies. the current hub is a joke."
"as a 0.0 nomad, i am looking forward to seeing less sovereignty and more wild/free space in my null sec wanderings. i do not think this is a bad thing."
"so for an alliance to hold sov in 20 systems, they need only pay for 100 towers - as if this isn't completely within their means. if titans showed anything, it's that isk is never a barrier to entry, so why is the only requirement for holding lots of empty space a bill in the wallet every 2 weeks? in addition, if i sneak into someone's space and do their plexes they benefit by keeping their infrastructure levels intact. denial of activity is not achieved solely through force of arms. having in effect carebear wars would introduce a new aggression dynamic to how people interact. to that end i propose the following changessystems to have a minimum activity requirement to hold sovactivity to count only if done by the alliance or party subject to treatyonce this is in place some thought could also be given to this proposal."
"no, alliances should not be made to have activity in that area if they want to hold sov, that's ******ed"
"well i will second wat jpnwobigheadz is saying , mainly because he is correct about the drones being hit and miss with drones mining large rocks actually mine them and the drones do cause lag mainly when they r being pulled back to ship"
"no, and how exactly does an aoe module only effect certain targets?"
"the ships computers manage to convert capacitor energy into a pulse that doesn't damage the bombers ship (hence the smart); is it so far fetched that, (perhaps with the assistance of an additional low-power module,) that the pulse could be stabilized or directed to omit fleet members?i'll admit that a \"hostiles only\" script would be going too far, but would anyone actually object to scripts that would trade range for damage, or reduce cycle-time at the cost of self-damage (kamikaze)?smartbombs, as they are, play an extremely narrow role and the small and medium sized modules are close to useless. rather than just universally boosting their range or power, wouldn't you rather see some minor customization, a smidjin of versatility added? - i think that scripts would be perfect, even if it took a low-slot module to load them into."
"i support the idea of scripts that load into the sb for- more range, less dps- less range, more dps- kamikaze (more dps + self damage)the other ones would be too imbalancing, and would make the bombs actually \"smart\". the name is more of a euphemism tbh..."
"smartbomb's role is to destroy drones, or if you're in jita, to kill you. every carrier and sc fits smartbombs for anti-drones, it's what they're used for. the only drones that smartbombs will relatively not effect are sentries (since they don't move obviously) and fighter bombers (they orbit just outside t2 smartbomb range)."
"smartbombs are just fine the way they are. if you're using them as an offensive mechanism, then you're most likely doing it wrong. they're to defend against drones and little ***** frigs that are right up in your face.also, if you want to talk rp rather than game mechanics, smartbombs exclude you from taking damage by creating the energy pulse outside your ship. the blast isn't somehow programmed to not damage you... it never comes in contact with you. it's an aoe weapon and that's what it's for. don't ask ccp to change it just because your fc gets mad at you for being careless. just stop being careless."
"i think it is unrealistic that in empire, market upkeep is free. who runs the markets behind the stations, the databases, etc? just like how they imposed taxes on npc corporations for payment to concord for policing etc, sales in empire should have a sales tax. it doesnt have to be exorbitant. and make it smaller as security status goes lower, until in 0.0, the player run sovereignty holders can choose how much the tax is, where it goes, etc. this would help encourage the sandbox approach by encouraging both 0.0 empires & empire industrialists to interact and cooperate in order to prosper. hauling will become more lucrative & necessary, both 0.0 alliances and empire traders/industrialists will be rewarded by working together, and it will open the way for all sorts of interaction, instead of just the machine-like, monotonous \"take it to jita and sell it\".perhaps this could even open the way for actual financial statement presentation for 0.0 empires, to account for where their taxes are spent on. an empire that is open and seemingly more trustworthy would attract more empire industrialists to trade in their markets, because they would know (or think they know) what their taxes are spent on. profit will be had both for empire industrialists & 0.0 nations to work together, and it will create a tougher economic situation for those that choose not to work with the rest of the universe."
"npc stations have a sales tax and a broker fee."
"should really put a corp tax on the npc corps while you are at it.11%?"
"god damn, ccp managed to implement this even before i was able to click the support button.that was impressive ccp!"

"1st of all, i'm strongly disagree on a state, that the new players are attracted by the new expansions. the expansions are the thing, that keep the old players, who got the experience in the game and bored. i remember the time, when i first got to eve - and thats not an expansion, what brought me here, i just searched the elite remake and found the article about eve. the main question is not why i tried eve, but why i stayed in this game.the first is - noobs were wanted in this game by older players, by their corporations and alliances. frigs were needed in the fleets, you were equal amongst the others when you just entered the game, no matter on skills you have and ships you can fly. when the t1 frigs and cruisers will be declined in fleets - we would have a serious problem with a new players stay in game. (assault ab boost is bad). the second thing is expansions, yes, but not every expansion made me happy, and there were several times, when i was about quitting the game - guess why? loosing ships in lags and bugs. the issues grows in every expansions we have, and the longer we wait the more problems we have, so there could be a critical mass, that no one could overcome. as for the positive responses for a bug fixing, well, thats what people are, they just take it as it suppose to be, since its a bugs, and therefore dev mistakes. they never says thanks for that. as it said in \"the laws of online world design by raphael koster\": i don't say, that the big content expansions are bad, i just want them with no haste and polished."

"thank you for your efforts on this diedra. your efforts to get information on all the candidates out to the voters is much appreciated.i also would have liked to add responses to my answers in order to clarify my positions. overall you had a good variety of questions. i would not have minded a few more. regards-ahs"
"i have news for you my friend.aaron, aaron cares for the carebearsgather your carebear friends and point them here. all of empire carebears unite under one banner.aaron mission statementcheck it out."
"now that is what i am talking about! exactly. right now people whine mostly because it's so ambiguous. there are thoughts about why things are the way they are but not much in the way of fact. granted it's usually noobs whining but then that triggers all manner of counter whining and bla bla bla... but your second point is the real deal. that is the sort of balance i am talking about. safer doesn't mean easier or free. it just means that, among the things you have to deal with, the constant threat of gank isn't one of them. and when you get tired of paying for your safety, get bored of mining veldspar, or feel like you are ready for the big boy game, you can go outside the bubble. meanwhile the big players who are moving serious money around inside the bubble still have to worry. because, even with the higher security, it might still be worth ganking them.another thought i had to go along with the safe zones is some system of licensing to mine. along with it making more sense for the factional government to protect it's citizens in the core systems, it would also make sense that resources wouldn't be free. different grades of mining licenses would allow carebears to mine safely but at a price. i was thinking of a mid slot module that loads script like licenses that get burned on a cycle. different script types for different lasers and maybe even different ore types. a couple examples would be a standard laser grade veldspar license or a strip laser grade scordite license. module isn't running, lasers don't work. refining tax is separate from this since that goes to the station corp. these fees are applied by the root faction. can flipping would still be in play. as much as i think can flipping is a cheesy tactic, it's still a well designed mechanic that makes sense as it. there is a counter that prevents it and if you choose not to counter it, i.e. not to jet can mine, then at least you have the option to attack the flipper."
"and who would that be? i didn't see anyone listed on the csm candidate page who is a member of eve university."

"there were reports that mr zastrow was using his csm delegate status to bring confidential information to his corporation and/or alliance which got an unfair advantage with the upcoming dominion changes.afaik this particular case was about the new outpost system and how it will be much harder to take them and they will be very beneficial to the sov holders."
"then it's a shame he didn't tell us it was going to cost infinity isk per day to hold them."

"supported, but i'd like my logistics alt to not have to wait outside a gate before re-entering into my mission system after remote repping me in a neighboring system during a mission. however, i think the moderate inconvenience that your proposal would cause in my scenario is far better than the current game mechanics."
"blaster problems, in my view:(1) a problem with all sub-bs ship fitting and bonuses.on all ships, there is one type of blaster worth fitting: the neutron blaster. everything else, and you do not in fact have that significant damage advantage over other weapon systems up close (making blasters pointless). this is a problem, because all sub-bs ship (bar mega) cannot fit neutron blasters without fitting mods and paper ehp.this results in a line of ships which are worthless at ranges they're supposed to dominate at, namely point blank, excepting the odd drone ship.take the brutix: the only way you'll get a bc which has a damage advantage up close is by fitting neutrons, 3 mfs and a shield tank. as a result, you get a paper-thin ship which even when it does get to its optimal range (aside from horribly dying to anything smaller then it) dies to proper bcs which can in fact gank and tank at the same time.myrmidon works much the same way, although gets a better (passable generally) tank in return for a smaller dps advantage over its opponents up close. it also has a, for pvp purposes, stupid active rep bonus. for solo work, low dps is a horrible idea, for gang work active repping is generally a bad choice on top of low dps being a horrible idea.frigates are plagued with split weapon systems or being tier 2 in case of incursus. thorax is plagued by inability to fit buffer and neutrons. vexor is good because drones plus small guns work on the ship, thanks to the dps output of the bonused 75m3 drone combination.diemost is a 110 million thorax. it also suffers from ******ed fitting, not to mention that the idea of a point blank hac is probably bad anyway.astarte has all the brutix problems, again. the ship if fit for tank becomes trash because of damage output. if fit for gank, it's too paperthin.(2) generic problem with up close damage of blasters.current dps figures of competing ships are such that you only have some form of advantage over them with neutrons, and even then the advantage is very minute at best. combined with fitting issues, it means that you can often kill blasterboats in their optimal (i fly minmatar and do it all the time - after one point i decided that kiting blasterboats is tedious when you can just reload to hail and show them who's boss at 1km), not to mention the horrible death if they have to actually sustain damage while closing range.the damage advantage is just a bit too low as it is, which when compounded with fitting issues and useless bonuses on sub-bs... well, hurts blasters.also, do not rebalance things looking at scorch in sight. it's a ammo which provides you with a ~124% boost to range over high dps faction, which is a bit frivolous and out of line with everything else (like, javelins, null, barrage).boosts need to be aimed at making blasters better in the area where they're supposed to have a advantage, and in fixing the whole load of sub-bs ships which are generally trash."
"a sniper zealot can't aggro at station either, a sniper zealot can't do sentry damage at 80km, a sniper zealot can't chase down an enemy due to it's lack of defenses, eft is a perfect valid damage presenting tool. and i never said ishtars were better snipers, i just said their dps was high with a large optimal. and i like how you completely left out the parts that you have no argument against, like how the ishtar and deimos are completely superior at closer ranges anyways. eft works just fine, hate you superior \"i can do it myself hurr my math is better than computers\" * inappropriate text removed - ccp ildoge."
"lol what? do you even pvp? which sentry goes to 80 km? sine when is heavy drones good at taking on hacs? and tell me, how is deimos and ishtar being superior at close range? the only way a deimos can outdamage a zealot is to fit neutron blasters couple with void ammo. void ammo gives a -50% in tracking (which does not show up on the dps of eft) means at close range, against anything that has a transversial velocity (such as, a zealot), it does pathetic damage. and thats exactly the reason why this thread exist. people are moaning because blasters are supposed to be superior at close range but they are actually not.so while a blaster deimos looks although it has a higher dps, in a real close-range fight it does -less- dps. no, i cant do maths better than a computer, but what i can do better is use my brain and battle experience and a computer cant do that. oh, forgot to mention, you cant even seem to use eft, with all skills at v, with 2 heat sinks ii and heavy pulse laser ii, a zealot actually does 406 dps with scorch. even with no heat sinks zealot with hpii does 301 dps. so please tell me where does your 276 comes from. also, when equipped with the 75km sentry drone warden ii and no guns, a ishtar does 338 damage. that is actually less than a 5-gun zealot. -nafiy"
"first of all, the ishtar is not a good sniper hac, as you'll be moving/aligning somewhere all the time, leaving no option for the use of sentry drones, because you'll just fall out of range of scooping them.second, on the zealot vs deimos argument, the zealot can do instant damage at a variety of ranges, with quite a bit of tank, while the deimos, to actually be used, needs to have a 1600mm plate and needs to burn towards its opponent to actually apply damage, while its speed isn't that good either. of course, there's a lot of variables to take into account, such as warp-in distance and whatever. but, in general, blaster boats could use more base speed/reduced mass or a significant boost to damage or (look up the thread for some awesome suggestions).also, a zealot vs deimos fight is actually a dumb example, because the zealot is a sniper and has range bonuses, while the deimos is not really geared to be a sniper (although it can fill that role) and it's supposed to be an \"in yo' face!\" gankboat. and, for that role, i can say that a shield brutix (before you start flaming me for even combinating those two terms, go and check it out yourself. they're pretty good boats), although it doesn't have the agility and speed of a deimos, in terms of numbers, it has a similar tank, much more damage output and it doesn't suffer from plates' penalties.so, past that, i want to bring up a especific thing that's been bothering me a bit, which is gallente command ships, nomenately, the astarte. i believe the armor rep bonus should be upped to 10%, because right now, it is not worth the buck. i reckon it's role is for small gang warfare, so, that small rep bonus doesnt do the trick, compared to the almighty absolution...but anyways, that's an issue worth a whole different thread. this one is about boosting blasters."
"zealot does 301 with multifrequency, i used scorch ammo because (276) people are crying about the range being too huge. a zealot with 75km range cannot do 338 damage even with 3 heat sinks and aurora ammo, so it's not less than a 5 gun zealot firing at the same range. (heavy beam laser ii)and the deimos is superior in close range because it has drones, 5 medium tech ii hammerheads. a scrambled zealot with hammerheads and hybrids on it will die very fast to a deimos.the gallente specialize in close quarters combat so don't try to change that. with federation navy antimatter a deimos also will hit harder than a zealot with amarr navy multifrequency even without drones."
"and a full neutron-fit deimos will just die faster than anybody when scrambled, your point? ever wondered why the deimos was called the diemost?"

"use a bit of logic, please.a) mission is reenginered to require a group;b) as mission require a group, all the people missioning will be subject to attacks or are required to kill the rats before the tank of those targeted fail;c) having 5 ships with strained tanks and whose dps are needed to kill the npc will not help you against pirates more than having a ship with a strained tank and whose dps are needed to kill the npc will help you. as long as the npc target only the people already running the mission the pirates will have a huge advantage."
"considering lvl 5s are basically lvl 4s that you have to passive shield tank.so on that basis alone there's plenty of incentive to do missions in lowsec.what happens? they take cov-op into lowsec. get lvl 5 missions declined until they give one in highsec. do the lvl 5 mission in highsec.the issue isnt in the value and incentives of the missions. it's the threat pvp. you either do missions or you do pvp. you cant do both.in my opinion from my experiences... the sleeper's ai in making you fit for pvp doesnt really address this. from my experience people who do go pvp those fighting the sleepers... end up getting killed by the sleepers and not those themselves.so if you really want to fix the lowsec missions issue. give the rats ai that switch up and smoke any pirates who come into the mission.thusly the mission runner(s) can continue tanking for pve... but when pvpers come into the mission. they better be quick in killing you or they will almost certainly die to the rats."

"right now, jumping from high sec into a wormhole is 100% safe because you're in jump range when you land, there's a session change cloak and there's no way of not being able to simply jump out.from what i've seen there is a 4 minute countdown after you've jumped through a wormhole two times, but only the regular session change timer after you've jumped once. i propose a timer for wormholes is in effect every time you jump, even the first time for 2-1/2 minutes or more. unknown space should be scary, after all the warning even comes up telling you concord won't protect you there and it's dangerous.please prove me wrong if i am because from what i've seen there's no way of catching people there with interdiction."
"the current mechanics avoid getting ganked everytime you jump through. which is imho good. we dont need another place like entrance gates where people are just camping to gank people."
"pvp is hard enough to find in eve, seriously wormholes are care bear space too now? it's too damn safe, people find a wormhole, jump through, see people, jump out. wow big loss there right? every action should have consequences and this one doesn't seem to have any other than the fact of wasting 45 seconds probing down the wormhole."
"there are still enough ways to die in a wormhole. and ganking people on a gate/wormhole is not pvp. its just ganking.maybe try syndicate. lots of pewpew there. or providence. or fw area."
"i fully support this, makes those 4 years of wasted training time become usefull and fun again."
"atm i find it silly that corp contracts have the same 2 weeks life expectancy of the public contracts. many corps want to have buy/sell orders that appeal to the corp members alone, for industry or ship replacement programs. but having the same contract lifetime of the public contracts(2 weeks) makes it pretty bothersome."
"note: this is long and mildly wall-o-text-y. if you wish to see the net point of the post, scroll down to the tl;drproblem: with the new system currently outlined in this devblog, the costs associated with holding a system are paid fully in isk. additionally, the costs for upkeep do not seem to be directly tied to any external factors (level of activity, number of other systems owned, hostile action in the system, etc).proposed solution: before i go into it, i'm just going to outline a really quick assumption. the assumption is that ccp, in the current iteration of the sov system, are trying to create an isk sink in 0.0 in the form of upkeep costs. with that out of the way...the solution i propose consists of two parts: 1) give the tcu a fuel bay, and set the fuel requirements to be non-flexible (i'll discuss this in more detail in a bit), and 2) have the system upgrades be a pure isk cost that is flexible based on activity level.to elaborate:1) giving tcu a fuel bay: yes, i know what you're going to say \"but why?! that'll just make it pos 2.0!\" not quite... or at least, not in this particular scenario. you see, poses currently require two things - ice products (player mined), and npc goods. my proposal for the fuel bay is: give it a fixed requirement of x ice products per month (where x is the number equal to the amount a large faction pos uses, for example), and a flexible requirement on the amount of npc goods, tied to system activity, number of jumpgates, and the amount of isk ccp desires a certain level of activity to be charged.to explain this a bit further, npc goods = isk sink for the most part. player activity can result in some of them, but, for the most part, a majority of the goods currently used in poses come from npc sell orders. therefore, having npc goods be a part of the fuel requirement is closely equivalent to having an isk cost... with one major difference: being an item which requires hauling, it maintains some of the logistic overhead required to own space. think 1 dst of fuel per month in terms of cost. one large pos's worth of npc goods per month may be a good reference point for a sov 0 inactive system.as a part of this change, there also should be the following change done to the npc goods: uncap the prices for all of them, fully (ie: speculators could drive a price up in a hub to 10m per unit if they wanted to), and re-seed them all at 1 isk per unit on dominion day. why? two reasons: a) levels the playing field for initial deployment, and b) allows market forces and 0.0 uptake (a.k.a busyness) to dictate the base price of owning space.finally, the upkeep option should be kept, but maintained as a maximum fee for the tcu, and also as a means to keep it online without full fuel requirements2) keeping the upgrades as a constant isk cost: if you read the previous section, you may have thought \"this guy wants a pos\". well, no. what i think would make sense, from both future and current points of view, is a place where you need some level of logistics and market interaction to get started. however, once you're started in your system, there should be no reason (beyond maintaining a base-level functionality of the tcu) for you to have to spend any more time on activities not directly related to making your space awesome. as such, the notion of isk/month for upgrades makes sense, since this comes directly from using your space, so, ideally, the addition of an upgrade should be a pretty simple decision based on how much you use your system (and not a decision based on \"how much more extra hauling of ice will i need to do\"). personally, i think a fee of 20-33% of the value of the addition that the upgrade provides should be a reasonable fee, isk-wisesee post 2 for conclusion"
"so, in conclusion, i think that by implementing those ideas, the following goals will be accomplished: 1) presence of two distinct isk sinks (base tcu, upgrades) to price the space, with the option to go isk-exclusive. 2) incentive for players to participate in 0.0 based on market prices of fuel (ie: \"hey, i've run the numbers, and if it stays this cheap, it'll only cost like (wild exaggeration) 20m a month to own a 0.0 system!\"); 3) allows for (potentially) more interesting trade route conflicts; 4) ties costs closer to activity levels and upgrade levels (which should encourage more activity in 0.0); 5) allows 0.0 to have the fuel seeded @ npc stations (which goes back to point 3... with the trade routes, etc)so, let me know what you think slash flame on below. don't forget to \"support\" if you consider this a good proposal.tl;dr: 1) tcu + fuel req of 1 large pos (or just pay the isk), 2) pay the isk for upgrades, tie upgrade monthlys to activity."
"system holding costs were put in place to allow sovereign space to be more autonomous, instead of carting the huge amount of materials from high-security space. eventually, concepts like the much-discussed planetary colonies might allow for the production and refinement of enriched uranium, mechanical parts, and such to be done on-site to make it truly autonomous (with the minor exception of skill books and blueprints).i like how ccp is going about this change, and while some of the numbers might be off-kilter, that's what singularity is for. therefore, i cannot support this proposal."
"i propose that ccp make a 2010 new year resolution. resolve to spend 2010 fixing all the broken issues. like any successful company experiencing rapid growth, great ideas infused into the current product line and a consistent forward momentum there comes a time when that company must take a moment to slow down and reflect on issues, maintenance and customer needs/desires/complaints.its fairly obvious we have long list of standing problems with player owned structures, alliance's being crashed with a single button press, asset and resource sharing with corps in established alliances, epic arch missions and we all know (based on the past performances of new expansions) surely dominion will be riddled with fixes, bugs, problems and tweaks.i am quite sure many will add to this list seeing how the forums are inundated with complaints, issues and suggestions. many are very good suggestions, some are tweaks and a few are just simple logic with the need for some serious consideration.that said i propose that 2010 be dedicated to repair. its quite evident that eve is cutting edge and superior to any other game in its category however i have personally seen corp mates leave the game based on issues like the ones stated above and with comments like i am going to take a break and come back in a few months with high hopes some of these issues will have been worked out.in the same breath i have seen (as many of you have) others threatening to leave based on the proposed sov changes and a plethora of other reasons many based on poor performance and a inherent feeling that they (the player base) are not being heard, not being taken seriously or even considered after years of flogging dead horses.in the past year we have has some awesome improvements with tiii ships, worm space and now a (in the initial pitch) more balanced and easier to attempt sov plan not to mention a trickling of info on station mobility and further improvements to player interaction and the social element that drives eve behind the scenes.with what we have on the table currently i implore ccp to pause for a moment, take a deep breath and look at the reality and vitality of the game. hold off on dust for a bit, finish what you have on the table for this year dominion and spend 2010 rehashing the ignored, overlooked and often ear marked too big to deal with at this time issues.what good is that shiny new car going to be to you if you never put it in the shop and do some routine maintenance or repair the broken struts ? obviously anything neglected long enough is going to break.lets not reach the breaking point, instead lets take the time to fix whats wrong and if (and i say if) the repairs goes smoother than anticipated the ask the clientele (the player base) are we ready to take the next step ? and i am quite sure that the majority of the players once they feel repairs are effective and the car is again running smoothly with answer with a resounding yes and look forward to your new fresh innovative ideas with promise and enthusiasm. rather than the hundreds of posts knocking the system and its feeble efforts to make great things happen by way of half hearted implementations, overlooking issues and ignoring the paying customers requests.a great leader knows when to retreat, regroup and reassess his/her battle readiness and capabilities.a poor leader fumbles forward patching up the troops with high hopes they will have the heart to see the mission through to completion. be the great leader and think wisely, listen closely and keep your equipment in perfect working order. any successful leader knows the value of getting the job done is not the same as getting the job done right.so lets see how many agreeshould 2010 be a fix it and tweak the settings year or should we just continue fumbling along hoping it all turns out right"

"ccp is doing fine as is. they're fixing one major problem with the game while releasing new content in each expansion. new content ensures new subscribers, and one fixed problem per patch allow for a dedication to that problem and it's resolution.they've already fixed scanning in apocrypha, and now they're working on sovereignty in dominion. i'm hoping the next patch is devoted to warfare (covering wardecs and bounty hunting). each patch, they also improve the ui (with eye candy and now cosmos).ccp is a business, and therefore new clientele is essential for growth without rejecting the veteran players of the game. in this rough market, entertainment industries (like ccp) have the potential for unparalleled growth, and they're reacting in a great way.bugs will always exist with a game, and this is true regardless of whether you play wow, coh, or whatever. they're working on it, and doing fine.tl;dr: don't bite the hand that feeds you."
"with all due respect sir you apparently dont keep up with current events or forum posts.the latest dev blog regarding sov changes has generated 69 very heated pages of response in 2 days.many, not just a few leaders of major alliances have posted their input and expressed the dissatisfaction with current plans and past mistakes.this is just one example. many things like storage, alliance shared access, player owned stations and the ever popular kill a alliance with the push of a button are some huge areas that need fixing (just to name a few).ccp is doing fine ? how many months ago did bob get disbanded with a single button press and yet here it remains unfixed and happens yet again. how many years has it been since player owned stations was released and the features introduced with them never fixed ?you say scanning was fixed ? if you mean made easier for everyone yes that is correct and i applaud them for that however... easier isnt always better and there are many topics regarding that subject and dumbing down the profession that many have spent months training for and learning... so again with this in mind did they listen to the veteran players and tweak it a bit more so they didnt feel rejected ? no instead it was made to work and they have moved on to the next project ignoring the fundamental input of the pilots in this profession.do not interpret this as a way of knocking ccp, it is not intended to do that. ccp is doing ok, i would not go so far as to endorse your statement of fine and definitely think they could do better...its time to take a short break from creating and start repairing that which has been developed and released. it is in fact just my opinion and you are entitled to yours however like i said ccp is capable of being much more and i think the 50,000 plus pilots who pay for this game (many with multiple accounts) deserve a bit more recognition for their input as well as a fully functional game.yes there will always be a few bugs, but if you read a few more topics i think you will find there are more than a few bugs and many are quite old and ignored"
"sory, planetary interaction and incarna is allready planned , so more bugs and issues are coming on our way considering how well ccp propgramers are familiar with their code."

"suggesting changes is still difficult when dominion is not in it's final stage. that being said i like the idea as proposed. as stated it allows a player to pay \"taxes\" even in situations where the tax system does not function. additionally it helps out an operation like cva. also if you happen to have a hostile or a neutral (if your nbsi) doing something in your system then their activity can help you hold your space. i like that.the only down side is that more activity = more isk income but less for the isk sink the upgrades represent. some tweeks may be needed but, i can support this idea.ashina sito for csm"
"i like it"
"to repeat it again, so maybe someone notice it, prices have been changed:it is here."
"they're being made to maintain activity if they want perks like jump bridges, cyno jammers and csaa's. where's the difference to simply say that to hold the system in the first place it should have some activity? if ccp are serious about making small gangs able to disrupt sov (which we all want after all), then there's no better way.edit - the three examples are sov based and reading the blog may not be activity based, but in any case the point holds for the other perks, and so stands - even if we assume that the strategic level is the sole criterion for those upgrades."
"not experienced this with mining drones, but i have read it is a real problem.i have seen the same bug working with npc structures in missions, sometime the drone circle them but do no damage, it is a bug somwhere in the orbiting mechanics.i prefer the current mining drones to \"static\" mining units as it make mining drones different from deployable stripminers, but i fail to see why mining drones need to orbit a asteroid. the gravitational pull of a small sized body like an asteroid can easily counteracted by the drone propulsion so they could get in range and stay there till the cycle finish, then return to the ship for delivery."

"lvl 5 missions in highsec, yea.this is content we all are paying for, and i dislike having to make a run through gankers and griefers to get to that content.while at it; ahsekuav, you should also look into the task of improving the bounty system. as of now the bounty system is worse than useless as the griefers can easily collect the bounties on themselves.ccp love to tell us all the game should have crime, as there is crime in real life.someone should tell ccp crime should not always pay well - there are penalties in real life, so we want some of these penalties in the game as well.work on this and you have my vote!"
"i like a lot of the ideas you propose on this post. you're not afraid to show your personal bias, which always exists regardless of the candidate (even those who claim that they have no bias).in addition, many of the changes incorporate pvp as well as pve, so you demonstrate your understanding of the balance of the two activities that exist in this game. for these reasons, you have my single vote (the only account i have), as well as my support (assuming you do not crash and burn like some of the other candidates, most notably in this current term)."
"you're right jarl. the bounty system has been a sore spot since i started in 04. i'm happy to bring this up within the csm. a good place to start might be to prohibit bounties to be collected by players within the same corp or alliance. still, that doesn't address the problem of alts or friends in other corps doing the hit and splitting the bounty with the intended target. i would be willing to explore bounty hunting as a profession and the development of a skill tree for that profession. the danger is tilting the board too much in favor of the bounty hunter and giving them an unfair advantage over other players. that's the primary reason why i oppose the pirate profession getting some lovin. until i see specifics of the type of lovin they are looking for, they shouldn't have an unfair advantage over other players. they should have the same level field as everyone else.another potential issue is the bounty hunter doing a counter contract with the intended target. say you take out a contract on a griefer. the bounty hunter locates the target. the enterprising bounty hunter may tell the intended target that he has been hired to do the hit. at that point the bounty hunter may negotiate a pay off or counter contract on you. in that instance, perhaps a new contract system could be implemented that specifies no payout until the target has been podded. further, in order for the bounty hunter to use the bounty contract system, they need to be registered with concord in much the same manner that real life bounty hunters need to be registered with state or local authorities. if a bounty hunter violates the terms of the contract system, then he loses his license and the ability to utilize the bounty hunting contract system. food for thought. ahs"

"as i said in an earlier post here in jita park i am the sovreignty csm to vote for.devblog - the upkeepthis matter will be so big in dominion that you just need one csm with long time experience, know-how and knowledge about the history of eve.i am that candidate to vote for."
"at this time, eve university hasn't lent official support behind any one candidate. there are several candidates that individual players and directors support, but no corporate position has been put forth."
"from what i have seen so far of the candidates there seems to be 2 that fit the concept that eve university follows. this is not a statement that eu endorses ether candidate but that these candidates are looking out for the newer players out there.the first would be jonathan dawnchaser if your more of a pve csm.the second is actually myself ashina sito for a more pvp leaning csm.or for pure carebear (if your looking for that) you can try aaron mirrorsaver."
"a majority of the ancients is made up of new players. as any of our pilots will attest to, we are happy to train new players and show them the ropes. we just choose to keep a lower profile than eu. i'm sure eu and ivy league will weigh their decision carefully prior to supporting the candidate of their choice.regards-ahs"

"alfons.... you're missing the point.blasters can not track their targets when in their optimal range. unless the target is bigger than the gun (cruiser shooting a bs) or stood perfectly still. the argument is that the effective (not theoretical eft) dps is hopeless. the weapon system is flawed in that it is supposed to be used within 3 - 6 km but can't hit titan (yes i have exagerated) if transversal is anything above 100. for the short range weapon of eve this is not right. the short range weapon should be able to track its targets within its optimal. fall off isn't really an option as te weapons range is hopeless and just going 500m into fall off drops your dps rapidly.all we ask is that blasters be able to track their target. a smidge more base damage too but tracking is the priority."
"do something already..."
"not supported, if anything a slight range increase on blasters or a slight range nerf on scorch so people stop their complaining."
"in order to keep the flavor difference between acs pulse and blasters, but get blasters in-line with regard to performance, blasters damage need to be raised a bit.the difficulties associated with not being able to deal damage at speed disruption range (10-13km) is a huge disadvantage over lasers and acs."

"a developer commented on this a few months back. the comment was, \"i thought that is the way it was. i'll look into it.\". i see both sides of it. easier to skill for but you miss out on the 10% bonus. the only wrong choice would be to add the requirement and not give the bonus.would need new code just for sentry's. i would say no. sounds cool but can you imagine the bugs? it would take years to fix them. gettign current issues fixed would be better. yes, should be in game already. while we are at it add +hull hp rigs!!!! i want to make a super hull tanked domi!! yes, but buff the current e-ar drones (eccpet ecm) and go from there. this does not match the description. it could be rewritten though. would be overpowered if e-war drones were buffed. that said you drone interfacing should function with e-war drones. all e-war drones suck, ok not ecm. if e-war drones were buffed up this would not be an issue. \0/don't count on getting any of these things. ccp regrets 3 things in eve...1) learning skills. they are a drag on retaining new players and a hassle overall.2) more then one pilot on one account.3) drones.i think ccp has dragged their feet with drones because they don't want to draw even more people to them. then again we got the fed navy omnidirectional tracking links and there has been implied comments that there may be more faction drone mods in the future."

"goal - encourage people to go to 0.0 (no sec space).pros: 1. ccp's stated goal was to increase participation (emergence) in 0.0 space.2. more people = more contact = more conflict (kicking industry and everything associated with it up several notches)cons: 1) anything (besides pvp) is better, safer and makes more money in empire. not just fotm lvl 4's, but everything! until ccp changes that, 0.0 will remain un-attractive to a vast number of people. there has to be a reason for people other than pvp'rs to exist out to 0.0, and the non-pvp players have to be accepted by the pvp crowd. dominion, imho, won't help 0.0 become more desirable, or attractive.so, while industry / mining / refining / invention / everything, is safer to do in empire, is closer to markets and doesn't have the >huge< drawback that it is *so* vulnerable... people will stay away from 0.0 in droves (as they are doing now).the only thing that makes sense, is if the rewards for doing industry/mining/refining/invention/research/*missioning* in 0.0 were higher, lots higher, because of the risk. honestly? you can take missions right out of the game, and if people can still make more money, safer, more consistently in empire in other ways - they will.and 0.0 will remain under/un - utilized.so, 0.0 (as a whole) has to be way more desirable than hi-sec. not in isk necessarily, but, for example:industry gets a 5% material bonus from 0.0 manufacturing (not needing to abide by all the empire safety restrictions - or however you want to roleplay it). or 10% or 15%...mining - 5% to 15% bonus to mining amount in 0.0 (buff asteroid mineral amounts in 0.0) ((maybe 25%?))refining - 10% bonus to refining output/less wastage.invention - \"come to crazy al's pos in fountain!\" (or where ever...) i can give you a 25% modifier on invention from your bpo's!\" (or, 10% reduction in materials, or a buff to me... whatever)missions/salvaging - missions are easy - peasy:lvl - 4's - one or two rats, multi - room missions spread all over a system. blockade normally gives x number of npc rats?in 0.0 blockade mission rooms should = npc rats / 2 (for example - 30 rats would equal 15 rooms) now its not impossible to scan them out & find them, but its not a slam-dunk either, because they are separated by gates, and warp gates can move you wherever in system they care to drop the other end of the grid. keep each room separated by 2 au, minimum. or whatever works to make the mission viable.salvaging gets a 15% difficulty modifier and a 15% amount modifier to results.all these things could be done via the upgrades systems (including npc agents). there is no reason this couldn't be done.these are the kinds of things (maybe way off on my numbers, but what the hell) that would *draw* people out to 0.0...dominion will not do this. hell, judging by the feedback, we're looking at exodus ii."
"numbers may need some tweaking, and i'm not sure i like the change to 0.0 misisons (missions need changing all right, but not like this), but the basic idea is damb fine.and industry/research bonus would give a real, solid advantage to living in, and most importantly, using sov 0.0give 0.0 industrialists, inventors and researchers a real advantage to compete with the massive free subsidies that hi-sec ones get."
"i hear a lot of people talking about making 0.0 a little safer and whatnot. that's what i thought this thread would be about before i read it. that kind of thing would be utterly ******ed and if it was the case, even though i'm not a 0.0 pilot, i would probably quit eve.this, i can support. i am in total agreement with there being higher rewards in null-sec. make it profitable for industrials to go there, even if they lose a couple ships along the way. that way everybody benefits... pvpers get their precious killmails and loot, industrials get their precious minerals, manufacturers get their precious money from selling more industrial ships out there. it will be great with these new sov changes."
"dominion isn't even out yet, and you're already saying it tanked? ccp knows what they're doing, and knows the limitations of the codebase.while i agree that agents should exist in 0.0 and be hireable to player outposts, the objective is to create a communal benefit. pvpers gain benefits for protecting pveers in their space, and pve gets a boost by having pvp carve out the section of 0.0 where they will run missions/mine/manufacture.i believe that, given time, certain alliances will be renown for their treatment of pve, both positive and negative, and we'll see those alliances that promote pve gain power in the grand 0.0 menagerie, while those that neglect it will find their upkeep costs much higher - to the realms of unaffordable. this will draw pve to low-sec, since the rare ores and maybe the level 5 missions will be available there, increasing the profit per hour while maintaining relatively safe roaming grounds. on top of that, level 4s will be a lot more profitable than in high-sec due to the security rating of the system, and maybe the quality of the agents.pve doesn't need any more benefit than it's gonna receive from dominion. soon, if the alliances understand the repercussions of persecuting pve, i believe it will draw a large portion of high-sec runners out to low-sec.in either case, lets wait and see what happens before firing shots in the dark. i believe dominion could be the ultimate benefit to both pvp and pve."
"hm, did it ever occur to you that there might be reasons beyond game mechanics? you know, like the people who live in 0.0 ruthlessly murdering any carebear that tries to set fot in their space?this expansion is about making the carebear hating pvp brigade accept carebears in to their space, so that small roaming gangs will have soft targets to shoot at. if you think it's too much effort, then you don't deserve any soft targets. you want something, you have to work for it. don't like it? there's the door. don't let the airlock hit you on the way out."
"interesting idea, have you considered the cons? a single player can already cover most of the industrial need of a corporation save the raw mineral gathering (but npc loot can cover a good percentage of that and high sec import the rest).make mining more efficient and you will need less miners.make refining ore efficient and you will need less miners (again).make production more efficient and you will need less miners (third time, ouch) and less producers. make invention more efficient and it maybe will give a real advantage to 0.0 but at the same time it will reduce moon minerals demand. t2 market is already glutted, so demand will not increase, simply prices will decrease pushing high sec inventors out of the market (intended result, so ok for this idea).missions with mega number of gates ..... brr the time lost navigating them.extra salvage? you already have that in belt rats, like extra loot, but most people will not loot and salvage them. but again it can help. i think it will not get more industrial people in 0.0, it will only make life easier for those already there and reduce the demand for ne producers.the mission part could partially work.the invention part would be a success probably."
"ok, fair enough. just answer me this then. given the current state of affairs, what is the draw of 0.0 (other than sovereignty or pvp) for a pve'r?why would you go to 0.0 when everything pve is gimped out there?exodus was supposed to encourage people to move from hi-sec to 0.0 (back in the day) - it didn't do it, and as a matter of fact, many people moved from 0.0 to hi-sec. and if you don't know what exodus is, it was a patch, i think you can google it.you might very well be right. but (imho) ccp's missed the mark again. vovwe'll see.i disagree, there are ways to get to 0.0, you have to look for them (and 0.0 alliances could be doing a better job of recruiting - but thats another thread).this expansion will -not- encourage 0.0 space holding entities to invite pve'rs in because the root issue (there is nothing better about doing industry, et al in 0.0 than in hi-sec) will not have been addressed.i have no idea what your 2nd paragraph is all about, so will leave that alone..."
"dude, i think you just won post of the year. this is the best idea for fixing 0.0 i've ever seen, no word of a lie. i'm going to steal this idea and flog it shamelessly now."
"yes of course. the upgrade could simply spawn the agents in space, like they are in some null sec systems, in gates or at some system visible spot.perhaps each level of upgrade would provide the corresponding level of agent, from 1 to 5."
"true but shouldn't they also be actively looking at ways to compaign? following the csm sections should be part of that and from there they should see the thread. expect more out of csms. they shouldn't need spoon feeding.song li for csm"
"thanks again la for the quick note to my comment on the planet risk site earlier today.as i mentioned, you can appreciate the amount of time going through the eve online boards can consume and also how easy it can be to miss a post here and there. as an astute csm candidate i had been going through these boards, however my time has been focused on proposals that have been garnering the most merit (via the support feature in the assembly hall threads) from the community rather than reading every thread and every answer to all threads. please do not take this as a complaint as i am familiar with the last round of the debate and i must say it was a job well done. as a candidate and firm believer in what the csm represents and the significance of how rare an opportunity that has been presented to the eve online community, it is critically important that word gets out about the csm, it's role, its history and its future.i was simply making an observation that we have several tools for communication and all of them should be taken advantage of in order to reach as many people as possible.keep up the great work and hope to be able to set up some face time within the debate soon.cheers,prodigal"

"bump.no one but me finds this useful?corp contracts have a different role than public contracts, making corp logistics easier to manage as opposed to selling and buying stuff off of random people. the fact that you have corp contract slots only enforces this.if you want people to use those 500 slots for their intended use, you have to give them much longer lifetimes."
"are you sure it's actually of any use to the corp at all if nobody is accepting it within 14 days?"
"oh yes. producing and selling cheap ships/rigs/modules for only your corp to enjoy."
"for hauling mining foreman and mining director are very important to maximizing output. these skills are ideal for a hauling alt because that alt can be moved to any system and be put to use within any fleet.however, the bonuses don't work while docked. and a hauling alt can dock often depending on the output of the fleet.it would be a great improvement if the fleet bonus loss were delayed by a minute or two so haulers don't stop giving fleet bonuses when dropping off cargo."
"while we're at it, why not have all the bonuses work that way, so you can get the joys of additional shields and resistances without ever leaving the comfort of your station!no. the solution is a fairly simple one. you don't want to lose the benefits, don't have your booster dock."
"not supported.....you must be in space to apply bonuses.if you want your hauler to apply bonuses... drop some secure cans in a safe spot near the belt and haul all your ore there. can't be scanned down unless you hang around too long. and means you don't dock till mining op complete."
"my pimped out iteron v carries 12 gscs permanently to squeeze out that last little bit of carrying capacity. gscs have never really been a solution to the intermediate storage problem, at least not once you're using something bigger than a frigate to mine.not that i support the op. bonuses should be carried by a barge or orca pilot, not a hauler, and if you want group bonuses all the time you might try being in an actual group."
"not sure if any of you realized this but not only does this change mining boosts, butit pretty much supports docking games with pvp. gang booster getting shot at? oh just dock for a couple minutes till the boosts wear off, then undock and dock again!"
"pos fueling is a terrible, awful, no good, very bad mechanic. i am completely against any proposal to expand it to another type of structure."
"you misunderstand my post. i'm not saying that bugs should not be fixed, far from it. bugs should be given attention in every patch, especially those that interrupt gameplay.however, devoting a whole year to something that will not attract players to the game (it might make a few return), is economic suicide. bigger things need fixed, and are on the slate to be fixed (wardecs, ui, etc). ccp is working on those.get off your high horse and realize that your idea is both unrealistic and improbable. bugs should be fixed, but your idea stretches the bounds of realism to the breaking point."
"do you have any thoughts on the situation with drones and having to tell them to do stuff 4-5 times before they will actually do as they are told and then a second or 2 later going back to whatever the hell they feel like doing?im also kind of curios to hear your thoughts on the expansion name as it seems to be geared towards an effort to break the dominion of the large alliances"
"i think ccp has tried to 'fix' drone behaviour about ever patch for the last 2 years or so . i have to admit that i have not be bothered by any significant problems with their behaviour for awhile now even though i use drones a lot. are there any specific situations that it seems to happen in?heh. fortunately -a- has no pretences to dominate the eve-lives of anyone other than those who enter our space uninvited..and occasional bystanders"

"the main dominion discussion thread has turned into something of a monster and so im going to post my thoughts about it here instead.firstly i believe that the goals of the sov revision have not been met with this new system in its current state. effective holdings of existing powerblocs will remain as they are even if the official sov map shows smaller blobs of colour. sovereignty in systems with no strategic value will be dropped but any local power will be able to make sure that no-one else sets up in there either.small corps and alliances who were previously frozen out of 0.0 by the pos mechanics will continue to be frozen out because it will be trivially easy for any competitor to shut down their space and force them to fight a one-sided battle with corporate bankruptcy.so even though one part of the design will, on paper at least, have been realised in that there will be more unclaimed space, the effect will be the same as the current status quo (which most 0.0 dwellers seem to agree needs to change).let me be clear, this criticism is not dependent on the numbers in fridays dev blog. ccp have stated that those numbers will change and have put forwards some new ones which are significantly cheaper. even if there was no cost at all, the issues i have with the design would still exist.ccp state that they want to consolidate large empires down to a few core systems which is fine. however those fewer systems will need to be able to support more activity and ccp have not yet put forwards a realistic proposal for how that might happen. early in the information stream, we heard that the target was a single system supporting 50-100 pilots, over the weekend that seems to have dropped to 10-15 or so with the caveat that those 10-15 pilots need to be doing different activities so as not to trip over each other.this really is the core of the issues that 0.0 dwellers have with this. we are mostly prepared for the fact that well contract and that some activity will be less profitable than it used to be. we were looking forwards to a new wave of 0.0 colonists coming from empire providing fresh targets and a shakeup of the status quo. as it stands though, there is really no reason for anyone to make that jump, 0.0 will continue to be filled with incumbents who fight each other for mostly historical rather than strategic reasons. in fact, the future of 0.0 looks even more stagnant as a result of these changes as there will be almost no reason to actively conquer space. we will send ~wulfpax~ to our enemies who will send ~wulfpax~ to our space and we will have ~good fights~ but nothing will ultimately change as a result of these battles. any incumbent alliance that dies or gets expelled from 0.0 space will do so as a result of internal schisms rather than through strategic conquest or ingame military action.i was excited for a system that would lower the barrier to 0.0 participation and make 0.0 life more dangerous and more rewarding. this is not that system."
"someone from legion of xxdeathxx brought this up earlier, and i'd like to make it a formal question for logit:what is your position on the local channel, specifically relating to its effect as an instant, system-wide scanner? would you advocate the change or removal of that function, and in what ways?"
"the systemic effects of changing local chat to a delay would need to be considered. clearly, such a change would have far-reaching consequences beyond just the hoped-for effect (making pvp more unpredictable, presumably.)currently, there are methods (probably exploits) of creating super-deep safespots. there are also many players with bookmarked super-deep safes from when they were easy to make. these safespots would allow people to circumvent the only remaining way of gathering intel (probing/scanning), and would generate a lot of complaining. this issue would need to be addressed first.another issue is how it would change the incentive structure surrounding fleet sizes. currently, in lowsec and 0.0, smaller gangs (of both pvpers and pveers) can use the easy intel local chat provides to assess possible engagements. without that easy intel, blobbing for defensive purposes becomes much more attractive.while i have never liked local chat, and would personally be happy to see a delay added to it, a change to it would have far-reaching consequences. it would definitely make eve more hardcore (a plus imo), but it would encourage blobbing (bad) and generate a lot of whining from all types of players about unfair advantages. a change would have to be carefully thought out.sorry if this seems like a dodge, but this is the kind of representative i would be; i would approach changes to game mechanics conservatively, no matter how attractive they were to me personally."
"pardon the thread jack, but why not just take away the pilot list from local altogether. it doesn't really make sense that you would just know who was in a system, even on a delay. but if you happened to be in a system when someone made a broadcast, then you would know they were there.i wouldn't argue about whether local list is fair or not. but i would argue that it doesn't make a lot of sense. it assumes that there is some system in place of collecting stats on the local population and then broadcasting those results out to every ship in local. i guess you could say this is a function of the gates but why does it exist? what's the purpose? wormholes have no gates but still have local lists...even from a pvp perspective i think it takes some of the fun out of it. more fun to guard the gates and start probing.that's my 2 cents. leave local chat but take away any pilot stats. just like a radio at sea. i know you are there if my radar can see you or if you are broadcasting. past that..."
"/thread"
"not at all - your position on the issue is that you'd look at any proposed change very closely and be watchful for any negative impact on the choices we have in the game (strengthening blobbing as the \"only\" choice counts as a negative impact on choices in my book). you told me exactly what i wanted to know."
"any news ? nocsm is useless ? yes"
"now availablethis will not happen again, i.e. the delays."

"why should we vote for you? your place is already secured because of the goonies vote."
"do you like any of my ideas? did you think i was dashing and witty during the alliance tournament?no?then don't vote for me. i'm not going to grovel for votes and i'm not going to apologize for being in goonfleet. i think i have good ideas for where eve should go and i think i can get things done. if it's more important for you to rail against \"the goonies\" then that's your prerogative."
"i was reading velocity prime's (suddenly ninjas ceo) blog and i noticed that they have formed a political party in regards to the upcoming csm election.it seems to be somewhat libertarian, in that they want to block (or at least put under a microscope) any proposed game changes that might restrict or reduce the number of viable activities available to players in-game.at first i was like but i have to admit that sn has always operated in a way that takes full advantage of the qualities of eve that make it great. if they think that it's worth it to organize around the idea of preserving those qualities, than so do i.another thing i noticed is that unlike other prominent corps/alliances, instead of just nominating one of their own members, they seem to be supporting a candidate from a competitor group of ninja salvagers. it's nice to see a corp/alliance that is more interested in the good of the game than currying influence for themselves."
"sounds good to me. imo, seems dominion's changes for 0.0 are really nothing more than adding a bunch of rules that will limit how people act there. that sucks pretty hard; i just can't see any epic events like we are used to unfolding once that new system is in place.the guy they are supporting (logit probit) has my accounts' votes."
"these guys are pretty experienced at dealing with carebear whining. seems perfectly suited for csm +1"
"hurray for cooperation. i would assume one of the changes they're concerned about is breaking ninja salvaging? i find flaw with their theory! adding aggression mechanics to salvaging would actually increase the number of activities in game. ninja salvaging would still remain, but ninja salvage baiting, and ninja salvager ganking would be 2 brand new activities added to the game.i call shenanigans on their platform, they really just want to protect their free tear-faucet"
"i think it's pretty unlikely that suddenly ninjas would be opposed to letting people shoot at salvagers."
"moved to jita park speakers corner."
"so are you saying you want us to be able to wardec npc corps?"
"that would be pretty sweet."
"hell yes it would be. i think there should be 2 npc corps per race, one for newbies and one for people who are too scared, lazy or asocial to join a real corp. you should be able to dec the second one."
"that's not a bad idea.how bout this... assuming you never join a corp, at a certain number of sps you automatically graduate, transfer, etc, from the noob starter corp to a sister npc corp that can be dec'd?and... that corps offices are all outside of the sec bubble i have been talking about. not only facilitates the dec but also encourages people to move outside the bubble or join a real corp.dec'ing an npc would have to cost more though. probably significantly more. and if you attack a dec'd pilot from the npc corp in that corps space, their npc patrols will respond. outside their space, no support. but i wouldn't put their patrols in uber ships though.would probably be best to just add a 1 more npc corp to every faction for the noob corp and maintain all the current npc corps. that way, when a noob graduates, they can get a status on current dec's in case they want to choose one that isn't currently dec'd. and to make it even more interesting you could base their graduation options off of their sec status with the faction. then you could tie the cost of npc corp decs into the rating system of the corp you are dec'ing. the corps that require higher sec status to get into are also the most expensive to attack. 0.0 sec status would give you below average graduation options. could maybe even say 0.0 or less gets you the base corp."
"and how exactly are these players in npc corps supposed to defend themselves against organized gankers? you can bet on it that if what you two propose happens, that it will be impossible for npc corp players to visit jita or any mission hub for that matter as there will be campers there looking for easy ganks.they will most likely quit the game as there is no way for them to defend themselves. chances are they are not even interested in pvp at all.wardecs are too unbalanced and in favor of the attacker, ccp called them a \"pay to grief\" system for a reason. wardecs should be brought in line and provide ways for defenders to end the war, and do not last permanently (as long as the attackers can be bothered to pay the minimal fees that is)."
"start with my first post in this thread and keep reading. this has all been covered.try to not freak out because a goon posted and got some traction. the idea has merit."
"the idea is to get people to leave npc corps and join real ones."
"i did read the thread, tyvm.not all people want to join a corp, just like not all people want to go to lowsec, not all people want to pvp, and not all players want to use voice coms. i've been in an npc corp for over 5 years for a reason. stop trying to force your own playstyle on others."
"in the absence of an eve-uni candidate then i would humbly suggest that as an instructor with agony unleashed i would be a good substitute yes we are focussed on pvp not pve - but some of the things we teach are applicable to pve encounters as well."

"blackops need the most:hp buffed to at least the same as their t1 hulls.some t2 racial resists. 40/20 would be excellent.improved jump range (4 - 6.5ly base)useful t2 bonusesjump portal functioning with standard cyno gens (pos mod)additional turret on panther.currently, the blackops can't even jump/bridge over most border systems, supposedly one of the main uses of bos. at best, they can bridge about 3 jumps (in-region jumps), which is more or less useless. never mind any sort of normal travel via jump drive is impossible, again due to horrid range.widow is the only ship that has functional t2 bonuses, agility bonuses? speed bonuses? wtf? the redeemer's bonus is at least not completely useless, but the rest.... ugh.i'd propose something like:redeemer:7.5% to large energy tracking, 10% to large energy optimal per levelsin7.5% to drone mwd speed per level, +10km drone control range per level panther7.5% to large projectile tracking, 10% to large projectile falloff per levelwidow30% bonus to ecm target jammer strength, 10% to cruise missile and torpedo flight time per levelthe sin will always be sub-par as a black ops due to using drones: impossible to stay aloof because you can't align with sentries and/or have to wait for heavies to return. panther could use another turret and/or being changed to be a shield tank ship. thankfully, the ac fix panthers wont be too badly off"
"no they simply need to get unnerfed. they originally nerfed the stats because they thought they'd become the omgsolopwnmobile.1. maximum target range nerfed vs t1 variant. which is crazy. afaik no other t2 ship had this happen.2. 25% @ lvl 5 agility bonus on sin; yet 50% more mass.3. non-existent t2 resistances 10% for kin? meh?4. 20% less armor/shields/strucutre then t15. less powergrid yet more slots6. less gunsthat's for the sin moreso. which is what i fly. just for comparison. i happen to be in my oneiros atm as logistics 5 is almost done and i'm changing my fitting slightly. anyway. oneiros has...1. 33% more maximum targeting range over t12. oneiros is slightly less agile. but fairly acceptable. plus oneiros generally matched up with command ships and battleships. so not an issue.3. 48.75% more kin res vs 10% more for sin and 32.5% more thermal res vs no change for thermal on sin4. 33% more armor/shields/structure then t15. has fitting bonus over t16. well gets 4 large rr vs 1 large rr or 4 large rr to 4 medium rr.so how about we unnerf these? we dont need to talk about making them jump further or such.that really only may lead to other issues i wont mention.black ops and titans can lock onto any sort of cyno. including beacons.my suggestion would be the allowance for black ops to lock onto any alliance beacon. regardless of alliance association. which isnt that overpowered as you cant exactly move much to that enemy pos; that the pos cant alpha.this is true. however by design sadly. this isnt that bad. then again. i really like the agility. cloaked velocity is fairly useless. on a ship so fat anyway. presumably. you jump into a camp. you ab/mwd-cloak and even with all that. you really arent going to get away from inties who run at you. the cloaked velocity would only work if it was like 1,000% per level. then you're practically nano while cloaked. which would be very fun but i cant see that happen.there are more titans then black ops!"
"oops, forgot support.they can't bridge to cyno gens (ccp did a dirty hack and made the bridge a passive mod so you can't).the agility is nice, but really useless frankly. (this coming from someone with a sin) only thing i've used it lately is a glorified loot transport: warps faster than a cs with a built in cloak-warp trick and more ehp. lol.being able to jump farther is critical for them to be of any use. if they can't jump/portal (portal range tied to jump range) a decent distance, un-nerfed or not they would still be more or less useless in the role ccp would like to see. oh, as far as the covops cloak stuff goes: meh. it would be nice, but balancing it would be somewhat hard. i'd rather see jumping and ship stats addressed first."
"totaly agree on the part bout boosting would be more fun"
"i agree with this. i think they need real bonuses. i would like to see combat recons be allowed to use the bridge also. that would mix the clandestine fleet up a bit."
"i am almost to my first jump cap ship, and now i get a \"puddle-dropping-blop\" effect, much like the new jump gate... i think that wh's effect was taken a tad too far in apoc... it's like they got an idea and then everyone one said \"so cool\" and suddenly everything ended up looking like it... a heard mentality in the dev department i assume... and we lost so much character in apoc, i honestly looking at you-tube stuff think only a few things really improved - mining lasers did - but shy of that, no much is better, in fact alot is worse... or has no character at all... well maybe shield boosters and such... armor/hull... after a few it gets a hand down... effects should be something unique and interesting that can be seen from a ways away or what is the point?/signed and double signed."
"well i know the vengeance used to have a 4th 5% shield resist boost or something. it went away with quantum rise or some other expansion around that time but i was told the resists were just added to the base stats since it was under amarr frigate which had to be at v anyway.i'm pretty sure the other assault frigates had a 4th bonus too so are you all taking this into account or were these never really added into the ships base stats?"
"t2 ships all had resist bonuses listed as the 4th bonus quite some time back. there were a lot fewer of them at the time. it was decided to roll that resist bonus into the base hull. all other t2 ships that were affected gained an additional bonus; assault frigates did not. that is part of the argument for them to receive that missing bonus now."
"this has been needed for some time"
"fully endorsed. a neutral who involves themselves in someone else's fight is no longer neutral. they should face the consequences of the aggro timer.although i wouldn't mind seeing them concord-ed either..."
"if all you're asking for is tracking then you still end up with useless ships.the tracking problem isn't really there unless you're doing something wrong or shooting smaller ships then you. maybe with two ab frigates fighting each other... maybe.you must be simply doing something horribly wrong. i have little problems tracking ships of same size using acs loaded with hail m, which track about 50% worse then blasters with cnam and have a yet shorter optimal and falloff then neutrons.range is more of a issue, but that is how blasters work. lack of real dps advantage in realistic fits compared to competitors is more of a issue then anything else. damage and ships (and fitting) in general is the problem.also, you cannot separate ships from the weapons. bad ship bonuses need to go. armor rep bonus, i'm looking at you specifically. (alternatively, introduce dual reps as one module and reduce fitting requirements of reps in general, so ships can fit damage and tank)"
"i do agree that three bays might clutter things up and if this proposal makes it through and gets implemented i would like to see it as a blinking highlight in your drones bay on your overview. this prevents abuse and keeps it nice and tidy.however you point out an auto attribute which repairs. if i'm understanding correctly is that you mean that when a fighters in a bay has damage that it will start repairing. i think, if this is what you meant, the option should always lay with the carrier pilot though and not have it done automatic."
"it hasn't been mentioned here yet, so i'll be the first... i'd like it to be easier to scan down player wrecks. no matter where i am in the galaxy, players get popped. being the first little scavenger on the scene would be very helpful.i mean i know this thread is primarily focused on mission wrecks, but i care more about scanning down t2 ship wrecks. xd"

"um, no."

"these ideas would be a boost for people already in 0.0 more than a draw for new people. i don't think anything short of removing high-sec (edit: which i am not suggesting) would really push high-sec citizens into null sec. if they wanted to be out here they already would be. it's not as bad as the op and others make it out to be. those are excuses and rationals to justify decisions made because it's easier in empire and the majority like the path of least resistance more than the path of challenge."
"that is flat out wrong. we have 6 or 7 fulltime, very pro industrialists in our corp, and they not only pay market rates for every last unit of minerals they can get from the rest of us in an effort to persaude us to recover rat loot, they have to import minerals by the multiple freighterload weekly. they can't build enough ships for us either.how on earth you could think a single player can cover the mineral and manufacturing requirements of an active 0.0 corp escapes me. do you think we do a once-per-week t1 cruiser op, then go back to ratting?if we had 20 full time miners doing nothing but strip belts every minute they played, they still wouldn't cover our mineral requirements. we dont have 20, or anything like. reducing our requirements such that 17 full time miners still couldn't cover them wouldn't change anything for us except the number of ships and minerals we import from empire."
"i think you are missing the point somewhat. some don't want to be there, because it is inefficient and lacking in things to do. the people who will go for the crappy 0.0 are already there, but that is no reason not to buff it, so people with differing interest could find it appealing too. i for one enjoy pvp, but it is just one thing among many and i'm not interested in limiting my other playstyles just to escape the limiting rules of empire. the thing that keeps me currently mainly in empire isn't just the security, but the richness of the interactions and better rewards. i can't avoid working for isk, but i can do it so much easier in empire, with several different playstyles and there are never times i don't have many different things available to do. in 0.0 i'm mainly reduced to shooting npcs and the income from them in actuality is a fraction of what i can make in empire. the no rules pvp in 0.0 is fine and all that, but currently living full time in 0.0 isn't worth the limits it puts on your income and other activities. challenge is also fine but i enjoy other things besides pvp and i'm not a masochist, so i'll try to minimize the time it takes to grind my isk."
"i'm a low sec dweller, but i assume the same problem applies with some gradient to all regions outside of high-sec:non-pvpers have no real reason to go there.the suggestions to buff industry outside of the large hubs sounds very good to me. after all, facing logistics problems and smaller markets is not exactly encouraging if there is no compansating factor"
"you read what you cite? \"a single player can already cover most of the industrial need of a corporation save the raw mineral gathering (but npc loot can cover a good percentage of that and high sec import the rest).\"1) i single character can run up to 11 industrial jobs, and a simple player with 1 account 33.so your 6-7 very pro industrialist can run at least 60 jobs fulltime, more than 400 bs/day. how many people in your corp to need more production? your corp info say 193, so 1 industrialist every 30 people to you seem a high quantity? ok, probably you have a big capship program, so the components require time, but again those 6 industrialist have 2 alts that can be easily trained to build them. note that the word is player, not character. 2) \"save the raw mineral gathering (but npc loot can cover a good percentage of that and high sec import the rest)\". seem pretty clear that 1 player can't get all the minerals for the whole corporation, but, in my experience, ratting cover a good 30-50% of middle and high ends needs (save morphite), and that for me is a good percentage. the high ends can be, generally, gathered on site be a few miners in a good quantity, and the rest is imported by high sec, as yourself attest in your post. again, if you have a big capship program you need truckloads of tritanium and other low ends, but, for what i know, no one want to mine them in 0.0. even increasing all the 0.0 minerals yield i don't see why people would mine super velspater instead of super araknor or bistot, so the problem will stay the same. a few less high end imports at most. honestly, if you have 6-7 industrialist characters it probably mean you have 2-3 industrialist players. making your production more efficient will not push you toward recruiting more players to do the industrial work.you say that those 6-7 characters can't cope with production.why you haven't recruited more people for the job?"

"we have fully articulated turrets with nice effects but frankly when it comes to cool looking weapons once again caldari gets the shaft. common a large blob of light comming out of the center of your ship isn't a good effect for missiles. it's a copout. i propose to make missile launchers visible articulated turrets that serve to add realism to missile launches. an example of what i am talking about would be the drake. right now it has 8 clearly visible launchers but instead of the expected swarm of missiles comming out of them we get the usual blob of light comming out of a compleatly unrelated part of the ship. i think it's high time ccp buckled down and gave the caldari somthing nice if we have to suck at pvp at least make our missiles look cooler"
"supporting my own topic"
"good idea. thought about the same thing."
"yes please"
"the missiles are coming from the center due to optimization and missiles having real flight paths unlike projectiles.this can however be fixed imo by keeping the flight path from the center in terms of the game mechanics, while visually the missiles should be flying from the launchers and follow along the path created by the game mechanical missile position without being forced all into one lump.in this way the game mechanics remain simple, while the visuals will be stunning as the missile group is launched in a quick sequence. after quickly accelerating towards the same point they start the dance of the missiles."
"i support this too. one other thing i noticed is that turrets have a much better ability to fire at random times from a ship, whereas missles seem to have definite one-second clumps of shots, i.e. in a drake when you hit f1-f7 to fire your missles they either all fire simultaneously at the beginning of the launch cycle or some will fire initially, another set will fire one second afterwards, and if you have a straggler you'll get one or two more missles one second after the second set.if ccp could get both visual missle launcher turrets and allow for more randomized timing of the launches it would be visually quite stunning (imagine the coolness of the graphics and sound from a stream of randomly timed torpedos hitting a target in rapid succession, instead of them all happening in big blobs one second apart from each other)."
"without a total ship modelling overhaul, visible missile hardpoints won't be around for a very long time however the missile hit effects are due for some serious changes."
"rec"
"i too would like to see better missile effects."
"even i, as someone who hates missiles with a passion, think this is a good idea."
"not supported because it defies game logic:an afterburner simply provides addtional thrust to the ships normal sub-lightspeed drive system.a warp (or micro-warp) drive is supposed to operate by warping a pocket of space/time around the ship, which is precisely why it doesnt work in 'dead' space."
"and the reason you cannot activate afterburner and microwarpdrive simultaneously is because mwd both provides additional thrust and warps space. not, if it is scrammed and cannot warp space, it will still attemt to do so, producing enormous amount of various effects,emissions and minor distruption of space, which is why it is so much easier to lock for your sensors, but the afterburner component will still function properly."
"needed changes should not be avoided simply because it favors one group more than another.needed changes should not be avoided simply because they disagree with your precious rp. the game's setting should be made to fit the desired game play models. we can always say that advances in mwd technology have allowed it at least some level of functionality in deadspace, etc."
"we've already changed it so that exploration sites allow mwd use. we plan to do the same for mission sites, but that will be part of a much larger renovations project that incorporates other changes as well. it's already on the agenda, though."
"thank you for this insight. i look forward to this implementation"
"wormhole mechanics are fine as is.if you really want to kill people in wh space, let them enter and warp away, then drop a bubble on their exit and go get them."

"here we go again. you think you know what i intended with this system but you are wrong.there will be easy missions alongside the more complex/challenging missions.you might wanna respond to my posts before you continue on that line, you are not providing anything constructive and if i said you thought missions should give the players 100 million isk every time by shooting a noob frigate i wouldn't be correct now would i?but if i did roam these forums for any thread you post in that is related to level 4 missions and told people that is how you thought about it you wouldn't be very happy and i wouldn't be very constructive now would i?so, once again. i've kept every players experience and skills in mind and it doesn't matter if you have been here since 2003 or joined yesterday. you will eventually lose a ship running missions and you will have the power to decide what mission you want to subscribe to. if you happen to subscribe to all the most difficult missions out of greed or sheer stupidity then you only have yourself to blame.the easier missions are there and they might not be as lucrative as the difficult ones but that's what risk vs reward is and that is what is missing from the current system. as it is now, once you've run a mission you know what it's about and can fit or fly to counter it. being able to complete it perfectly every time and only get better at it. the reward is there but the risk is gone because the only reason you would lose a ship in that situation would be if you forgot to activate your tank and that is a user error and doesn't make the mission any more risky.i have been running level 4 missions for 2 years and counting, last time i lost a ship in a mission was more than 19 months ago and that was because of user error. i thought i was running a different mission than i actually was running."
"the forum has eaten the long reply, so short version:i say that your are trying to balance mission around old players with good ships because it is the way your idea will work.re-read what you wrote in your long presentation (read it like it was some other guy presentation, don't add what is only in your head and don't think it will work as you think it will work, think about what you are suggesting in your writing).there are no checks to balance mission within the same level, there is no way to reliably inform people of the difficulty of the mission in the briefing.in a lego system with computer generated descriptions a lot of mission will miss important informations that will endanger the player ship.a old player with a good ship can prepare for them even when the mission seem easy, a young player or one with a so-so ship would be destroyed even before saying \"ouch\".when i pointed it out the first time your reply was:that remind me of a old joke about statistic, the one where \"a guy with the head in a oven and the feet in a freezer enjoy a perfect temperature\".you reply is on the same wavelength: there are plenty of mission between wick you can chose so some of them are of the right difficulty for you. forgetting that there is no reliable way to chose them."
"the \"player fits\" on npcs won't work. sleepers are generic and still create enough of a nightmare if one is not properly prepared. a decent fit ship is hard enough to solo in an equal hull, adding just 1 or 2 such ships to a spawn will make some missions nigh impossible.the last paragraph concerning a competitive element has a huge potential for a low-sec mission boost. basically offering another tier to mission running if you are willing to run the risks;- create new low-sec only corporate divisions with speciality items/prices in lp store (has to really matter for people to want to risk life and limb).- reduce or eliminate sec. status hits inside dynamic/competitive mission ded space, creating true competition - dynamic/competitive ded spaces can be probed out after \"activation\" (ie. warped to). low signature like the hard-to-nail exploration sites.maybe make a bunch of small mission arcs using that fancy tool ccp has for them. nothing major, but 3-5 steps each would go a long way towards making things a little more interesting if mixed up enough.no matter what you do it will become \"same old\" after a while though . a truly dynamic mission system would be such an insane drain on server resources that it is a practical impossibility (or so i presume). \"restricting\" it to a small number of agents in low-sec should be possible without killing off all hamsters in the first hour and could increase low-sec populations quite a lot if done right."
"i am in general a 0.0 alliance player, and i've dabbled enough in missions to make a safe buck to make it recently to level 4 missions.something i noticed that wasn't new to me, but did fly against many suggestions made by the ccp guides for missions came to my attention. the issue is aggro and more specifically how npc aggro works on missions in relation to player drones.the guide would tell you to manage aggro, only pulling a few ships at a time as pulling an entire grouping would be near impossible unless you have a very heavily tanked ship, and enough skills trained to keep in the fight. however, with a drone boat, such as the dominix i currently use, managing aggro is nearly impossible; as the npc's as current, will attack your drones even if not pulled. now with my current skill set i can manage pulling every npc at once so they don't kill my drones making me defenseless.however, i got to thinking that players less skilled would probably not easily be able to accomplish this feat, and would have to resort to buying new ships, different tactics etc, that they may not have training for. thusly increasing the displeasure of the experience for the player.so the proposal i would make is to change npc aggro sensitivity to work in the same way as they do in relation to the player ship on missions. the correct npc ships would only attack the drones if they entered the same proximity or agressed the npc's the same way as they treat the player. i think for those of us who use drones, this would make the overall experience much much more enjoyable."
"i have a small idea, maybe its a bit crazy but here it goes.i would like all sov holding structures (flags or whatever) in 0.0 to be invaulnerable/unlockable untill there is a war declaration and it would be impossible to plant structures that would threaten sov without a wardec.i.e. only entitys at war can attack the sov of each other.this would enable the entitys that are at war in 0.0 to be at war everywhere as it should be (total war). no hiding in low/high sec.if 2 alliance fleets are in a fight to the death jump through one gate then suddenly they cant shoot each other.this would ofc not prevent entitys allied to the attacker (that are not at war) to raid/harrass the target in 0.0 but they could not attack sov without a war dec.this might allso be used as a diplomatic system/tool to end wars. surrendering with the option of handing over 'systems' items and/or isk for a peace treaty that would last for x days/months/years.if a peace treaty is signed with terms for 6 month peace treaty then the attacker/defender entity couldnt wardec (attack the sov) of the enemy for that time. ofc he could still pvp with them.ofc this can be abused with moving all corp/alliance members under a new flag. but this would rather be the exeptions imho."
"i didn't want to be the one to tell you this but 0.0 is 0.0 because you dont have to pay concord to let you kill people."
"well corp vs corp 2m/week? and alliance to alliance 50m/week? what is that compared to the multi-million/billion 'bill' every 0.0 corp/alliace has to pay to 'concorde' every week for just holding the sov!now with domination, capturing sov will be much easyer/faster and each corp/alliance holding less sov (cost of sov) then it is likely that long wardecs wont be neccesary.btw. regarding the sov payments to concord.. please, pretty please with cherry on top, come up with somthing better.rather have some 'special fuel' or some material that is only sold by npc (empire and/or pirate) that was very expensive and small. logistics wouldnt be an issue, but somone might try and pirate the logistic guy with the expensive fuelsov structure: units/day (each unit 1m3).tcu: 2/dayih: 1/daymaybe a second cheaper material for the upgreade structures?anything better than just bill to concord or some empire entity.if we roleplay a bit, what would concorde do if you didnt pay the sov bill, come and pod you"
"this is a pretty good idea but it would probably be a issues client side in any sort of large fleet. 500ships with 500 different paint jobs spread across lets say 20 ship types that would add 480 more textures then the current client needs to render and buffer.i'd say it might be a good idea around 2011/2012 when hopefully ccp will force people to at least directx 9.0c with sm3.0 if not dx10 with sm4.0 for min requirements. which would be anything newer then a nvidia geforce 6 series or radeon x1k series."
"i think this is a good idea i want to see ccp force upgrades to higher direct x levels but frankly they do need to keep direct x 9 support since people are going to be using xp till the end of time. putting directx 10 suport would be nice"
"pink up me world."
"client side issues, if there were any , can be dealt with by simply making color varients a check box in graphic settings. plenty of people play on low graphics with no audio. this is some long-over due fluff for those of us operating on maximum graphics with no lag. :d"
"i like this idea and it should hopefully be a simple change.we have people who put up corp contracts of ready fitted ships and it is a pain for them to time out before they are all used up."
"if the abillity to manually set standings would be removed ?it is a thought that haunted me for a long time now and i dont have the eve insight to comprehent the consequences."
"interesting...so, we are to trust you? can you seriously tell us how you are more trust worthy than larkonis trassler?i must say, ccp disappoints me greatly. what is the process that they vet out candidates for the csm? do they look at petitions for people? do they look at eula violations? do they look at the hundreds of petitions for harassment in game and out of game?i wonder how they missed this one. he's another larkonisgate in the making."
"he's a worthless griefer, why does this surprise you? he sits on a gate all day and preys on helpless noobs. that's not what a real man does."
"if it were not such a sad person running there would be humor in this. seriously, this is truly sad.this guy makes it onto the csm, we are only going to hear about how he's been kicked because he beat the crap out of someone who refused to agree with his half baked fail agenda."
"noticed it happen a few times during pvp (although this could be atributed to lag) where you tell your drones to return to bay and they flat out ignore you. i have also seen it in missons with multiple agro you tell it a ship to shoot and the drone icon dose flick over to the desired target with all 5 drones if you hover the mouse over it then about a second later it will switch back and shoot whatever random it feels like (usualy the triger heh)"
"ah yes the returning...that's the only problem i have discovered occasionally but it could be atributed to lag alone."

"erik read a text message from ankhaywert68732tr6gd out loud at the csm3 summit in iceland loli liked erik finengan he was cool to hang out with irl, but the guy was really clueless about a lot of game mechanics and i generally think the take care party has been a counter-productive influence on the csm"
"counterproductive to the goon agenda, i'm sure, yes.as for the text message, erik asked me rather specific factional warfare question iirc, which he didn't know the answer to. he asked me, not the other way around. i bet you didn't know the answer either, so glad to have been of service.it's not really a political party, its more of a think tank, so that all players can have a say and the csm representative really represents the players instead of them going \"gee, thanks for the free tickets, bye\" and you never hearing a word till the next load of vague election promises.the reason i founded this organisation back in early 2008 was that i wanted to represent as broad a section of the playerbase and i knew my knowledge was lacking in certain aspects, mainly 0.0 and industry mechanics. but there were quite a few knowledgeable players in these areas, which didn't have the will to run for csm themselves at that time. z0d was one of those back then. we got together and i agreed to confer with them after the elections, so that i benefited from their experience and they got a say in things in return. the organisation grew over time, as i started receiving a lot of lengthy emails during my time on the csm, and players wished to discuss their ideas and feedback with me.one of the things i consider important to the csm is continuity, and after csm1 we saw a few csm leaving, with their remaining issues being orphaned. in addition documentation became cluttered. i started organizing this in my wiki, which was later integrated in the evelopedia by omber zombie. but i realized, that all of my knowledge would be lost after i had served two terms on the csm. this is why take care got together and appointed erik as representative for csm3, i went to berlin in person to talk him through all of the remaining issues csm1 and csm2 have dealt with and what ccp's replies and promises were.zastrow may criticize erik for not having much knowledge about the game mechanics (i'm sure that his gap in knowledge is limited to 0.0 and fw mechanics, though), but the reason we picked him is that he has been altruistic, not having ego issues nor being a prima donna as we've unfortunately seen on past csms. the csm is about bringing people with different views together and working together.now how can you players contribute to take care? send us emails, come up with ideas and discuss them! when you see us online, come talk to us. we bring like-minded individuals together and have some group discussions if possible, and then hopefully draft a post on the assembly hall so the csm can take the matter to ccp."

"greetings, my name is teadaze and i'm here to ask for you to vote in the upcoming csm 4 elections. of course i would be very happy if you decide i am the right candidate for your vote(s) but the most important thing is that you do vote for somebody.eve is a unique place with a vibrant and diverse community and where players can shape the news and even the game itself. the csm is an important part of this, taking player ideas and issues, filtering them and finally passing the best to ccp for a response. as the csm is under a greater deal of scrutiny due to recent events i feel it is important to vote for candidates who take the responsibility seriously. it is in the best interests of the players to vote and continue to post issues in the assembly forum because it shows ccp that the csm process is worth supporting further.about mei have been playing eve since 2005 and currently specialise in 0.0 small gang pvp but like many people i started as an empire carebear running missions. for a while was a member of a space-holding alliance, i also dabble in market trading, have an alt in factional warfare, run a reaction pos and am involved with low scale t2 production via invention so have a wide variety of game experience to draw on. i was selected to be one of the commentators for at7 and was also invited to be on stage commentating at fanfest.i teach classes with agony unleashed to help players new to pvp to find their feet.out of game i am a senior software developer with an engineering degree and 10 years of experience in the profession.what can i offer?i take the csm process seriously and will put in the necessary effort. during at7 i spent many hours on research and with a couple of the other experts produced many of the notes used while in iceland. i am methodical and committed to researching any subject raised by the players thoroughly.i have a wide breadth of eve knowledge including areas outside of my primary pvp focus. i will listen to feedback from players on any issue and ensure items are presented to the csm as proposed by the players before the csm make any amendments (accurate representation).i will attempt to get correspondence to the players in a timely manner. some of this might be out of the csms control, but in that case the playerbase need to be kept updated even if it is to say that ccp haven't yet published the supplied material.risk should be rewarded. for example i'm looking towards lowsec players for suggestions on how to improve it. if people want to stay in empire that is fine, but those wanting a riskier path should find it worthwhile to do so (carrot not stick).i'm in favour of (where possible) buffing a weaker item instead of nerfing stronger ones. i feel that not all ships need to be good at solo pvp and that racial differences should be maintained rather than homogenizing everything. that said balance is important and must be maintained in some way. if an item is nerfed (such as webs or sensor damps) then in most cases specialised ships that have bonuses to that item need a slight buff to maintain some balance (looking at minmatar and gallente recons here).dominion is being released a day before the csm results are published. it is likely the majority of issues raised to the fourth csm will be related to those changes. however i want to ensure that whilst any issues resulting from dominion (sov changes, faction ships etc) are addressed that other topics are still submitted too.some of you might agree with my position but might have specific issues, i will try to address some of the common ones in a further post.i will be happy to answer any questions you have.tl:drvote for teadaze!"
"why vote for me (and not another 0.0 candidate)?it is likely the large 0.0 alliances will be well represented on the csm without additional votes from players outside those alliances. their combined block voting will take around four or five of the nine available seats (going on previous results).whilst i live in 0.0 i don't have political connections to any space holding alliances. i represent a different style of 0.0 play. agony (and others) base out of npc 0.0 (a current necessity for station access without getting into naps) and roam around looking for targets. i wish to ensure this remains viable post dominion and beyond and represent the smaller gangs which move fast, hit hard and gtfo (or explode spectacularly, it is all good )why vote for me (and not another pvp candidate)?as an instructor with agony unleashed i have taught hundreds of players how to take their first steps in pvp and have a good understanding of the challenges they face. i want to help educate players in how to survive in pvp and maybe they will get the same pvp bug that i did.as i stated above, i wish to ensure that small gang roaming pvp remains viable to all. this is applicable to low sec as well as 0.0 dwellers. i know agony have a reputation for only flying frigates, but rest assured we fly every ship class in game to some degree and when i say small roaming gangs i mean subcapital ships with between 2-20 pilots.i support many forms of pvp even though i prefer 0.0 roaming. this includes piracy, gate camping and even pos bashing (just don't ask me to join in). i prefer a policy of educating people in how to avoid obvious ganks rather than attempting to remove current tools in place (don't break the sandbox). however that isn't to say that some things shouldn't be made a bit more tricky.i am a ccp certified pvp expert why vote for me if you live in lowsec?because i hadn't spent time with factional warfare since it was released i put an alt back into fw recently and have been splitting my time between fw missions, small roaming gangs and larger fleets. i know people have ideas for improvements and will look into any raised armed with my recent experiences there.whilst i am not a pirate, i have a good relationship with many pirate corps and understand their game style. it is a valid form of pvp even if not to everybody's taste. as i said above, i support risk vs reward and this appears to need looking at in lowsec.why vote for me if you live in empire?there may be other candidates that are a better fit for people who live in empire, however i feel i can still represent your needs.i have experience of being a carebear (missions and mining) and understand some of the frustrations there.i trade, run a pos do low scale manufacturing so have better than simple background knowledge in those areas.i help many people to get into the mindset of pvp even if they decide that style of play is not for them.so ends my wall of texttl:drno matter what playstyle i can promise i would look at your proposals and submit the best to the next csm meeting for voting.vote for teadaze"
"hey tea,i think people might like to hear your thoughts on dev focus after dominion comes online. could you expand on your statement above? where do think they should be putting their effort?spin"
"i think this relates to this point listed above.by this i imply that for the larger space holding alliances there will be many specific sov 0.0 issues that need to be looked at asap once dominion hits. whilst i agree that due to the level of changes a great deal of csm effort will be expended in analysing player concerns about the new mechanisms for sov, titan and supercarriers; i would aim to discuss other long-standing issues directly relevant to other aspects of the game too.including but not limited toquality of life changes such as shared corp bookmarks.balance issues such as the assault ships 4th bonus, minmatar and gallante reconsfollowing up any of the previously raised items that have not had a responsesome issues raised between now and one week before the first csm #4 meetingthe csm is supposed to reflect the whole playerbase and if elected to csm #4 i will attempt to reflect that on the issues raised."
"you've got my vote."
"got my vote!"
"supported, you have my three votes."
"as a longtime experienced player, ceo of various 0.0 corporations and friend of ahsekuaw; it is my honest opinion and perception that ahsekuaw holds dear the many values that we as pilots should come to hope for in a candidate to represent us. ahsekuaw has remained one of the very few in my many travels that has consistently done his best to remain understanding and considerate of others and their respective needs.i feel his hands-on analysis of game mechanics, his interest in the welfare of this game and it's participants makes him one of the best candidates for csm.i endorse this ancients. product."
"eve tribune's zarch aldain interviews me on my candidacy for csm 4. you can find it at:"
"i would settle for the ability to easily share bookmarks among a fleet. something like a \"share bookmark to fleet\" option (maybe this would make the scout marker useful!).fyi: there are shortcuts (unused by default) that you can set for \"engage target,\" \"return and orbit,\" and \"return to drone bay.\" i believe the lack of \"launch drones\" is because for ships with more than 5 drones, which are you launching? i guess they could possibly allow you to set a shortcut to launch members of the a particular folder/group, but that could lead to a lot of groups.if you sort the unused shortcuts by description (and why would you sort by anything else?) you should find them near the top starting with the \"drone:\" prefix or something like that.i use control e for engage, control s for orbit, and control d for return to drone bay.coolwhich part is clunky? because i love the dev that put in the \"specific item\" and minimum price fields (why scroll through the countless 800k wtb contracts on 700m isk items)?i think more sophisticated ais could be added to l5's since their low sec locations mean fewer people run them (which means fewer people run them at the same time in the same system). as ccp has said, sleeper ai is more taxing on the system. it uses a combination of damage taken and net effect on the target into consideration.but even if l5's were being considered, they aren't utilized enough to justify developer time (that is better directed towards fixing rockets).i thought low sec was for people that couldn't make enough friends to push into null sec. i kid (mostly)."

"+2 votes for you sir."

"csm raised 61 issues with ccp, including some funny stuff like switching char without relogging, and they didnt talk about the scanner fix (which was the most requested topic in assembly hall with more then 60 pages), even if they promised they would."
"thank you."

"my blogepisode 9 on planet risk where i had a chance to speak. herei do not have a huge force behind me, i am counting on people who probably don't read the forums for that sort of thing. i am just a casual player . .. more carebear than pvp because i do not have the funds to replace lost ships. more missions than mining because i can only stare at a screen of rocks for so long. more comedy and sarcasm than is warranted because i like to have fun when i game.this is a game, not a second job.i entered into the race to try to help make the game better, not different. i seem to be in the minority in that i don't have a dozen planks to my platform, i am supposed to be a representative of the player base, not an unpaid game dev, figuring out all the bugs and fixes by myself. that being said i would like to see the ui get smoother and the sandbox continue to be what it is, all things to all people. pvp for those who want it. relative (but not total) safety for those who want pve. consequences for actions that you take, no matter what those actions are.my name is mike azariah in game . . . in real life i teach high school . . . math and sciences. i am used to dealing with tears, whining, and griefing (think back to your own high school days) i do not flinch in calling things as i see them and when it is bull**** . . . i call that, too. (not on the best terms with admin, at times)if you are reading this you have probably already made up your mind who you are voting for. fine. but if you have 3 votes, how about tossing one towards a normal player . . . one who is still saving for the next shiny ship. who has only one account and enjoys the game in moderation? one who is not trying to make his career the best and the only true way  to play. my name is mike azariah and i am asking for your vote(s)mike"
"i'm looking for the candidate that will (verbally) beat ccp about the head and shoulders until they revert once again to they find a way to allow (at the very minimum) the major rp alliances to participate in fw. it is absolutely ridiculous that ccp has decided that the two oldest participants in the faction war -- having been fighting the war since long before fw existed and even before alliances existed -- will continue to be excluded from the fw mechanics. this after years of bashing our heads against them, finally getting them to agree to allow us access. now with a slight tweak to their proposed changes, they've written us back out of the story.so, which candidate can convince me they actually care about rp issues, and mine in particular?"
"from the finally published csm-ccp september meeting notesso perhaps the wheels are already in motion..."
"that is the very quote that has made me upset; i've emphasized the key words. this would exclude both cva and ushra'khan from participatipating. these are two of the oldest alliances in the game, and have been rping the faction war since the early days of eve. then ccp finally started working on the mechanics we'd been waiting to see for so long. and when the 24th imperial crusade was formed to reclaim minmatar lowsec, the group responsible for the largest territory increase in centuries (cva) was told to go home, and when the tribal liberation force was formed to break the chains of our kin, the oldest freedom-fighting alliance in the game (u'k) was told that our phone number would be blocked if we kept calling.since then, we've been told that they were working on mechanics to fix that oversight ... and now this.so, my question stands. which candidate actually cares about rp and will fight to get ccp to understand what all those letters in mmorpg stand for, as opposed to all of the ones in the csm currently winding down?"
"interesting...so, we are to trust you? can you seriously tell us how you are more trust worthy than larkonis trassler?i must say, ccp disappoints me greatly. what is the process that they vet out candidates for the csm? do they look at petitions for people? do they look at eula violations? do they look at the hundreds of petitions for harassment in game and out of game?i wonder how they missed this one. he's another larkonisgate in the making."
"he's a worthless griefer, why does this surprise you? he sits on a gate all day and preys on helpless noobs. that's not what a real man does."
"if it were not such a sad person running there would be humor in this. seriously, this is truly sad.this guy makes it onto the csm, we are only going to hear about how he's been kicked because he beat the crap out of someone who refused to agree with his half baked fail agenda."
"that's a lot of \"i\"s in your blog you got there... i'm happy that you think you know where a game played by 300,000 others should go.still, one can see you put a lot of work and thought into some of your ideas, so i imagine it won't be the end when the goons vote you in."
"yes, let's ignore the events a few months back. i remember they hated the idea of salvaging carrying aggression-flags.but at the same time, i guess the real scares were always in wardecs so you're probably right.one would hope that they finally have small and medium turrets trained to level 5 by now. oooh... shiny."
"first of all, thank you to all those who support the ideology of our newly formed political party, and thank you to everyone who has decided to give yoursupport to logit probit for the next csm. we are still in our infancy as a political party, but rest assured that we will be fighting for your rights as a player as we expand our sphere of influence.the sandbox preservation party supports salvaging in its current implementation, as ccp has deemed that the salvage found in a wreck belongs to the first person that gets to it. we do not support mission runners having ownership of the salvage. however, personally, i pray to be shot at when i am salvaging a mission as i loot every single mission that i scan down. that's my playstyle though, not all ninjas will loot. some ninjas will only collect salvage from the wrecks - again, salvage that has no legal owner until it is picked up. the fact of the matter is that given the opportunity, 95% of mission runners will not shoot at a ninja salvager, even if they have aggro rights, i wouldn't expect them to start shooting if the salvage ownership mechanics were changed.but...the formation of the party is not about suddenly ninjas or ninja salvaging. it is about the preservation of the sandbox as a whole, with ninja salvaging only being a small part of the larger picture.an example of the downfall of the sandbox would be the recent changes to aggro mechanics. a little known fact is that there used to be a way for players to extend the aggro timer, effectively allowing you to bring justice to those who had aggressed you. keep in mind, this mechanic was not an exploit but a legitimate tactic.however, ccp has recently changed this game mechanic so that it is not as effective as it once was, and now the aggro timer will eventually run out. the tactic still works, it's just very limited now - which in itself assists the perpetrator in escaping justice. i don't know about you, but i find that pretty restrictive, and a definitely blow to the preservation of the sandbox. there have been countless other changes, including increased response times by concord and the increased security status hit for aggression in empire space.the sandbox preservation party is not looking to dominate the csm or the direction of eve. we simply support players who have an open mind and who wish to be equally represented on the csm. players who choose to play the game as it was meant to be played - as a completely open-ended universe, playable in virtually anyway you choose. you want to suicide gank? fine. you want to mine? awesome.right now, our web address (www.savethesandbox.org) is forwarded to a post on my blog supporting logit probit for csm. i'm looking to make a more official page sometime in the future, so stay tuned for that.save the sandbox. power to the players.velocity primechairman, the sandbox preservation party"
"i would support a space libertarian except there's already a candidate for that (it's me lol)"
"i think that without a crystal ball, it will be difficult to determine what, if any, changes any patch will make that will with any degree of certainty dictate a limitation or restriction of any pre-ordained activity beyond the actual actions of the activity itself.what does that mean? it means by the changes in dominion we're seeing an obvious and wholesale beating of the 0.0 big boy alliances. ninja is capitalizing on this travesty by offering up a political party with this as an example on which to launch a platform.it is important to remember that we are not psychics or fortune tellers. there are many changes that people have wildly differing opinions on, so determining that a change \"drastically impairs a particular activity in game\" is indeed no metric at all. it is a parlor trick intended on riling your anger to sweep your wind into their sails.the basis of political parties in eve should rely on economics (the cold hard reality upon which this universe derives all meaning), the will of provider (ccp, with the design, development and corporate backbone of the game we love), and the will of the consumer (the person footing the bill for all this fun). any party would want to divide their policies and platforms along these lines if they are to provide cogent and defensible positions on any topic.please don't bring meaningless rhetoric to our game. if we are to have parties let them be born of reason and logic with meaningful things to debate. enough with the slander and doomsayer predictions. bring facts, figures, polls.information is power. use it wisely."
"i filled out my questions."
"was i supposed to do homework?val just make some stuff up that sounds like me"
"when will voting start and when will vote match start?"
"sorry. the comments you made gave me the impression you hadn't read the thread.so let me explain myself better and maybe, correct me if i am wrong here trzzbk, clarify trzzbk's point a bit.the idea isn't to force a different style of play on anyone. it's to prevent people from hiding in npc corps. that doesn't mean you necessarily. some entire corps will empty out into npc corps if they are wardec'd just to avoid the war. this, and other similar practices make npc corps, as they exist now, problematic.under my proposal this, goon inspired, aspect would make it more difficult to get int,o and stay in, an npc corp. they would be standing dependent and would be more expensive to be in. another thing i thought of today, that expands on the npc corp reinforcements idea would be that any system, regardless of sec level, would provide npc combat ship support to members of the npc corp(s) that owned that system. that would provide added value for the higher isk costs of being in that npc corp and also add another interesting aspect to the game.so, to recap this concept:starter npc corp kicks you to an intermediate npc corp at some point, either determined by sp or time, not sure yet.options for which intermediate npc corp you move to is determined by your sec status, root faction standing, or some other measurement. the higher that number the better npc corp you have the option to join. (this point is important. this mechanic would help ensure that players that are serious about being in an npc corp make up the vast majority of members of npc corps. it would also help to prevent most people from hiding in npc corps on a whim.better npc corps have lower taxes, better services, etc.better npc corps are more costly to war dec, to the point of being nearly cost prohibitive but not impossible.lower end npc corps are cheaper to war dec, but easier to hop in and out of.implementation of this change would be fairly simple. once implemented, a grace period would begin that would allow current members of all npc corps to meet the requirements of the corp, or move on either to a real corp or to another npc corp."
"just thought of another idea that could be used in addition to, or instead of, the last idea...introduce a mechanic that makes leaving a corp, en mass, less attractive from the perspective of the corp as an entity. perhaps a corp standing hit or some other condition that would be easily absorbed by standard membership turnover but would be dramatic in the case of a mass exodus.i dunno though. the more i think about this the more i think this is like can flipping, ninja salvage, or several other things that will be lop sided no matter what you do. you can't make it impossible to quit a corp. so people could always go somewhere, even temporarily. if you make quitting take longer it's only going to impede legitimate player circulation. and even so, a determined corp may have a couple sets of alts in other corps they can shelter in or, worst case scenario, they can all quit, start a new corp and make the war chase them.one thing everyone can probably agree on is that this game is chock full of cowardly, yet clever, *******s. even if everyone, in this case, is talking about everyone but themselves and their buddies. yah, i dunno. i think this one will require some critical thinking. this csm candidate is going to smoke a bowl and think on it. and inhalation is absolutely going to happen... i leave you with this to think about:please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
"discussion on ganking, security changes in high sec, new rules for joining and staying in npc corps, and making the game generally more interesting for everyone here."
"i was under the impression that eve university wasn't about 'dealing with newbies' as one of you has put it. it is about taking new pilots and showing them all the things the game can be. in other words a player run 'new player experience'. look to the corps that some of these 'new player friendly' candidates are in. tell me if their actions back up their words.i am a common face in the help channel. i am not an instructor ingame but i help where i can. a few others who are running are also worthy of consideration by the university. i would point you towards teadaze and song li. yes, i can say when a competitor is good because i want the best for the csm and the game i want to see someone like me (or me) get elected. should the university step behind one candidate? probably not. they should read and evaluate and vote from an informed position.but i would appreciate being part of that consideration.mike azariahmike"
"just to make sure, eve university do not explicitly support any one candidate - any slogans or mentions in this thread should not be taken as a sign of support from eve university."
"i would agree to boosting the black ops only if there were concurrent defenses implemented to provide both:a) on-grid cloaking detection/aoe decloaking possibilities.b) sovereignty holder anti-afk cloaker possibilities.currently the black-ops is primarily a logistical tool for sb/recon gangs, and for that they are very effective. if there were tools to counter cloakers, offensively, not just using bait and hoping they make a mistake, then i'd be all-for increasing their jump/portal range far enough to make some of the very long inter-region leaps such as to the drone region from the north.--krum"

"the first paragraph there sums it up pretty well as i see it. even with comparable damage bonuses, blasters deal inferior damage at inferior range compared to lasers. the armor rep bonus is not nearly as bad as the mwd cap penalty bonus though - medium size blasterboats aren't going to win fleet battles, so the dps they are likely to be subject to isn't too large for a good active rep tank to have an effect and switching it to a res bonus takes a lot of the flavor away. perhaps an ab bonus instead?"
"it's a good idea, but maybe it should require a special module and skill?"
"supported for moms, since they can't dock.i would like to see some kind of fuel consumed, though. possibly tritanium?"
"omg, yes. i've groused about this in the past on my blog. it's a much needed change. my preference is a 2-hour reduction per level. total reduction should never exceed 12 hours in any event. some other ideas/options:could require infomorph psychology to level v before you can train it. could require a skill and an implant to make it work...an implant that requires cybernetics to v. i'm sure there are others (didn't read the whole thread yet). anything that forces a choice would be fine. whatever, but please give us a choice to be able to reduce the time between clone jumps."

"eve's ui is archaic, bulky, busy, space consuming, and overwhelming, there are easier ways to display 90% of the information, both in a prettier way, and a more space efficent way, and with the planetary updates in dominion, we'll be pretty much set for graphics changes, except for the ui that is, which looks remarkably like some of the early versions of windows. what would the new ui look like? well personally i would like to see that holographic interface used in the eve trailers recently put into the game proper, i think it would really add something. but i leave the specifics up to the community at large, the only requirements of this new ui would be:*conservation of space: currently eve is spreadsheets online, i find that in half of my combat encounters i'm basically instrument flying using the overview, and have so many windows open i can't see what i'm shooting.*ease of use: the ui is a signifigant part of the barrier to entry to eve, its just so complex that it overwhelms most people, it doesn't need to, most of the information could be presented much better and much more clearly.*adaptable assets: this is more of an expansion on what is already ingame, you should be able to move and adjust, and relocate, pretty much every asset on the ui. allowing players to choose how to arrange all the elements would make the game much easier to work with, with these three elements, you can create a ui optimized to you personally, that fulfills its functions and makes the game better to look at."
"for too long most of my screen has been taken up by chat, scanner, overview, and local chat. time to reduce the bloat. replace local with a proper intelligence tool so it does not constantly have to be on my screen please!reams of right click menu levels have no place in a modern interface."
"i'll side with the \"keep the one mid\" crew on this one. the retri needs help, for sure, but it doesn't need to homogenize with the rest of the af out there. just like i would oppose adding a second mid slot to the coercer, the retri merely needs to be better at it's assigned role in the amarr lineup: dealing large amounts of face-melting damage are range, while tanking long enough to get the job done.yes, it could use more speed... so could all the af.rather than swapping the high down to the mid, the retribution deserves a 5th turret and concurrent increases in fitting. plus a bit more... if any ship deserved to be able to fit top-tier frigate guns without fitting mods in both lr and damage versions, it's the retri. retri could also use a higher lock-range. the ship does very well as a replacement for the destroyers (that don't work), in keeping other frigates honest. it is still, unfortunately, a questionable choice for a gang because either you should be taking a sb for the larger targets, or tackle because your gang is heavy. damage should be around sb levels, or a bit less, to make it reasonable.--krum"

"bump back to page 1. supported."
"agreed, void is absolutely useless atm, so is the high-damage railgun charge (forgot the name) they half your tracking, with void also severly cutting your falloff, need inssane amount of skills to use, and offer nearly no additional damage over navy antimatter. the range and tracking cut would be acceptable if there damage would be significantly larger, then they could be used to give small ship edge over larger ships, say frigate over a bs, or used by hacs and bs against capitals. they either need much lower penalties, or increase in efficiency."

"i don't know how could this be done but its a good idea in a odd weird messed up way. with the upgrade system in place, the more you rat, the better the rat will be ? same thing with mining and such. omg, we'll get 47m npc rats in beginner systems lol. same thing goes for mining wow.anyway, this troll but good intention in it."
"now about 60 % of the ore come from mission by reprocessing. it's clearly too high. i propose to reduce the pourcentage reprocessing from 100 % to 60 %.if you have the skill max the reprocessing will be 60 % of the ore you need to build the item."
"simply remove the loot from missions and u will see that:1 mission income is equal vs 0.0 income (risk vs reward)2 mining abc ores in 0.0 is worth it again (after adjusting drone alloys)3 manufacturing gets a boost4 t1/2/3/4 modules will have their prices corrected to the value of the mod5 ccp will lose numerous isk sellers6 ccp will lose numerous isk farmers mission runners that buy plexes anyway"
"TRUE"
"60% of the people who play this game love to make statistics up on the spot.not supported."
"i kinda agree with this proposal, especially the no meta 0 loot from missions, under one condition: that they first make mining more interesting. the reason the market is flooded with these minerals is in two parts - the missions are more interesting and more profitable.please note, i'm not saying to necessarily nerf missions, but rather to buff mining yields and/or activity while mining. however, given the game mechanics as they are now, i cannot support this proposal."
"kinda the whole point of my thread vm..... hard to recruit people when activities in 0.0 are no more remunerative than the exact same activities carried out in hi-sec, more dangerous, and ultimately harder to perform!the whole point of this thread is to present ideas on how to attract people to 0.0. because lets face it, ccp has said that they would like to see more people in 0.0, and fewer in empire. and i think we've all established that ccp is perfectly willing to take actions to improve their game (from their point of view) even if those actions would anger/upset and even *p*i*s*s* off their player base (nano-nerf anyone?).my opinion is that its better to \"attract them with honey\" (i.e. - 0.0 is better for everything than empire) than to \"force\" people out (i.e. - nerf every activity in empire).do you (or anyone else) have any ideas to contribute towards encouraging players to go to 0.0? (keeping in mind that is ccp's stated goal, whether you, me or anyone else likes it or agrees with it?)"
"here's my support. i've long held this idea for a long time. ya they've said it'd be hard. it'd be so worth it though. plus those 50,000isk docking fees would be so worth it also.also since there are 5 levels of any of those \"industry, military, strategic\" the scale can easily be made.lvl 1 - lvl 1 agentlvl 2 - lvl 2 agentlvl 3 - lvl 3 agentlvl 4 - lvl 4 agentlvl 5 - lvl 5 agentpersonally i have a feeling that treaties and these agents and a few other neat little nuggets will be coming together after a fair bit of internal testing i suspect.also technically. the agent doesnt even have to be in the station.agents in space are fairly common. you can put them @ the infrastructure hub. though doing this hurts the docking fees and such.this would mean that mean pvpers can go around killing agents everyday after downtime. so having them in every one of your systems would be good."

"ok so normal ship gives you anomalies that you can warp to using the scanner. how about make it so tech 3 ships are able to detect wormholes without probes. perhaps at the cost of being able to scan down anomalies like normal ships.could be an interesting change."
"someone got stuck in his shiny t3 cruiser?"
"the billboards at the moment are pretty boring. wouldn't it be awesome if they streamed to eve tournaments and stuff? and maybe more of them around stations, larger ones at a side of a station that cover almost half of it! and when there is are no tournaments they could stream some kind of eve chronicle with moving text+pictures. something interesting to watch while on station/gate rather than the concord \"don't do drugs!\" signs.if the quality of the in game screen was good enough (would allow a \"look at\" button to maximize the screen\"), without much transparency, i think it would be common to see a bunch of pilots just hovering around a billboard at a station or gate watching the tournaments in game. at the moment players don't really have much business with each other outside stations in high sec space.on stations i guess they would be either aligned with the undock (example 2) or just off the station at a certain angle (example 1), kind of like this: ms paint owns"
"oh, and maybe allow corporations to rent out a billboard during a certain time for some kind of commercial for contracts or mercenary hiring. the commercials would of course have guidelines and rules and would need to be approved."

"i like using spare/empty slots for offline mods to act as heatsinks and/or for later use if no station is available. problem is on-lining a module requires 75% of cap which means that i can have a rather long \"down-time\" before moving on.proposal:add a 10%/lvl reduction in cap requirement for on-lining modules in space to either energy grid upgrades or energy management or an entirely different - those just seem logical.with a maximum of 37.5% of cap drained when on-lining in space with skill maxed, fitting solutions currently impracticable open up.i personally can't see any major downside to it, but may be blind to it so feel free to point it out if you can."
"works for me, but i don't feel we need a new skill for this. maybe the racial skill for that ship? or some other skill, but not a new skill dedicated to this imo."
"for the killmail. i'm sorry but even though this is good info to give i rather want ccp to work on this problem: if i'm shooting x ship, i want that killmail even if i'm not the guy who laid the final blow. its hard enough to find out who killed him, we have to deal with the question or even order \"please post your killmail on kb\". so i support it but very very very low on my list."

"the obvious question here is \"so what would you do to make it work?\""
"that would be handy for fleet ops, but in wh space that's no more usefull then the current system nor does it help corps deceminate tactical bookmarks if they move to a new home location.i have those setup and use them all the time. but the drone interface already has a way to group drones. it would be nice to be able to hotkey those groups for launch.you can't contract a container in a ship. a good reason they're not utilised is because they're in low sec. running in a mission fit, or group of mission fits in low sec is still flying a target. if low sec missins were reconfigured to be more like a sleeper site where you need / can use pvp setups and where the ai targets new players on grid, you would balance out the odds of the missioners more. instead of a pure target, you would have a small gang that could fight back. i'm all for ways of bringing missioners into low sec. but that will require a change in current missions design or risk/reward balance."

"what is the plan for the turn around from new to old? it does affect few people however with a single role alliances can be closed, corps can be closed. personally i don't believe i'm in that position but as a good administrator of the corp i wouldn't mind being made fully aware of what's going to happen even if it means revoking everyone' roles to secure the corp assets. or am i too paranoid? it would i believe help every new character, new player and established corp if rat drops didn't drop tech 1 stuff. on the subject of industrial stuff as i've had the pleasure of learning how to use excel, access and logical mathematics to get my spreadsheet working would it be too much to ask ccp if waste could be applied in a coherent and unified manor at some point. it need not be guess work, requiring tech 2 blueprints on sisi and a kindly donation of a t2 bpc in actual game to confirm my (which i will always be happy to share even if it's not 100% correct) theory. i would like to thank the csm for standing up for the industrial side of the game. arguably the most important. not the most fashionable or the most glamorous but important nonetheless. i would like to take this opportunity to ***** my excellent audit skills when it comes to income and expenses over a period of time. what you/corp/alliance does in the future can always be based on the report i provide as long as it's over a long enough period of time, all i require is an api key capable of full wallet information retrieval, and a nominal isk amount for my time. yes i really really love access, excel and eve hq. glaring easter egg before christmas - what is the parameter ccp would like to tweak? i thought - and i could be wrong here - if a character had access to at least one corp wallet division and had the blueprint and minerals in the same division that they have query access to (currently based on roles/titles of course) - that they could build from that query division being paid from that wallet division. if i'm wrong let me know. great idea as long as both or more characters are similarly skilled up. or the quota is so large that it's done on corporation scale perhaps :d woot corp missions for empire, how can it possibly fail except to empty 0.0? agreed it's their business to record the events not make them... erm, you know what i mean. what about free station services for the controlling fw members? is eft in the new browser going to work?ccp baldur recognizes the need for short, clear and unequivocal sounds. cowbell.bye"
"you tease monsters!! you're evil. or i'm rather slow and it's been public for a while now. the thought that excited me was getting huge outposts or pos towers, even the dead horse pos that should be more popular than the beatles, and quite possible removing local from 0.4 and below.will ccp make it easier for people to import overview settings without first having to export them to create the directory? personally i play eve through the overview - whatever i am required to do i do through the overview - if i can't see it, it doesn't matter. getting new and even experienced players to actually use the tag column is more annoying than getting corp members to read the forums. suffice to say it's complicated to explain via voice.why can't a corporation or even an alliance recruit for a limited period of time an agent based in station of our choosing to provide missions and other services (locater agent maybe? at the very least) perhaps for a limited number of missions? certainly for a limited time. the price unless it's going to include a cool down period is going to be very difficult to calculate. and what would a gallente agent be doing in caldari space unless they were up to no good? just a thought.it's a role play element only as far as i'm concerned, and while i enjoy the thrill of sometimes believing i'm undocking with a few thousand souls, it's only for story related purposes. or a marriage.thank you thank you thank you"
"nice to see them finally.if you're going to continue to be a bell end about this at least get the facts straight. the changes to the scanner came less than a week before the iceland summit, too late to submit the issue to ccp officially. we badgered them about it off the record though and it is (afaik) going to be raised in one of the online meetings."

"lol yes, i am a woman in real (?) life. at 54 years old, it seems i also am the eldeest candidate this time around."
"such a pity.. carebears provide the goodies for pvpers and missioners to blow up (or get blown up.) but, each must vote for the candidate that addresses their particular concerns.. just make sure that you vote!!"
"let me be more specific.... limited high-end roids. my thoughts are along the line of a semi-random spawn within 1 (one) belt of a system spaced over a fairly lengthy period of time. i'm thinking maybe 45 to 120 days between bonus spawns per system... and perhaps to make them rarer, but available, make it 1 spawn per constellation. obviously there are some technical issues to sort out. but the idea is to provide miners with a fairly unexpected bonus.. a boost to the wallet, but not something one could build a business on.as for the moons... i'd like to see the possibility of mining moons dry. physics points to the existence of more, but less productive patches of high-end materials. so a system could reasonably have several high-end moons, but with limited draw. this would have the effect of forcing any moon miners, solo or alliance, to keep somewhat on the move. layering is another possibility. that is, the high-end materials tend to be heavier, and thus would be deeper within the moon. a layering concept would mean that one must remove a certain percentage of the lighter, mostly low-end material, before being able to access and mine the high-end.these are just some ideas that i have. what i am looking for in this thread is your ideas..."
"take care has raised this issue repeatedly after it was originally raised by inanna zuni.number 1number 2number 3ccp's reply is basically \"yeah we still want to do this but it has no priority\". i personally find the sov restriction silly as well, especially because ccp originally agreed to implement this under condition of the alliance corps all meeting a high standing requirement!so vote for z0d this round, as we have fw and roleplaying on the agenda."
"dear mister starforged, your concerns are valid. the outcome of factional warfare events does impact the backstory of eve, and this backstory is of great value to roleplayers. for this reason, it is not logical that the major roleplaying alliances are excluded from affecting the storyline direction.i agree with miss ankhesentapemkah that ruling out alliance participation in factional warfare based on the criterium of holding space is not an acceptable one. the standing requirement is a much more realistic marker, as only the most loyal roleplaying alliances can expect to meet these requirements or motivate all their members to raise corp standings to the required levels. you have my assurance that i will continue the work of our previous take care representatives and raise this issue until ccp implements it properly.thank you for voicing your concerns.z0d"
"that is just so crazy ... i suppose that way they hope to exclude the largest alliances. as has been said before, the standings requirement would be a far better way to ensure that random 'big players' do not stomp all over fw.btw, even long before we moved into our new home, one corp in u'k had one sov claiming pos in k0cn-3, should that really in itself have prevented us taking part in faction warfare?"
"that accurately described everything ccp did regarding fw. whoever does the game design on it is just incompetent and detatched from what the players want and do."
"i am not involved in faction warfare or roleplay, but i have a great respect for cva and uk as enemies and friends respectively.i have heard suggestions and comments about the situation from several cva members already. if you would be willing to help me formulate a proposal, i will gladly push it.- sok."
"at the risk of losing potential voters i don't agree that rp alliances should have any special treatment in this matter. you choose to rp and i respect that, but it shouldn't give you special powers over and above any other alliance. i could just as easily complain that as i want to rp a minmatar resistance fighter i should be allowed to sneak into a cva outpost, set explosives and blow it up yes extreme example but the principle is the same.so setting aside rp the argument \"simply\" boils down to \"should alliances be able to hold space and still participate in factional warfare\". the current csm and ccp think not. i've yet to see a convincing argument for letting space holding alliances have their cake and eat it regarding fw (and why wouldn't they want their cake? it's so delicious and moist! ). there may well be a good reason to let them, but simply pointing at rp isn't it.it would be so easy to go hunting for easy votes and say i would support this but i would rather people saw how i approach these kinds of issues. so the short answer is i do not support your agenda in this form. i would however be happy to take other rp issues to the csm if voted in and am always willing to support a well reasoned argument."
"proposed changes need to be examined closely. you sound like an idiot."
"you sound just like the opposition actually, your ideas on to which to base a political party sound decent. you should start one. that's the great thing about politics. it allows for different viewpoints. but it's obvious to me that you have your own agenda, which seems to be to smear ours - making it sound like we are some sort of wild internet cult leaders, bent on taking over the game with our crazy conspiracy theories by riling people up. it's absolutely absurd. the fact that you are so strongly opposed to the party's formation tells me that we are doing something right.the criminal segment of the population of eve is underrepresented in the csm, and if you can't see that, then you are truly blind. it's time to change that. but i wouldn't expect you to be looking out for the little guy, knowing that you are a member of a large 0.0 organization."
"the competition is getting nervous"
"you're half right. without a crystal ball, it is difficult to determine every effect a change will have on the game with 100% accuracy.fortunately, most humans have brains which are functional enough to look at a proposed change and start thinking creatively about it. those experienced enough with the game, its mechanics, and its history will be able to figure out some of the effects a change might have on the game. some of the people in md are doing that all the time, and making a fortune at it, because they can extrapolate. as an example (a clumsy one, but you'll get the idea), they decide to up the bonus on a certain type of rig by 2%. doesn't seem like much. but what if it made it suddenly more effective than a non-rig module that affected the same parameter? because of stacking penalties, we might suddenly see a sharp rise in the demand of that rig because people will want to use the rig instead of the module. of course, that means the demand for the module will fall just as sharply. so demand changes, price changes for both the rig and module. but now let's say the rig was made with a type of salvage that previously had very little demand. suddenly the salvage has more demand, and the prices go up. suddenly you start seeing more ninja salvagers in missions because salvaging is getting more lucrative.as i said, a very clumsy example, but that's mostly because i haven't been playing the game for very long. the point is, you don't need to be clairvoyant to see where a change might take the game.the freedom this game allows is the one thing that sets it apart from so many other mmo's on the market. it's the reason i got into the game in the first place, as i'm sure is the case for many of its players. the spp, as an organization, can raise more legitimate and persuasive arguments against restricting freedom than can scattered forum posters. and logit, as a member of the csm, can voice those arguments directly to ccp."
"you made our argument. there are wholesale changes in 0.0, and you are there to represent your constituency. you have good representation.let us have ours. that is hi-sec criminals, looters, suicide gankers, scammers, pirates, etc.simple."

"making salvaging viable is the main point! i believe anything is viable when properly implemented./bump!"
"being part of a group in eve for most people is about more than just getting out of an npc corp.most people have a hell of a lot of friends, both in game and out of game in the corp and alliance they fly with. being in a corp for most people, although 99.9% of people won't admit it, is about being with friends and having a laugh in game. corporations and branding are everything in eve, without them eve would be a dull and boring place.i'm not asking to be able to paint ships, ala homeworld. i don't want to see 5000 pink goonswarm thoraxes ramming the undock point of jita 4-4 (you know it'd happen )what i'm asking for is the simple option for the ceo of an alliance's executor corporation to click a check box that controls the ability to have the alliance's logo displayed on every member's hull. while it'll be a lot harder to implement it on a corporation level given the huge variation available in logos, the alliance logos never change once they're patched into the game, and for a billion isk to form one, an alliance should at least have this benefit.i'm aware that there are more pressing issues that people want taken care of with the game, and that's fine. this is something minor that would simply improve immersion and gameplay a little for a lot of people. it's also at least partially implemented and has been experimented with in the past given there's been trinity graphical demos with red alliance logos painted on ships.ccp have been considering it and talking about it for a long time, and with dust 514 on the horizon (even the war barges in the dust 514 trailers are painted with the ishukone logo) alliance branding and recognition is going to be even more important.if ccp can do stuff like this, and let alliances claim space with their colours, then it's high time that members of alliances who're proud to fly their colours were allowed to do so."

"currently the items container in station hangars provides sorting functionality for item name, item type or item quantity. i would like to suggest the addition of a 'sort by meta level' function.seperating the 'treasure' from the 'trash' when looking at a hangar stuffed full of modules can be time consuming at best. as it stands, if one does not have a fairly complete knowledge of the module list and associated meta levels, the only other viable option is to 'show info' on each module individually. adding the ability to sort items by meta level would allow identifying the higher level modules to become a much more streamlined task.prior to posting this proposal, i have posed the option to many eve players in various channels in-game and so far, the suggestion has been met with a resounding yes."

"v check here if you want to give your support to the idea/discussion going on"
"i propose to have 3 additional check boxes in the drone settings pain for small medium and large ship types when checked the drones can automaticly target ships of this type when unchecked the drones wil not target said type of ship until told to. this is to keep your medium and large drones from attacking the friggates and acidently triggering the next few spawns when your busy focusing on say the 5 battleships already attacking you"
"i second this idea. it would help out tons!!!! being able to choose what type of ship your drones focus on."
"because i need another annoying keyhanger thingamabob amirite?here's an idea, create an \"account security\" tutorial page outlining the creation of proper passwords, stressing the use of decent antivirus, browser and network security software, advocate against people just blindly clicking \"yes\" to whatever popup appears on their screen.and then don't do squat for people who get their account hacked because they had a trojan on their pc, likely obtained on a shady pirated software, ****ographic, or isk selling website.honestly, 90% of all these \"account security\" issues must be caused by user error. don't try to put a costly, annoying, physical solution on the bleeding wound that is the general lack of user intellect.not supported."
"in addition to failing at real security (since that only reduces the odds of someone having their pc compromised and account info stolen), it's also failing at practical considerations; many pc users are simply only semi-computer literate. you base your business model on the users you have.\"user should be more knowledgeable\" is a idiotic way to run a business, which has consistently lost to user friendly systems just about every time so far.that said, \"90% account security issues must be caused by user error\" means your security is not worth ****.fortunately eve is only a game with virtual assets, so \"well, if you do everything right, you maybe won't have your security compromised. but you might.\" isn't that tragic of a approach, since you won't lose real assets. still is horribly bad.but given people are asking for a optional thingy, you can still retain your luck-based security and give people who want something stronger a option. how is that bad?"
"i believe that having an optional authenticator in addition to the account name and password is a good idea. granted, there are other things that can be done to increase account security, but i don't see a reason not to have an optional authenticator be an additional hurdle against having one's account compromised. ...and i suppose i should read the whole thread before posting in something that was recently bumped. someone said the csm already discussed it and linked the minutes."
"well i do agree with this proposal, except that i think that it will be to difficult to implement by december. instead i would suggest just dropping concord from all systems with a .9 or lower security rating, excluding jita of course. that will give high sec players that aren't brand new to the game plenty of fun. brand new players of course will start in 1.0 systems so they will still be safe for a little while."
"sure, why not? still not going to get officers or any spawn above 650k in empire, no matter how upgraded. a flat increase in volume doesn't seem like too bad a thing. possibly make it lowsec-only."
"maybe you should look what the upgrade do before crying. at level 5 the system get 10 insta respawning top tier anomalies.that mean 25-30 millions in bounties with bs worth 1,2 millions a chance of a faction spwan and of a escalation.plenty of people would like that."
"i want equality for all."

"missions are interesting?"
"i like this idea, but i'd need to see some hard numbers before being sold on this. i had *hoped* this was based on the qen, but looking through it i saw nothing related to reprocessing loot.perhaps if coupled with a lowends buff this would be good. until then.... hasty changes are bad, mmk?have to keep in mind this nerfs compression, which is needed to get the quantities of mins needed for supercap production and the like in 0.0 because mining lowends by itself is very unprofitable/slow progress. if a superdense version of veld/other lowends (200% yield or something) would spawn in 0.0, i'd fully support this."
"i agrea in principle but i think this would be the wrong way to go about it.i would like to modify your proposal.i think it would be best if it was possible to have corp tax on refining and reprocessing.the station/outpost owner gets his tax ofc (sometimes nothing with good standing in npc stations) but the corporation should have the option of taking taxes from refining/reprocessing.this would mean that a pilot for a npc corp in empire would maybe get away with paying tax to the station owner due to standing but he would still haveto pay the 11% corp tax ("
"ccp did release numbers like 3+ months back or so. iirc they broke it down for each mineral type and mining, reprocessing and drone loot and reprocessing accounted for 40-60% of the minerals. of course it didn't differentiate between mission loot reprocessing and compression, but i can't imagine compression counts for much compared to the tens of thousands of people in motsu everyday.the fact that a significant portion of minerals come from kill missions/ratting and not from mining is a huge issue and pretty much a deal breaker for dedicated miners. i can only imagine a mining fix is in the works but don't hold your breath.not supporting any quick fix as mining in its entirety needs a revamp."
"how to make nullsec more attractive for industrial characters?5% fixed concord tax on npc corp refineries.so starting player has 5% from npc corp, 5% concord, bunch of wastage. fix that up by improving standings with that npc corp, training up the refining skills. still stuck with 5% concord tax in all npc corp refineries.so head out to low/null sec or set up your own pos.then have the sov industrial upgrades allow pos refineries (with appropriate skills) to reprocess at 100% efficiency, in a few seconds.then reduce hisec ores to veldspar and scordite only, no kernite or omber. reduce the ore quality to only the 100% (veldspar, scordite), all veldspar in lowsec is the 105% variant, all veldspar in nullsec is the 110% variant.finally, scale the scc sales tax according to the security status of the system in which the sale is made. 0.5 sec will attract the current rate, 1.0 sec will attract double the tax rate.so ore becomes more valuable, refineries become more useful in nullsec. each stage of the industrial process should have some extra cost in empire that is not present in a sovereignty-claimed nullsec system. poorer ores in hisec, lower efficiency in the overworked empire-based refineries, manufacturing lines that cost far more to operate (due to highly organised unions pushing for higher wages), and increased sales tax in higher-security systems.in the meantime, allow the industrial upgrades to improve the exhumer class ships so that they tank like battlecruisers, not cruisers. a hulk or mack in nullsec should be able to tank a t2/officer fit stealth bomber at the very least, if not a gank-fit cnr. there should be some allowance for response time when a stealth bomber sneaks through a gatecamp and starts attacking industrialists - the ship should be able to have a chance of lasting long enough to pay for itself.empire should be safe but boring. nullsec should be a world of opportunity."
"a 10 or 15% decrease in some 0.0 production requirements wouldn't make a scrap of difference to miners income. it would only increase the number of ships produced. actually, scratch that: in fact it would probably increase mining income. mineral prices are tied to ship insurance prices, not mineral demand. if it takes n minerals of average unit value m to create a ship with net platinum insurance value x, then decreasing n by reduction y will necessarily increase m such that the new mineral value m will be: m=m/(1-y).ergo: the proposal is a boost to miners.edit: and if the miners are producing more, then their income will increase, again due to price support from insurance.edit2: still waiting for your reply to this, venkul."

"im pretty sure this happens to alot of people running missions with a particuler faction where you ae running missions either for cash or standings you will eventualy get an offer from a storyline agent for a simple mission or mission series for a large increase in standings with that agents corp and the corps designated faction. this in itself is fine but i find it really irritating when one is grinding for \"corp\" standings to then get a storyline for a compleatly differnt corporation and particuly when the corp you get offerd the mission from is that of a corp you never run missions for and probably never will, then it basicaly turns into just running the mission for the cash/item reward and the faction standings, im sure some people will welcome standings with another corp and sometimes it is helpfull but after a while it turns out you get higher standings with a corp you never did a single normal mission with over the corp you have been gridning away with the past few weeks/months or so,i propose a simple fix for this to change the system from the nearest storyline agent to the nearest storyline agent of the same corp you did the last mission for."
"this would require a lot more storyline agents. as it is now you would often have to travel quite some jumps or even get to lowsec to haul ore or that 40k m<U+FFFD> boxes.though i see your point (grinding standing for a specific corp)i think it is better as it is right now. take the standing for the other corp as a bonus or look for an agent with same-corp-storyliner right next to it."

"incoming compact dwarf galaxy to collide with new eden. only about the size of 1-2 regions of space. the solarsystems are mostly unformed. consisting of asteroids, comets, star, and the dust cloud. due to the lack of formation of celestial bodies. the moongoo-iceproducts-minerals are all in raw form ready to be scooped up.the interesting difference due to the nature of the galaxy in it's form. there's a constant blast of damage against your ship. sitting idle in space provides a constant amount of damage to your ship. enough that the large majority of ships are unable to tank this damage. including typical pvpfit ships.due to the nature of this space. you either have a large tank similar to that of pve fit ships or capships or bring friends.due to having no moons and no planets. stations and pos do not exist. nor do stargates. the only possible way to go in and out of these systems are wormholes, cynos, or jumpclones in rorquals/titans.a true nomadic area of space with literally no place to hide. furthermore... due to the cloud... you have no cloak. so if people are online in the system. you see them in local and you know you can go kill them."
"well here are a couple of issues that have probably come up many times but it isnt fixed so it needs another round1#please make meta 5 (t2) items better than meta 4 items, its as simple as that. this applys to everything from modules to ammo.meta 4 modules often have same benefits as t2 but lower cpu/grid/skill requirements and are therefore better than t2.dont change the cpu/grid/skill requirements just give t2 a slight boost.here are a few suggestions: web ii 11km range instead of 10km. give mwd ii 550% speed bonus instead of 500% like meta 1 & 3. boost dps and/or reduce penaltys on t2 ammo.some items like reactor control unit dont need any change, but in general all t2 should be better than meta4, after all its harder to fit them on any ship and it requires sp.this would further incent t2 building and boost the t2 market (some modules are not worth manufacturing atm).meta 2-4 is npc loot, meta 1 and 5 is or should be built by players.2#well i would personally like to see no more t1 loot dropped from npc wrecks, or at the very least a reduction. most of it gets refined anyway. this would be an incentive and boost the mining profession (allso the sparsly populated drone regions), most importantly this would give the t1 market back to the industrial players instead of the npc ratters/missioners."
"with your first topic, i agree with some of what you wrote. the reason the high-metas were equal to t2 was because t2 could be mass-produced (from the bpo lottery), while high-metas were dropped with increasing rarity from npcs.mission reprocessing is more profitable than mining, so the fact that far more people run missions messes this equation up. some changes are needed, but really, t2 costs a lot less than t1m4 gear usually.with your second topic, i agree to an extent, but first mining would have to be made more active and less afk-able. this is an area that has hurt a lot of people (miners, t1 manufacturers, etc), but major changes are needed before it can be a reality. these changes are along the lines of a whole expansion, and we will have to wait for that to arrive. ccp has said they're in the works of revising the mission system, so we'll have to wait and see."
"make rats only drop named loot and not normal t1, and of course tags and that kind if stuff. increase amount of salvage a bit to compensate for lost loot. increase t2 stats where needed.i support the idea"
"let's just cut to the chase and reform rat loot altogether. remove module drops totally. replace them with named bpcs produced from salvaging (along with the normal salvage materials)."
"id like to answer bunyip on his comment.isnt it possible that the price of the t2 module is lower bechause it is worse quality? you dont specify any specific modules.take ecm modules for example. best named (meta4) are better than t2(meta5), lower fitting cost (cpu/grid) and less cap usage but it still has same stats. maybe give t2 ecm 5% bonus to range and strength.i dont see why anyone should fit the t2 ecm modules to the falcon/rook? why use t2 and nerf your setup?ecm spatial destabilizer ii costs 580k in jita.bz-5 neutralizing spatial destabilizer ecm costs 1.75m in jita.>this is due to the fact that the meta 4 item is better than the meta 5.reactor control unit ii costs 538k in jita.beta reactor control: reaction control i costs 348k in jita.>in this case the t2 item is better and guess what, the market price is higherthere are a lot of examples out there about meta 4 being better than meta 5. some exeptions exist on meta 2-4 that are very expensive due to rarity and/or the fact that not everyone has skills to use t2.and in closing i would like to say that if t2 was always better than 'best' named then im pretty shure that prices on 'best' named would drop and prices on t2 would rise. this would put more pressure on the producers and maybe this might improve the profit margin on industial production and maybe even get more people to do it. lots of pilots have skills to build but consider it not worth the effort to do it.well tbh if t2 isnt as good as meta 4 why train to use it?"
"so i was thinking, since minmatar ships have this reputation of being a pile of junk, why not make them a ship that actually looks like that... a ship that looks like it's been put together in a scrap yard. an i know i know what you think: \"they already look like that\"... which is true. but there's nothing on them that's actually recognizable. like i want to see the rear end of a harbringer as a bs engine. or half of an executioner as part of some cruiser.but it doesn't have to be minmatar. it could be for one of the pirate factions. or maybe the sleepers coming out into k-space and incorporating our technology into their ships. something like that."

"i suspect the game servers would not appreciate the added load of 20k video streams.i would, however, support player designed advertisements for the current billboards.edit: the main problem is that it would have to stream the video to everyone near a billboard (even afk's). this is simply wasted resources. perhaps this would be more practical if the videos only played upon request?"
"idk youtube seems to handle it pretty well. you have to admit the current billboards are just a sentry with boring pictures."
"aside from the fact that video on in-game billboards is a useless idea, it wouldn't add any load at all to the eve cluster. it would link to an external server that would host the video and the only additional load would be on the clients... oh and the enormous amount of load that would be on the streaming servers as they streamed to the 50,000 people that are online during an alliance tournament broadcast.anyways... very bad idea that will cause extreme amounts of lag, extra resources used by the client whether or not you have streaming turned on, and the possibility of some jackass (namely, me) sitting in front of the billboard to **** people off. eve tv broadcasts have enough problems as it is only streaming to people who are explicitly choosing to watch it in their browsers.definitely not supported... but talk more about corporation ads and whatnot, because those would be neat if billboards were a little bigger and less impossible to read."

"+1 vote as long as you will yell at ccp for the dominion fiasco that we are dealing with."
"why do you feel that l4 missions should remain a high-sec commodity, when we all know that exodus which was supposed to make all players move to 0.0 introduced them and caused the reverse effect.. i.e more people than ever stayed in high-sec.. and now, even with dominion and a chance for ccp to change their stance by decreasing lp or isk rewards with each high sec-mission, they still won't do it.so in short .. do you really feel pve'rs should really have a natural benefit in high-sec?why? with the new system in place, wouldn't they actually do more good in 0.0?other then that much  for any -a-, and most notable ex/current tri member's running for csm (which r a is=p) =)"
"dear sokratesz.can you publish small \"press release\" related to rumors that you was involved in scam?"
"i have noticed that some of the other candidates have voiced quite strong opinions about the level 4 question in the csm matchmaker. my current stand remains 'mildly against moving level 4 mission to lowsec' because i don't think it would solve much. the people who use missions to make isk to finance their pvp losses may already do so in the more lucrative places (0.0, empire) because the isk/hr difference is quite large, and the majority who runs the missions for enjoyment (to finance more expensive pve tools) or business (sell isk) will simply not go into lowsec and find other means of making good isk in highsec.in short, i don't believe it would change much in present-day eve. i would be in favour of making 0.0 and lowsec more attractive to these players but that would have to be done in a more subtle way or go accompanied with suitable changes. (f. ex. to prevent them all getting ganked on the ingate to lowsec or 0.0)perhaps with dominion this will change - i will have to review my stance on this one and indeed on many items once the effects of dominion have been fully felt.and thanks, my heart still lies with tri <3 ask all your ex-nano*** buddies to vote for me :dfirst, let me draw a very fat line between in-game activities that are allowed and in fact endorsed by ccp like piracy and scamming, and the combination of metagaming and illegal in-game acitivies that larkonis was doing.second, yes, i made some isk there in a way that not everyone might approve of. but those players, both apparantly unfamiliar with game mechanics, were there every step of the way and they fell for it with eyes wide open. i merely equalised their balance between isk and sense, and there are countless people, friends, corp and alliancemates that can testify that i am not an 'inherently evil' person or have a tendency to betray my fellows. i have been with my current corp for over two years now, and i am proud to say that i see no reason why i would ever have to leave it. you can find more information in a thread made by one of the victims here. this thread incidentally will also provide proof of his cluelessness. let me also stress that this was the first and in my book last time that i engaged in such activities, but i believe it is part of the game and will oppose any suggestions that would make scamming illegal or impossible (see: csm matchmaker)thus, i have no intention to follow in larkonis' footsteps and the suggestion itself sounds appalling."

"do you like volume 9-11 of berserk ?"
"my personal priority lies with industry and the market, and i think these aspects have been neglected by ccp. however they agreed with the previous csm that they will have a slot for related issues reserved in each expansion, and i'll definately make use of that. fix what is broken and critical, make some existing features more practical, fix the cosmetic side (user interface) and add new features.for corporation specialising in trade, where 2 and more dedicated players can for example sell corporate goods, a new role could be added (corporation order manager) which could be attached to corporate wallet divisions for security purposes.multiple traders could then especially when playing from different time-zones, run and manage corporate sales as a team, as opposed to the current system, where the person who initiated a current corporate sale, be the only one who can modify it.at the moment also there is practically only the 0.01 isk undercut system to sell items on the open markets. a system promoting more personalised sales could allow a player to make public sales as himself or his corp. adding in this case on a player / corp info page, new tabs for public contracts, sales and shares that directly relate to those initiating them.this would promote more teamwork between players as opposed to current models where a trader has to work alone and manage his own sales even if he is doing corporate sell orders.on the shares front, to be able to put them on the market as the current real life market functions. create public share sell / buy orders, would put a lot of life into the corporate share systems. trading is definitively a core part of eve at all levels. players need to buy assets they use, sell items they create and the ones they find. they can use the income to buy / sell items or services that they need and progress in the game in any way they choose to."

"his answers to dierdra's questionnaire say it all. almost everything filled out as \"i don't care\" except him wanting to keep bombs and bubbles out of lowsec, which are the most important issues in the game for him.personal agenda ftw, he doesn't give a **** about the aspects of eve that everyone else plays."
"can you link this questionnaire for the benefit of us all?"
"yeah.. but we aren't running for csm saying we will represent all of fw......."

"hey teadaze!what do you think about some proposals to increase bounty on 0.0 rats to balance out risk reward in 0.0 vs empire?"
"i would support a proposal to look into this, but without any specific thread here are my current thoughts on it.for sov holders increased bounties could be linked to the \"pirate magnets\" (i propose we call them \"pieces of eight\" ) so rats are not only related to truesec. it would also be interesting if they would escalate in some way (increased bounties and difficulty) so that they retaliate with greater force or give the whole system a temporary improvement of truesec based on killing x number of rats per hour. it might also encourage people to ninja rat in upgraded systems leading to more chances to pvp.for npc space some similar escalation ideas could work but they shouldn't be as high as for sov 0.0 (we need to give some extra benefit to holding space).if anyone has a better idea please put together a proposal in the assembly forum for us to look at"
"teadaze, please consider filling out the questions of the csm vote matcher. while i completely agree that such a questionnaire cannot represent everything that a candidate has to offer, it covers at least some issues worth taking a stance for or against."
"i filled it in the day the eve mail with the logins was sent round.if i'm not showing for you then i guess i don't match well enough on those questions. however feel free to ask here if there are any issues in particular you have and i'll respond"
"duh, found you now ...based on the answers that i feel different about, here are some questions for you:- about nerfing of local. do you propose it for everywhere or maybe just low sec + 0.0? if you want to see it implemented everywhere, i see a great imbalance in favor of attackers/or the larger gangs. it's bad for solo low sec dwellers and it hurts the victims of empire griefing corps.- about nerfing of point income sources in 0.0. i think the question was badly formulated, since i think rebalancing moons was necessary, but on the other hand it killed the strategic assets alliances have been fighting over. don't you think valuable moons where an essential driver of all 0.0 life? up until now alliances needed to be pvp heavy to conquer space, to hold moons, to do more pvp. with the changes 0.0 turns into carebear wonderland, because you need to pve to pay for the space and get the upgrades and there are no strategic assets worth fighting for (and space is more of a burden then anything else). so pvp for alliances will be degraded to only fun gangs between ratting, while the strategic fleet fights will become rare...- about 0.0 infrastructure being vulnerable to small gangs. another badly formulated question, as it could mean just that (small gangs disrupting 0.0 infrastructure just to annoy an alliance), or it could mean that small entities should be able to get a foothold in 0.0. the latter includes the former and in that case i'd support it. but if it's really just the former i don't really see a point, shooting some stationary structures to annoy the alliance, but with no real purpose. and if you're just after pvp you don't need to bother about structures... depending on how easy you make it for small gangs, the pain for the space holding entity could be really big, if any roaming gang could fubar their sov. another aspect is that if the proposal was made reality, dreadnoughts would have nearly no function. so, how do you see this could be balanced?there where quite a few points where you answered that you have no strong feelings about. i guess that's just honesty, so it's okay!"
"hi helen!you and sokratesz both scored around 65%, so i'm not sure who to vote for .. so!why do you feel that l4 missions should remain a high-sec commodity, when we all know that exodus which was supposed to make all players move to 0.0 introduced them and caused the reverse effect.. i.e more people than ever stayed in high-sec.. and now, even with dominion and a chance for ccp to change their stance by decreasing lp or isk rewards with each high sec-mission, they still won't do it.so in short .. do you really feel pve'rs should really have a natural benefit in high-sec?why? with the new system in place, wouldn't they actually do more good in 0.0?"
"two good questions. i'll deal with michael's first as it will be shorter.level 4s and mission running is now firmly entrenched as an empire activity. there are thousands of people running l4s who have no interest in moving to lowsec or 0.0. if l4s moved out of empire, those players would, in my opinion, either stay in empire and chain l3s instead or simply quit. ccp have acknowledged that l4s are somewhat out of whack with the rest of the design but that they are (rightly) unwilling to simply reset them. i think it's inevitable that a fix for l4s will come, either as a buff to everything else or as a direct nerf however i don't think moving them out of hi-sec is the right fix at the moment.having said all of that, i do think that missions in 0.0 as well is a good idea and one that will fix some of the issues with dominion. i'm hoping that ccp's strategy here is to implement the system first then balance it, certainly that's a sensible way to go forwards even if it's frustrating for those of us who will be getting the short end of the stick in the meantime.regarding my suggestions for dominion.firstly, the design should match the requirements which currently it doesn't. the aim is to free up unused space by forcing large sov-footprints to contract. rather than simply put a high linear cost on sov holding i would suggest that an exponential approach is better where sov holding costs quickly spiral out of reach of any but the most active alliances. to prevent alliance simply setting up smaller splinter alliances as a way to spread these costs out, have cost rise with proximity to other alliance holdings.in other words, sov becomes more expensive the further away it is from your capital system but also the closer it is to systems under another alliance's sov. this will naturally create buffer zones of unclaimed space between sov markers which will encourage roaming warfare and also add a level of strategic decision making when claiming sov as it can be used offensively as well as defensively.a non-linear cost allows a reasonable investment level for smaller corps looking to get their toes into 0.0 space while scaling properly to the level of a very large alliance. fixed costs penalise small corps too much if they are in any way non-trivial for large alliances.logistics is also a way to reduce the effective size of an alliance's holdings. jbs are vital for managing very large areas of space, by making them expensive or difficult to achieve then the amount of space that can realistically be held reduces also. again this reigns in large alliances without unduly penalising smaller entities who are only trying to hold a single system or constellation.of course reducing the footprint of an alliance is no good if the new holdings cannot sustain the pilot numbers of the old area. the current system upgrades do not allow this. mission agents would be an easy fix for this, if ccp can't put them in outposts yet then put them in space or have roaming interactable npc vessels of a hostile type to the incumbent pirate faction flying around space offering missions to anyone who sees them. give the mission journal interface a 'current location for this agent' and suddenly you also have people moving around space more and providing more opportunities for small scale pvp.in addition to this, cosmic anomalies should be ubiquitous and worth doing. the best way to handle large numbers of pilots in a small area is the way it's already done - through generating content on demand. missions are an example of this but cosmic anomalies can also be moved to this model. perhaps the anomaly doesn't exist until i scan for it, once i scan for it the anomaly is generated in the same way as asking for a mission generates that opportunity and, by warping to it, i 'accept' the anomaly and it is spawned. anomalies should of course be worth doing and range from reasonably valuable solo content to really valuable (but very hard) group content."
"hello,based on the csm vote matcher site it seems you are an interesting candidate. sadly, i could find little more information about your platform, since the site you linked to is not open to the public (requires registration and therefore agreement to the legal terms of another private company). also, i could find only 4 posts by you on this forum, so unfortunately i can't learn much more.regards"
"if a fairly small number of eve players even bother voting, does anyone really think that many will bother to go through 49 different web pages to fully understand the candidates' platform? i think there's a reason that in politics there are normally only a couple of candidates-because the differences between them are then much more apparent, and consequently, each candidate will more thoroughly be looked over. i'm mostly interested in getting feedback here, because i'm curious: has anyone really gone down the entire list and read every single candidate's platform?"
"my concern is how fragmented the voting will become with so many people to choose from. in effect it could be handing more seats to the bloc voting alliances. voter apathy is pretty bad too, just look at how few reads the candidate threads have been getting in here but it seems to go further.the original candidate announcement page had the raw text pasted to it and whilst i and others sent updated (html formatted) text to ccp it wasn't (afaik) uploaded (some people didn't put any campaign message in when they applied but it didn't hurt their application at all).now the voting site is open, but no official notification on the homepage, in game or on the rss news feeds.i know there are 2 weeks to vote, but it is a shame that there has been no official announcement from ccp to raise the visibility of the voting process."
"he, i guess that is why i ended up not having a website, nor a long platform message. just a short statement.either the people who know me form my six years in the game will be enough or it wont. i dont think the information on the voting pages count for much in the end...you could probaly cut down on the candidate list by requiring that a certain number of people support you candidacy in the first place. (many real life election systems solves the problem that way.)"
"you are probably right, but then again just a simple site and a little bit of campaigning might sway a few floating voters. i decided not to take anything for granted.that is an interesting idea. the question is what number do you put for this? 10 people? 50 people? 100 people? i suspect it isn't difficult to get that level of support and so it might not make much difference to the number of candidates for the extra complexity involved."
"dierdra vaal created a vote match, just fill out the questionnaire and you get the csm candidates matching your views. just read up on them so you don't have to go through all of the others, and vote.i personally only look at these forums, i didn't read the whole list of candidates on the eve website, as anyone that doesn't have a thread here is just slacking and doesn't deserve a vote."
"i agree the vote match is a useful tool, but it doesn't give the whole story so i hope people do still read some of the campaign sites.i agree, however if you look at the number of reads per candidate thread it is pretty poor. some threads have been up for a month with only a few thousand views in that time (and that isn't unique viewers).many of us have put the effort in to campaign outside of the forums via si radio, campaign sites, in game events etc but we won't see if that has increased the overall number of voters until the 2nd of december..."

"some statsresponseout of the 49 candidates, 38 have filled in the questions. 2 confirmed with me that they felt they were not properly represented in the questionaire, the other 9 have not replied to mailings or convo requests. i was aiming to cover at least 75% of the candidates, and i made that mark. hopefully next election, with an evemail system that doesn't suck, i'll be able to get 95% :)questionsthe answer index (ai) is the average answer on a question. as all answers range from -2 to +2, a perfectly balanced question has an ai of 0.0. questions where the ai is greater than 1 or smaller than -1 are questions i'll look into removing or changing as they do not get as many different answers as i would like. * only 4 questions are candidates for removal based on the current answers. * 1 question was perfectly balanced and resulted in an ai of 0.0question importance (qi) is also an interesting stat. as candidates can mark 3 questions as being 'important' to them, a question that no candidate finds important is one i will review for removal or change. * only 1 question was not important to anyone* the question that was marked 'important' most often was marked 'important' 9 times"

"hi, thanks for introducing yourself - you matched highest in the vote match questionnaire and merit my provisional support.my hot topics of interest are(1) making the client a level playing-field - use of external comms and utils degrade the experience and provides advantage. why am i forced to use apps beyond the client i'm paying for?(2) clear communication - i think you've got this covered under documentation, but i want to see clear representation of who stands for what in this morass of of conflicting viewpoints and agendas at csm and ccp. give us the tools to see what is really going on. the forums are not good enough.(3) bounties. flawed system. game design makes it next to impossible for me to play the lone bounty hunter while hundreds of popular pirate gangs clamour for 'more love' from csms / game mechs. does anyone else see the disparity there?(4) storyline. i can't see the link between storyline missions and events in eve. does it exist? it should. in my opinion every patch, release and upgrade should be linked to the storyline. trouble with the game balance could very well be solved with the introduction of new modules or tech rather than the blunt instrument that is the nerf bat, it would also provide the march of technology, just as in the real world, and a structure to hang chronicles upon. that's enough of my high horses, hobby horses and nightmares for now, i would very much like to hear your opinions.chris k ~ playing the sisters tem."

"igonoring the fact that faction warfare is as meaningless as red vs blue without the rp/backstory aspect (and i know rvb is great fun!) ... i don't think the rp players are asking for favours.if u'k were able to form one huge corp which met the standings requirement and called it ushrakhan, we'd be able to join fw now. so why should a large allianc (rp or not) be prevented from joining fw if the alliance as a whole meets the standings requierments?"
"because a corp can't hold sov so that avoids the issue.the op specifically stated \"find a way to allow (at the very minimum) the major rp alliances to participate in fw\". ccp and the csm supported the idea with the restriction that no sov could be held while in fw.i don't have a problem with the idea of an alliance with the right standings being able to join fw under those conditions.however there hasn't yet been a convincing argument for allowing a single alliance to take part in sov 0.0 and fw - the only proposal made so far is it would suit rp alliances.hopefully you can understand the issue here. an alliance with 0.0 sov has access to more resources than a pure fw corp/alliance and at the same time doesn't give anything back to fw in exchange. maybe it could be allowed if a sov holding fw alliance automatically sets the rest of their militia to +10 and thus gives them full access to their space and outposts? that way both the alliance and the militia gain benefits.just a thought"
"my question would be why is holding sov an issue?thus specifically excluding the two oldest alliances in this game. what kind of argument is needed beyond 'some of us would like to' ? it is a question of counter arguments surely.i really do not understand what you are saying here. an alliance which joins fw would be just as much part of the militia. what it 'gives back' would be the resources it can invest in fw."
"personally i find the idea of an alliance wanting the benefits of holding space out out in 0.0 as well as to participate and get the benefit of factional warfare to be rather greedy and also in many ways counterproductive. what is the point of holding space if you actually want to go and do factional warfare instead? csm #3 and ccp took a similar position.maybe i'm missing the point, but you've not given a good reason why you should be able to have both abilities. it isn't specifically targetted at you. it appears the aim is to exclude any alliance from fw that wants to hold sov instead.that isn't how it works. you want to make a change to the game thus it is you who need to make a convincing argument why. come up with a good one and i'll support you fully.the original request was to allow alliances into fw and csm #3 agreed with ccp it could be allowed as long as the alliance wasn't holding sov as well. it isn't hard. the alliance would gain access to all the benefits of fw (easy pew pew, missions, lp store etc) except that unlike the rest of the militia it also has access to 0.0 sov benefits as well.i was suggesting a quid pro quo for an alliance wanting to have sov and join fw is that it would have to share its space with the militia it has joined.give us a better suggestion instead"
"the fw is balance of power is very fragile, particularly on the amarr-matari front, with a grudge match being carried out between plexers and pvp'ers alike.big fleets happen but are the exceptions rather than the rule.an large influx of people from an alliance on either side (or both) would reduce it to mainly gate camps and other such wet blankets making it less than it is. add to it the possibility of fw space being used by alliances to duke it out without jeopardizing their assets (ie. space) and you have the reason for the \"no sov\" idea.i have yet to see any idea that would keep fw's integrity intact while allowing major organized entities like alliances into the theatre. has to be done with immense care if it is to remain a primarily small-scale conflict.you flew the bleak skies mr. starforged, so you should know this"

"well, they obviously have never done trading with a high volume, low margin item. makes the choice of candidate much easier though i'm not saying there isn't a problem, it's the solution in the questionnaire that sucked..."
"it says i put \"no opinion\" (which is weird because i thought i didn't leave any as \"no opinion\") so i guess i didn't understand what it meant (because all those things i imagine it to possibly mean make no sense).if 2% undercut means that if i want to post a sell order cheaper than the lowest, i have to exceed 2% (i.e. post at 98% or less) of the previous one? no way. i understand people hate the \"eve price is right\" but seriously, it is a \"free market.\" the artificial floor price of stuff is based on either the manufacturing cost (which is impacted by the insurance for ships) or the buy orders.even if that rule were put in, people would quickly abuse it by posting a stupid cheap sell order of quantity 1, then post their desired price (higher for sell orders, lower for buy orders) for the rest then buy back their initial one. this assumes that sell orders higher than the cheapest (and buy orders lower than the highest) are not effected.since it has such an obvious method to circumvent it, it is an unnecessary market feature."
"i picked no opinion because being only a part time trader it isn't an issue i would pick up unless it was being ignored by everybody else. i used the match site as a place to show where i have specific interests and this wasn't one of them. if it was brought to a csm meeting i was at then i would disagree with the proposal. much as i dislike being undercut by 0.1 isk 30 seconds after posting an item for sale it is part of a free market."
"it was a good question, since anyone in favor of it was clearly too stupid to be allowed to have any influence on game design decisions. i didn't hold an uncertain position against anyone though, since that should be the default position on issues you are not sure about or haven't considered yet."

"they are biased more often than not, and frequently fail to recognize the simple fact that the silent majority are highsec carebears and casual players in small corporations that play only a few hours per week, solo or with a select group of friends.not to marginalize 0.0 or anything, it's good that 0.0 gets some attention with the dominion expansion and boring pos warfare is done away with, but let's not make 0.0 politics any more important than it is."
"too bad you didn't run, i don't think there's anyone to catalyze the c&p/low-sec vote. :("
"and cva is not a major alliance? that sounds like a little short sighted bias."
"z0d isn't from cva, and i was in an npc corp during my time on the csm."
"well allright, but dismissing a candidate based solely on their ticker is still wrong,"
"major alliances as a whole should be represented, but that doesn't follow that each major alliance should have at least one seat on the csm.the issue i think ankhesentapemkah has is that with the number of candidates splitting the rest of the voters that bloc voting major alliances may well end up with proportionally more seats than the share of active players would suggest the should have.i hope there is still space for those of us between empire and sov 0.0 but we'll have to wait till 2nd december to find out..."
"if those candidates do nothing but represent themselves and their alliance then yes, something's wrong, but i aim to be more than that."
"bloc voting is the defacto way of doing it. just in rl the blocs are political parties while for the csm it's alliances. those running on standalone platforms then have to battle it out for the rest of the unaffiliated votes.if players want to make sure that they have a representative on the csm that specifically covers what they want to see in the game, they need to get out and take the 2 minutes it takes to vote! whatever your play style and issues you think are the most important, find the candidate you like the best and vote for them. if you don't vote, you don't get the right to complain about the outcome.and when you go and vote, remember the name song lisong li for csm 4"
"well in my experience, large alliance csm often vote against issues that isn't their playstyle, and they dismiss them as irrelevant or carebeary simply because they do not understand how much it affects players that are confronted with the problem.an example is that all factional warfare issues that were repeatedly voted down by the alliance csm at the start of csm3 to the point that it led to public outcry, simply because the csm didn't think that fw as a whole deserved a higher priority and because they didn't understand the extent of the issue (fw lag is a myth, we have lag in 0.0 too, fw lag isn't worse than that!).another example is the issues surrounding medals, that when you delete a medal and award it again, it doesn't show up in your list anymore, and the inability to edit medals after they are created (yet it is possible as ccp edits csm medals too!). ccp sais its working as intended, and the alliance csm voted the issues down and dismissed it as a non-issue and accused me of being a medal-*** while this is a geniune concern from roleplaying corps.highsec issues are often dismissed as carebear non-issues too, and teeth are often grinded when 0.0 small gang warfare is mentioned cause the alliances seem to find this a threat to their powerbase.if there was some issue i didn't know about, i read up on it, and at least voted in favor if the issue had some merit even though i personally didn't care about it. things like killmails for selfdestructs, i don't give a .... but i do understand that this matters to some people. alliance csm often went \"we already have plenty of issues for ccp and this issue isn't important\" instead of doing their homework and reading up on it.i don't expect an issue like \"move level 5 missions to highsec\" to pass it through the csm if there are 5 or more alliance people on the csm, despite the fact that a lot of players (and neutral csm) want this to happen. which is frustrating. when i wrote a document on level 4 missions, i included in the document that there were players that wished all level 4 agents moved to lowsec, as i do paint the complete picture as well as i can and cover both parts even if i disagree with it personally.the csm is about representing the players even if they aren't your type of player. and i hope those that get elected keep that in mind."
"it is a noble aim, and i share that sentiment.but that still doesn't help me if a topic comes up that would improve the way i and others play the game at the expense of major 0.0 alliances. in that situation you wouldn't be able to support me without going against your supporters.in the event that major alliances take 5-6 seats then we get no representation at all on those subjects. which is one of the reasons i felt the need to run this time as i can represent the middle ground. i'm happy to support improvements to the sov system but at the same time i and others have a fundamentally different playstyle in 0.0 (not wanting to take sov) and wish to ensure there is still a place for us."
"i think the main reason to log in and vote an \"abstain\" is to increase the turn out proportion.it would be amazing if every active account voted (even if 90% were abstains) just to show that people checked the eve website.seriously, this is a 14 day voting window and is online."

"fixing the basic balance including mixed weaponry of the npcs is all fine and dandy, but:it should be completely impossible to speed-tank npcs in any way, shape or form. it is against the spirit of fw and eve itself.- npc's should chose a new target if they fire 3-4 volleys at one without doing damage, be it due to range and/speed.- destruction of all spawns should be a requirement for capturing any plex (unless defensive naturally).- npc's should not bother themselves with ships that are not a threat to the installation (ie. far away from timer while another more accessible target is in timer range).do this and you get proper plexing as goddess intended and not he system rife with abuses and exploits that we have now.ps: fix the bloody timer bugs already. running on their own and getting bugged by combat inside plex sometimes never actually capping."
"yes, ankh was probably one of the worst possible csms ever... nothing that was ever brought up was ever supported unless it fell within her very narrow cone of personal preference.. and when she realized that the caldari was fw on 'eazy win' mode she stfu on fw changes (other than the rewards system).the entire gallente space seized by the caldari should be removed because it was only gained by a patently broken mechanic.and now she has the gall to send me a mail suggesting this or that csm... what a *insert feminine anatomical epithet here*. anyone she suggests will not receive any attention from me."
"i propose a significant increase of the fitting and ship selection be a post-dominion change priority. fittings for most modules easily could have lower cost/output and higher cost/output at decent efficiencies (meta 4+) versions added in with at least two new t2 variants for each normal module. weapons could just receive appropriate additional t2 variants. ships of course would be more difficult but 2 additional ships of each t1 class, and an additional 1 of a number of t2 classes or maybe even a t3 (desties?!)- whatever the formula, an extensive upgrade in fitting and ship diversity helps not only every player in the game, but heightens all aspects by providing alternative means to the same end. it is also a relatively easy and \"free\" upgrade- it requires minimum of new coding and additions compared to t3, wh mechanics, sleeper ai, not to mention all of dominion. overall, more ships and modules = more fun for all."

"hi!motivationdue to the dominion discussion and so on i thought about how the economy works in eve and how players, corps and alliances get and spend their money. which resulted in me thinking about the money flow in eve and how to improve it. especially the money flow from empire to 0.0 space, the more money flows from empire to 0.0, the more lucrative 0.0 will become.assumptionsas for every sound thing, i try to make some assumptions, because i do not have access to any data.1) i think the main reason for cash flow in eve are ships and modules. on the one side we have isk faucets (mainly missions and bounties) on the other side we have resource faucets (asteroids, loot, moons, w-space sites). the isk stay isk, but as resources move through the manufacturing process they become more and more complex being modules and ships at the end. however, the resources move to the isk faucet harvesters (ratters, mission runners) and the isk move to the resource harvesters. basic basics of economy.2) 0.0 spacemany inhabitants of 0.0 space use t2 ships and modules. looking at the main isk generating grind (ratting), the isk flow from t2 user (is also the ratter) to t2 producer to moon miner. so basically the 0.0 ratting grind is financing the alliances.3) empireat least from the forums, it seems the l4 mission running is one of the more lucrative activities at the moment. so what are the isk flows where mission runners are involved? big isk: agent, bounties -> mission runnerlittle isk: mission runner -> ammo producers -> minersfaction ships: mission runner 1 -> mission runner 2 -> lp storeobviously there are also some modules and ships involved, but mission runners do not loose ships too often as in contrast pvpers or 0.0 ratters.conclusionsas already said in assumption 2) the isk flows from 0.0 to 0.0 on its end, but goes through empire (t2 producers) and leaves some isk there.the main conclusion i draw from my assumptions is, that if you combine 1) and 3) mission runners draw much isk from faucets, but don<U+FFFD>t inject them into the player isk circulation, because they do not buy new ships and modules on a regular basis, because they rarely loose their ships and if they do, they probably buy a faction ship with faction mods. as pointed out in assumption 3) faction items do not help other groups of players than mission runners to get more isk from them.proposed solutionmake ships and modules use some sort of fuel to increase their effectiveness.the buff to 0.0 is, that resources for t1/t2 fuels are only accessible in 0.0 space, and resources of fuels for t3 ships (and maybe modules if ccp introduces them) can only be harvested in w-space.on a closer look the production chain should be similar to the t3 or booster production, so resources can only be collected with ships (that means no passive point income) and a reasonable complex production chain, so that people can specialize and get some profit out of it.basic examples:power core fuel: increase pg output (you always have to have enough of it, because otherwise modules go offline)hybrid turret fuel: increases hybrid dmgrail fuel: increase rail optimal rangeblasters fuel: increase blaster tracking summarythis proposal should suggest a concept which can be detailed later. the main idea is to increase cash flow from empire to 0.0 space by introducing a player produced consumable everybody wants and which basic ingredients can only be harvested in 0.0/w-space.feliaedit: exchanged the worse-than-bad chosen name for the consumable to fuel"

"can anyone tell me what advantages minmatar ships have even left after all the nerfs to them?because right now i just came to the painful realization that even after all the training that i've done on my ships, it will never ever compare to the ships of other races. i've put up with the jokes about their ugliness (i actually find them quite beautiful, the whole scrapyard look is appealing). but it's frustrating as heck when you realize that you've been training for a year for the most disadvantaged ships in eve. i had begun to realize this about a month ago when a 3 month old corpmate was tanking better and doing heavier damage than me on rats with a cruiser, and me by then almost a year old on a battleship with a t2 fit. something's not right there.gallente have drones, caldari have missiles, amarr have lazors. all are very capable of achieving very heavy tanks. matari ships are fragile as heck, with nothing comparable to the advantages given to other ships at all.the only concrete advantage of matari ships are projectile guns with its supposedly capless advantage. as if. with enough skills the cap drain from firing guns on the ships of other races are negligible so it's not even an advantage. oh and did i mention that it has utterly poor dps and tracking anyway and use a ton of ammo (gallente and caldari guns does too, but hey, they have drones and missiles which hit no matter what, so who cares).in the olden days, they did have an advantage of speed for their hac ships. not anymore. yet it's still touted as the primary advantage of matari ships - speed and agility. as if it's supposed to make up for the massive advantages of other ships. a vague description that doesn't even come close to how matari ships actually are ingame. their speed advantage is very very minor and limited to their smaller ships. sure our hacs are some of the best, but then again so are the other races' hacs in their respective niches.so what else is the raison d'<U+FFFD>tre for matari ships? if ccp likes it like that why not just remove all matari ships altogether? all my other corpmates who once flew pure matari had no choice but to branch out to other ships. that means most of us had to train for twice the time just to get an effective ship.i have nothing concrete to suggest. i guess this is just a rant to vent off the frustration in the hopes that maybe just maybe ccp will shower more love on the matari ships. if we're supposed to be the 'speedy' race, then for goober's sakes, make it so. our speed 'advantage' at the moment barely counts for much, we have no dps/tank advantage to speak off, and none of the perks other nations got (amarrian armor, caldari missiles, gallente drones). nor are they really useful except for maybe scouting or solo ganking poor miners and of course - running away. and i sure as heck didn't train for a year just to become a scout or simply fleet support (as most of our bonuses are for fleet support - webs, scrams, target painters).all in all, give a reason again to be thankful i trained to be a pure matari pilot. because apparently the advantages of our ships are all just talk and their disadvantages plenty. rebalance please, please don't force us matari pilots to train yet again for the ships of other races.compare the pro/con lists in the official wiki:minmatar shipsamarr shipscaldari shipsgallente shipsthe first thing that springs to your mind when reading the minmatar ship advantages list is 'bullsh**!'. intentionally vague descriptions of advantages to mask the fact that they actully have nothing at all to compare to the other races.oh and i have no illusions. i think nothing will come out of this rant anyway. *sigh*"
"you know that isn't the official wiki, right?"
"fixed...idiot"
"feel free to contract me all your \"lol-useless\" minmatar ships. especially any hurricanes or typhoons you may have. i will gladly relieve you of the burden of looking at them cluttering up your hangar while you train for some other race's ships."
"ya bro. i totally fit my hurricane with 6 miner 2s. then someone came a flipped my can. i shot him with my drones and he killed me.hurricane totally needs to be boosted."
"can i have your minmatar ships?"
"got any extra vagabonds or hurricanes i can have?"
"sounds sensible to me."
"cripes yes... suddenly having the corp deliveries spammed with dross is worthy of pulling hair.they need to make the corporate deliveries hangar sortable by system/constellation/region/everywhere just like our personal assets.trying to recover deliveries from 100+ stations is a nightmare as it is, much less when a corp goob jumps into the soylent green processor."
"biggest issue in eve atm is lag which is cause by too many players in a system soo when groups like nc or sc go to fight your looking about 2k + people (which will just keep growing) in a single system which makes the fight unplayable soo remove standings so that alliance and corps can no longer blue other alliance and corps no more blues no more reds just neutralsalso put a cap on how many people can be in an alliance 1000 to 1500 would be my guessi belive doing this would reduce lag and also make the game more fun and help introduce new corps and alliance's to 0.0 this has prolly been suggested before but it seems the most simplist way to put the fun back into the game"
"nothing you propose will do anything to reduce lag. nothing. if you remove in game means by which to set standings, people will merely use out of game mechanics to accomplish the same goals. limit the number in an alliance? say hello to goons1, goons2, goons3 who will all still fly together putting the same numbers in a system.what would reduce lag would be for you to never log in again."
"if u remove the ability to set corps/alliance blue how u gonna deal with all neutrals in fleet fight (ofc u would have to remove the alliance and corp ticker option from the overview) maybe also reduce the max number in a fleet to 100 so then u go into a battle with your alliance only and u would not be able to distiguish as u say goons 2&3 with the enemysoo this will mean less numbers in fights alliance vs alliance not half of 0.0 vs the other half"
"i have more people than that in my corporation.e: well i did until i got booted."
"would you like to borrow a calculator, venkul?"
"i don't se how changes to sov system will encourage people to move from hi-sec to null. currently there's nothing which can attract people messing with industry/pve. in my opinion whole change in dominion(though it's nice to see they want to do something with it) is a bit of unthinked and ccp don't really have idea yet how it all should look like."
"yes, that is rather the point of this thread."
"and you think that is you reduce mineral request people will mine tritanium in 0.0?no one of the proposed changes will \"cure\" this because there are better minerals in 0.0.increase all mineral yield by 15 and people will still prefer bistot to tritanium.you get offended if i am late replying? lol what a ego.it will be a boost for 0.0 producers (and maybe, much maybe 0.0 miners).unless 0.0 producers start to sell to the big high sec market it will shift mineral prices only locally and if the producers are very honest.most 0.0 builder will be still paying high sec prices minus transportation to high sec cost for high ends and high sec costs plus importation cost for low ends. you need to learn how market work"
"i generally agree that 0.0 needs to be made way way more attractive then it currently is compared to highsec (and not by nerfing highsec but by boosting 0.0 - give us missions and meaningful ways to improve our space that don't suck)."
"supported. some extra stuff regarding mineral distribution:- hisec only should spawn tri & pyer related ores.- lowsec should spawn only the other related ores low-ends.- nullsec should spawn only abc+m.- wh stays as it is (various sizes of belts with all sorts of ore) & exploration belts the same.this way you entice a flow of activity regarding minerals between the 3 layers of security, so not any can be independent and exporting/importing is a must (coupled with industrial bonus, hopefully importing minerals to 0.0 will be more usefull than importing ships directlly)."
"in all honesty, i know you guys disagree... ;)i am pretty sure that malcanis agrees with me that 0.0 needs buffed (in accordance with ccp's stated intention to get more people to 0.0).venkul, i am not so sure that you agree with me or not.i am trying to figure out more ways to entice people to 0.0, instead of nerfing them out of hi-sec (which i think ccp is more than able and willing to do).venkul - is there anything that would make you go back and try 0.0 again? if so, let me hear it here!thanks to everyone who's posted so far, appreciate the feedback."
"iirc venkul wouldn't move back to 0.0 even if the belts were yielding supermodels because he's obsessed with the belief that all 0.0 corps exist for the sole purpose of making industrials miserable."
"as an empire manufacturer i see no reason to move to 0.0 with dominion.not because of the risk... i've had alts in 0.0 for years... but because of the logistics involved in keeping my assembly lines running.moving commodities to my manufacturing location takes a considerable logistic chain that is all too easily broken trying to get through the choke points of 0.0 (even with jump freighters). and then, once i've got my goods built, getting everything back to markets where it will actually sell (0.0 markets are a laughable joke... limited number of stations, restricted customer base by standings, ect ect) is another logistic nightmare.it's not the risk that keeps my assembly lines bottled up in empire, it's that delicate chain of supplies i simply cannot maintain in 0.0"
"hi, i think eve needs to bring more relevance to the shares of companies. shareholders do not control a company, as a matter of fact, unless they hold the ceo position. this should be corrected.a ceo, as things are now, control the corporation and can kick out, validly, any shareholder regardless of how many shares he or she owns, thus neglecting any rights of ownership of the corporation. for instance, it is common that a corporation is the owner of the shares (a holding company) of another corporation. so, the holding company will never control the ceo position of the company owned, as it is not a character that can hold offices. \"don't make ceo untrusted persons...\", yeah right, but on a complex corporation with lots of people, owning different companies, is impossible to control all the ceos.i propose shareholders should be able to govern a corporation, regardless if they hold ceo position and regardless if they belong or not to the corporation that issued the shares. ccp should allow shareholders to enforce a shareholders voting to expell the ceo and propose new ceo, without being part of the owned company. also, voting should be enforced once majority has been achieved, without giving time to ceos or directors to rip off companies.hope you find this proposal viable."
"i'm torn on this. i don't mind the way it is, though i agree it could be better. not sure if it should be better...here's a workaround:*) the game tries to take the next storyline agent within constellation. if possible its the same corp.*) you can \"block\" storyline agents by not doing their mission, the next available one is then taken instead. grind l1 missions to block him, then do good missions."
"i can relate. -though i don't know of the best solution.i currently don't have much interest in storyline missions which result in increased faction standings.storyline missions which increase corp standings but not faction standings would be nice.a reward system which benefits those who play across numerous factions and who maintain standings to allow for that, would be appreciated.the current arrangement seems to reveal an underlying notion of the game design that peace doesn't pay."
"and for the love of eve... make storyline missions... well... missions!!!nothing is more annoying than a storyline mission to get 8k of ore, or move 40k m3 of cargo containers 13 jumps to some distant station in lowsec (i mean, what idiot dev came up with that mission? what do you think their daily pasttime is? hint: it starts with 'gate' and ends with 'camp').make it a mission. make it a hard mission for its type, one that takes time and entails some actual risk (other than transporting the aforementioned oversize cargo through the same gate camp half a dozen times)."
"support the cause!"
"in another game where name changes, server transfers and even changing race are the norm you get the biggest asshats screwing over others time and time again with no consequences. this definitely degraded the quality of the player base. in eve it would make the whole point of characters being the sum of their history meanlingless."
"two main reasons come to mind:1) you typed in something dumb to start and after you've played awhile you realize that your name \"l33tawesomek00lduudz\" is not what you want2) you purchased a character but the name is \"l33tawesomek00lduudz\" and you cannot stand that.i don't see anything wrong with a name change if it is extremely limited and the history is shown. i'm thinking it would cost $15 and only doable once per character with a history shown and that cost waived when done through character transfers. this is not a whine from scammers wanting a free pass. there are legitimate reasons for wanting a name change. i don't see why you people are so paranoid over it, if a scammer changes his name he will be easily caught via history. besides, real scammers have disposable characters in which to scam and are perfectly happy biomassing/not using/selling the character after he cannot scam anymore because of reputation."
"no. absolutely not. your name is what identifies you. if you're a scammer, and you scam a lot, there are consequences. you develop a reputation. same with corp thievery, and many other notorious acts.likewise, chribba, noir. and many others have developed a reputation based solely on their names and their word.actions should have consequences, and i don't mean just clicking \"select new name $10\" from a menu."
"no, as some people wrote earlier your name should be your ingame \"id\". there's already character selling/buying - you can change name that way, if you want to loose your identity."
"the only way i could even remotely support this is that it's only available once, and it should cost a fairly hefty sum. those two points would help deter, but not remove the possibility for a scam artist to hide their identity. i'm still not really okay with it.also, having a list in your bio, even if it's just one name, means that more names will be taken up that aren't being used. it's a pita for the newcomers to the game, i'm sure.i guess the only reason why i'd even want this for just a little bit, is because i've changed the \"lifestyle\" of my character, and gone from a good little federation navy officer, to being wanted by all of the empires. for rp purposes, that i couldn't really have foreseen when i created my character, i'd like to change my \"call sign.\" but even then, i still see it as something i have to live with."
"in the two cases listed above, only #2 seems like a legitimate situation to me. #1, frankly, is your own damned fault. next time put some thought into your character name.however, i would support character name changes as part of character sales, for an additional (small) fee."
"i say no to name changes, you earn the reputation you get, so if you're known as a can flipper then people will know when you're in system to be on their guard for example.the only way i would allow a name change is maybe within the 1st month and only if you've got no negative sec status issues.why oh why did i call myself after a painful sitting down condition...... oh yeah i remember, i thought it was funny at the time and still do"
"due to the macromissionrunners being banned. isk has deflated to a level relative to that only insurance propping up the value of products.stave off insurance fraud by boosting lvl 4 missions to give more isk. this will have the effect of some inflation.due to the large isk sinks coming in with dominion and people more interested in pvp.we need lvl 4 missions to be boosted to give more isk to cover this hole. or everything will simply be funded by insurance fraud."
"i am a meager child of 12 and am unsure as to what this is."
"i have a better proposal: save the trolling for features and ideas discussions, and let us pretend that the assembly hall is a place of serious discussion."
"how dare you accuse me of breaking the rules and trolling. this is obviously not trolling. i am seriousbear and this is seriouspost."
"/supportedand caldari dont suck for pvp :p"
"v"
"i'm pretty sure this is negligible. also, if they behaved like turrets, then the launchers closest to the target would be the one's \"launching\" missiles. regardless... so what if the flight paths are slightly different because they were launched from different points on the ship? wouldn't that be more true to the way missiles work? besides... it would be such a small difference...that aside, i support this. i think it's long overdue, too."
"it's been 6 years, ccp..."
"not a huge deal, but would be nice to see."
"no. there are too many other important and more pressing issues, like musical instruments in ambulation, to consider before ccp should even ever think about this trivial matter."
"too right... and they need to fix missile so that they actually travel as far as they should.currently if a missile has 5k/s speed and 10s of flight time it'll go about 45km because, like a ship, missiles have to 'accelerate' up to their max velocity, cutting into flight time and shortening effective range."
"f-see me after class, jason."
"nice twist on the sagan quote.hmmm. something about this idea eminds me of that toxic gas cloud mission i might have warped into in a helios a long, long time ago in a solar system far, far away. i was pretty much immediately vaporized.this sounds more like something that could be implemented as a special kind of exploration site."
"simple all major alliances join same channel become blue to each other move entire legion capital army to boarder systems of low sec and high sec lock systems down become complete -0.0 standing kill any thing that comes through gates from high sec we don't need high sec we provide high sec. no new players will get their hands on on ours space"
"-20 spelling-20 grammar-500000 idearesult: really bad troll."
"think about it. there is what 20 gates to 0.0. 40 gates to low sec.if a triad of high end alliance and blue coalitions banded together.brought as much pain to those gates took them over with the new sov changesbarricaded the gates with around the clock support. you as a player base are essentially breaking eve's game by making your own rules in their sandbox.killing any thing not blue coming through those gates noob toons piracy for limited api keys if your below 20 million sp you die. if you arnt -1 standing to high sec you die no new player gets to experience's low sec or 0.0 based on player control.its unfathomable perfect id like to try and see ccp not listen to a coordinated action such as this.be it a week or three months if you major alliance align to fight a common enemy ccp and their changes. nothing cant be achieved. they will have to listen."
"...and so everyone's going to do this to get what accomplished, exactly? kicks? destroy the game? grief noobs? lobby for gameplay changes? i think you forgot to mention that in the original post."
"err lobby for game play changes. thought that was quite apparent. people think whiny and quitting the game will make them change something. but new players will keep coming in. we have a opportunity in a game were we make our own rules. who is to say we cant smite all new players from and block off a large portion of the game to new entry until they begin listening to the player base."
"you have to sleep sometime. your theory is flawed, and besides, the amount of distrust between the largest 0.0 alliances would have this falling apart within the first hour of operation."
"alliance 1: \"come sit on the lowsec gates and force ccp to take notice!\"aliance 2 \"lol. sure!\"alliance 1: \"hey where are you guys?\"message from eve mail: alliance 2 just kicked alliance 1 out of xxx region and stole all their stuff.rest of eve: \"lol! noobs.\"that is why you're idea has exactly a snowballs chance in hell of working."
"screw it, i support this idea. ccp wants \"emergence\" - give it to 'em! ;)"
"i'm not really sure what the op wants to do here but i felt like voting \"i'm with you\" for some reason. i think it's cause i have \"gas\"."
"i agree.you should force 0.0 alliances who hold sov to defend and secure lowsec. so i can go do missions in lowsec safely."
"title. scimitar has a saving grace in that it is fast enough to be survivable in a roaming gang solo, trading rep capacity for speed and an extender \"tank\"; however, the onerios can not fit a \"tank\" while maintaining enough cap mods to be semistable and be semisurvivable. in addition, both have a useless bonus to tracking links which is never used due to needing to use almost all mids and lows as cap mods to run all reps. on the other hand, the guardian and basilisks can pull cap out of their asses and thusly fit a nice buffer.remove the link bonus, and give either:10% to rep amount per logistics level.-or-allow scimitar to use armour reps, and onerios shield reps. give both more fitting to facilitate fitting new reps.-and-give a 25% reduction in cap recharge time to both ships -or- decrease rep cap use to a similar degree.move one midslot to a highslot.change armor drone rep bonus to shield on onerios and vice versa on scim.give scimitar about 100mw more grid, and the onerios about 30tf more cpu.personally, i'd rather to see the dual rep rather than a straight rep bonus, but both are here for argument. there's still going to be significant trade-offs, but it'd be better than it is now."
"oneiros for example should be allowed to fit 1 cap remote rep. so it frees up highslots for mining lasers."
"so this must be why all fast gangs have basilisks for logistics instead of scimitars, right?"
"no because the scimitars have better mining yield."
"edit: i realize this is a bit of an old thread and possibly the topics have been proposed individually by now. however, i thought it was worth bringing up again to remind people about the process that will get their ideas the best chance of support.none of your ideas will be brought to ccp's attention by the csm without significant player support in response to individual proposals for each idea here. by support, i mean players clicking the \"support\" option when replying to your proposal thread. your omnibus approach almost guarantees you won't be taken seriously, nor get player support. how can people support something that is unexplained? there are some interesting topics in your list but i wouldn't offer my player support for any of them without more information and insight into the underlying issues and what specific changes you think should be made to address them.if you feel strongly enough about your ideas, invest the time to break each out into its own proposal thread. if you're not willing to make that investment, how can you expect anyone to take you seriously? as far as the five minute delay goes, writing an intelligent and well-thought out idea proposal should take at least five minutes. i don't see the problem. do a couple a day so that people have time to think about and respond to them, rather than flooding assembly hall with 16 of them them. as for keeping track of them, bookmark your threads and organize them in a folder for easy navigation to them. it's not that difficult. i do it all the time."
"i know a great many play eve with their sound off, this is largely due to eve not actually supplying you with many audio-prompts that are immediately beneficial to gameplay.i think eve's audio environment could benefit from audio feedback on your situation. i dont know how feasable this is, and whether or not the voice actress that did aura is still available, but i would definitely love to have audio warnings for such events as:-low shields, armor, structure warnings (user definable)-ewar affecting your ship (e.g. your turrets are being disrupted)-ward disruption -being- applied, as opposed to the warning coming up when you try to warp, tell us when it is being applied.-low ammo in your clip to warn you of the upcoming reload-warning when you are being targetted-warning when being neuted.i think a richer audio enviroment would increase the number of players actually using sound, as well as giving you valuable audio information that will not have to be constantly checked by eye."
"it would help if they would fix the sounds they already have first.ever since they tried to \"fix\" turret sounds, the sounds for events like weapons firing and hitting are no longer reliable as indicators of these events. sometimes you can hear them and sometimes you can't, and sometimes you have to move your camera farther from your ship to hear your own missiles or guns firing or the impact of enemy missiles on your ship. this erratic behavior is not just bad design, it's extremely annoying.put sounds back the way they were, with the exception of making the \"quieter turret sounds\" checkbox they added actually do what it says - currently it seems to have no effect whatsoever.and get rid of the annoying hums and \"doo-dee... doo-dee...\" sounds they added to shield and armor hardeners (respectively). i don't want to have to zoom out until i can barely see my ship just to avoid having to listen to that constant, irritating droning or beeping."
"delete"
"instead of dropping named bpcs, i think that the npcs should drop \"wrecked\" modules that one could then reverse engineer to get named bpcs. wrecked modules could refine for quite a bit less than their named counterparts would. no, this isn't a stealth ninja salvaging nerf. :3"
"v- but for #2- you have to replace that loot with some value- such as bounty or less overall items but significantly of greater value."
"nice idea both #1 and #2. that changes would seem reasonable if they would really be \"small\" changes.also basic t1 modules not dropping from npc sounds good."
"irony?"

"based on your answers to the csm vote matcher, i have a few questions for you:- you disagree that mining in its current form is not profitable enough. why is that? the amount of boredom they go through (self inflicted, true) should be rewarded. think of the poor miners!- now that moons were nerfed, there is little conflict driver for 0.0 alliances, also since holding space becomes mostly a burden. with the proposed changes 0.0 becomes carebear wonderland (though easily disruptable), replacing pvp as a means to get hold of valuable assets to do more pvp with a system where you have to pve to pay the bills to pve some more. why do you think this is good?- you are against the increase of production and research slots. while i agree that research slots are one of the main reasons to put up a pos in empire, eves population is increasing, making the situation worse over time. imho a good compromise would be to increase the number of slots, but also increase (and level) slot fees, so that it at least matches the cost of one slot of a pos you're running.- please explain how being against the ending of t2 bpos is not motivated by self interest.- why shouldn't invention become more profitable? imo t2 ship prices are too high and invented bpcs are too inefficient. decrease their cost, increasing volumes moved, increasing profits. again, sounds like you are sitting on t2 bpos.and here is another question that every candidate should answer:- since you have a rl job and maybe other responsibilities, how can you get enough free time to do the position as csm justice?regards"

"compared to the marketing done for the previous takecare candidates, i found little info on z0d tbh. are there any documented public appearances?based on your answers in the csm vote matcher, here are some questions for you:- you disagree that suicide ganking should be viable. the question leaves some room for interpretation. i think it should be viable in the sense of being possible, but less profitable then it is currently. so if you decide to suicide that freighter it should be for strategic reasons (it was carrying precious cargo to my enemy). what do you think?- you would like to see 0.0 infrastructure vulnerable to small gangs. if that is because you'd like to see small entities being able to get a foothold in 0.0, imo that is fair. if its purely for causing disruption with no strategic value, how do you think this could be balanced?- how the hell does eves core combat system lack complexity?- pos logistics in w-space is already a nightmare. why should they be exposed to more dangers?- now that moons were nerfed, there is little conflict driver for 0.0 alliances, also since holding space becomes mostly a burden. with the proposed changes 0.0 becomes carebear wonderland (though easily disruptable), replacing pvp as a means to get hold of valuable assets to do more pvp with a system where you have to pve to pay the bills to pve some more. why do you think this is good?other than those points i like your proposals, though imo they only cover a part of the subjects that require love from ccp.and here is another question that every candidate should answer:- since you have a rl job and maybe other responsibilities, how can you get enough free time to do the position as csm justice?regards"

"i'll answer two of your questions, if you don't mind.unfortunately, all of us (erik, z0d, me and my brother) had a very busy time irl and we were unable to produce a movie before the elections. z0d has thus far not been able to schedule any interviews despite him trying. seems like the interviewers are much more interested in the major 0.0 chestbeaters. maybe something tomorrow though, not sure.all three of us were present at fanfest during most of the roundtables.i think z0ds answer to this question was influenced a lot by my whining about it in private so let me state my reasons.alert: the following doesn't reflect z0ds personal opinion and my corp/alliance definately does not endorse this view. just my own personal opinion as gamer and game designer here. if you're easily offended please don't read it either. in my opinion, eve's combat model is very straightforward. the problem isn't that it's not twitch-based, but the lack of options. both to create a valid fitting and when actually flying in space. the combat itself only has a few options which is attempt to get to a certain range of your target, attempt to create or nullify transversal, fire your stuff, activate your tank (if you have it), and maybe use some ewar or energy denial. if you have a blo... uhh fleet then there is probably some maniac shouting over voicecoms who to zap first. great.ship fittings are limited and straight forward. ships have a certain role which determines how they should be fit. you pick a weapons type which is basically already determined by the race of the ship you fly and the corresponding ship bonus, choose one of four tank systems, and fit the modules that create the most optimal outcome in eft. you can opt for some speedboosts, webs, scrams, maybe a nos or a neut if fitting allows it, and that's as varied as it gets. the pinnacles of creativity are things like the passive shield dominix or fitting an oversized shieldbooster on your baitship in the alliance tournament. *yawn*all of this means that eve core combat is actually very similar to world of warcraft's (does this tell how boring i find eve pvp good enough?) ships are the classes and the classes have 2 or if lucky 3 optimal cookie cutter builds where you maybe vary a few talen... i meant module or two to show off your rebel creativity. if you're a rich guy, you can fit some epic... i mean faction and officer modules which pwn lower tier stuff, unless you're a total clueless buttonbashing monkey and still manage to get your behind handed to you. just like world of warcraft, there is a rock-paper-scissors mechanic which makes class a variant 1 strong against class b variant 3 to which the counter is class c variant 2 and you just pray that you don't run into your class nemesis and specced your class i mean fitted your ship to emerge victorious from your encounter with the enemy. if all else fails, just throw that last shred which eve calls \"tactics\" out of the window and either bring 10x as much people or wardec some noobs to claim your well-earned victory.i'll stick to guild wars where i can mess around and be really creative so that something insanely good pops up every once in a while. not that it is a very enjoyable game after i assembled my characters. fortunately i'm a half decent programmer and i just make bots to play them and win against natural stupitidy in pvp, while i'm doing more important stuff."
"well, i like most of what you did or tried to accomplish in the csm, but i can only wish that you.. uhm.. were more successful at pvp so that could enjoy this great aspect of eve tempted to say gtfo while it's not so common these days tactics can play a large role in the outcome of battles. imho much of your whine about lack of flexibility only applies if you look at a single player/ship. as soon as you put together a small gang the amount of permutations rise dramatically. the impact can be huge, which can be seen for instance when an outnumbered gang manages to prevail.macroer! get her!!!!"
"let me state that i never botted eve. i did hack eve, but reported my findings to the devs immediately and they fixed the security gap.maybe something for next alliance tournament though."
"as far as i know z0d hangs around eve all the time, even when he is at work ;)he has already devoted much of his time helping people around him (as you may quess from post around here).also he's a kind of a world runner and spender - not just someone who only hangs around chats all day long \"wishing things were so\" - meaning he does not hesitate to push his rl assets to make his eve expirience more worthwhile.so from the narrow perspective of people i know he is definetly one up for this task.only negative i can think of is that he maybe be a bit too stubburn in his views, but given z0ds aims laid down here that is probably a good thing too and finaly the punch line while the story of adam and eve seems to have some rather disturbing gaps,the story of denis and eve is ongoin everyday reality -----vote zodvote more relaxing and more rewarding eve expierience"
"hey ankh, i think you're sniping a lot of z0d's airtime here. while i'm sure he's a pretty cool guy who doesn't afraid of anything i'm sure the people here would rather hear his opinions on issues, not take care's (and hence your ideas by proxy).z0d, while your list of issues are long and have no doubt been thought tanked to death please tell us of your personal in game experiences and knowledge of:running a corppvp dynamics in hisec/lowsec/0.0manufacturingpve (including anomolies and wormholes)starbase management"
"regarding the viability of suicide ganking, in my opinion there currently is still too little consequence to carrying out a gank. the sec status his is laughable and people can still smartbomb even if they are at -10. recycled alt characters with destroyers is also becomming common practice. while i do not think that game mechanics should prevent suicide ganking alltogether, indiscrimiately ganking random targets for huge profits should not be viable. there should be risk and consequence attached for the ganker.in my opinion some adjustments should be made that takes in account a few different factors. the ganker himself should not get an insurance return for suiciding a ship by doing something illegal, be killed and then claim insurance for his deed. for example concord response could be based on the sec status of a player transporting the goods whatever the form of transport used. the higher his sec status the stronger and faster concord's response will be to the criminal act. the same is viable the other way around where the lower someone's sec status is, the slower the concord response should be.then with the goods transporter lies the responsibility of splitting high valuable into more secure ships and not flying autopilot totally afk to maximise his goods remaining his, until their intended destination. if one person chooses to transport 300 mil worth of good in a hauler afk that is worth 800k isk, then he only has himself to blame for it and hopefully he learns from his mistake.for the major infrastructures being able to cause disruptions that could modify certain attributes and features dynamically would make it interesting tactically for an enemy to plan disruptive incursions, which then causes certain of those effect having to be reinstated from their disrupted status.the main reason why i want to see 0.0 infrastructure vulnerable to small gangs, is because it is clear that many players in 0.0 are looking for small gang emergent pvp, and not for huge blobs. i hope that the vulnerable infrastructure provides incentives for people to leave the blob at home and roam around in small, fast gangs.it would be logical to be of more dangers as it is technically the worst type of space out there. we start from a typical 1.0 system where concord responds immediately and as you go down towards 0.5, response becomes a lot slower, then you enter low sec where most laws are decided by the players living there but still have an impact, then you get 0.0 where law is usually written by the biggest guns and finally unstable space where one day to the next entry and exit could lead from one corner of the universe to the other. absolutely anything can go in there and the rewards of living in it should reflect the ultimate risks taken by the people choosing to harvest the most unpredictable space which wormholes should be."
"moons were essentially nerfed to remove a monopoly held by the bigger player blocks, having their numbers far more limited, makes it easier for the few very large alliances to hold the best places and run a complete cartel. re-distributing the required moon based components required across a broader range of more common moons and in the upcoming required quantities will enable more smaller based alliances, corporations to participate and be able to also prosper independently.sovereingty changes that are comming will most defitivelely require a lot of balancing as with any major changes brought in that dramatically changes existing systems. this in my opinion will force the largest alliances to size down held space to a size they can manage. this should hopefully lead to more smaller groups to come and occupy those new space either in partnership or by themselves. this potentially bringing more pvp and conflict opportunities to players as well as many new trading materials having to be moved around in and extracted to empire. these changes will defitively affect our game on a global scale.you worry for pvp, but with 0.0 carebear wonderland, as you call it, i also hope that more players choose to actually earn their money in 0.0, and the economic upgrades coming in dominion should ensure that 0.0 becomes more attractive to live in. this means that there will be more potential targets as well, and more opportunity for small skirmishes which i believe is what a lot of 0.0 pvpers seek."
"i created my current corp over 3 years ago and built it from scratch. security, infrastructure, policies towards other corp members, corporations and alliances. i can say that one of the tedious part was to use the corporate ui and actually make it work. building everything and testing security with alts of my own or other corpmates. it quickly highlighted many points that would need complete makeover to actually properly secure corporate and allied members and assets. there are a lot of places where some settings are either too little or simply way too much but no middle ground, leaving areas completely vulnerable to massive potential corporate and allied damages. look no further than former band of brothers and just recently cva.my own pvp experience is mostly theoretical as i am essentially an industrial and marketer. i have nonetheless been in enough wars and survived through each and used them as experience to be better prepared for the next ones, travel through lowsec when needed and been occasionally into 0.0 and wormholes with friends. one of the great advantages as a market runner and industrial is that you can if being proactive and actually take the time to talk to your customers meet an incredibly diversified scope of players in all types of career paths and many solid friendship have formed up that way for me and keeps expanding.on the manufacturing side which i have been running for years and keep expanding in many ways with other industrial and trading partners. finding ways to expand is sometime quite challenging but is also quite rewarding when you reach a new goal, then set new bigger ones. in terms of manufacturing itself, we can basically build anything just about in eve, short of super-carriers and titans. a lot of planning goes into deciding who will train specifically what, so that efficiency can be maximised as a group to get the build jobs done. contrary to what many may think industry can become quite complex when working with t1, t2, t3, supplies etc.as far as my experience is mostly theoretical for pvp. for me pve is a place where i am very strong, having run myself a very extensive amount of missions, ranging from cosmos, l1-l4, datacenters, r&d and make myself available when friends need a hand at handling through missions. i have been in some anomalies and wormholes as secondary much less than mission running itself.pos management from as far as a couple years ago when i started using them has been quite interesting from many points. there are many ways one can go about tailoring the fitting of the mods on it to suit ones specific needs of either research, defences, harvesting etc and is essential for industrials that do research (me/pe), copying, manufacturing simple to advanced jobs which is mostly my use for them. more needs to be done for the interface which can be quite cramped especially when you have a pos system loaded with industry, protective and offensive modules in terms of management."

"i've spent quite a bit of time in wormholes where there is a form of delayed local (delayed until somebody talks) and it makes for some interesting tactics.local is currently an intel tool for both defender and attacker. a defender is notified as soon as a hostile player enters system and can thus take action before that player has even loaded. an attacker entering a system is told as soon as they load how many people are in the system and can decide if it is safe to shoot that target on gate or if it is worth sweeping through the system looking for targets.this currently makes it tricky to sneak up on targets because even if you enter from a different gate they see local spike and bug out. you can't even sneak a covert fleet in via a blackops portal because they will see you in local. as a defender you can't hide your true numbers in system without springing a login trap when the attackers have committed themselves.then there is the often complained about single afk cloaked ship in system stopping people from ratting.so the question is what type of delayed local is appropriate for normal (known) space. do we want the same as wormholes where you don't appear if you don't speak, or do we want what we have now just with a delay between entering system and local updating (and how long a delay)?it needs further discussion and testing on sisi but i think it would be interesting to try a 2-5 min local delay between entering and leaving a system and it would only apply to 0.0 and maybe later lowsec. (empires have better comms networks and thus can update ship beacons straight away )there are other issues too, such as avoiding spamming the directional scanner  maybe some kind of 1au proximity alarm instead. i think this is a fair point. i don't see much incentive to take space from another alliance other than lowsec/npc 0.0 gateways, outpost systems and other logistically significant locations. will those be enough of a reason? i'm not sure. it was certainly much easier to point at an r64 and have a reason to take it. i like small roaming gangs (5-20 people, fast moving, hit and run style) and having seen the infrastructure hub's hitpoints it is certainly not going to be bothered by even 20 bs.so we are not going to be removing sov anytime soon but i would however like the ability to be a fly in the ointment, to go into sov space and disrupt operations there. this would keep sov 0.0 alliances honest as they would have to protect their ratters, miners etc and create some opportunities for fights. i've not really thought of any additional ideas for disrupting infrastructure (though you could have hacking type modules to offline upgrades, maybe).for this question i mostly wanted to repeat my support the smaller roaming pvp gangs.hopefully that makes my position clear even if you don't agree with me"
"yes, we know small gang pvp is an issue close to your heart, and even if i disagree on some points, the fact that i am asking is because i think you did very well in the podcasts and other public appearances.that's is a different problem (for which several interesting solutions were proposed). making local delayed doesn't really help.are you telling me you need 5 minutes to catch an unsuspecting ratter or miner? seriously though, i think a delay of 15-20 seconds already produces the desired effect, and if you want to catch people, that is what interceptors are for. for 0.0 you could actually tie the delay to system upgrades, giving the defending entity an intel advantage...my question also was, supposing the infrastructures could be disrupted by small gangs by any means, what would you get out of it if you don't really have a chance of taking the sov? even supposing the hubs had far less hitpoints, why would you prefer to shoot a stationary structure instead of doing pvp?and here is a different question: you very probably have a rl full time job, a family maybe. how can you get enough free time to do the csm position justice?best regards"
"i felt it was important to make the effort it depends on what form of delayed local is used. if you use w-space style local then the issue of an afk cloaker in system isn't the same because you don't know they are there. you assume i want this change to simply go gank ratters? with the directional scanner changes and new probe mechanics i would say that even 30 seconds isn't long enough to find a ratter if that were my reasoning for this change.in reality there are many instances where we would like to be able to circle around a gatecamp and be in warp to them from another gate before they see us appear in local. if they have catch bubbles we need time to get a covops on grid to setup a warp in. currently when the covops gets in system they can see and so bug out.my point was that with the amount of hp there isn't any point us even thinking of taking the system and the defenders would know it.what we would get out of being able to disrupt something is a reaction from the alliance which leads to a fun fight for both parties.i'd say i'm already spending 3-4 hours per day on csm campaigning (plus running extra pvp courses at the weekends) so getting voted in would probably save me time in seriousness i have enough eve time to take on the csm tasks and do them justice. it might mean i get a bit less pvp some weeks but that is a price i am willing to pay."
"for gang vs. gang the change is fine, they are looking for a fight, actively scanning, the one with the more/better scouts has the edge on intel. i'm worried about soloers, pvpers but especially ratters. don't you agree that they'll be at a greater disadvantage than they already are? they have no scout and no warnings. the directional scanner doesn't really help in this situation, you can't expect ratters to rescan every few seconds for hours just to see if there is an inty just about to land on grid.i can imagine variations of the proposal being more balanced. for instance making pilots flying covops appear x minutes later, and making the other ships only appear in local after they broke cloak. or even bigger/crazier proposals, like an intel disruption bubble, while you are inside you don't appear in local but also don't see local..."
"this is why as good as the vote match site is it doesn't give the whole picture. yes there are many issues to cover with a change to local but the five options available can't convey that. removal of local brings up the option of other intel tools which haven't yet been discussed.to specifically tackle the ratting question (did you see what i did there ), yes it would be seen as a nerf to 0.0 solo ratting if there wasn't an easy mechanism to say \"new in local, warp to safe and cloak\".i think it comes down to risk vs reward as well as encouraging the m in multiplayer. if people really want to be safe earning isk solo then there are other options (l4s in empire etc). i'm not sure protecting solo ratters in 0.0 at the expense of gang pvp is worth it but i'm open to other suggestions for new intel tools etc to make it fair.ultimately it needs to be driven by player suggestions, submitted to the csm from a proposal in the assembly hall and then have on the record discussion during csm meetings. there are far too many issues for one person to have all the answers at this point, hopefully you can see my general opinions though.as a final thought on this, i was at one of the pvp roundtables at fanfest when the issue of local was discussed. two big power blocs took opposing views on it and argued for some time. by the end of the discussion both parties had swapped position on the subject. there were also discussions about replacement intel tools such as sov holders having reports from the gates they pay the upkeep on and other ideas to reduce the problem of direction scanner spam.it is a very tricky and emotional subject, but i am not shying away to protect votes or otherwise hoping it doesn't come up.all good points which would have to be considered in any \"removal of local\" proposal put to the csm. the csm process is supposed to be one of engaging the community to suggest improvements, discussing them at the csm meetings and finally pass them to ccp.i hope with my posts you can see i take the process seriously, am willing to discuss issues and if elected take suggestions from players forward. i do enjoy these kind of discussions and good proposals should be able to withstand a little scrutiny"
"well, to put it bluntly, i think you are trying to fix something that is not broken, at the expense of another player group. i.e., while i am not mainly a small gang pvper, when i do go roaming, i don't have problems finding targets/fights with a bit of patience. remember that dominion forces people to do more pve, so you'll already have more targets, and nerfing local would be another kick in their nuts. yes, i can see that. that kind integrity (at least till you're involved in the next scandal ) is something going for you. you also have my sympathy as a candidate for doing teaching in eve. i'll be casting my 3 votes on the end of the voting period, candidates should work for them , but you're on a good way, even though i don't agree with your pet project."
"i don't belive it is working as intended but i wouldn't say it was broken as such. more so i believe that improvements could be made and as i also stated the ideas at fanfest were that removing local would require new intel tools which would help sov 0.0 (such as gate reports).i know you disagree but that is fine - there are many things in eve that cause opposite opinions and so far the game has survived don't misunderstand, it isn't a pet project of mine (though obviously i have an interest in such a change). nothing would go before the csm without a player proposal. i would however support the submission and discussion of such a proposal (and add to the discussion threads etc). i'm more interested in ensuring any overall solution (local + new intel) is well thought out than i am in making changes for the sake of it there are a number of things i would like to take forward from the assembly hall threads, such as shared corp bookmarks, assault frig bonuses, rockets and the like but i'm not sure i would class those as pet projects either"
"you have my vote (x2). good luck mate."
"mr. dawnchaser... ::nods::... vote gained, and cast, sir."
"actually, ahs, the pilot of an orca can make it so the people from the fleet can put things in the corp hangar bay, but i don't believe they can take."
"correct. currently a fleet can be configured to have 'put' rights only on a ship that has corporate hangers. i'd like to see the pilots of those ships have control over all corp hangers on the ship and specify which hangers have 'get' and 'put' rights. in addition, i'd like to see the orca/rorq pilot have the ability to name those hangers and the name would be properly reflected to the fleet members regardless of which corp they are from. ahs"
"i appreciate your positions and proposed changes. i'm with ya."
"i didn't see any real issues of concern. issues such as csm oversight, new player experience revamp, new content such as ships, and ui overhaul.whether that's because the csms don't care about them or because the creator of the vote match website forgot them i'm not sure."
"i think it comes down to what you expect the questions to do. a lot of the ones you list are rather boring, ultimately. do i want cool new ships? you bet. would i like to see the ui get overhauled? of course. the hard part would be finding a candidate that'd disagree with either of those statements when you phrase them generically. this isn't designed to get at the csm's \"motherhood and apple pie\" issues, the ones where we all agree and the fight is just to sound more concerned than the other candidates. the point of the site is to ask about questions where candidates disagree, to try to shed light on the differences and aid voters in choosing. polling the candidates to find out that we're all anti-t20 and pro-csm doesn't help that at all."

"you're so wrong, changes to the scanner were 6 weeks before the fanfest. the petition to revert the scanner nerf is august 20th, check your facts before posting.you have no excuses, 70 pages of people asking csm to talk to ccp about an issue, and you talk about all sort of **** except that only topic, delibaretly ignoring requests of people that voted for you, and therefore beeing fail."
"so now you lie to cover your ineptitude, just wow. scanner changes were introduced 2 months before fan-fest."
"in the csms defence, to my understanding it was the 20th of august the \"unnerf the scanner\" post was started and the meeting was on the 4th of september weekend (?) so that makes it under 2 weeks. the fanfest was for clearing up one or two topics already brought up, not for new topics.that said however the csm has a strong history of ignoring the most supported topics in the assembly. and ccp have a strong history of vetoing the topics that do manage to get through the csm filter.this pundits advice: be patient but dont hold your breath. work tenaciously at the foundations but do not bang your head against the wall. watch the perspective and critical analysis of csm members wilt under the fury of the ccp meet and greet package as they transform into cringing fanbois.never give up - and vote abstain with all your accountsskunk"
"hurrrrrr...apoc 1.5 (which is when these changes made their debut was released on the 20th of august. the csm summit which these minutes cover and was seperate to fan fest took place from the 3rd to the 4th of september. i believe the final meeting we had where we were able to discuss issues to 'officially' raise topics with ccp was some time at the start of august. so yes, while we did raise hell about it, nothing was official and hence won't show on the minutes.if you are going to continue to whine about the process but not educate yourself sufficiently about said process then you should probably go and stick your head in a gas oven (in game) and remove yourself from the gene pool (in game).as i am no longer involved in the process i can't comment on it, but it was brought up at fanfest and it has been raised officially (i would dig it up but i cba).i was just as unhappy as anyone else, perhaps more so because i am, by several orders of magnitude, more competant with the scanner than i'm sure i a lot of you mouth breathers are. recently i believe the delay has been changed to 1.3 seconds, if that's as good as it's going to get then i suggest you live with it. the csm are not devs. if the devs implement a change because of technical/server issues (scanner spamming was absolutely throttling the servers) then that's their perogative. if you're still unhappy then cancel your account, the door is that way."
"you say it was raised at fansfest. ok then, what ccp said ?"
"just read the minutes. really glad to finally see them, and there is a lot of insightful detail in there. those meetings must be pretty hellish with so much to cover. but anyway...of concern to me is the fact that there were some \"action items\" requested of the csm by ccp (wish lists, for example). i'm concerned and curious about how csm4 is going to ensure the ball doesn't get dropped on those. are there internal mechanisms used and shared from one csm to the next to track such things?"
"there is nothing about the scanner on the minutes, moron. that's why i'm asking, i just want to know. but you see that larkonis arrogant answer \"just quit the game\". so much for representing players. thousands of people ask you to talk to ccp about 1 specific issue and after 3 months we still dont know anything. and if you try to ask a simple question, you're beeing \"a bell end about this\"."
"fyi i resigned my spot on the csm during the iceland summit and had no further dealings with anything.with regards to fanfest, there wasn't an official meeting so i don't think you'll see anything 'official' published. there should have been some online meetings at some point or they are just around the corner with 'official' answers. regardless, i'll tell you now, off the record and on the qt, i personally can't see the changes getting rolled back. i think 1.3 seconds is as good as it's going to get. given the choice between the servers getting throttled like a ginger stepchild or the rabid qqing of a (significant) minority i think ccp would rather have the tears tbh."
"excuse me, you're calling me a moron? in case you are, just so you know:\"just read the minutes.\" was meant as:\"i just read the minutes.\" (as in past tense, where \"read\" rhymes with \"red\")it was not intended as a directive to you. i wasn't even replying to you, otherwise i'd have quoted you. i was simply making a general observation about the availability of the minutes and the fact i'd just read them. i got lazy while typing my thoughts and left off that apparently oh-so-vital pronoun.jeeze. easy to see how it got misinterpreted but is name-calling really necessary in this discussion?"
"bump for a good friend :)"

"i have yet to see any new arguments being made that haven't been made many times over the last few years of struggling with this issue.the bottom line is that the alliances in fw issue isn't a new one, it's been one since before fw was turned on. ccp has weighed in on the issue several times, and in each of those times we were told that they would fix the situation so that alliances (such as ours) would no longer be barred from the rp war that we've been fighting for more than five years and that has since been largely usurped from us.for those who think that the currently proposed solution is reasonable, consider that while ushra'khan -- an alliance that has been fighting for matari freedom for five years -- and cva -- an alliance that has done more to reclaim space than the last dozen emperors have -- will remain barred from joining the fight. on the other hand, the privateer alliance would be welcome to join the faction of their choice! \o/in any case, this thread isn't an 'issue' thread. it's a request for information on candidates. teadaze, your opposition to representing my perspective in the csm is noted. z0d and sokratesz, your support for my concerns are likewise noted.would any other csm candidates care to voice their position?"
"indeed. no new argument for why this should be allowed past what has been agreed in principle thus nothing will change.firstly csm #3 and ccp have agreed that alliances could be allowed into fw. you are therefore not being barred for any reason other than your own reluctance to give up your sov space in return. you've been unwilling to explain why you think that is unreasonable.people in factional warfare have concerns about large alliances steamrollering in, should we ignore their concerns over yours?irrelevant argument. u'k and cva would be fully able to join fw under the agreed terms, they just would have to make a choice between sov 0.0 and fw/rp. what have privateers got to do with anything? have they tried to justify having cheaper war decs for some rp reason? under the proposed solution any non sov holding alliance would be able to join fw providing they reach the standings requirement. are you saying that they shouldn't be allowed because they don't rp?if you give a good argument for why an alliance should be allowed into factional warfare as well as continue to hold sov then i would be happy to represent your position. the problem is you keep rehashing the \"because we've been rping this war for 5 years and want special treatment\" line.i could have taken the easy option and agreed to represent your position for free votes, but i'm not that kind of person. instead i gave my time to help you understand why csm #3 and ccp might have decided on the restrictions they did and give you the chance to respond with an updated proposal. i even suggested a possible solution where you'd be allowed to join if you had to open up your sov space to the militia you joined.if i get to the csm, i would be happy to present this issue again as is. but i'm honest enough to say i wouldn't vote for it without an update to explain why a sov holding alliance should be allowed to join fw and retain the benefits of both."
"as becq has requested that this should not become a deabte i'll finish by saying the following:to me, that's like asking why i should be able to run hi-sec missions while also ratting in 0.0!it certainly was an outcome they would have known about full well. they know who is pushing for access and they know that those two alliances hold sov.the arguments have been made by others repeatedly. the question now is why should sov holding alliances be excluded? i've not seen a convincing answer.you seem to ignore that we work for that 0.0 sov. i'm not running for election."
"i see your point, but it isn't comparable. it would be more like the opposite fw militia asking to be able to capture your space without having to form an alliance. remember, you are trying to change the current behaviour but you are the ones wanting to make a change! it isn't a matter of trying to find a reason not to make a change, it is simply a matter of you giving a good reason why the change is warranted.i wasn't on csm #3 (and at this rate i won't be on csm #4 either ) but they decided that having sov while in fw was wrong and ccp agreed with them. the ball is back in your court so make a strong case instead of gnashing teeth and pointing at 5 years of rp. as to alleged bias against your alliances in particular, again i can't speak for csm #3 but it does strike me that if alliances are allowed in fw it has to be any alliance that meets whatever criteria are required. and fw people work for their \"sov\". you want to influence theirs but they can't retaliate against yours, does that seem fair? you gain the benefits of their work, they can't gain the benefit of yours, does that seem fair?which is why i suggested an idea for allowing the militia you join to share your sov as you share their fw. if anything that requirement would stop non rp alliances from joining fw so would be a benefit to your cause, right? i'm not the one trying to make a change to fw to allow alliances to join on their terms not the terms agreed between ccp and csm #3 .i'm looking out for the factional warfare players at this point because until you (as a group of sov holding alliances wanting to play in fw) provide a good reason why you should have the ability to join fw while having the benefits of sov i don't see what the non alliance fw players gain.at this point i've asked many times for a reason to support your aim and each time you've avoided the question. i'm sure some candidates will jump at the chance to get easy votes and state that i am an idiot. i've just been trying to point out that your case needs to be modified. i'll say again, if you can point to one good reason for allowing alliances to hold sov while in fw then i would be happy to support you.as the argument is going in circles i'll say no more unless i'm misquoted etc or you supply that case for change"
"becq, i think your issue is totally valid, and in fact outside of csm i've been privately working on a player project to put the rp back into fw. the combination of fw and rp is a great untapped opportunity for some awesome player experience, not only for existing players, but as a theme to bring more new players to the eve universe."
"if alliances can be in fw then fw corps can also form alliances. i really don't get your them vs us which you keep bringing up.keep in mind in all this that we are also arguing that our arch enemies like cva should be allowed to join. that would allow amarr fw corps to join cva. it's not all just for our benefit. and i said repeatedly why i do not think holding sov is an issue. eg. at the top where i said one of our corps once had a sov claiming pos at a moon in one little system, making us a 'sov holding alliance'.i do however respect your standing by your views. let's leave it there."
"there is the cost and organisation involved and then it changes the dynamics a fair bit if it becomes (say) four big fw alliances rather than a loose association of individual players and corps. i got the impression that ccp view fw more for casual players than sov 0.0 and thus would like to keep the two separated.from an rp point of view it makes perfect sense for cva and u'k to represent their factions. but much as i respect both alliances for what they have added to the game (even though cva have us set red ) i don't feel rp alone is a good enough reason to make gameplay changes.if there are other ways to improve the rp that don't require game balance changes then i'd be happy to support those proposals. we agree to disagree on this specific issue. if i make it into csm #4 i look forward to more healthy debates and maybe supporting you in other matters"
"1) create new corp outside of your alliance2) join that corp3) enlist corp into fw4) ???5) profittada... you can now go fw as a corp rather than an alliance. or, just drop out of your corp and go join the npc fw corp.ccp has said no on the sov holding alliance, but they have still left you a way to enter fw."
"i can't support this as such. what you are asking is to be able to do both 0.0 alliance warfare and fw in the same context (that is from the same alliance). that kind of ruins the idea of fw as a stepping stone into 0.0 warfare.what i would support is a fw variant for alliances that would allow them to ally with a major faction and get lp for killing alliances loyal to the opponent alliances or something along those lines, but not get automatic access to fw in its current form.i can't support an idea that would allow 0.0 alliance of highly skilled players to go on a killing spree in fw and get lp's for that, without some practical barriers."
"what is this \"fw is a stepping stone into 0.0\" nonsense? by keeping a rigid wall between fw and the rest of eve, you are creating the opposite effect, divorcing the two sandboxes completely. what's needed is the existence of player structures that cross into both spheres, allowing players to test the waters in both without having to quit one to try the other. in much the same way that there are currently alliances that are empire-only, nullsec-only, and split between the two, the same should exist for fw. existing members of the militia could either remain independant, join a friendly alliance, or create their own fw-only alliance. if this seems like too many people in too small a spere of conflict, then expand fw to the remaining regions of lowsec.lps, lps, lps. who gives a flip about lps? i'm a freedom fighter. i want to kill slavers and free my people. the bottom line is this: the 24th imperial crusade is attacking my brethren, and i'm sick of being prevented from fighting back. i'd do it for free if i was allowed to."

"how time flies - it's term 4 of the csm and i've decided to run again. for those of you that don't know me, i was vice chairman of the 1st csm. my main platform at that time is what it remains today: i offer the eve community mycapabilities: at assessing and refining issues raised by players and fellow council members. in particular bringing an independent, balanced view to all issues.credibility: ability to deliver on plans. during csm 1, i was elected as vice chairman. i have a long proven experience of big changes to the game, from eve strategic maps, running alliances, corporations and launching the first public ipos to the economy.credibility: qualified playerplaying eve since 2003 with 5 accounts has given me a deep knowledge of almost all game mechanics. this enables me to predict side-effects (or benefits) of proposed issues. this includes eg. pvp (solo/gang/fleet/blob), pve, mission running, manufacturing from moon/roid/npc to finished ships and modules (t1/t2/t3), pos, 0.0 infrastructure (outposts, corp, alliance, pirating, being suicide ganked, wars, faction warfare, npcing, mission runnning and research. i do have a gap in my experience in invention and wormhole life, but know enough players who do both these activities to gather balanced views.capability: qualified professionalwith 20 years of professional experience in it and internet at a senior/strategic level and relevant experience to csm in the areas of leading/participating in committees, teams and working groups, mentoring and training managers and consulting on internet strategy, process management and change management.during my working time, i created eve strategic maps which is used by ccp employees themselves! i've also appeared in documentaries to advocate eve online to current non-players (another perfect world). for the last 3 months i've been doing private study on game design, and am working on private business venture for a new mmo. i was at the game developers conference europe to get the low-down on the dust514 launch.belief in eve playersi have a strong belief that players have the capabilities, ideas and ingenuity to make changes in how we experience the game through emergent play, without sweeping changes from ccp.eg. dominion: while thankfully (hopefully) solving the pos boredom, was not necessary to break the alliance stagnation in 0.0 space; it is possible for players to achieve this through self organisation.what we players do need from ccp is support for game mechanic and particularly social networking tools to enhance the player abilities. eg. eve banks, ipos, alliance organisation tools, spacebook, api key access and of course the individual balance issues, which have been highlighted by players from csm1 to csm3. this will become increasingly important as dust514 is integrated to new eden in 2010.vote or do you want to know more?vote serenity steele (or) post a questions here. you're also welcome to evemail or convo me in-game."
"linkage to my csm 1 campaign, resulting in vice chairman. in addition to the joint outcome of establishing a base for the csm and passing many csm features you see in the game today, from a process and efficiency perspective i also defined the issue submission templates that are still is use in csm3."

"hawt. supporting this."
"black ops do need alot of love before they will be used in any great numbers. i personaly think they should be based on more dps as they are more like hit and run ships, sneaking up on someone then hitting them round the back of the head with a hammer comes to mind. but but at the moment they cant do hit and run because they can only fit a normal cloak instead of a covert ops,they are stuck waiting at gates instead. also i wouldnt mind them being given a role bonus od 99% reduction in fitting needs of warfare links for a second role of fc ship for a covert fleet."
"i support any bo boost. the pre-nerf needs to be removed, the range is meh but ok. it's a battleship, not a cap. leave it skill intensive, that will prevent mass proliferation.they're not going to be solopwnmobiles, but will be useful. any solo bo will remain a juicy target.300-350mil is a good target cost. do this then un-nerf it. at least the sin and panther."
"i was honestly shocked when i looked at there combat capabilities... i do not fly one, but the fact that they have ess powergrid for fitting, less hp, makes them made of paper, and less guns, means they cannot even stand up to regular dirt cheap battleship in combat, and they cost about a bill. give em proper stats please!!"

"after doing some research i couldn't find any similar proposal. if it does exist, please provide a link to it as i'm curious about why it's this way.i think that we should be able to see outside a station before we undock. it makes no sense at all that capsuleers flying around in ships and cargo worth fortunes have to venture out in space where no law enforcement is present without even having the option to look through the station's window or give the control tower a call to see if there aren't any pirates camping.if the game already allows protection for player jumping through gates by cloaking them after jumping, what is the logic behind leaving them vulnerable at stations?this could be implemented by having players coming out of stations cloaked as if coming out of a gate or having the option of docking back in before they are vulnerable. maybe there could be a radius around the station where aggression isn't allowed, the station would assume concord's role in a way. i'm way to novice of a player to suggest really educated ways of implementing a change in the game but as it is right now, it feels like eve is telling me i shouldn't be able to see or know what the weather is like before i step out of my house. that's obviously ridiculous.in any case, i'd be really interested in knowing the rationale behind that mechanic of the game."

"i suggest learning skills be remove and just add the points to everyone's totals. honestly it doesn't do much but act as a hassle and a turn-off for new players. they have to train skills for a month to reasonably be able to train more skills, serves no purpose.it would also cost the community nothing, if you have 30 milliion sp's you'll have a 31.5 million sp advantage on them by the time they train the skills up. no difference really and we get them into the game a month earlier. with a steep learning curve and a lot of training ahead of them this will make the game a little more accessible from the start and make it more likely for them to stick around.note: (before i get flamed) i have two accounts, both are a couple years old and both have learning skills trained already."
"so you want to give people a sp boost when they start, but the make training in the rest of gametime much slower? *thumbs down*"
"as i cant find the thread atm. learning skills are good as is. if you want the faster training time. you train them a little or fully. if you dont. you can still achieve your goals just a bit slower.what should be banned from the game is \"you have to train learning skills to this level before you can do anything else.\" this is just plain wrong and stupid. and *that* discourages new players. i tell all my friends, who start with eve: start a bit with the learnings and put skills in that get you new things to try. so they get a new module or better module every few days and inbetween their learning skills go up.not supported (obviously)"

"dead horse, meet stick. *thwack thwack thwack*the hassle and turn off to new players isn't learning skills, it's the crappy advice people give them surrounding the learning skills.new player: \"hi i just started! what should i do first?\"old player: \"zomg train yur learningz to over 9000 immediately!!!?!!ione!!\"new player: \"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz\" /quitfrankly, learning skills need to be discussed, in detail, in the npe, along with a tutorial on how to properly train them. there's no need for a new toon to train all the learning skills to 5/4 or 4/3 before they set foot in a ship(unless it's an alt, and then you should be smart enough to figure out what you need).my recommendation: train the basics to 3, then start working on the skills you want for the game. get the ability to fly a frigate fairly well, or to mine, to be research, or whatever, before you even think of coming back to them.getting all five base skills to a 3 will take about as long as it takes to complete the new player experience and the first epic arc, assuming you also train the freebie skills they give you to level 1 when they hand them out. at that point you have a decent smattering of base skills, as well as a good head start on your learning skills, and you're not even half way through your bonus period.people aren't quitting eve because of learning skills. people are quitting eve because of the bad advice given tot hem by other players about learning skills."
"i guess the question i would have is: what purpose do they serve?none that i can see, but whatever."
"i've said this before, and i'll say it again:eve has enough players that ccp doesn't need to act in desperation to coddle newbies so that more will stick around.learning skills are fine. move along."
"don't train them if you don't see a purpose. nobody is forcing you."
"your ghey, if you dont want them, dont buy and train them.they serve a purpose, if a player wants to progress further he can put some time aside to train them up a level every so often."
"wow...the nerd rage on these forums is pathetic. get a life folks, log off your computers every once in a while and you might not be so angry at the world.just sad"
"op is right, rest of you are wrong. nuff said."
"looks more like op can't take criticism...making a game too conveniant just kills the motivation. i've already seen that on another mmo and don't want to see that mistake again.disagree."
"precisely."
"coming from the person who keeps coming back to his alredi dieing post of bullsh!t.i only log off my computer when your mum is puttin some out, which dont happen often coz shes probably dead...im harsh, live with it"
"that's right, let it all out. you'll feel better it's ok to cry"
"ok **** it, its not working lol"
"effort vs reward.do you prefer instant gratification or spending time (effort) to train learning skills first.both ways are good, it is all about giving people choices."
"i'm against this idea. i'm a new player and learning skills don't discourage me from playing the game. i think it gives an advantage to people who are wise enough to invest in those skills, delaying immediate gratification for an improved gain in the future. just like it is in real life actually.funnily enough, studies have found that kids of kinder garden age who have been able to wait before eating a candy in exchange for getting more candy later have much less chance of holding criminal records 20+ years later. stupid people (yeah, i'm saying criminals are stupid, or those who got caught and have a record, anyway!) can't control their urges.if anything, i'd suggest that learning skills give more bonuses so that the effect for the long term player is even greater."
"no, not now, not ever, they are not mandatory, just some idiots think they should be trained right off the bat, which is wrong.they should be trained at a time suited to the individual."
"the use of the term \"lubricant\" is... worse than bad. why not just call it fuel?the general idea though, is fairly well thought out, actually providing a rationale is rare on these forums."
"as part of a bigger overhaul, this sounds like a good plan."
"more drone pilots wanting things to be done for them, and have everything automated.why can't i tell my torpedoes to automatically fire at the nearest battleship, and why won't my smartbomb automatically go off when drones are attacking me? how come i can't afk jump through nullsec knowing that my invuln fields will come on automatically, my ship will warp to a safespot that it generated itself, and it will cloak up whenever the local count goes up by more than 2 in 10 seconds?seriously... i hate having drone ships in my fleet because they always refuse to control the drones manually. granted, part of the fault goes to ccp for having a horrible drone control interface, but that's what needs to be fixed. don't add even more automation to the drones... just make it less of a pain in the ass to control them."
"a little zen to start my reply:one of the biggest parts of battle/combat is the chaos that follows. remove the chaos and you are left with administrative work. a better and more logical solution would be to have the drones aggression lists sort by size. ex: a light drone targets an aggressed frigate first even if a bs is above it on the list."
"drones do miss.missiles get massive damage reduction on moving targets.try again."
"pft typical, ad hominems right off the bat. even if it's not the offical wiki (i admit my mistake, heh), it still doesn't erase the fact that the only advantages of minmatar ships acknowledged officially are 'speed' and 'versatility'. speed of course has been nerfed a lot of times in past revisions. not to mention what use is having a level v mwd skill on a battleship? or a nagglfar? other races' advantages continue on regardless of shipsize. ours end at battlecruiser level.anything above battlecruisers for minmatar sucks, and anything below are mediocre or outclassed by other ships in other races (except perhaps vagas and the aforementioned cane which performs about as well as drakes and harbingers for shield tanking). sure, the phoon can be awesome... if you're 5 years old and have a gazillion sp. compare this with the range of ship choices in other races most often used effectively in pvp.versatility is just one way of saying, you have to train for shield and armor and never come close to how effectively the other races' tank. the skill requirement to even come close to achieving what can be achieved in a few months in other races' ships is mindboggling. sure we're 'versatile'. might as well say, we have to train everything under the sun if we want to be good pilots. or be content being a miner or a solo pirate. not to mention despite the claim of 'versatility', ship bonuses only affect one type of weapon while still forcing the fitting of the obligatory missile launchers.i do not mine at all. i supplement my pvp forays with missionrunning. so the comment on failfitting a cane is uncalled for.drones miss, yeah, but they're capless, ammoless, independent. only instances they miss is if you release fighters/heavies on an interceptor.missiles get massive reductions on moving targets, yeah, but they always hit (when in range that is, and majority of pvp situations, you're always in range), not to mention, the moving targets thing only applies again for smaller ships since battleships and such are pretty much sitting ducks. and add a tackler into the fray (which is pretty much standard in fleet ops) and that advantage is taken away. modules meant to stop speed are far more abundantly used than modules meant to counter drones or missiles or punch through armor/shield.both also do not have the very very narrow falloff range of projectile guns. (fit ac's and if your enemy gets too far, they're useless; fit arties and if your enemy gets too close or move too fast, they're useless).and yes this is a raaaaaaaaaaageee!!!! post lol. i guess i just got very frustrated yesterday trying to come up with maelstrom fit that even comes close to tanking 1000dps and still deal decent dps. at all level v in eft, one of the fits got at around 20 omni. another averaged at 300 omni. and i looked over at my 3 month old corpmates' myrm with a 1300dps tank and went a little crazy.how much longer do i have to train to get that? or is the answer actually 'never' (unless i buy expensive deadspace stuff)?if you did it. pics or it never happened.i found an old thread from back in february detailing this more:"
"your whole damn post is an ad-hominem.i'll gladly take any minmatar ships off your hands being a minmatar pilot myself.obvious troll post op is... 3/10"
"having fought primarily matari hulls using only amarr ditto the past year and a half i can say, with great conviction, that you are wrong.rifter, thrasher, rupture, claw are downright unbalanced and a grid reduction is needed to bring them in line.only ships in game able to fit oversized buffers while being able to fit correct sized guns + tackle/drive-mod.stabber, hurricane, cyclone, rapier, vagabond .. hell all sub-bs ships are top of the pile (odd one is being muninn) compared to other races.matari's only \"bad\" ship size are bs, and even there they have the mighty typhoon plus with changes coming the whole line-up receive a massive boost so very much an unwarranted complaint."
"cool story bro"
"i started to train for minmatar ships from originally being focused at flying gallente / caldari ships. well i still fly those too but the secret behind my way of playing is simply being able to adapt what i want to field depending on what has been asked for.the different races surely has specific advantages, even down to a single ship area. there used to be a time when vagabonds were extremely great for speed and damage all together but as mentioned previously in the thread vagabonds has suffered greatly amist other ships from speed reduction. they simply lost their cutting edge and instead of making a somekind of balance to the field, ccp decided to do it the easy way yet again. pure nerf...however i must say that minmatar ships can dish out some nice dps volley, i fly hurricanes and munins on regular basis and they are wicked when it comes to alpha strike. so i can't agree on a 100 percent basis that minmatar is suffering to much and as far as i've learned there will be a boost on the minmatar damage output area.if i am mistaken i apologize but there has been a post about changes on this issue.on a overall basis i must say that active tanking ingame is ****.it's not even close to what a decently setup fleet of hp buffed ships with logistics support can do on the field.also note that ccp has made several nerfs that has inflicted greatly on the solo pvp scene. positive effects of this is forcing players to act on a group based idea instead of flying about on their own.the downside is that alot of the unique advantages alot of the shipshave had is gone and tends to make the game alot more dull and less difference in how ships stick out compared to one another.this is however not an entirely 100 percent accurate comment but still it has some coverage to what has happened in eve.it also worth mentioning that the result of each major nerf has only resulted in players finding new means of what ships and formations tactics is the \"i win\" tactic in combat, this is a pretty natural development, but its unfortunately that the common result has been that it ends up with ccp nerfing because something sticks out and is actually effective and puts a challenge to the game for others to break. i hope for more balancing terms of problem solving in the future instead of simply making ships \"more crappy\" because they have a good advantage in certain situations.it's simply a situation of improving or the other way around."
"you don't have to rent an office to get things out of impound. it's been a while since i've had to deal with this, but i know that you can simply pay an \"impound fee\" without renting an office. it's usually significantly less than the value of whatever has been impounded. you're essentially buying their assets and a very reduced price. an option to just trash it would be nice though. if i remember correctly, a director or ceo will have to fly to the location where the assets are held, and attempt to open the \"corp hangar.\" you'll be told that the corp doesn't currently have an office there, or something, and you'll be given the option to pay the impound fee to retrieve the items. like i said, it's been a while, but i know you can get the items without paying a rental fee."
"i believe impound fees are based upon the office rental fee, which makes it extremely high in places. plus, the requirement for a director or ceo's physical presence is annoying. perhaps the change to allow the corp the option to transfer these items to either the trash or to deliveries would work. just somewhere where the items can be disposed of or moved easier."
"see limting napfestssadly it seems people dont want to discuss possible changes to the corp/alliance standings methods."
"trolls, they never learn.also, sort by corp ticker"
"i cant see ccp ever beeing able to put in the hardware to deal with big fleet fights so im just trying to suggest something."
"unfortunately what you're suggestion won't handle the problem. people are far more adaptable than you seem to be giving them credit for, and they will find a way to do exactly what they want to do, regardless of the system limitations ccp puts in their way.this is especially true where it concerns standings and the like. heck i could put together a webapplicaiton that you could run through the igb that would let you type in a pilot's or corp's name/ticker and it would give you back a shoot/don't shoot - it would probably take about a day to write it. at that point, it's the same thing - an in game method of seeing who you can and can't shoot. *shrugs*"
"current:battlecruiser skill bonus: 10% increase to drone hitpoints and damage dealt by drones, and 7.5% increase to armor repair amount per level99% reduction in the cpu need of warfare link modules. change to: battlecruiser skill bonus: 10% increase to drone hitpoints and damage dealt by drones, and 7.5% increase to armor repair amount per level99% reduction in the fitting need of drone control unit modules. someone with advanced drone interfacing 5. which is all of 3 people in all of eve. because the use of drone control units right now is just a terrible idea.this change would make myrm lose 5 highslots to the drone control units. so less guns... but you get to control 10 drones @ 75mbit. 5mediums 5 lights."
"this is an incredibly insightful proposition that is sure to at last fix the myrm"
"no i would suport this if it was about givin back the myrms 125 m/b band width as well as the dcus but with just the dcu bonus and 75m/3 bandwidth u dont hav enough drones 2 fieldnot suported"
"perhaps this would make up for when it lost it's 5 heavies finally."
"my dislike for a lot of the politics of 0.0 aside, you don't have addressed the points i raised about the effect of reducing the mineral need in any meaningful way.almost no one will ever mine veldspater in 0.0 unless they get the same return that they will get mining bistot. but if that was implemented in some way miners will protest about the low value of bistot, not be happy about the high value of veldspater. the only half feasible way to do that would be the 500% yield veldspater that someone suggest. increasing 0.0 asteroid yield by a reasonable percentage could help miners and indirectly help industrialists as more high ends will be available but it will not remove the need to import tritanium if all the asteroids are boosted the same way.reducing mineral requirement for items production in 0.0 will fatten the industrialist wallets but will not help 0.0 miners, probably it will damage them.almost certainly it will not increase the number of ship produced in a significant way unless the number of pilots increase. you can use only 1 ship at a time and there is a limit to the number of ships most people will want to keep in reserve. to asuri:i disagree with most of your suggestions.- moderate increase in mineral yield is acceptable (for me), even if i think that ccp approach with access to more hidden sites with better ore if you install the upgrades is a better way;- getting more than 100% minerals from refining? no. as a corollary, allowing 100% refining/reprocessing in pos and stations with normal level of skills, yes.- reduced mineral cost to produce ships in 0.0? no.reduced production time could be a good option. - invention bonus? i don't like it but can't decide if it a bad idea or not. i think it would squash empire invention with plenty of people researching in 0.0 and then moving the bpc in high sec to produce. probably instead of making life in alliance space easier it will make wormhole invention the way to go, with hundreds of (almost invulnerable) research pos in low level wormhole systems. - missions changes? another uncertain idea. i don't like much your suggestions.if ccp get over the problems of putting agents in conquerable stations or in space (they already have them but apparently there is a problem with allowing them to give a range of missions. today they have only one specific mission and scripted follow up) an upgrade adding agents to 0.0 space with missions better tailored for 0.0 would be good.note that ccp is implementing pirate storylines with missions tailored for interceptors, af and hac with level 4 or more rewards. but storylines have a limited usage as after completing one you have a several months cool down period. so those mission can help but aren't the \"solution\"."
"i think this deserves a bump."
"this doesn't need fixing. there's enough agents who send you to on-corp storylines that anyone can do it that way if they want to."
"i would like to tie issue 2 to tactical overlay for 2 reasons:1 currently it is not of much use anyways, so improving the feature should be alright2) as i imagine it, the sole purpose of tactical overlay is display of tactical information like who is warp scramming&jamming what, and that's not what is currently happening. so when i click \"tactical overlay\" all the remote effects and e-war should be highlighted adn displayed using hud."
"i'm gonna say signed, but only as a one time thing, that should balance it."
"not signed ... thats why ccp gives you 2 alts"
"i support this just to give players who created silly names another chance and so i don't see as many of those names floating around space. i think limiting its usage or, if you like, charging for its usage would counter most ill effects."
"not supported, my name is annoying as people read it as **** you twenty two but you just deal with it.want a new name? do what others have suggested and sell ur character and buy a new one via the char bazaar forum.case closed imo"

"i believe that ccp has said that this was something that they're going to do for ships in the same station as you, but that it was impractical for ships in other stations. not perfect, but it's a start."
"i like this idea a lot."
"yup. they don't offer enough reward for the immense risk that's involved with doing them (death from boredom)."
"as a level 4 mission runner, this idea is laughable.not supported."
"sorry having done level 4's i think the risk versus reward is about on par with what it should be. doing them with pretty much no threat to me and my afk dominix, i can earn close to 70 to 75% as much as i do killing rats in 0.0 with loads higher risk to myself. seems about on par for solo money earning to me."

"+1 for more votes"
"vote sok... once you've gone bald you'll never go back!"
"the problem with mining is the boredom, not the profit. mining isn't great money in highsec(and it's total garbage in lowsec, which i think does need to be fixed), but it's quite nice in 0.0, for example. mineral prices are really low right now, but i think that's a temporary state of affairs. if they come back up, which i expect will probably happen, the incomes are reasonable for a low-intensity activity like mining. i'd prefer to eliminate boredom, not pay players to bore themselves even more. most 0.0 players already need to pve sometimes as it is. the thing is, right now their best bet is to do it with an alt/jc in highsec, because 0.0 income is actually kind of weak(and certainly way more annoying than highsec missions). i'd like to see 0.0 cater to the risk-tolerant, not just the risk-lovers. 0.0 will never be a \"carebear wonderland\", nor should it be, but it should offer a nice big incentive to bring people out, not just the promise of getting bubbled, popped, and podded every once in a while to spice up your day. the natural way of relieving pressure on npc lines is to set up your own, at a pos. the problem with that right now is, as much as anything, that pos mechanics are terrible. if they were fixed such that you could sell lines publicly, for example, the lack of npc lines would be nearly irrelevant. the problem isn't the lack of lines, it's the lack of ability for players to create their own for sale. i don't own any t2 bpos. in fact, i'm an inventor myself - if you look on jita's market right now, the stack of 26 broadswords for sale is mine. the reason it doesn't need to become more profitable is that it's already plenty profitable for most items. there's a lot of work/skill/money/excel involved, but if you have the ability to do it right, the rewards are substantial. it's not in any need of a buff. just about every candidate has rl responsibilities, as well as usually some big in-game ones. that doesn't prevent them from doing the job. csm is a big responsibility, but it's not a huge time sink in the grand scheme of things - i'm not running for parliament here. i'll have to keep up with the forums and talk to players, but i do that right now anyways, and that's most of the time needed. i can spare a few hours every sunday for a meeting - i spent the same amount of time this summer playing baseball, and it hardly ruined my life."
"i've known herschel since before i was a csm candidate, let alone a delegate. while we do tend to butt heads on some issues, he doesn't endorse or reject anything without thoroughly thinking it through. he is also very active in the forums and interested in making this game better for everybody.i must admit that i did not vote for him because another candidate fit some of the issues better in the voter match and has a platform that appeals to me, but this should not be interpreted as thinking herschel will do a bad job or anything of the sort. of all the candidates running, i think he is the most devoted to boosting this game."
"a fair point, but what do you suggest?as with the current changes, there is hardly such incentive. what do you think should be done about it? imo the moons were what drove 0.0 at the strategic level, made it tick. that's mostly gone now...sounds like a great solution that ccp will never implement, as they are afraid to touch anything related to pos and acl code...let's see we are on the same page here: setting the owners of t2 bpo aside for a second, there is no reason to keep them, it would be better for everyone else to get rid of them. sure, invention took its place and people will start talking about volumes etc., but there still are some low volume markets dominated by t2 bpo holders where they do cope with the demand. other legacy isk faucets are also being touched, why not t2 bpos? so the question remains how to reduce the pain to the holders. i'd say turn the bpos into bpcs with 1-2 years worth of runs, that's nearly the value of what they are being traded for...i'm pretty sure you'll make it to csm, and i wish you good luck there!"
"the moon rebalance was overdue for several reasons, some of which you mentioned, but together with dominion there are some pretty negative sideeffects. also, your answer shows that you never really lived in 0.0, like you said yourself.like many pointed out in the comment thread from the devblog on the 0.0 system upgrades, the problem is not so much the nerfing of moons, or the necessity to downsize the space held and player numbers. the problem is that it changes how life is lived in 0.0, changes the goals for leadership to something much less dynamic and interesting, as well as for the average 0.0 grunt. yes, there are lots of complaints about the income possibilities of the alliance being greatly nerfed, while income possibilities at the personal level being increased a little (but still not on par with empire - most upgrades are a joke), but that is not my beef, most 0.0 dwellers have an empire mission alt anyway to be able to sustain them being in 0.0.what was good about the moongold is that you could do pvp to ensure your alliances income. now you have to do pve to accomplish the same. i think that sums up what the problem is with the changes. the large scale conflicts and strategic fleet fights die with dominion. there won't really be fights for space, there will be so many unclaimed systems. so we'll have only the fun-gangs roaming around. that is, if everyone is not set blue...when you say the increased amount of ratters will mean more targets for pvp'ers, that's almost a troll and not fun for either side.now onto a different subject, like larkonis i also think it seems ankh is still pulling the strings. i'd like to know on which subjects you and ankh disagree, if there is any."
"this guy knows what hes talking about.he's got my vote.viva la zod"
"it was long overdue and will open up lots of opportunities to others, off course as it may please a lot of people who don't have access to those high grade moons it has the opposite effect as you mentioned on those that do have them. much less demands via the global components required to build t2 ships essentially anything below jump freighters on a global scale across all empire races.as i have seen from all the different patches on sisi which i have spent time on in the last 2 months. i did a lot of number crunching, comparing bpo's material requirements and the time to build for some new highly increased components which has changed on bpo's between different builds as we are getting closer to dominion's release. we can also see the mass market panic with many moon related products spiking up in anticipation as well with every build on sisi which have so far been slowly introduced to avoid mass market speculations on global needed products on tranquility.i have some friends in a few major alliances that have essentially told me the same thing regarding those costs as being prohibitive even so just for basic sovereignty. it is meant for massive changes and may also force people out with its prohibitive costs, and still be very hard for smaller groups to maintain sustainability for sovereignty. hopefully, those costs will get rebalanced to phase the major changes so they are not so hard for current residents and over a longer time.ankh and erik are both helping me in the campaign as we all have in the previous elections. we have a lot of different experience on different areas of the game, we have different views on the same things that we commonly know but seeing them from different point of views enables us to come out with more constructive ideas when working as a team."
"why are all take care candidates always proxies for ankh that have no real experience with pvp centric aspects of this game?"
"maybe because there is more to pvp that pew-pewing starships in space?z0d seems to realize this, maybe that is why it is with ease he gathers support."
"calling z0d a proxie for ankh really shows you're clueless about the guy. if you are into silly conspiracies, it is more likely that ankh and erik have been a proxy of z0d all along, that would make much more sense.even though i've been with major 0.0 alliances and fw, i've still voted for z0d. there is always an overabundance of 1337 pvpers on the council, i rather have someone there that sees the big picture instead of only their tiny niche playstyle."
"awesome guy, perfect for the jobhe actually denied running pres for out country last year"
"just on general principle, i'm not voting for anyone named \"elvenlord.\" that is ridiculous.no i did not read the candidate blurb nor will i."
"i just wanted to say that i've already voted for teadaze based on the planet risk interview. i think your platform and comments were spot on and represent my own position regarding the direction of the csm. best of luck to you and all the candidates. lastly, i'm looking forward to the fc seminar on saturday."
"vote for teadaze - because he cares, he is intelligent and he is not in anyones pockets.tea, you got my vote"
"it would indeed be a good idea to get the information hosted somewhere where you don't need registration. facebook and other such sites wax and wane with the times, and the competitors are too numerous to assume that everyone in the world has an account on it. public information like this should be, well, public."
"smae here, i ran into the wall of facebook registration, so your information is.not.public. please change the op to include this info or link to a real public page"
"this is a useful tool for some candidates but not all. i would like to use it but it doesn't cover alot of issues that i am promoting and it will not correctly refect my views.-t"
"i view it as kinda sad that only 49 accounts out of 300k are willing and eligible to run for csm..."
"if you take the time to go through the list and click the links of the candidates (as i have done), you'll discover there are not 49 web sites to look at. most of the links go nowhere or nowhere that provides csm-related info about the candidate. a quick hover with the pointer over the links will reveal this. i discussed the signal to noise ratio in my blog when the candidates list was announced. after eliminating the obvious jokers followed by the ones with uninformative campaign statements and no useful web link, there are maybe a dozen candidates i would characterize as serious and worth considering."
"the main effect that we've seen over the last few years is that it's not so much a matter of people reviewing the candidates, as the candidates campaigning to the voters, not in the forums, but actively via alliances, corporations, pod-casts and being known for previous activities and accomplishments in the game eg. look at the past people; running universities, leading communities, making fansites, blogging, making media videos. this isn't a lot of activity.that said, if 10%-20% of the player base read the forums, then they're probably not reading this section. that would amount to 30k - 60k votes, which typically aren't seen."

"the formation of the sandbox preservation party is seen by some a ray of light in a dimming universe, while others view it as an extremist organization, if not utter bs.and thats cool.but what they fail to realize is that there are players and csm candidates out there looking to do away with what is viewed as criminal practices in eve.case in point:in the latest episode of planet risk, the hosts interviewed several csm candidates, one of which was stormaxe titanothere.51:48 into the show, quivering palm poses the question:we have seen a lot of suggestions being posted in the assembly hall. has there been a single suggestion that made you think to yourself, boy, if i were elected to the council, thats the first thing that im going to push', and if so, which one [suggestion] is that, and why?56:00 stormaxe responds:one of the things that i know that i really would like to see, kind of at the top of my list, is salvaging thieves.he then goes on to talk about how he thinks that salvaging in its current implementation is really just a relic of a mechanic from several years ago, should be considered akin to can flipping, and thus salvagers gain aggro from salvaging mission wrecks.the sandbox preservation party supports salvaging in its current implementation, meaning the salvage found in a wreck belongs to the first person that gets to it, for the simple fact that it is more conducive to an open-ended universe. we do not support mission runners having ownership of the salvage.personally, i pray to be shot at when i am salvaging a mission (as i loot every single mission that i scan down). that's my playstyle though, and not all ninjas will loot. i just like to kill mission runners. some ninjas will only collect salvage from the wrecks - again, salvage that has no legal owner until it is in your cargo hold.the fact of the matter is that given the opportunity, 95% of mission runners will not shoot at a ninja salvager, even if they do have aggro rights. they simply wont do it. i wouldn't expect them to start shooting if the salvage ownership mechanics were changed.anyway, yes. csm candidates are working to change the mechanics of salvaging. stormaxe is not alone in his thinking however, hes just one of many that think the same way. all you have to do is browse the eve o forums a bit to find an instance where someone is working to take away your options in the sandbox.save the sandbox. power to the players. logit probit for csm4."
"it is important to remember that the only functions that alliance mechanic provides are:- easy management of standings - consolidated war-decsand later- the ability claim sovereignty- access to jump bridgesprior to the implementation of the alliance mechanic, there were many functional alliances within eve. stain alliance & bob to name a few. almost all alliances went further to create holding corps to manage alliance finances as there is no supported game mechanic for alliance wallet.take all this together with the introduction of treaties soon(tm), and we have a mechanic for dealing with this, without allowing alliances into fw; setup an alliance holding corporation which *is* the alliance, provide treaties to all the fw corporations and manual management of inter-fw corp standings.looking at this whole description, it's a work-around, so the question becomes; what could be done to make it easy?eg. by providing a supporting feature \"mirror standings of corporation x\" (ie the holding corporation) you would have alliances in fw.if a lot of alliances are structured in this way, it would show it's important to eve players, and therefor get support for game mechanics to make it easier. so; 2 options - the csm (as i would) can support mechanic solutions now *and* there is a way to achieve it today to show support from a player perspective."

"good points. please see my response below:(1) clear communication.every csm since csm1 has asked for ccp to address this issue. there are several distinct areas that imo need to be made clearer and particularly faster:day to day working- publishing of minutes- clear list of issues (tagged, categorized, indexed and searchable)- voting history of council members on issuesmulti-csm continuity- final prioritization agreed with ccp for agile backlog- working methods used (eg. the submission template i created in csm1)- candidate scores, participation and (if relevant) previous issue voting historyccp has historically been unable to provide the tools with the reason being given that the web site does not support it. in reality it is most likely needed for the csm themselves to organise a tool and present the data. this is what i hoped the www.eve-csm.com website would be used for. it is probably the case that i just need to do it myself, and if elected to csm will put in the time to do this. hell if not elected, i'm tempted to do it anyway for the benefit of the community.(2) bountiesbounty hunting as a profession (in fact the whole bounty system) is indeed a flawed game mechanic. it has long been the case that any serious bounty placed on a character is simply recovered by one of the players alts or friends. furthermore, the tools available for bounty hunting vs. the rewards are fairly limited. (yes you can use mission agents to find the intended target, but it requires co-operation of many people/accounts to score the hit). this is particularly a profession i would like to get 'more love' as it also provides a market-driven solution for industrialists who are on the receiving end of piracy or aggression generally, but don't have the social network to motivate punitive measures. market based systems imo are a great solution to these kind of issues.(3)storyline.i'm not sure if you are aware that in (2008?) there was a massive amount of work done on the storyline arcs, which was leaked by a volunteer, and the whole 1-1.5years work had to be thrown away to stop the potential \"insider trader\" effect. ccp have been working hard to restore a storyline arcs, but iirc aren't there yet. what i would personally prefer to see is more player development of story-lines/arcs, with the support of ccp. for example, in the early days of eve it was fairly typical to see a gm played character performing in live \"mission\" events for players, based on real-time events of player alliances within the game. there are many opportunities to develop this in line with faction warfare, and i support these developments. personally i don't read the chronicles as i'm more interested in the social networks and developments of the players. what we need here is more tools (ambulation/wis promised layer scripting of npcs in stations with missions, which sis something i would like to see soon!)."

(appologies if i've overcomplicated this)a very small distinction, but nevertheless one that i hope might be brought to the attention of the dev team while they are engaged in implementing this feature."

"i'm of the opinion that everyone should start with all basic learning skills at lvl 4 (the skill \"learning\" excluded)."
"most new characters are forced to train learning skills to level 4 (tier 1 and 2) which eats up 950,000 sp before they train anything else. soon after this the 2x training bonus ends making it seem like they train at the same speed (as 2x with no learning skills) and the 950m sp they just worked for made no difference.huge turn off for newer people, i've tried to get some friends to play but they don't want to spend their entire trial getting learning skills to 4 and sitting in an ibis.i'd like it if they started at 4, all of them, getting to 5 is optional completely. i'd finally be able to persuade some of my friends to play.and for you ****s who think ccp doesn't need the extra players, they may not but we players sure as hell do. new players are rare now as most of them are really just alts. and i'm pretty sure they do as every patch they improve the newbie tutorials and interface explanations.this is not a cry post, all my learning skills are trained. although i would like to redistribute a million sp to another skill category."
"first of all the entire point of drones is an automated weapon system that requires minimal pilot interface. secondly this is primarily for missioners who are busy with their main weapons and dont have time to babysit the drones so they dont accidently trigger the next 10 spawns on you while your still working on the first 5 battleships."
"aye, i am in favor of making it so the items do not end up in impound.instead are dropped into the deliveries hanger."
"i would like to propose to introduce some mechanics to allow sp redistribution. we can draw parallel between attributes remapping and sp redistribution. remapping was introduced in response to the fact that when players created their pilots they were not fully aware of implications for skill training. when they gained more in depth knowledge of game mechanics they realized that choice of attributes was by far not ideal for their goals, however they could not change it. by the same token new players would often be very confused by attributes composition and may be discouraged from continuing playing the game because of that choice. hence attribute remapping is a very handy tool allowing players to be more flexible. there is a similar situation with skills. veteran players have an assortment of skills which they on the second thought would not have trained at all, however at the dawn of eve due to lack of information they were a necessesity. for example at the begining players had to train certain industrial skills, just to be able to earn money. even though at the moment the players is pursuing a pvp career he still retains those industrialist skills from the past and vica-versa. in addition certain skills are becoming obsolete due to changes in game mechanics. imagine you were a pure amarr combat pilot and only trained cruise missiles specialization for the purposes of stealth bomber. now that sbs utilize torpedoes cruise missiles are useless. in that way ccp should introduce some mechanics to compensate for those changes. i suggest that restrictions on such redistribution should be quite severe. example of those limitations could be the following:- only allow redistribution once per specific time period (same as attribute remapping)- only allow redistribution of specific percentage of total sp, for example 5-10%- penalize amount of redistributed sp at some rate, for example if a pilot \"unlearned\" 1m of sp, then only allow 50% (500k) of sp to be injected into another skill- only allow sp to be redistributed within parent category, in other words skill points from spaceship command could not be redistributed to engineeringin order to make that game mechanics trully useful and prevent abuse such as complete shifts from industrial to pvp specs for instance (this is not wow after all), the extent of those limitations should mirror the extent of changes introduced to game mechanics, as well as allow for certain error margin within career path. what i mean by \"error margin\" is that players are bound to make some decision with respect to training, which they will subsequently find unwanted. current system penalizes those decision with maximum severity, in a sense that it does not allow any ammendments at all. however if we introduce skill redistribution mechanics, it will allow to take corrective actions with respect to skill sheet. over sufficiently long time horizon veteran players will be able to alter mistakes of the past and convert unwanted sp they learned due to inexperience into something they deem more useful, and younger players will be able to correct there miopic decisions made in the short term. alternativelly, ccp could introduce some mechanics which would allow to change skills with respect to specific ship which they change in the next patch. however i would say this would be too cumbersome vis-a-vis system which will work in generic way (as outlined above) and will allow players to correct their skill sheets at will. again, this by all means should not be a complete wow respec, but rather a very restrictive corrective mechanism."
"this is not wow. this has been discussed to death before. you made the decision to train that skill. eve is about decisions and consequences.not supported."
"this is not bul**** thread, so those ppl who cannot read my last sentence please do yourself a favour dont make yourself look like illiterate monkeys"
"is it that time of the month again already?no! eve is all about making choices, the choices you make will have consequences. even though you may not realize it, the skill you may not want may be useful sometime in the future."
"well, you could argue same way about attribute remapping, in a sense attribute remapping is even much more agrresive change, than what im suggesting. thats not to say that im arguing that since we got attribute remapping we may as well get skill redistribution. every game mechanics modification should be justified on its own. i bring previous experience only to draw an analogy here. i don't think i'm being unreasonable here when i suggest system which is extremelly restricted. one of severe drawbacks i see here is that there are people out there with extremelly focused skill sheet and certainly it makes their chars valuable assets. should that proposal be accepted it will dilute their value. however if it will be implemented with set of severe restrictions which i suggest this dilution will only be marginal and overall \"social benefit\" (as we put it in economics) will outweigh \"marginal cost\" of focussed character value dilution. hence according to cost-benefit analysis this change should be implemented. but again this is all in theory and needs to be discussed. are there any real arguments based on set of reasons, not just that \"it was like this for ages, because thats the game model, so it will stay that way\".in every decision-making process, one should weigh costs vs benefits. if benefits are higher than decisoin should go through. so far i see a lot of benefits in this system, and relativelly small costs. opinions ?"

"why when we can fly around in our internet spaceships do we have to go knock on the door of our agent to see if there's anything he wants us to do?once you've built a bit of standing up with an agent so they know you, why can't you get on the phone and ask him instead of having to go there, buy him a coffee and ask him if there's anything he needs doing.(iirc i think it was coh that had a similar system)i know it would speed up mission turnover and that people will cry about mission farmers but meh, it's supposed to be a futuristic game yet they've not invented the telephone yet.the proposalonce you've run a few missions for the agent (not the corp) then have the ability to call the agent up instead of having to go grovel at his door."
"from my experience with mission running, the agent are quite paranoid and won't tell anybody unless they are in the same room. no communication is safe, not even in eve it would seem. that's the only logical reason i can see behind this mechanic. and i think it makes sense."

"how about \"battlecruiser skills bonus: +10% to drone damage, hitpoints, velocity, tracking and control range\". then gallante will have their sniping bc..."
"although it would be very interesting to see in game, i honestly like myrm the way it is. i cannot say i am against this, i would like to see how it would work out first. so far i can see it being use to **** small ships, but giving it no real advantage against other battle cruisers. if you give it 125mb bandwidth, but take away turet slots it will simply become t1 version of ishtar in battlecuiser -sized hull."
"battlecruiser without link bonus is not a battlecruiser, sorry. you either give up armor rep or drone bonus for it."
"uhh okay in that case i want to fit battleship guns on my harbinger. there is nothing wrong with the myrmidon right now, learn to fit if you're actually having problems, the ship has enough medium slots for heavy e-war and it's got enough low slots for a heavy tank, high slots and drone bay for decent to heavy dps."
"a sign close to your velocity that shows you how hard you're being target painted and webbed and sensor dampened, something like this (noobie mspaint picture ftw). of course it would be more fancy than that.edit->i'm thinking more than just knowing who is using e-war on you, i'm thinking about showing how much it's effecting you. if you were being target painted it would show your signature radius red, with a +30% (or w/e the strength of the painter is) in smaller font next to it, showing you the actual signature of your ship without ctrl+shift+f in mid combat."
"venkul, i seriously think you should stop talking about what 0.0 corps want and would do."
"current paradigm in ship fitting is to cram as many plates as humanly possible onto a ship, slap a remote repairer on and fly around in uber tanked blobs .. it is effective but tedious and buffering becomes downright broken as you go down the size.some ships are able to fit oversized plates, correct size guns, full tackle and drive-mods and with the now ridiculously cheap (thus 'mandatory') rigs and the dps/ehp ratio gets so out of whack in cruiser and down that you need gangs to kill anything - the blob has come to small scale warfare.proposal:- increase fitting cost of all buffer modules (plates/extenders) by 50% across the board. - decrease remote repair modules efficiency by 50%. either double cycle time or halve repair amount.- add a rolebonus to logistics ships doubling rr efficiency (same as now in other words).- double the effectiveness of rigs designed to boost active local tank (ex. t1 aux nano pump gives a 30% increase to repair amount).- tweak cpu on ships to cover difference between plates/extenders and resist mods.what it will do:- very little effect in bs class, instead of a triple plate a double plate + resists can/will be used. - logistics will see a lot more use when bs can no longer reliably fill their role. opens the door to breaking a circle tank before the sun sets.- bs-rr without logistics is still possible if ships mount a local tank to help out. - gives a leg-up to the tank bonus ships, particularly the repair bonused gallente hulls (if they use the tanking rigs that is).- lets sub-bs ships choose between active tanks and buffer tanks, ending the reign of trimarks.- limits ehp of buffered cruiser and down hulls and \"should\" make active tanks more common.- \"could\"/\"should\" reintroduce the active tank solo-bs of old.and yes, i hate buffer tanking with a vengeance (not the ship) and want it dead or hamstrung."
"1. you wont have remotely enough cap for 2 repair systems and guns.2. your local tanking boost wouldnt be remotely enough to replace the repair capabilities of a gang.3. there are so many ways to break rr tanks. ecm. cap warfare. range manipulation. just to name a few.4. also rr is still highly based on player skills and defeat also takes player skills and fcing.not supported."
"nerf neuts.they should only work if you have more cap then the target."
"i kinda like the idea, esp. since i find rr a snoozefest, but i fear that done on it's own, this solution would lead to 2 things.1. even more stupid amounts of cap transferring (read even more unbreakable) guardians to fill the gap created.2. increase in player dissatisfaction with the blob/focus fire.rr and focus fire go hand in hand, the former being the logical response to the latter. without rr bs, guardians will be everywhere and gangs that cannot field them or at least enough of them will find them selves getting even more p****d off at their ships disappearing in seconds.i really want to support this, especially the aspect of bringing personal active tank more to the forefront, but without a parallel solution to focus fire i can't... yet."
"i agree... the entire spiderfest has gotten completely out of hand, but it's hardly the sole issue that has made combat in eve a complete bore.now it's blob or hide. there is nothing in between. that's the true nature of all combat, honestly, be it mice, wolves, or capsuleer pilots so nothing ccp ever does will shift things back to 'smaller gangs' being more effective than a rolling mob of mice.and then there are the complete asshats sitting at stations randomly repping people for lols."
"oki do apologise if this has been said before, i tried searching but failed to find anything.why can we not have 'mobile agents' basically these guys fly around their relevant space, ie serpentis agents in serpentis space etc, and dock at player owned/built stations. they maybe stay at that station for a week before they go off again to another station, this would allow us 0.0 dwellers who dont want to fight our way through 40+ people to get a poxy level 1 agent, it would allow us to earn a few lp's with faction whose space we live in..pretty simple really, no standings would be required the agent would be simply docked up for 7 days and you get do mission for him, normal combat or even varients such as forward scouting for him, say he wants to goto system 4-ep (this is random numbers) you would have to travel say 10 jumps in 0.0 to get to destination where you mission would complete you return and inform him details of the route. missions that require you scan down a complex in the neighbouring systems that have a 'mission' only scan frequency..just a thought to change life in 0.0 from jsut killing rats/mining or pew pew .... any thoughts or comments appreciated and apologies if it has been added before..cheers"
"having lived in 0.0 for many moons now i still get frustrated with the lack of use for a force recon ship. (please hear me out)ok the ship i fly in particular is the arazu, i love the concept of this ship, jump behind the enemy fleet uncloak on their support ship/ships and cause havoc whilst the rest of your fleet ganks the un-support bs's however....... now the however, by the nature of the ships name 'recon' it should be able to do reconascance(sp) but this is near impossible and pratically improbable..if we consider real life scenarioo its like asking the foroward scouts of the army to go behind enemy lines but have no forms of equipment to find where the enemy lies... so what i am asking is why can the recon (in particular force recon) ships not have a bonus to fitting expanded probe launchers, or even better their own version that depending on your level skill in either scanning or recon ships which reduces the amount of cpu the module takes on the ship. (yes same way as covert ops cloaks work).the ship current standard fit is 3 small guns with a cloak, now what is point of the small guns, because this 'usually' means you have to get close to your enemy to hit him, which makes the sensor dampening effect pointless, also if your in a gang/fleet then you are not there for dps, so why not allow us to fit 'recon probe launchers' that allow us to warp in cloak and scan down an enemy in a system whilst also keeping our 'offensive' sensor/warp scrambling abilities.apologies if this is long winded, but i wanted to get my full reasons across..look forward to opening a discussion on forum any issues please shout out in the post."
"instead of giving us one measly launcher and a handfull of snowballs why not temporarily make the launchers and charges cheap market items seeded by npc christmas tree shops. this way players that havent been here for 5 years or more can make a decent snowball drake"
"supporting this. not mainly because of your proposal, but because the share system needs a complete overhaul, as well as requiring a proper stock exchange."
"do your homework. look up where important agents are and what agents of the same level as the missions you are running are. keep track of the number of missions you've done. for your 16th mission, go use an agent that is so close to the desired storyline agent that you are guaranteed to get a storyline from the corp you want.if a certain corp doesn't have important agents, there's a reason for it. you'll just have to deal with it."

"i've proposed a thread on making lowsec ore valuable before - i think a few new ores that don't derive most of their value from nocxium should do the trick nicely. how to make mining interesting without ruining it for the people who like doing it now, i'm not so sure about. it's one of those problems without an easy solution, i think. the one proposal that i've seen and liked is multi-ore asteroids(with crystals going from just increasing raw yield to changing the composition of the yield) - i think it keeps the core of the current system intact, while adding some slight measure of player skill and interaction into it, without ruining semi-afk mining. it's not perfect, but i think it's good. i don't mine a whole lot myself, so i'd check with people who do before i pushed that too hard, but it's the sort of thing i'm thinking about. yeah, that's the biggest reason i'm annoyed at the proposed dominion changes. as for what i'd do, here is my commentary on the proposed changes and here is my (somewhat crazy) list of proposed changes to upgrades. in practice, i don't expect half the stuff i posted could or should happen, but i'd rather maker sure that it's still worthwhile even after all the insanity gets cut out. but basically, give people a nice big incentive to move out, and give alliances the ability to protect those people a little bit, and build infrastructure to support them a lot. yeah, i know. it's frustrating. one of these days they're going to have to bite the bullet and recode poses, but they keep putting it off and piling more cruft on top of the bad code instead. but still, it feels totally wrong to advocate a bad solution just because ccp is reluctant to implement the good one. i'm not convinced that t2 bpos are a bad thing. i'm thoroughly unconvinced that they're such a bad thing that it's worth screwing over everyone who owns one. those low-volume markets you talk about are junk modules - how does it help anyone for the price of junk to go up? also, t2 bpo prices have been going up kind of insanely recently - they seem to routinely sell for 4-5 years profits. considering that it still takes a fairly large amount of work to build off of it, you're going to be telling them that they have to work for years and still only break even. i don't like screwing players over who acted in good faith. i certainly hope you're right, and thanks for the good wishes."
"that's something ccp is not afraid of doing: screwing players over. sure, i'd like to reduce the pain for the owners, but imo the bpos should end, really. it sucks that such a bad game design still causes headache... other isk faucets like moons at least can be conquered, they are not a jackpot. and they are being nerfed.i wouldn't exactly call interceptors junk.speculation is risky...it just requires a hint that the bpos will be nerfed and the market will \"adapt\"."
"you're right, ccp is more willing to screw people over than i am. but still, it's not like the bpo lottery was just \"here, have free billions\", the players did have to work for it. it was poorly designed, and reward far exceeded effort, but i don't think it was so bad that we should just try to wipe it out of the histories and pretend it didn't exist. right, i was thinking more of the modules market. yeah, but why would you? manipulating the market for the sake of it isn't my idea of a good time, and manipulating it in order to lower the amount you compensate people for a game change is just crass."

"you have my votes.impressive well-organised manifesto and i really appreciated the excellent work you did commentating on the recent alliance tournament.best of luck with the elections and perhaps more importantly should you get elected i hope you have an enjoyable term of office."
"teadaze, i really appreciate the efforts you're putting forth in your campaign. i think you have a solid understanding of what your role as a csm delegate will be and will be able to work well with other delegates. besides that, i agree with most of your opinions about how things should be changed. so you got one of my votes. good luck, gooooo teadaze!"
"the one thing that jumped out at me in this thread is where you said:\"for example ccp wants more people in 0.0\"the main reason that 0.0 space is so sparsely populated is that unless you belong to a big corp and bring a battle fleet with you, entering 0.0 is suicide.if you want more people in 0.0, then you need to reduce the chance of people getting killed unncessarily.there are many ways this could be done, but i am certain that the people that control 0.0 space at the moment will not want it, and so it will not get changed.the simple point is this: this situation has come about because of the way the game is, and to change it will upset many, even if it pleases even more. ccp will not risk alienating its top players to try to get more top players.one possible solution would be to create a npc corporation for freelancers. belonging to this corporation could allow you access to 0.0 space to trade and do missions. you could even dock at player owned stations to deliver or collect cargo, or get given player created missions that would increase your standing and the standing of the player corp. it would massively open up the game and the games economy. attempting to attack a freelancer would cause a warning to the attacker that killing this ship would cause loss of standing for not just themselves, but their entire corporation.personally i don't believe anything like this will happen. too many top players like the idea that they can kill anything that moves in their space. bullying the small guy is great fun, for the bully that is. for example, i took a newbie alt into 0.0 space in an ibis. sure enough it was not long before i was caught and destroyed, and then pod killed. why? because ccp lets it happen. can i retaliate or complain - no. i can't even put a bounty on the killing pilot as they are above -1.0 sec status. i am the victim - tough. will i venture into 0.0 with my main character and risk my expensive ship - not a chance!ccp has created this situation, i doubt they have the guts to really try to resolve it. people like myself will take what enjoyment we can in high sec space, then leave for another game. it's as much a loss for eve and other players, but they are not willing to give up anything to stop it happening. either ccp need to make big changes or they need to stop whining about the low population in 0.0 space, it is their own doing after all.all that said, i think it is a good idea to have npc corps represented in the csm, even if it will not achieve anything specific for us.good luck."
"i agree that nearing a not-blue:shoot-it area is hazardous if you aren't blue.but i think the mystique that \"0.0 is suicide if you aren't in force\" comes from the fact that there are some nb:si alliances near the low sec empire gates. since any player wanting to get deeper into 0.0 would have to go through territory between (or go around which probably means more systems to cross).but the not-red:don't-shoot areas are different.as to \"freelance\" npc corps in 0.0. there are already pirate corporations in parts of 0.0. additional npc stations aren't going to fix 0.0. and an npc 0.0 corp for players is just going to be abused. the corp would become the de facto place for hit man alts. a way to wage war on rival alliances without fingering their true alliance (especially if these hit man alts apply to join other rival corps to get them on their employment history).and that doesn't even address how counter it runs to the concept of 0.0.in the end, 0.0 (and to a lesser degree low sec) really does require backup. there is no reason several corporations couldn't alliance up. it doesn't even have to be a \"we are all going to help each other\" type of thing, just a \"we all commit to mutual defense and retaliation.\"the only problem is paying for it. and i think one way to do that is to expand the taxation system to include an option for static dues. so instead of taxing x%, it could be y isk per cycle. and maybe they would still have a % tax, but it could be smaller.i haven't noticed yet, but i wonder how the new sov system will effect outposts."

"i killed one of your guys, he lost a pilgrim (got it on video ). since then then not a single tears pilot has engaged my ship while on a mission. i did have one of your guys scan down then loot a wreak. he warped off before i could lock never to be seen again. it's quite unfortunate. i love killing pirates who think they found a sucker, only to be suckered themselves. i even bought/skilled for a proteus so i could draw the flies but that did not work, even sitting in a mission with an mwd running got no results. too be fair i saw that pilgrim pilot undock in a navy mega and figured wth. i was gonna go cheap and use the @ 0m bug to disable his guns but, the closest i got was 167m. unfortunate since i would have beaten him handily if i had just kept up the range."
"you could at least have the decency to post my entire quote. here it is:"
"technically wouldn't a faction rp alliance be a splinter faction, as far as game organizations are concerned? from an rp perspective, why should concord support an independent faction, to take part in a wardec sanctioned between two other factions? from an rp perspective, shouldn't the opposing npc faction send their npc capital fleets to shoot at your poses, and disrupt your sov and infrastructure? rp as an argument for an added game mechanic can be taken to any extreme the imagination wants. how about game mechanics that are good for the game? ccp has said very explicitly they want fw to be casual pvp. suddenly doubling (or more) the size of a faction would not only invalidate everything the fw guys have put in, but the influx of capital fleets supported by sov holders point income sources would render the current fwers obsolete. if i was in fw i'd probably be pretty upset if my faction strategy got completely taken over by people i don't even know, and who haven't contributed to the strategic goals. as a new player wanting to join fw having large sov holding alliances dominating fw would probably put me off from wanting to join. my votes for csm have been based on the principle of the candidates creating opportunities for either new people or people looking to experience new playstyles. fw is broken, no doubt about it. letting alliances in at all would probably hurt more than help, until fw can be fixed.btw to the op and your alliance-mates, you seem to be looking for a completely selfish, nearsighted agenda, not realizing that following through on it would seriously damage the entire eve community without regard to anyone else. i don't care about your politics, but i'm disturbed you all seem be so willing and eager to sacrifice the entire eve universe on the altar of your political agendas."
"i think you are getting things mixed up, it's liiza who has posted with alts crying about lark and the csm stuff.#1#2#3he posted in all the threads about lark several times, but i just cba to link them all."
"no, he's not serious at all about this now. he's not engaged the community in a meaningful way or engaged in any public debates. he's simply not trying because he knows he has no chance of getting elected. i personally asked some valid questions on his csm website last week. the comment has yet to be approved. in fact, there are no comments approved on that website. now that he's been called out on this fact, i am sure that there will be several dozen comments that will appear on their. i wonder how many of them will be made by people other than liiza valora trying to cover his butt. it's not like he has any method on their to validate whose posting a comment, like intensedebate or anything. my goodness, that would just bee too much. something to ensure truth and honor, that would be a big step for him. i doubt he has the integrity to do such a thing.one more thing, for those of you wondering who i am. yes, i am an alt and yes, i used to be a member of the united, not neo spartans. i am not this \"gaylen\" as he puts it in that lovely in game email he sent me. i've blocked you so you can stop paying that 1 million isk for each email you try to send. i deleted the other 10 or so without reading, sorry. i got to know ga'len in real life. he's an odd sort of fellow in that he likes to see the good in people.i do read ga'len's blog as it's an interesting read. i bought the old web domain that ga'len registered for sandwich back when they were friends. i bought it to blog about sandwich and how he harassed people. i thought it was wrong what he was doing to people, scamming them out of ships, stealing isk from the corp wallet and how he pursued people out of game to harass them.i've tried to get ga'len to comment here or blog about liiza's run for the csm, he simply won't do it. he won't say anything for the same reasons i am posting with an alt, he doesn't want to have to deal with the in game and out of game harassment as i had to deal with from liiza valora. how did ga'len put it? oh yes, \"i don't want to bait him into harassing me. it would not be fair to do such a thing. he won't be able to stop himself and i shudder to think how far he would take it this time around.\"sorry ga'len, you didn't say off the record."

"/support"
"from my understanding of racial balance, blasters are supposed to rule within the short confines of their optimal - but now they only do so (in med/small level in particular) if you gimp your buffer to the point where you're much more fragile then ships with 30-50% more ehp then you. making your ship a glass cannon to get 15%-20% more dps sucks, when you're already outranged by a factor of 2-3.a blasterboat landing within his optimal should have a heavy advantage to compensate for its (in comparison) horrible range along with locked damage types and cap-using weapons.now that isn't so, because either the ships suck (which they sort of do, since rep bonus is incompatible with doing dps), the guns suck (neutrons don't, but everything below that doesn't have a real dps edge over competition and gets a horrible drop in range, and neutrons have horrible horrible fitting requirements).these are the problems which need fixing in some way. give me some incentive to kite a blasterboat (or train for one if i want to do short-range ganking)."

"yeah, this is something that needs doing. that said, i'm pretty sure it's already been raised by the csm.edit: hrm, couldn't find it in the csm pages, which makes me think i might be remembering wrong. i don't support issues that have already been raised(since i don't want them raised again), but if it hasn't been, then i'll support for sure."

"the gas harvesting career needs some serious work. right now all that can be used for it is any ship with at least 5 turret slots, and even then its painfully slow to harvest any reasonable quantity of gas from a cloud.i would think at least in the storyline of the game that ore would have come up with some kind of mining barge and exhumer for gas harvesting. they have them for mining asteroids and mining ice, why not gas? they could even stick with the original harvester turrets, but allow the ship to equip more than 5 of them and/or give bonuses to their yield and cycle time. or they could follow suite with the other barges and exhumers, and make gas strip-mining modules for them.another possible add-on to this is that since units of gas aren't extremely big like ice, gas harvesting drones are also a possibility. anyone else feel that this is overdue?"
"overdue usually means they are too humiliated to deal with it now, so i doubt it will happen but... support+1."
"more gas is always a good thing! oh wait, that just sounds wrong... ok, more drugs for everyone can only lead to good things um, nvm. but yes, better harvesters for... the fluffy stuff!"
"i have seen many petitions on the poor quality of amarrian drones and i think i may have the solution that gives them a purpose and fits in with racial status. i propose to give the amarr drones self regenerating armor. this fits in with their technological prowess and would finally come up with a drone that although it does less damage than all the others it can survive longer in hostile environments."
"i've proposed similar threads a couple times(though focused more on raw hp than tank, because in my experience drones taking a bit of dps over a long period of time is rare), but i don't think they ever actually got raised by the csm. so yeah, supported."

"with so many nerfs and the caldari being a primarily missile based race i belive that the word kinetic should be removed from all missile damage bonuses the entire purpose of missile combat is to provide damage versitility and to restrict a ships bonus to only one type of missile is a unbalancing nerf for any pvp fit. i propose that missile bonuses on ships should be universal"
"i certainly agree with that. people going against a known caldari ship can easily tank against kinetic a lot which negates the bonus. make it universal; all of the other damage bonuses for weapons on other ships are universal regardless of the ammo used, with the exception of the stealth bombers."
"supporting own post"
"not supported. you still got the versitility of diferent damage types, if someone know they facing a caldari ship ( how they know and then have time to refit is another question ) and harden against kinetic then they got a hole in another resist, so swap missile type and hit that hole. missiles already have diferent types of damag are capless and an option when jammed to keep firing at something which a the turret ship pilots would love. put up with it, if you're target hardens towards kinetic, swap missile type and in effect you still hitting for a bonused amount as you be hitting a resist hole."
"people going against a known amarr ship can tank em, people going against a known gallente ship can tank thermal, etc etc. the caldari already have the choice to choose between primary damage types unlike any other race, the small penalty that follows not doing your race's damage is a sacrifice you'll have to decide on.edit->all other races don't get penalties because their ammunition types do the same types of damage with a different ratio, excluding the minmatar, which they fall out in damage per second in exchange for their omnipotent damage.<-editand kinetic is the caldari primary damage type. notice how their drones do kinetic, and their doomsday too? i would be pretty sad to see explosive drakes with heavy assault missiles."
"better avoid looking at the rook or the raven if you dont want to be sad."
"uhm i'm aware of their bonuses.i didn't say that all caldari ships focus kinetic damage, but it is the primary caldari damage type. amarr would have em, caldari kinetic, gallente thermal, and minmatar explosive. the drake reference i made was to combat mission runners because the drake already has a ridiculous defense rating. that defense combined with free selection of damage would make it a little too good for missions.although the raven can do most level 4 missions alone with it's large active tank and damage potency while holding onto it's range, it does have a heavy weakness to energy neutralizers.don't condescend to me it's humiliating."
"i agree that there should be some way of seeing what's outside... but without your standings/overview filters.after all, you're slaving to the station's sensors (or just simply standing on an observation deck looking out a window), not using your ship's sensor suite."

"ok the only way i would look at this is simple..can you learn to walk when your 2 years old then first thing you do is walk straight into a job as computer programmer, nope you need to learn things first. but before you learn how to program (or fly a bs) and for that you need to learn the basics, and in my opion the learning skills are these 'basics' that we learn in real life at school....and the better you do in school the faster you will be able to pick things up in real life (and yep i know this isn't always the case) but im sure you get my idea."
"my character went to the federation navy academy, so i assume my character learned something, even if she just learned how to learn.basic learningskills to lvl 4 are so elementary, that i doubt there's many in eve-online that do not get these skills. respectively they do not add a lot to the game in the beginning, apart from getting skills quicker. you do not gain any gameplay value from training learningskills, and it's incredibly boring.advanced learningskills (although still dirtcheap) are \"expensive\" and \"exotic\" for new players because you have to earn them, more or less. same goes for implants.all basic learningskills (bar learning itself) standard to level 4 will let you train learningskills right off the bat if you want to, but it also gives a lot more room to train other skills while earning your isks for advanced learningskills. basically it makes you bleed a little less as a new player, but on the whole scale of things it doesnt really leave an impact. it just makes the game more enjoyable."
"let try a reasoned post.given the choice, i would choose not to give up my learning skills, even for double the amount of sp i invested in them.i invested in them for a reason! i want faster training. i would not accept the free skill points in return for significantly slower training on everything from losing my learning skills.if instead, you're proposing to boost everyone's attributes as you remove learning skills, then why? all you are doing with that is lowering training time across the board. if you want to compare this to wow, it would be like saying \"i want levels to take half as long.\" well....why? blizzard would laugh at you! they want people playing thier game for a while. ccp is no different.i reiterate, your post is asking for one of two things, both of which don't belong. either you want to slow down the training of everyone who learned any learning skills, by removing them and giving some piddly amount of instant sp, or you want to speed up overall training time by giving everyone the benefits of all learning skills to 5. either way, i support neither of these options."
"let's not and say we did"
"actually since almoast all new characters train their learning skills to max before even starting their main skill chain i think removing those skills completely and just giving the characters the extra 10 sp in the begining will save training time and remove a complete waste of time. although if ccp does impliment this i hope they will give the missing points to existing characters as well as new players"
"thanks for the hint. i am not a native english speaker, so i do not know how things like engine oil or coolants or other items who are supposed to supply the operation of a machine are coined correctly."
"\"lubricant\" is the right term for motor oil and such, but most people hearing the term think of the sexual variety of lubricant, not the industrial variety. hence, you'll get a lot of people interpreting your proposal entirely the wrong way. as for the proposal itself, it's not crazy, but i don't like adding new objects to the fitting screen without a good reason. eve ships already routinely fit 20-30 items, plus overheating, ammo types, implants, gang bonuses, and all the rest. i don't like making things more complex without a real need for it."

"ok then i will use a real scenario, very similar one i used to discredit the removal of learning ..if you want a job (as i do) as an archaeologist you have 2 options..1 you start by doing the job as a volunteer and work your way up until you get sufficient skill that someone hires you or2 you goto uni (which im doing) and spend 5 years doing bsc and ma then you get hired to work in a field of expertise..now assume 5 years time i work in arch for 2 years then think i dont like this, i want to be a doctor, can i simply change my degree and go work in a hospital... well no of course i can't ive gotto go back to uni to study another degree..now to me eve is like this, if i want to fly a caldari bs i have to train caldari bs to level xx (bsc) then the skills that it requires to fly it well (ma) now i get in ship have 3 fights think omg this ship is s%^t and i want to fly in gallenete bss i now have to put in the time in training to fly this ship... so in fact having to re-train makes eve skills more like life than any other mmo i have played..obviously most people have played wow and because the majority of the kids who play it didn't like having their talents being permanent they allowed you to change the talents for cost of a few gold, the reason being that most people who play wow have little to no long term attention span, which we obivosuly know that you need in eve... the remapping was brought in because of the complexity of creation new toons 12months ago often meant people chose otpions that had very very little effect in their game abilities but also when they 'dumbed' down the character creation they had to compensate by offering the older players a bonus thus the remap was born."

"stealth torp-bomber whine detected basically, yes. too bad, so sad, suck it up. torps 4 -> 5 is only a 2 week train; the bomber change was months ago. and cruise missiles are still in the game and still useful. the new stealth bombers are so unbelievably much better than the old ones that i am simply baffled that anyone using them could complain about a couple of weeks training time.skill respeccing inevitably leads to everyone flying fotm builds, and it also means that low sp players are at an even greater disadvantage to high sp players. make your choices and stick to them, stop trying to ride the fotm wave and crying because you're not in the \"uber ship\" every second you play."

"before the fact that missions really need an overhaul, make mission rat quality (in bounties, lootdrops, and salvage) be reflected by the system security rating.missioning would be worth the following: (just sprouting out some numbers which would need to be worked on)1.0 - 0.5 = 30% less than current worth0.4 = current worth0.3 = worth 5% more0.2 = worth 10% more0.1 = worth 15% more0.0 = worth 25% moresame could be applied to mining in the form of yield per cycle?industry is affected in the time it takes to research / produce?basically, this would put a lot of emphesis from highsec to lowsec and nullsec. it would also greatly encourage a spread in lowsec systems. risk assessment would also become a larger factor... noone will know which systems are safest to work in without losing a good chunk of your possible profit."

"or how about instead of an agent which means you have to go back to station and hand in/accept/skip missions, you just spawn mission rooms (let's call them \"cosmic anomalies\"), and as soon as one room is completed you spawn a new one?then add an upgrade to the infrastructure hub which increases the number of cosmic anomalies which will exist in a given system?the advantage here is that you have no deadline in which to complete a mission, you have no mission item which some prankster will inevitably come and nick from you, and you have no agent to lose standing with when you fail a mission due to completing the objectives before picking up the item due to being blown up and podded. throw in the utility of being able to enter and leave an anomaly as required to answer cta.can it get better than that? why do you need level 4 missions when you can just spawn infinite numbers of cas?the cas can be scaled in risk/reward between \"level 1 mission\" (ie: dumb frigates) up to \"level 5 mission\" (ie: hordes of battleships, neut towers, web, scram, damp, smart ai), to the point that you can keep people occupied in any role, while they are waiting for some more pvp action.no more jump cloning to empire space and missing all the fun!"
"i agree"
"they dont even have to dock. just sitting on the gate would be enough.i saw such agents in sansha space and also in highsec."
"aye these agents (usually cosmos) are doted around 0.0 but often their systems are highly populated because of it.. but if with the changes that comes in with dominion and your quality of system improving then also as a bi-product your quality of agent improves as it gives the agent reason to come visit your system to check on how your 'looking' after his space ;)"
"wrr, i too fly an arazu. have never had fitting issues with it. if you're setting up to probe with it, you can just not bother with guns. if you're not fitting probes on it, you can get a full rack of 200mm rails on it. it's not built for dps, it's built for use with a rapier on the side so you can essentially pin some poor sod down until backup arrives. solo work in an arazu is not really smart.to be totally honest, the force recons are fine as they are. boosting damps would be nice though"
"ccp is terrified of any ship being able to probe down another and actually have the ability to deal damage to it once locating the target.now, they don't mind the support being cloaked (bombers, anemic cloaking recons, ect)... but they are dead set against any probing ship being able to engage."
"ok both fair comments but lets look at it from slightly different angle..arazu has 440 cpu... the combat scan probes takes 220 cpu... thats 50% of your cpu, doesn't leave room for much else.. (*thats why my practicle improbality reasoning)now given that you can spend 80mill less and buy a sb which since it can now warped cloaked (the main reason i did all the painful training to get into recons) can have more uses on a battlefield, in my opinion at the moment i struggle to see the benefit of the arazu i just feel that if not bumping the force recon then making a recon ship that offers versitability of scanning whilst behind enemy lines with some proper form of defence (for arazu its dampening)apologies if my logic is slightly flawed at moment its almost 2am lol"

"teadaze, just wanted to say, after reading this thread, you have my vote too. i think you'll take the csm seriously and work hard in the position and not just push your own pet-projects.local could use some tweaks, a 1 or 2 min delay wouldn't be too bad to test on sisi i think."
"i have another question which is somewhat off, given your focus, but maybe you have an opinion on it:- do you have experience with capital ship warfare? do you have ideas about how it could be made more relevant and fun (in a post-dominion context)?and lastly: am i right in assuming you indulge in tea culture?"
"you got my vote, matey.don't know if you started putting yourself into the public eye in advance of the csm but you play it like you're born to it. bon chance."
"i was also like 64% & 63% between alek and helen. the two big differences i noticed from the vote match site are that alek agrees w/ making local delayed which is a horrible idea unless you want to constantly get ganked by cloakers in your own freaking space while trying to raise pvp money - it just further reduces 0.0 profitability (besides, that's what wh's are for).also, alek is against converting tech ii bpo's to high run bpc's. not directly relevant to most people, but i agree with iain in erasing all remaining traces of that ridiculous lotto. anyways, i voted for helen w/ my accounts and you should too, especially if you are in any way interested in 0.0. besides, the more goons we can get busy w/ csm business the less time they will have to spam-crash tpar local."
"i can state that you are by far the most interesting goon candidate, imo your stance on different issues are sound and you did fairly well in the podcast (you don't fit in goons tbh). but the problem has been pointed out already, even if more people feel the same about you, they just won't vote for you because that might result in 3 goons in csm...harsh but true: cut all your goon ties and you might have a good chance in csm5."
"i'm getting this:"
"just try again, server hickups sometimes."
"you can read my interview with eve tribune at:"
"everyone complains about low-sec and no one goes there which leads to people discussing issues they don't know enough aboutso, i'm curiouswhat would you identify as some of the core problems with low-sec, and what kind of remedies do you suggest?"
"i was going to vote for you until the \"dental hygeine\" comment on your latest podcast.this might sound like sour grapes but i hate stereotypes, and if you exhibit them in real life, i feel you are likely to do the same in game. that said, i wish you good luck, if not success."
"as a trader i love low sec. great profit to be made there as is. the issue that i speak to is getting missioners into it. my idea was for fleet missions. missions where you need to be in a group and in which pvp setups are ideal. in them the ai needs to be able to re target to include pirates that may show up in the mission site. this would \"even out\" the playing field where the missioners may not have to tank all the mission dps plus the pirates and the pirates have to worry about the rats."

"seriously. i feel like people who are interested in exploration content are pretty underrepresented. do any of them have any agenda regarding exploration content?"
"as much as i would like to say i am the only candidate with an interest in seeing exploration increased, i think you would be hard pressed to find any player that is against expanded exploration.bear in mind that exploration is already getting a much needed buff with dominion in december.so the question becomes, after this coming buff, how much additional dev time will exploration need. that is where i think the difference between \"strongly agree\" and \"agree\" comes in.edit: i ran this question through vote match. only two candidates didn't vote agree/strongly agree. those are logit probit (who declined to take a stance) and lizza valora (who \"disagreed\").i recommend you check out csm vote match to help narrow the list of candidates to check out.\"or you can just vote for me (jonathan fearn),\" he said half jokingly."

"supporting the idea and letting others discuss the details."
"i made a slight revision to your proposal, and with that revision i would support your proposal. damping the signature radius of wrecks would not be enough, as illustrated by the impact of a set of drones in use by a target being probed. your suggestion, as written, would mean that pirates (or other hostiles) would no longer need a combat probe to probe mission-runners, which would be a ridiculous change to the system."

"sure, gas strip miners would work just fine too, and maybe the gas harvesting drones i also mentioned. they at least need something better than what we currently have."
"really good and unique idea.i'd love to see it happen especially if the amount of regeneration they get is actually viable against smart bombs and drones of a similar type. for example, small amarr drones should be able to over-regenerate against small smart bombs and small drones but die to medium and large ones if they can hit."
"seriously? no, unless you are speaking of a 1 vs 1 drone fight.if i send my drones against your drone he should not survive (unless you kill them faster). the general idea of giving some different advantages to the different race drones as a way to balance them is good, but your proposal would make light drones way more unbalanced. so support to the op, even if i prefer a larger hp buffer or more armour resists."
"this sound reasonable and interesting."
"i have to say i give you points for your inventive take on this.but i'll be honest with you, even if they regenerated, they'd still die rather fast, and the lack of proper dps on them would still have me picking another type of drone in 99.9% of cases.caldari drones are similarly unimpressive, i might add."

"third time lucky....issue. many minmatar ships suffer from the affliction of nothing bonuses. unlike the other races which have clearly focused concepts and bonuses that match, minmatar ships seem to have been given a hodgepodge of bonuses that are incongruous with the nature of the race, and are practically redundant given the alternatives. for instance, active tanking bonus to the race with the poorest capacitor and cargo bay sizes, double damage bonuses where in reality, a single larger damage bonus would do... given the merrigo round that is minmatar skill training and the fact that certain successful racial traits (ie speed) fail to transfer into later ship classes, i propose a new solution that would aim to solve the \"throw away bonuses\" issue...solutionlet's throw away, throw-away minmatar bonuses in exchange for slots...the traditional mantra has always been that minmatar ships where * versatile*. well active tanking and remote active tanking bonuses (see nidhoggur) more than any other kind of bonus destroy that ideal. and in the case of shields (unlike armour) can be replaced almost exactly by an additional tech 2 - shield boost amp (36% from the module vs 37.5% from the ship bonus before stacking is applied) so an extra mid slot in almost every case would directly compensate for the removal of the boost bonus. in some cases various ships would have an early advantage at as relative tank compared to caldari ships at bs ii-iv would be better however is is racially counter balanced by the dual tanking nature of minmatar ships.hel bonus removed - 5% bonus to shield and armor transfer amount per level  new slot layout - 7/7/5nidhoggur bonus changed - 10% bonus to shield and armor transfer capacitor power use per level naglfar (???) who knows wtf is happeneing to this ship is right now?vargur with the new projectile changes considered i'm happy to keep this as is although the power grid of this ship (even with standard fittings considered) is no where near on par with the other maruders. +1500 power gridmaelstrom bonus removed - 7.5% shield boost amount per level  new slot layout - 8/7/5 +50 cpu agility modifier changed to - 0.12 mass reduced to - 101,000,000 kgtempestalthough most ships with dual damage bonuses work somewhat, the tempest most certaintly does not. barring a full gang fit (of which it has no where near the cpu to successfully fit, it has almost the same the slot/hardpoint layout/drone bandwidth as the myrmidon. although it's already faster than a drake, it also has the same sensor strength. all battleships (with the exception of the scorpion) are designed to tank and gank to varying degree's of difficulty. the tempest does neither, substituting performance for utility, that has gradually become irrelevant over the years. this combined with the way that rigs tend to improve specialised ships the most, the introduction of the maelstrom and the speed nerf has seen the tempest fall behind radically in it's real world effectiveness.  10% bonus to projectile damage per level + 100m3/mb dronebay/bandwidth +50 cpu agility modifier changed to - 0.117 mass reduced to - 100,000,000 kg new slot layout - 8/6/6 speed increased to match the typhoon missile hardpoints changed to 1 shield recharge rate reduced by 15%the tempest can now fit a moderate shield tank + gank or participate in armour rr with increased utility. although it loses a bit of turret dps, it gains 25% more alpha (+/- 20% over the maelstrom) and additional drone bay."

"so you want no skill bonuses on most of the ships???"
"there will still be a single damage bonus, or role bonuses for most ships but now you just have options. your not condemned to fit a specific setup everytime."
"i'm ok with this, but maybe give +0.25 medium slots per level so you need at least bs level 4 to use this bonus slot. maybe even +0.2 so you need bs5 to fully utilize your bs, like other races. otherwise, they *will* cry.edit: this will also satisfy the guy that posted below me :palso dunno about the tank bonus on sleip/claymore, they're very powerful already, and can tank better than marauders (until you run out of cap booster 800).also nidhoggur is very good as a triage ship, please don't take away it's logistics-like transfer bonus. nidhoggur is fine imo, maybe just needs a touch more cpu so it can fit a shield transfer+shield booster and all other gear normally, so you can use it as a shield tanker properly.not commenting on hel because on sisi it now has a 5% resists for drones bonus... but, all in all this is probably the best idea i've seen so far to fix tempest/mael. drop a bonus and give one more slot. bonuses just give one thing, while a slot can give \"versatility\".supported."
"if you're not going to follow the most basic principles of eve ship design, why are you even trying? t1 ships get two bonuses, t2 ships get four. that's malleable at the level of capitals(right now, carriers get 3, motherships and titans 4), but if your t1 battleships have one bonus, go back and do it again."
"suporting this proposal ps: also i c now why they keep nerfing matars"
"i didn't realize csm \"proposals\" could include redoing a whole race's ship lineup. wow that's... ******ed."
"that would be interesting if it was possible although satifing the needs of herschel yamamoto has never been my aim.little changes in there active tanking performance however they can now do other things, such as fit tackle or passive setups as well as other commandships.triage is the only thing the nidhoggur can be concievibly thought at being useful at, and even then cap stability and personal tank > 25% more remote repping even for triage as if you've run out of cap or die a few minutes earlier, whats the point?but, all in all this is probably the best idea i've seen so far to fix tempest/mael. drop a bonus and give one more slot. bonuses just give one thing, while a slot can give \"versatility\".supported. tyvm"
"interesting idea. i like it. it's a different solution to the problem and should be given a try. question - do you think the ships will have enough power/cap to support an extra slot?"
"making it need more rep mods fitted to do the same amount of rep does nto help cap-stability either.it's a good ship with a useful niche..."
"they really should just be one weapon type or the other. make the phoon a missile boat and the pest a projectile or vice versa. i think the maelstrom would go from one of the worst ships to one of the best if the shield boost bonus was both local and remote tank.as to the hel & hog, i'm not sure what the complaint is with the current bonus. it makes them the most desired carrier/mom in a cap fleet. everyone desires a little hog lovin.as to the nag (a.k.a worst dread, a.k.a. fcs call battleships primary before worrying about these \"dreads\") - get rid of the missiles and double up on projectile bonuses. the end."
"signed and bump"
"why not retain current bonuses on tempest but redo it to be the minmatar armour tank rrbs with 7 turrets / 4 mids / 7 lows and 100m3 dronebay. that gives it competitive dps output, free highslot for rr, and a passable tank on top. the typhoon as it stands is a effective shortrange rrbs, why not make tempest the same only using projectiles?"
"this. not supported."
"if you remove the shield bonus of mael/sleip/cyclone (cyclone is awesome, you just need slaves), claymore so on, you need to give them 1 extra mid slot, not low slot."

"as an minmatar enthusiast.... i have to say big fat no on this one.why the hell is everyone's solution to ships is to put more slots on it?if you got a problem with bonuses... then fix the bonuses... the minmatar need much loving... but this is a little overboard.what's next? add slots to all the other races? yeah.. like ccp will go for that... let alone this.not supported."
"a weakness to neutralizers? you obviously didn't use a large cap booster setup on one before. with the cap booster and shield booster properly timed against the enemy energy neutralizer, the neuts would do nearly jack squat to it."
"honestly, if anything, the kinetic bonus should apply to all missiles, as per the wording of the bonus itself.\"battlecruiser skill bonus: 5% shield resistance and 5% bonus kinetic damage of heavy missiles and heavy assault missiles\"it doesn't say \"5% bonus damage of kinetic heavy missiles\"it says \"5% bonus kinetic damage of heavy missiles\"sure, i'd be happy if they just worded it correctly, but only boosting kinetic missiles is ******ed.it should just add that percentage worth of the main kind of damage on the missile in kinetic.so if you have a 150dm thunderbolt heavy missile missile, it would do 150 em damage plus 37.5 kinetic at battlecruiser v (7.5 kinetic at lvl i)"
"confirming this...i once beat the curse's big brother (can't spell it...) with a cnr on the test server by using that trick...he ran out of boosters first."
"great my first few days on the forums and a bunch of kids who obviously can't read decide to reply to me. i was talking about missions. if you use cap boosters in missions you need to have a hell of a stock of them in your home station and i can't be bothered to go pick them up in a hauler, especially when i can just pack in capacitor flux coils and rigs.oh and if you want to get gay and technical, you need the cap booster to sustain the defense on your raven without being neutralized. after a proper neutralizing ship is on you, even if you can get a single boost off every time you're able to cap boost, you will still deplete too soon to defend against more than 75-150 dps. also your invulnerability fields will sometimes fail to activate in time. in before you decide to say \"no i'm pro i time it too good\" sometimes your connection may not be."

"back in the day, i never used more than 5 or 10 cap charges, even in the direst situations (2 full loads). you don't need to keep your booster on, as you should know. most of times, distance / shield / cap recharge rate is enough to keep your ship going. the booster works wonders against heavy dps / neut situation, without resorting to flux coils which gimp your damage potential.also, if you're running missions in any given mission hub, you can always bring a cap 800 bpo with you and refine useless junk to craft them (it's often cheaper than buying them, even with 0 production efficiency).as for this proposal, either swaping kn for rof (raven / rook) or giving 5% kn damage bonus to all missiles (as someone mentioned in this thread) would be just fine."
"not supported. what arwen said."
"now this i actually like, a lot."
"the way i see it, then 5% of 0 kinetic damage on an explosive missile is still 0 kinetic damage. so applying it in the way you said would still only work for kinetic missiles also, your race shoots capless weapons which can shoot without needing a lock and can always hit at their range, even for reduced damage, of any damage you choose. you just get bonused to kinetic because that's your race's flavor.not supported"
"that sounds a lot like drones to me. anyone up for making the domi's bonuses only apply to thermal drones?"
"max heavy drone dps is 475 and that's with all thermal damage. switching damage types drops you to 431 with kinetic. 386 with explosive.sooo in a way, the dominix actually can't do as much damage with explosive and kinetic drones as it can with thermal. caldari missile boats would be doing just as much damage with all types of missiles. dominix can't do that. unless you of course just reduce the damage on all missiles besides kinetic. that's the way drone damage works or actually, boost drone damage"
"but there are also amarr ships that get a drone bonus. does it make sense for the curse to be pushed into thermal damage?"
"i don't see your point...ships without drone bonuses are pushed into thermal drone damage, too. the drone bonus doesn't push amarr into it, the different base damage of drones does."
"you seemed to be saying that it's fine for missile-bonused ships to lose one of the primary benefits of missiles(damage switching) because they have other benefits too. in a theoretical world where drones were balanced, drones would have all the same \"power\", but amarr drone-bonused ships using explosive drones, or gallente using em, would be commonplace. and while 475 dps doesn't sound like a lot, it's more than any realistic fit on a kinetic-bonused ship(bar the phoenix/leviathan) gets. remember, the torp battleships all get rof bonuses, not kinetic. so i guess my point is, \"missiles have benefits, so they don't really need to be able to use one of them\" is a bit of a silly argument."
"first of all, you are not losing the ability to use the benefits of missiles. you are totally free to switch damage types whenever you want. however, caldari are the kinetic damage dealers so they get a bonus to kinetic damage. sure as hell i'd use em and explosive drones if they all did the same damage before bonuses! explosive damage on armor could potentially outdamage bonused thermal drones. same with missiles. i've flown the nemesis several times, and i'd switch to explosive missiles on armor ships and i found myself doing more damage, despite my bonused thermal missiles!and i was not aware of the only bonus of torp spewing ships to be rof...if you look at it that way, then you can't compare battleship dps (dominix) to battlecruiser or cruiser dps (drake or whatever ships you're talking about). you'll find the myrm's sucky drone bandwidth severely cuts down from the dominix's 475 dps. eh, well technically the ishtar can, too. but i'm sure some caldari kinetic bonused ship can easily reach the ishtar's dps."
"which would still be the case after this proposed change. you get your base missile damage of whatever type, and then a bunch of bonus kinetic on top of that. they're still clearly kinetic-primary, but they can switch a portion of their damage, just like projectile-users. yes, using explosive drones seems great until they bring a shield-tank ship to the battle. admittedly, some ships(like the domi) can carry enough for both roles, but most have to choose before the fight. as for the nemesis, was this before the change to torps? they get +60-75% dps on thermal missiles, the guy would have to be very, very specifically tanked for swapping to explosive to make any sense. typhoon gets rof, raven/navy raven get rof and velocity, golem gets a flat +100% damage and velocity/precision bonuses, proposed navy scorpion gets rof, proposed rattlesnake gets velocity, and any other bses that use torps(tempest, scorpion, etc.) are doing so with no bonuses. the bombers are the only torp ships with damage type bonuses. okay, let's compare on-class. we'll assume all-v skills, t2 drones, no sentry rigging, t2 launchers, 2x bcu, and cn kinetic missiles. - myrmidon does 315 dps with drones(/me grumbles at ccp for nerfing it). drake does 368 with heavy or with 462 heavy assault. advantage, missiles. - ishtar does 475 dps with drones. cerberus does 351 with heavy or 440 with heavy assault. advantage, drones. - vexor does 315 dps with drones. caracal does 189 with heavy or 330 with heavy assault. advantage, drones, though only slightly. - ishkur does 99 dps. hawk does 128 with rockets, or 105 with standards. advantage, missiles, though only slightly. sum up the four classes, drones deal 1204 dps, close-range missiles deal 1360, and long-range missiles deal 1013. so when we compare class-by-class, insofar as that's possible, we see that the kinetic-bonused ships are roughly on par with the drone-bonused ships when it comes to the dps they get from their main weapon system."
"my helios gets a thermal bonus to drones. there's a lame example, but a true example of another race having to deal with stuff like this. i still feel that being able to change missil types is powerful enough without having the kinetic part carry over to all types of missiles. exactly, we have to choose what type of damage to bring, most ships can't pick what damage they want to use on the fly. caldari can already do this, so they shouldn't get bonused damage to all types of missiles. just kinetic.yes, this was before the change, but this demonstrates how the small bonus difference can be overruled by just changing missiles to a hole in resists. your ships don't get 60-75% bonus to kinetic damage, now, do they? sooooo the rof already makes up and bonuses all types of missiles while other races really only get bonuses to their damage type since they can't change it at all. this is fair how? especially since the dominix gets heavily penalized in the dps department for switching drone damage types.i could argue that you're using the wrong drone size for the ishtar if you're comparing cruisers as many times cruisers just speed tank heavy drones. however, just as often as not, actually, more often than not, heavy drones work perfectly.they are perfectly on-par as you said, so why change the bonuses around so that caldari can do as much damage with all damage types as drone users can do with just one damage type, thermal?or should we look at just how much dps is lost by switching to the lowest dps drones..."
"drone boats get damage bonuses to all drones, not just thermal - the dominix gets 10% bonus to drone hitpoints and damage per level.gunboats get dps bonuses to all weapons in their race specialisation (rate of fire, range, tracking).missile boats get kinetic bonus on missiles, or a rate of fire increase (the rook only gets a velocity increase, meaning it can hurl heavy missiles about 90km).am i reading it wrong when i see lasers listed with a \"base armour\" and \"base shield\" damage - does that damage apply in addition to the em/thermal damage, or is that an indication that the em/thermal damage is scaled differently versus shields and armour?"
"not sure which side you're arguing for...just gonna point out that yes drone boats get bonuses for all drones, but drone damage is not consistent. gong from thermal to kinetic to explosive to em, a **** ton of dps is lost.tbh i don't know what those \"base armor\" and \"base shield\" damages are for"

"current situation: isk spammers annoy everyone in high-traffic channels like npc corps or noob system/trade hub locals. we can block them, but they all get banned within 10-20 minutes, and the block list only has so many spots on it. someone who is in jita a lot and blocks obvious spambots can fill their block list in a few days. proposed solution: every downtime, the server will check everyone's blocked list for people who got permabans that day, and remove them. benefits: we can block obvious spammers without having to worry about filling our blocked list. drawbacks: additional server strain."

"currently applying 3 trimark armor pumps or shield extending rigs increases armor/shield hitpoints (respectively) by 50%. trimarks have low calibration cost, and penalty isn't all that sever, especially on large ships, bc size and above, ass those usually do not speedtank. now let's look at weapon rigs. you can only apply 2 of these rigs, as there current calibration cost is 200 points. they are only half as effective as a damage mod, and have severe penalties. fitting 2 of them will increase fitting cost of your guns by 20%, which will **** most fits, and only is as effective as one damage mod, + there is no point of having them on, if you already have 2 or more damage mods on your ship, due to stacking penalties. to clearly demonstrate inferiority of these rigs i will demonstrate there application: no drones, as there damage would be currently irrelevant. dps: 821, effective hp: 120571now, let's see what happens if you place hybrid rigs instead: notice that i had to drop heavy cap booster for a medium one, meaning ship would become more susceptible to capacitor warfare. dps: 919, effective hp: 90kthat is ~30,000 effective hp lost for about 80 dps, it is clear that they simply aren't worth it. my suggestion on how to fix the situation up:reduce calibration cost of the rigs, allowing 3 of them to be fitted. andmake them receive stacking penalties from stacking with each-other, but not with damage mods already on the ship. trimarks only increase in efficiency when stacked with plates and plating and each-other, why shouldn't the damage rigs at least be just as efficient? pros: 1) allows for more diversity on the field in battleship combat, rather then having every single battleship fitted with trimarks (except for utility ships and very specialized setups, making battles more fun. 2) allows you to achieve ~30% more damage output from your ship, if you are ready to pay the price of having 30% more power-consuming guns, meaning you probably will not be able to fit much more on your ship. 3) now, when fitting your ship, you have a choice of either getting 50% more armor/shield buffer, or having 30% more dps at the cost of powergrid. still isn't perfect, but it at least becomes a viable option in certain circumstances. if someone thinks that they need even more of a boost, i would agree with them, but i would be happy even to see these changes."

"it's very mediocre as it is, sorting does not work properly (i.e. sorting courier contracts by payoff) and it's probably largely why there is no really good business in hauling contracted stuff around for people, since 90% of the contracts are traps (and you can't filter out low/null sec systems) or have such an excessively large collateral and tiny reward that it's probably just not worth the risk.being able to sort courier contracts by distance, payoff, collateral as well as some system of validating the contract issuers (like..ebay, let people who completed the contract rate their employer) and allowing filtering of low/null sec origins/destinations would invigorate the hauling \"mini profession\" and be attractive to newer players as well.another idea is to introduce variable rewards. i.e. pay more the faster it's delivered, to encourage smaller, faster haulers to pick up contracts rather than fat freighters collecting them for a week before moving them."

"something needs to be done to curb the ammount of highsec ganking going on. jita is especially bad with a minimum of 20 gankers at any given time sitting outside of station. there are several ways to curb this problem. i'll start with the overkill solution which i don't support but have herd people say. concord anyone who targets a non-hostile target. before you start fllameing me for that i don't support it. another way is to make cargo scanning a concordable offence. i have herd people counter this with a real life example of it's not illegal to look at someone, granted that is true but then again go open a womans purse and see if it's worth killing her over and you'll wind up in jail. and my last thought on this is to make a rig or module that will counter the cargo scanners that can only be fitted to industrial class ships that require industrial ship skill. this in effect will lower the major market hub population of gankers looking for easy isk rewards. the problem of gankers in high-sec market hubs is out of controll and something needs to be done to adress the issue.as a recap here are my two ideas that i support for this topic:1: cargo/ship scanning is concordable offence.2: module or rig that will counter cargo/ship scanners to hide you cargo/modules."

"csm2 didnt decide anything, it was all rather dubious, with just the loudmouths deciding that it was agreed upon, which it was not. plus it's the most ******ed administrative thing the csm ever 'decided', every normal council or parliament allows its members to abstain. should be one of the top administrative things csm4 should fix.and your vote match is very useful but your interpretation of \"neutral\" is fundamentally flawed, as it always counts as a non-match. thus it is always better to list a for or against opinion, because then no matter what the players tick, the candidate cannot lose more than you lose with a \"neutral\", but you can win 50% or 100% if the player happens to tick the same box. a \"neutral\" is always counted as a loss.not my problem though, z0d already 'optimized' his spreadsheet, i noticed.in my opinion the amount of points should be decided based on how far away your opinion is. so if you list neutral and the player ticks for, then its -1. equal to if you say 'very for' and the player just lists 'for'. 'for' and 'against' are two boxes apart because neutral is in between, so thats -2, not -1 or whatever it is now."
"bah, pyramid quoting. my full post was eaten by the forum and i did not think the abstain comment needed further definition. i guess i have to retype it. first though the idea that you can not abstain from a vote is plain nutty. i have never heard of such a thing. i agree with ankhesentapemkah in that this should be something that is corrected with the first csm4 meeting.any representative should have the ability to abstain from a vote. simply at a basic level not everyone can know everything about everything. an uninformed vote chosen with a flip of a coin is not beneficial to any sort of elected body. now the response to this would be that every candidate should make the effort to understand every issue so they can make an informed vote. it is always possible that a csm issue is of an arcane nature and you can not really come to a justifiable position on it. i would rather have a counsel member abstain then make an uninformed vote in that situation.there is also the issue of having a conflict of interest. there could be a situation where a consul member would abstain because their vote would be seen as self serving. while this is a bit less likely within eve it still exists.as to your valuation of the \"neutral\" position in your survey. i have already stated my issue with your stance but, i will requote ankhesentapemkahif you can game your survey then it is not functioning properly.thanks for your time,ashinaedit: my comment about z0d is not intended to be a negative comment about him or what he did. it is simply a statement that the survey as designed has an issue."
"you seem to have missed the point.you are expecting people to come into low and zero security space on your terms, and a lot of us are simply not interested. you want us there, you have to meet our requirements first.many of us are tired of being cannon fodder for the current residents of low sec space. this is as much your problem as it is ours. if you get voted into the csm, will you fight for more fairnerss or continued ganking by the bullies? you need to represent the whole eve community, not just the ones that control things at the moment.there's no mystique, it's fact. you enter low sec space and you get ganked by the bullies. it happened to me a couple of hours ago in 0.4."
"first, everyone comes to lowsec/null sec on his or her own terms. we each control ourselves and no one else. if someone doesn't want to go to low/null sec, he shouldn't go. decline missions that send him there, filter low/null sec from his market, pretend it doesn't exist.but when a person goes there, will anyone else be there? probably. will they shoot at him or her? probably.but that is because the default assumption in low sec is that strangers are going to shoot you rather than ignore you. this destroys the threat of retaliation. retaliation (as a deterrent) relies on the assumption that not hindering a person won't draw ire. if that ire is coming regardless, i have more incentive to ruin every non-friend then to ignore them.because of that, i don't go to low sec unless:1. i am in an agile ship or one of my covert ops ships.2. i am in force.first, there is no argument ccp will accept to enact a game adjustment to fix what you want changed (that is making low sec policed by concord so that people don't gank indiscriminately). that has to be a player driven \"change.\" specifically, start a roving (player managed) police-mercenary force that sets known pirates to red and goes after them. that is the emergence ccp wants.additionally, there are nr:ds alliances in null sec. i recommend you get in touch with them about the policing of one or more routes through low sec to connect them to empire space. i am sure those alliances would be thrilled if someone would step forward to organize such a group.will i vote for \"bully buffs\"? i will vote for things that i think will improve the game (so they must make sense to me). i think that insurance shouldn't be paid out if a player has a global crimes timer going. that is a huge \"bully nerf.\" i am for sharing aggro to the active fleet. mixed corp fleets and fleets with non-player corp members could now share aggro. this would reduce \"wrong\" global crime timers. i am also against low sec warp bubbles.similarly i think firing on a player with a global crimes counter should be fully legal (i think this should still give a yellow timer though). this would encourage \"good samaritan\" behavior (you see someone getting attacked, the game shows you who has the gc timer, you attack that guy because he is the aggressor).i think it is important that people understand and accept that high sec is \"opt in\" on pvp. low sec is \"opt out.\" that is to say, in high sec you take action to engage in pvp (barring suicide ganks). in low sec you have to take action to opt out. if you want to avoid pvp in low sec/null sec, you have to stay mobile and/or hidden.every ship (and the one pod) i have lost in low sec were cases where i didn't opt out (actually i was part of the sak wolfpack, so we were looking for pirates).eve is fair. if a group is picking on you, there is nothing innate to the game preventing you from getting a bigger group to pick back. when you enter low sec, the only authority that matters is the authority players create and enforce.if you are asking me if i will vote to make low sec into high sec (policed by concord), my answer is \"no.\"there are two types of game issues: ccp issues and player issues. ccp can't solve player issues."
"i am new to the game, and had the pleasure of meeting ahsekuaw in the help channel. he set me up with some of his crew that took me on missions and spent time showing me things from manually piloting my ship, to setting up my training q to maximize the bonus period. i was hardly able to complete a level one when i met ahsekuaw, and flying a merlin. now thanks to his crew i am flying level twos and threes in my almost t2 thorax. this game is very hard, meeting someone like this made it doable, and enjoyable. thank you ahsekuaw and crew, much apreciated."

"is this just an fyi post or is there a point to it?besides the vote for logit bit at the end, which could have been posted in the other thread suspiciously lacking content that you created recently."
"alt posting anonymity ftw, amirite? hmmm...this is a fyi post that pinpoints a candidate who's core ideals are to remove your options from the game. this is what we - and what everyone, including you - should be fighting against.i'd say that it contains plenty of content."
"noso wait, your against logit? or...that was the problem lots of content, couldnt find a point in it though, i was under the impression that ccp had the say in the direction of the game not the csm, was i wrong?edit: spelling (annoying teh)"
"wait i think ive got ityour against stormaxe titanothereand for logit whosisnameright?why? because you think if the other guys get in, that there going to remove ninja salvaging?it seems odd that you would devote your time to something such as the sandbox prevention.. urm preservation party, even though it will never serve the purpose it was formed to, its not like, if ccp decide to change something this drastic there going to run it by you first.i guess i can see what you were trying to do, but obviously little to no thought went into its end-game.the numbers are against you anyway (more people dislike ninja-salvaging than like it) so if it ever came down to that, you'd still lose.as for the whole csm election thing, people will vote in who they want. your creation of vote this person or else this happens threads, is yet another waste of time.while your dedication to logit is admirable to a degree, continous posting of \"vote logit\" threads simply makes you look like his alt and therefore nullifies your support of him.i wont be voting because i just like to play the game as delivered by ccp, but some people obviously care a lot more, so good luck to all the candidates and there supporters."

"first, considering my post included the follow up fight where i lost my ship to that pilgrim pilot's navy mega i don't really see it as e-peen waving.second, people of differing viewpoints will read this thread. some will take umbrage with your position and candidate. i have no stance on you candidate, i do have an in game issue with your position. a reader that does not agree with you may like to know of a counter vote for the csm you promoting. your candidate would not have gotten that vote in the first place.... and this discussion keeps the thread bumped which gives more exposure to everyone involved. even the csm candidate that you are railing against. as to the last bit, part of the reason i posted about the tears pilgrim loss is so that readers can see that you can fight back. even more important is that if you fight back you will not be bothered again. since the intention of ninja's and can flipper is to kill easy targets, not have real fights.sorry to harp on this but one of the main things i do in eve is teach people to not be victims. with a little guts and some skill you can get the piratey types to leave you alone. some people learn this, others don't.personally i luv ninja's. there arn't enough of them. too few to rack up any decent number of kill mails.

"you think csm1 was really the best one? way too much drama for my tastes. i'm more a fan of csm2 - aside from pattern going awol, it seemed to work fairly smoothly all told. and it's the one that got us our skill queue, so that's worth at least a point on its own. and while i don't think any of them earn 10/10 ratings, i think you're being far too pessimistic. as for csm4, i'll be on it, so it'll clearly be a 10, if not an 11."

"omber zombie mentioned something along these lines but ccp won't let that happen.edit: i still think roleplaying should be able to fully participate and be able to capture complexes as well, with the hefty standing requirements to prevent lolster alliances from ruining it. then again we have established already that ccp is totally clueless about fw matters and just dabble around, throwing darts at a chart and tweaking random things, which surprisingly don't work."

"fully supporting the idea of activating repping modules counting as aggression and preventing ships from jumping or docking.but pitboss, just one question - if you have to divide your attention between two ships, doesn't that mean that the guy you're shooting gets to shoot you for free anyway? along with any drones that the logistics guy will now be deploying since he's already got the aggression timer?"
"supporting discussion, but not supporting modification to reduce chance of probing wrecks in deadspace.just make wrecks hard to find overall, so that it will be faster for a carebear tears hunter to simply scan for drones/ships. folks who are genuinely only interested in \"abandoned\" wrecks can happily probe for wrecks.then there's the issue of \"abandoned\" wrecks implying that wrecks are at some point in time \"claimed\". in most cases the mission runner will complete the mission then come back with a mwd-capable salvage boat - unless the wrecks have already been salvaged in-mission.just leave out the discussion of \"abandoned\" wrecks, leave out the issue of intent with respect to wrecks (both from the mission runners who create them and the salvagers looking for them) and the outcome becomes clear: simply allow wrecks to be probed down, regardless of where they exist. just make wrecks harder to probe than drones or ships (since both of those entities are active and must \"logically\" be easier to find), on the same order as wormholes or the higher-value gravimetric sites.i'd also make wrecks probable using core rather than combat probes, or perhaps they can be only detectable using deep space probes. but then, i'm also of the opinion that combat probes should only be able to probe ships and drones, so one has to make a decision about what they're looking for. the old system of quest/sifter/etc probes made life interesting for explorers. you had decisions to make, and those decisions would affect the outcome of your game. these days there is no decision - just deploy combat probes and start with the first \"thing\" you get a 100% resolution on. this is arcade style gameplay.anyhow, i've probably ranted enough."

"more fibre does help as we have a lot of satellite in our bandwidth mix, however the speed of light is constant and distance is the real factor in the latency.with the restricted amount of international bandwidth it also means our local bandwidth is somewhat restricted by telcos not wanting to break the bank with users who download too much internationally.as such southern-hemisphere fps players *must* play with other southern-hemisphere players on dedicated servers.p2p servers don't work well at all with the limited upstream local bandwidth provided to home users.an australian or new zealand player connecting to a us or uk server would be 250-500ms+ behind the other players. this amount of latency in an fps which relies on reaction time is completely unacceptable to players, as such these users only play on local *dedicated* servers.remote centralised or p2p options will fail for users from our end of the world and the product will be completely unusable to us."
"i think the changes being made warrant re-introducing the following. i've posted it before, and it's gotten good responses, but the problem is ongoing and will become worse in the next expansion.tl;dr: read the quote box below.backgroundscenario: my corp/alliance is at war. intel has indicated that one of the hostiles is camping a particular station. one of our members engages, hostilities commence in both directions, both sides are warp-scrambled. we send in reinforcements and the battle swings our way. the hostile stops firing, then docks a short time later. he undocks a few seconds later, fully repaired, and engages again. then stops, waits out his timer, and redocks. repeat.welcome to docking games 101, a tactic that allows players to exploit a mechanic to engage in virtually risk-free pvp. who needs stabs when you can simply dock at any time? traditionally this tactic is most common in empire wars, and is one of the key factors in making empire wars far more dull than they have any right to be. it is also not uncommon to see such docking games played with dreadnaughts or carriers in lowsec systems.but with the changes to sovereignty in the upcoming dominion patch, the problem becomes magnified. under the new system, a challenge to sovereignty requires the attacker to disable any outpost in the system (among other things). this requirement will bring the art of the docking game to new heights (or more accurately, depths).set aside the scenario above where each side has perhaps a handful of battlecruisers and battleships. the dominion docking game will involve potentially hundreds of battleships, capital ships, or even supercapitals on each side. except that now, the defender can simply fight in the shadow of their station, docking up when they take aggro to repair the damage. and the repairs are free, since the outpost owner can control the repair fees.can you imagine the results? the defender is fielding a titan (which cannot dock), along with a sizeable fleet of carriers. the carriers repair the titan until they are declared primary by the attacker's dread fleet, at which point that carrier de-aggros, docks, repairs for free, then undocks and resumes repairs. meanwhile the titan is destroying an attacking dreadnaught every few minutes. motherships would also fare well in this environment, being able to dock to repair as needed.sovereighty wars in such an environment will be one of the least amusing features of the game in a long time, and i include lag on that list."
"no, i like my matari ships the way they are; especially my 1kdps permatank claymore :p"
"do you realize that you are making the best carrier into the worst carrier by doing this?"
"maelstrom can tank easily over 1k dps for a long (read: longer than most fights) time by burning cap boosters, while still outputting upwards of 800 dps without overheating guns. this is comparable to a hyperion etc. does not need fixing. the only thing in this whole thread i support is to remove the sleip active tank bonus, i prefer to run them passive, but then again many people don't, so best to leave that alone too."
"the active tank capiblies of any previously active tanked ships will not changethe active tank capiblies of any previously active tanked ships will not changei've made no changes to the archon.i assure you that this is not true. also, have you seen the new bonuses to the hel?high slot/mid slot/low slotall those ships receive an additional mid. a cruise missile phoon will still be better than a 1200mm tempest, even with 8/4/7. that and the fact that there is already an abundance of turreted battleships with 7 lows. the 8/6/6 slot layout would keep the tempests current performance in armour however now it is able to shield tank to the same effectiveness as the raven whilst keeping lows free for tracking mods, nano's and/or gyro's whilst the phoon and maelstrom become the tankers.show me a cap stable nidhoggur with 2 remote reps (even a triage setup) and it'll show you a cap stable archon with 3 reps, as many cap mods and more ehp/better personal tank. there's no use repping 25% more if you die or cap out pretty early. an extra mid would help in this regard."
"what the tempest really needs is 1300 more base grid. then if it's still crap maybe another turret hardpoint (if yes then it also needs another 2600 grid on top, to fit said turret), or up the damage bonus to 7.5%(10%?) per level. for some reason, ccp doesn't want to do any of these simple fixes though so people come up with a ton of different (and sometimes dumb) ideas.this idea is new, and doesn't do anything to overpower said ships, just gives them more different fitting configurations (it should give medium slots tempest/maelstrom, but for example only when you have the battleship skill at level 5). this would also be something unique to minmatar ships, now that they've nearly completely lost their speed advantage.yes vagabond is still speedy compared to other races cruisers, but it's the only exception and also not in this proposal. also it'd probably be best to limit this change to tempest only and do some maths and see where it takes it. other ships mentioned are already \"good\" anyway.also nids are the best triage, it's their (tiny) niche and it should stay that way imo.i do like the extra mid on tempest and no rof but instead a 10% damage bonus. this gives a huge alpha and you keep the 2 utility high slots. if it also gets a little bit more grid (just 1300), it'd be a lowish range but high alpha shieldtank sniper. decent. not op like an apoc, not awesome like a rokh but still usable, and with a nice alpha niche."
"supported although i'm a bit cautious regarding the tempest changes and the removing of ship boni in general (though the mid would open up versatility i admit, i somehow would miss something).imho the maelstrom should stay the alpha boat leaning more toward arties and the tempest should be the damage over time aka dps boat leaning more toward acs.imho the tempest shoud be the most agile and fast bs on the field and \"dictate range\" among the bs. a high agility, speed and decent shield tank and acs."
"all ships have 2 bonuses for each skill. stop being stupid in the name of making your race \"more flexible\". don't touch my ships, as i, for one, am happy with minmatar and will be happier after dominion."
"/signed 1000x. the minnie bss struggle to do anything well, and the active tanking bonuses are singularly useless (in all races) above cruiser (and even there, they're dubious, since most simply don't in pvp)."
"all the nidhoggur needs is some more cpu so you can swap those faction mods with t2 ones, and maybe some more ehp so it's more in-line with other three carriers..."
"...unless they already had a shield boost amp equipped, of course. but who cares about the third module you equip on an active shield tank? it's not like any of these ships had three mids before, right?"
"quoting stupidity...maelstromx-large shield booster iiheavy cap booster iiinvulnerability field iiinvulnerability field iishield boost amp iishield boost amp iiwith active tanking bonus at lvl 5 =x-large shield booster iiheavy cap booster iiinvulnerability field iiinvulnerability field iishield boost amp iishield boost amp iishield boost amp iinow however, if you don't want to active tank, say you want to passive tank or snipe, you have an additional slot instead of a wasted bonus."
"yes it does. pvp fit (especially sliep/clay with its active tank) need that tanking bonus more than the extra midslot, which would likely be used for some other utility purpose.pve sliep or clay means the change is irrelevant.i can kinda see your point with the mael, mainly cos active tanking pvp battleships make me cry, but again, for pve purposes the change is irrelevant...gotta consider the whole field here"
"i like this idea. the thought of not wasting a bonus on a sniper maelstrom is appealing."
"is it really that hard to understand?when you put a shield boost amp in your new mid slot, your as effective as you where with less mids and the tanking bonus. (plus/minus a few percent)holy ****. what is wrong with people?"
"the archon might be the best carrier for lowsec docking game bull**** but for fleetwork the nidhoggur is outright superior because of the remote rep bonus and the ability to rep both armour and shield at range. an archon in a fleet is of limited value if the hostiles have primaried a shield tanking ship, and is worthless for repping pos shields."
"in most fleets with rr support, shield tanking ships are set to armour, even chimera's these days are armour tanked. the pos shield is one situation i'd use the nighoddur over a an archon, but even then with the extra mid, the ability to either fit eccm, cap re-charger, sensor booster or point offers a lot more flexibility especially when you put into consideration the natural cap benefits the other ships have over it."
"i think your missing my point. while the extra mid with a boost amp would theoretically have the same effect, there is no point in changing the bonus into the extra midslot because its a waste of coding and developer effort that has the exact same result."
"the difference is instead of being forced into active tanking setups, you now have a choice/added effectiveness in other setups that do not use a shield booster. (eg, sniping, passive/shield rr, support, etc)"
"what if i don't want to active tank my mael?"
"actually, you are wrong. moving the ship bonus to an extra shield boost amp (as shown in your example) would not provide the same bonus due to diminishing returns.not supported. i'd rather replace **** bonuses with good bonuses"
"due to stacking + stacking penalties it works out to be 3% less, which can be overcome with better modules.feel free to come up with better bonuses btw. seems like people like to fly the ship in different ways, giving people the slots to better utilities the ship in they matter they choose is what change accomplishes."
"wrong again - the stacking penalty on the third sba reduces it to about +20.5% bonus (from +36%).i will refrain from insulting your intelligence, as you have been so quick to do to others in this thread."
"in ccp's thinking, a single 10% damage bonus is equal to two 5% damage bonuses (see the claw), so it's likely that, in their view, the tempest proposal would not fly, as in their mind it would keep the equivalent of two bonuses at the same time as gaining a slot.secondly, giving up a bonus in return for a slot seems like a unequal exchange. on the one hand, using the slot for tanking will often incur a stack penalty, which ship bonuses do not; on the other, if it is used for utility then surely it would be just as poor as you suggest it is on the tempest?sba example on pattern's maelstrom fit: xl booster ii + ship bonus @ lvl v + 2 sba = 1473 shield for 360 cap, or around 4:1 shield to cap efficiency. xl booster ii + 3 sba = 1291 shield for 360 cap, or around 3.5:1 shield to cap efficiency. it's less bad for a 1 sba fit (which would become a 2 sba fit under your proposal), true, but other potential uses like trying to emulate a rokh-like buffer fit also fail the stack nerf test."
"apologies, it appears to be a 10.4% difference in active tanking abilities however, i wouldn't lose sleep over this fact if given the slots. (840 8 slot shield tank vs 938 7 slot tank + boost bonus)i try not to design ships and bonuses based on what the ccp might think as there perfectly capable of breaking there own rules when given the encouragement.this is really a compromise, i know exactly what lots and bonus i'd like on my tempest, so does the next person. but overall there really isn't any agreement on what the slots/bonuses should be so the best solution seems to be to give the players the slots to decide how best to use there ships.like i said to the last guy, feel free to come up with your own bonuses/slot layouts, get universal agreement that it doesn't suck and campaign for the changes."
"i think you are confused."
"change the bonus to boost both local and rr for shield and armor reps."
"i just think you are heading in the wrong direction by removing bonuses and replacing them with slots. imo bonuses have more to do with a given ships viable roles than slots (although slots certainly have an impact as well). by cutting bonuses from ships we would indeed make them more versatile, but we would also lose ship individuality. i believe it is intended that given ships be cornered into certain roles.for example, your proposed changes to the sleipnir would probably make it a better passive tanked ship than the nighthawk, while still retaining superior speed/firepower. your sleipnir would not just gain a new viability, it would replace other ships that currently fit that role.often, a given ship's limitations are as important as its bonuses."
"in the instances you just mentioned i'm pretty indifferent however the restrictiveness of an active tanking bonus, when compared to resistance based bonuses is astonishing. that combined with capiblities that provide absolutely no synergy with either the ship class role, or racial traits (the actual ones, not the perceived ones.)so 3 bonuses then?also without first reducing the cpu usage of shield rr so that t1 hulls can first begin to contemplate fitting these modules good luck with a decent fit.as it stands, with more than double t1 battleships are armour tankers, without increasing the number of shield tanking battleship platforms, shield rr bonuses on a battleship hull will be even more situational than a local tank bonus. like i said, what works for you probably won't for everyone else."
"maybe, but as we've proved in other venues you have a much more optimistic view of how they handle ship design and balance changes than i do. i'll admit that i can be harshly negative in my opinion, but considering recent events i've seen nothing to reignite my faith in that part of the dev team.i was thinking more generically for my second point. one test would be to extend the idea to other races; for example, i'm dubious that rokh pilots would want to give up their shield resist bonus for another mid-slot (i can't say that with any authority, though).i've been doing some thinking, and i think that the key to doing it would be to take a leaf from the amarr and caldari books and give the tempest and maelstrom their own roles, as opposed to what we have at the moment which are two ships which directly compete with each other.at the moment, the typhoon more than adequately fulfils the close range t<U+FFFD>talhelldeath machine role. as i think that neither ccp or minmatar players would be happy with the idea of electronic warfare or other support roles with their battleships, it suggests additional combat roles. perhaps one being a lightweight mid-range kiter and the other being the long-range alpha sniper, leading to thoughts of:tempest: 7/5/7 (7 turrets, 1 launcher); 5% rof + n% falloff ('n' being a balanced value in line with how autocannons will perform post-dominion); reduced mass, boosted speed.maelstrom: 8/6/5 (8 turrets); 5% damage + 5% optimal; enough grid to fit 8x 1400 ii + mwd without grid mods (the ship will still have to use more mods to achieve fleet range than an apoc or rokh, and in return shouldn't have to fret about fitting mods).niddy doesn't need changing (seriously). hel and naglfar are in a limbo of being messed around with by multiple devs, although i'd like to see the nag changed to 5% turret rof + 5% turret damage with capital projectiles balanced for competitive performance at dread iv as at the moment the oversized bonuses impose too large of a dps difference between iv and v. vargyr's value will change with the autocannon changes so it's tricky to say how that will pan out.regardless of what people might think about my specifics, i hope i'll get some agreement on the statement that unless proposed changes are composed with specific roles in mind, then consensus will be impossible to gain and the hulls will be doomed to mediocrity. i'll certainly think seriously about supporting other proposals that fit that criteria."
"this.although i would add that vague ship design can also lead to ships that infringe on the roles already held by other ships, as in my example of the nighthawk vs. the sleipnir. there's a reason ships have bonuses, rather than being blank slates. diversity is a good thing."
"not really sure myself yet. the dominix with t2 wardens does about the same dps as a raven with wrath cruises (that's with drone dps only, two sentry damage rigs).to be fair, garde sentries have much less range (but higher tracking) than any other sentry. on the flip side, most npcs (which is what i have most experience shooting) have weaknesses to kin/therm, exp/kin or em/therm, where thermal is a weakness it's only a secondary weakness. most t2 ships have weaknesses to explosive or em, with thermal as a secondary weakness. although thermal drones have more damage output, by the time you take resistances into account you're far better off using the right drone or missile for the specific weakness of the enemy.and now that i think of it, i should take my rook and drake out for a spin to figure out if the kinetic damage bonus isn't already applied to all missile types anyway."
"that's not a bonus, that's a trap for the unwary. the only non-cal ships that are like this with actual usable bonuses are the bombers. you have to know about a hole far enough in advance to bring the ammo. just how many people flying cerbs or kestrels in pvp load up on alternate ammo in advance of the fight? it'd be handy for low-end missioners, but that's not a field i care much about balance in(as long as it's doable by new players and not worth farming for cash by old ones, i'm probably happy). drone and projectile pilots can both switch damage types. both take a hit to dps doing so, but they both get compensations(drone speed, drone hp if another issue of mine ever gets taken up by the csm, gun range). missile users also take a dps hit, but they get no compensations except pure type-switching. as above, you gain things switching drone types - actual stats, not just type-switching. if explo missiles traveled 25% faster, em missiles were immune to smartbombs and (lol) defenders, and thermal missiles got 10% dps, 10% speed, and double hp, i'd be fine with kin missiles getting 25% dps and the others not. of course that's crazy for other reasons, but you see my point. they don't get anything like that at all, so i propose this change instead."
"you are the only one.however i do like the idea of making the kinetic bonuses apply to all missiles, so can fit assaults etc."
"i always bring different ammo types...it's really not that hard. you're not being penalized for switching damage types, you're just not using the bonused damage type. i don't see why you think you're getting penalized for switching types. it doesn't say -5% explosive damage per level or anything, you just get 5% extra for kinetic.projectiles start out with lower base damage than other systems, and are many times forced to fight in falloff. these are drawbacks for using all types of ammo. along with losing dps by switching ammo types.one thing i can't believe i've forgotten about but you just reminded me of. until 1/5 of your damage can be almost instapopped by cruisers and below, don't say that getting speed and hp bonuses to drones in place of dps is an advantage. drone users are at such a disadvantage in the fact that drones are very very easily popped.i think you got it right when you said (lol) defenders. as above, drones are very very eaasily popped by all sorts of ships so that kinda makes up for the fact that they all get bonused and get speed additions instead of the dps and such. i haven't seen anybody use defenders. plus missiles get bcu's, drones are purely skill based. i personally think both systems are balanced. disregarding the myrmidon of course, but we're not talking about that."
"on an unrelated note, i have always found it odd that missiles specialize in kinetic damage and bullets specialize in explosive (this seems at least a bit mixed up to me)"
"ccp makes me frown.for some reason they need like 9 months to make a minor change to any ship."
"i don't even fly amarr ships, but the retribution is one i could possibly fly with a couple of weeks of training. if ccp is not going to add a mid slot and remove a high, there is one other possibility (which would still drive many to emorage tears, but you can't please them all):remove the optimal range bonus and add a neut/nos bonus. this would solve the lack of tackle problem nicely, since with a 50% improved neut bonus (at af 5), you can turn off other ship's ab's, mwd's, scrammers, webbers etc quite quickly and drain their cap fast enough to prevent them from warping off. it would, of course remove the retribution's ability to snipe, but would make it better at 1v1 pvp."
"grath telkin, have you ever flown the ret? as an avid flyer of the retribution i can say that beyond a shadow of a doubt, it is clearly one of the best assault frigates in eve. your standard fit with the retribution will usually have around 70 sustained armor defense, with around 200 dps and an optimal that makes interceptors shudder with fear at just the site of one of these bad boys. the retributions power doesn't come from dps or tank alone, it's a subtle mix of the two, adding up to one kick ass little frigate. many say it needs one more midslot, but in all honesty an addition like that would make it so overpowered, it wouldn't be funny. the retribution isn't a 'heavy tackler' or whatever you said it should be. it's a god damn anti frigate platform. 1v1, no af in the game can beat it and that is the truth."
"supported. i can handle a nerf if you can at least let them do 2 fighters per level and allow the super carriers to dock. having a character wasting away in space in a ship that's no longer worth jack scrap is not how people are going to want to play the game."

"while a cloaker is cloaked and immobile (or at constant velocity, not speed) he dissapears from local chat. that means if the cloaker wants to keep the system under constant alert he himself must remain alert (or at least at the keyboard). as soon as the cloaker moves (ie, warps, changes speed and/or direction, etc.) cloaker reappears in local chat.this should be a somewhat win/win for everyone involved while at the same time forcing all players to remain actively on keyboard. the cloaker can still go afk for bathroom breaks, talk on the phone, change the baby's diaper, etc. and since the cloaker is afk he no longer (and rightfully so) has no influence in play. as soon as he's back he can continue his terror spree but must remain at the keyboard./thread"
"1) i doubt ccp will be willing to implement this - the coding will be too weird. 2) people don't want cloakers disappearing from chat - they'd much rather know about the stealth bomber coming to gank them than not. 3) find object, orbit at like 212km. your vector is constantly changing, so you stay in local, but there's no chance of you getting caught. sorry man, i don't think this is a good solution at all. not supported."
"i'll address points 2 and 3 as i have no idea what kind of coding would be required to implement this change.this in particular is what needs changing. it is perfectly fine that cloakers influence and \"terrorize\" a system keeping it in a high state of alert. that is their purpose. however, i believe this should be the case only while the cloaker himself is at the keyboard. as soon as he goes afk to do whatever his ability to influence the activities of [active] players should cease. basically, if he's not actively playing he should not be able to actively influence others (keep a system in high alert).and even though the cloaker still has zero risk while cloaked he would now be forced to remain active. there is absolutely nothing wrong with forcing the cloaker to be at the keyboard while still being able to keep a system under active alert.and to answer your question, as soon as the cloaker becomes active again, he reappears in local chat allowing everyone to go into a high state of alert once again. it would be no different from a hostile jumping in through a gate.as an added bonus to the cloaker, he now has the ability to be completely incongnito *while* not in play. as for the system itself, as long as the player is inactive (afk) they don't have to suspend their normal day-to-day activities for the entirety of the unwelcomed visit.i don't think this would be difficult at all. you could add an exception as a code that removes the cloaked pilot from local chat if the orbit command is activated."
"not supporting t.t;;;;"
"not supported for the 10235658th time"
"not supported.however when you state \"and since the cloaker is afk he no longer (and rightfully so) has no influence in play\" would you agree that afk empire haulers also would not have any influence in play?"
"what is a real shame is that afk empire hauling carries greater risk than afk cloaking. i should thank you for proving my point further. you see, in this case the ones acting like carebears are the 23/7 afk cloakers, by keeping systems in high alert while they themselves are not even required to be in front of a screen.i'm not even asking to have the risk increased to afk cloaking, so you can relax. your profession will remain risk-free ;). i'm proposing a change that rightfully invalidates influence when the player has gone afk. if the cloaker is afk then he is cleared from local chat. the cloaker remains invulnerable and the system has no need to remain in a high state of alert for 23 hours per day while the cloaker is present.to answer your question more clearly: yes, the afk hauler is still influencing eve. and here's the kicker: the afk hauler is still susceptible to the influence of others (suicide ganking, etc).my proposal is attacking one problem only. if a cloaker is going to intimidate a system for 23 hours per day 7 days per week, then he shall be forced to be at the keyboard for 23 hours, 7 days per week. that is all."
"you can choose to be intimidated... or not.it won't matter either way."
"working as intended."
"hmm. i can choose to love. i can choose to hate. i can choose to wear red. but as your response, it is all irrelevent.having active hostiles heightening the security of a system is a valid tactic. the ability to do this while also being afk is unlike eve. i don't expect this to sit well with some of you. and the fact is you, as a cloaker can still go afk. but not only would you like the ability to go afk for 23 hours. you also want to continue to degrade the security of your enemy all while watching tv or sleeping. and your response is \"they can choose not to worry\". the choice you're referring to of course, them slacking their security :). profit for nothing.anyway, just thought i'd offer my 2 cents on the matter."
"i wrote a nice mature reply to your response a few posts up. and you follow it up with this?"
"so what you're saying is your argument is irrelevant.ok... makes sense to me.try making sound arguments before you start coming up with counter arguments... you just shot yourself in the foot.. if not the leg as well.don't look at me pal... you chose the words... i just responded in such a way to get you to realize that your arguing over something pointless.i mean think about this... how do you know they are afk?that is entirely an assumption... for all you know the guy is sitting there... watching.. waiting.you might want to put a little more thought time into this before you come down here and emo-rage about something as simple as mind warfare."
"so i'm in my nyx in a ratter system. i sit 13km from the warpin of the middle belt. not on a warp in direction. ratter comes along. i'm cloaked. not in local. ratter warping to belt as shown by directional scanners. i decloak immediately. he's either given a heartattack seeing a nyx appear suddenly on his local or landing into a belt with someone when he knew 3 seconds ago wasnt even in the system. my shadow serp sebo is going. my 30km point has him dead to rights. he's done.if this is possible. nobody will ever go do stuff in 0.0 anymore."
"i don't know what you're arguing. however, i can tell you what i am proposing, or at least make it clearer to understand.i am not, i repeat, not, proposing to nerf afk cloaking. you can still afk-cloak for 23 hours per day if you wish. you can afk-cloak without worries. you will still remain invulnerable :p. what i am proposing is that while you are afk-cloaked you do not have influence over your surroundings. i am not acting out of line here. and i am not proposing an outrageous idea. if you are not at the keyboard then you do not get to deprive a system from mining and pve.a parked cloaked ship has a purpose. it keeps a system on its toes. and why not? it should be on its toes. there are hostiles on the system. what i do not agree with is an afk player influencing an entire system.i know what you're thinking. \"if he's afk what does it matter?\". and my response is if he's afk you're right, it does not matter. the problem manifests itself when trying to distinguish whether a player is at the keyboard or the player is afk not even playing the game. my proposal allows the cloaker to go afk for as long as he wishes while allowing the defending system to run business as usual. if the cloaker wishes to disrupt business as usual then it can still be accomplished. the only difference is that the cloaker must be playing the game.i know, an outrageous proposal :p. how dare i suggest the cloaker be at the keyboard playing?"
"fair enough... but your proposal is entirely based on an assumption.you cannot... and will not... beyond all reasonable doubt... prove said player is even afk... let alone cloaked or any of the above.space is vast... lots of places to hide.try spending 3 weeks in whs and then you'll figure it out real quick.the point i'm trying to get across to you is this is not a problem... its only a problem when you make it such.if there is an afk cloaker in system... then there is... how you react and treat him is entirely up to you.any good operation in mining or pve requires constant attention and observing of your surroundings... it dosen't matter if someone is afk cloaked or not.while your proposal seems fair... there will never be a solution granted to it because we cloakers here (i fly covert ops frigates frequently... and stealth bombers now) can't just sit there and remain cloaked all of the time... we have to make sure people don't get too close...yet we cant be too far away or we can't get any good intelligence.it's not as easy as it looks... it just seems that way.it's all mental warfare...you keep pointing out that its free reign intimidation.... and as ive pointed out to you... you choose to be intimidated or not.you call it irrelevant... i pointed out you said it.is it a problem? not to me... if we have an intruder... we act accordingly and just pay attention.. evetaully we may \"call it\" as an afk and go back to work but we make sure people understand there is a risk.but in reallity the risk is still the same with... or without the afk cloaker.which is why this is a whine post.so while you dare to call the afk'er to be interacting with the computer... will i think its fair that all afk'ers be required to be interacting with the computer.so that includes -1: haulers on auto pilot2: miners who afk mine.3: afk missioning (yep they do)4: ?????5: ?????you open this door... people are gonna demand balance to the system.so while i respect your position... keep in mind that your not going to get very far.ps: i know what its like to deal with afk cloakers.... so i afk cloak right back. difference is... in whs.... you still have to leave some time.... granted in low sec/0.0 your dealing with gates but still.. set up a nice little trap...."

"we have this, it's called fines from the directorate/booted from corp if you don't pay. i think it costs 100m to send alliance mail for most big alliances."
"go on singularity, they have a new mail system on there. it's freaking sweet - finally bringing evemail into the 1990s. i haven't tested it too thoroughly, but i'm pretty sure it solves this problem."
"or just fix defenders so they affect any missiles targeted at your ship?"
"a better solution would be to target missiles from any of the targetted ships. that way a ship set up with defenders could act as a missile shield for a team mate by targetting the ships firing at it.since you'd need a lot of defenders firing to provide enough of a defense it means an fc who wants this kind of missile shield is commiting a ship to a defensive role to protect a higher value target (a drake with defenders shooting down citadel torps fired at a carrier, nice protection against the tops, but the moros will still nail it)"
"why is jita laggy? because people keep going there until it lags.why are fleet fights laggy? because adding more people to a fleet brings an advantage right up to the point that the server collapses under the load (ie: because people keep going there until it lags).the way to prevent huge fleet fights is to reduce the benefit of having huge blobs. reducing the number of people you have in a corp is not going to have any effect at all on how many people get involved in fleet fights.if the processors were fast enough, blobs could be nerfed by using line-of-sight rules (weapons hit the first solid thing in their line of fire, as opposed to 1400mm shells passing magically through the hulls of friend and foe alike until they magically hit the target).fleet fights are big and laggy because by nature fleets get bigger until the lag happens."
"as one of so many new players who didn't know their cyclone's behind from their thrasher's nose, who originally happily carebeared away doing mission after mission to buy more shiny (or rusty in the minnie's case), i ran up huge positive standings with the closest minnie agents and massive negative standings with the amarr and caldari factions. the result of this is that this character cannot enter amarr or caldari hisec and has no realistic way of regaining standings with those factions (diplomacy trained up already, no go). one of the only ways i can see to do this would be to join an amarr losec corp who would be willing to mission with me in losec until my standings got to the point that i could reenter that faction hisec. or perhaps find some corp in minnie or gallente hisec who would be willing to mission with amarr agents in minnie hisec until my standings got high enough. i don't see many corps doing this at all.for normal sec standings, one can raise one's sec standings by ratting in 0.0 or low sec, but for factions this is very difficult and in some cases impossible.i propose that ccp please include some functionality that allows one to similarly raise one's standings with any faction. i know that game play wise it would not be easy to implement, given the current game mechanics, but one possibility could be a bribery skill that would allow one to pay agents with whom one has a deep negative standing (less than -5) to mission for them and thereby raise one's standings for that agent's respective faction. this would only be possible until the standings rose above the -5 level. the payments would be based on what your standings are with that faction, i.e. the lower your standing, the more you pay. another option would be to lower the standings requirements for missioning in losec, since hardly anyone does it, and it is hard (gank risk), this would perhaps give some risk/reward that the game requires.i'm not asking this because i particularly want to mission, but it cramps one's options in game (for wardecs, or hauling etc) to not be able to realistically enter faction space where you have very low standings.i know that thousands of players have the same problem and suffer from the same lack of resolution.please take a look at this, csm, and raise the issue with ccp."
"i support fixing this, but for you personally, i'd suggest that you use the workaround - assuming your standings to them aren't too badly shot, go work for the royal khanid navy or the ammatar fleet. both have +standings to amarr and caldari, and they should eventually let you work yourself up to missioning standings. both also have highsec combat agents."
"make that -2.5 or -2 to match the diplomacy bump so a person intent on recovering standings can get back to 0 standing with the skill/system."
"i've always felt it was too hard to get back in good standing with the empires, considering the severity of the consequences for having such a sec. status are so severe (cutting off 25%+ of empire access). the bribery skill is an idea"
"yay another \"nerf suicide ganking\" thread.didn't we already have our quota of these this week?seriously, there's nothing wrong with suicide ganking as a profession. learn to properly tank/defend your ships and you won't have a problem. do what so manyother people have done. create a safe warp to point straight out from the undock - undock, warp off, go on about your day.you have to be smarter than them - and really, it's not that effing hard."

"the worst part about jason is that 2/3 of the time he's a massive troll, 1/3 of the time he's serious, and when he's serious he's actually a fairly good poster. this proposal, for example, seems utterly reasonable to me. at the moment, faction guns are what you fit when you have too much money and not enough sp for t2, but they should have a role as pimped fittings on a vet's ship, not just for plex-selling newbies. i don't want too major a buff, but it really is kind of silly that t2 weapons can do better dps than officer weapons."
"i was wondering about the same a few days ago:for faction launchers vs t2 launchers the faction launcher win dps wisethe t2 launcher only get better if you use t2 high damage ammo (fury/rage)for turrets t2 turrets are always better, iirc after training the spec skill to 3.so bringing faction turrets in line with faction launchers would be a good idea imho."
"i'm too scared to not support. it's the internet tough guy guys. ok, but seriously, i agree as long as t2 guns aren't nerfed. that would make me a sad panda allthough, caldari navy rails have more range than the t2 ones, which makes them different, but not better. the other stats are pretty much the same as the prototype gauss'.might be worth looking at other options, like that. but tbh, i think the extra range is a joke, so they need a boost, and i think they should have more damage in addition to the range."
"there is at least one civilian module missing from that section of the item database, and that particular page has been locked to editing so i can't post anything about it there. this seems like the best place to make note of it.there is a civilian analyzer module for archaeology sites. i know for a fact it exists since my main char owns two of them; i recieved them from agents in either cosmos mission agents or agents from the lvl 1 epic mission arc (i forget which one). it has a 2% chance of success each cycle to break open the can and it does not need any points in the archaeology skill (or any other skill for that matter) to use, making it a slow but viable option for people who want to do archaeology without the required skills. i wouldn't be surprised if there are civilian versions of the codebreaker and salvager as well.can someone please put this into the database, or at least unlock that particular page so that i can do it myself?"
"not a chance. i think it would be good if ccp got rid of some of the more grindtastic skills and refunded the sp to be distributed as one likes, but that is it. skills like learning skills, jdc, advanced spaceship command/capital ships, and leadership.

"never underestimate the power of an ill-taught newbie. more seriously, there does exist two useless skills, so far as i can tell - battleship construction above level 4, and industrial construction above 3. also, there's the four rare skills that never got implemented but can still be found if you've got a spare billion. but if you're training any of those skill levels, you're not a newbie, so i'm hardly going to cry if you walked into wasted sp with your eyes open."

"i am supporting the discussion, but my preferred solution would be to remove meta 0 items (ie: unnamed t1) from npc loot.as for making mining more interesting, i actually like mining being \"boring\" because it's something i can do to be productive ingame without paying 100% attention. the level of attention required to make isk currently progresses on this scale:logged off -> station spinning -> slow sell market -> ice harvesting -> mining -> mission running -> 0.01 isk babysittingi like activities that produce more return than station spinning, without demanding as much attention as mission running."

"your idea for asking other players for input is hardly new, sokratesz. this is what take care has been all about since ankhesentapemkah founded it, and we have taken true representation to the next level. take care is a diverse group, we got all types of players onboard, ranging from newbies and casual players to lowsec pvpers and 0.0 players. we have industrialists and fw players in the team. in addition every player is encouraged to mail us and propose issues, and gets a personal reply back. i have been a part of take care since it was founded back in 2008, and am running as their next representative, but will continue to build on the team's experience. i think i can put forward a more holistic view than other csm, simply because we have a pretty solid group with which to debate issues and to make sure that we look at an issue from as many sides as possible. ankhesentapemkah and erik finnegan have proven to be holistic and unbiassed, and have proposed issues which affected all playstyles, not just their own niches. you have seen that ankhesentapemkah wrote a lengthy issue document for 0.0 changes which contributed to the dominion expansion, as well assisting with a major 0.0 issue, even though she wasn't involved in 0.0 at all. surprise, someone from your very own alliance was one of the players which assisted her with this.your insinuation that we are ignoring issues due to a lack of personal experience is a laugh, as one of the main goals of take care is to prevent just that.however, during our meetings with ccp and our internal csm meetings, we have to rely solely what we have in our heads at that time. i can and i will gather as much as i can from my advisors beforehand, but once we step into that room with ccp, we are on our own. the good thing is that so far, the csm has had a nice mix of people on it, with different specializations. as industry and market specialist, i believe i can contribute greatly to this mix. it is a big ecosystem, all aspects affect and stimulate each other on a global scale regardless of living in 0.0 from pure pvp or as a pure industrial, someone has to build what you use in your day to day activities."
"you seem to put a whole lot of effort in appealing to a certain target audience though, and i can't help but taste a bit of 'but we're better than you' in the whole message."

"that makes a bit more sense"
"you've got my vote. our answer profiles on"
"i should explain that those answers were a 'best match' for my feelings and i agreed with part of the question but not necessarily all of it. mining for example does need a boost while exploration is in quite good shape at the moment. you can make money from mining if you are macroing or if you're running a big mining fleet. the first way will get you into trouble, the second splits the profits too many ways to compete with mission running or ratting as a viable profession. miners have to compete not only with other miners but also with the vast quantity of very cheap minerals that flood the market from reprocessed mission loot and drone regions ratters. that needs to be fixed either by reducing the amount of minerals from non-asteroid sources or by giving miners unique resources to harvest other than ice. making mining less boring and harder to operate as an afk macroed activity would be gravy on top of that.there are a lot of variables in combat and it's certainly not as simple as target-activate turrets-wait for one side to die. however i do think that there could be more depth added and more tools added to help fcs in large battles operate with more finesse. at the moment a large fleet is a pretty blunt weapon and i'd like fcs to be able to easily manage that force with a little more granularity than simply gang warping everyone to the hostile fleet and shouting primaries over teamspeak."
"as mynxee said, you can get the list down to a dozen people fairly quickly. after that or even before that you can use the match making site to confirm your choice.what i wanted to add to the discussion is that a person with good ideas will still be able to voice them even if not elected to the csm. that's what this forum is for. on the other hand a person with a to narrow mindset will not make a good csm imo. i'm certain we'll get candidates with different points of view elected.but to the op, you're correct a fair amount of new players ignore what the csm is about. 49 candidates is discouraging at first sight, but you have 2 weeks to go through the entire list. i would think that discussing your vote in-game and the reasons behind your vote will encourage more players to vote.and by the way, i didn't vote for a spinning kitty or a girl in a bikini. but i'm curious to see how many votes those candidates get."
"i do base the points on how far away your opinion is. scoring is explained in detail in the 2nd post of this thread (and was open for discussion at the time of posting). the survey cannot be gamed, although you can get futher into the extremes (higher and lower scores) with less \"don't know / no opinion\". but if someone has that many issues that dont know about they really shouldnt be on the csm to begin with.as for the abstain issue - we had the debate in csm1 and it was just tricky. should an absolute majority vote be needed for an issue to pass, or only a relative majority (so do you need 5 explicity yes votes, or just more yes than no). with the former, people argue 'abstain' is just a fancy-dressed 'no', while in the latter an issue may end up being presented to ccp with only 3 supporters, and the rest of the council not supporting it and/or not caring for it - hardly proper csm support."

"... so no one is up for more diversity in modules/ship types..."
"would be awesome. especially as most ships are fixed with very similar fittings due to pg/cpu issues or slots are already used by must have modules."
"uhm ... and you balance that how?we have tons of ships/modules already which need to be somewhat balanced to each other."
"balance for for the waek and feeble. besides, when you say balanced, what excactly do you mean? what is, in your opinion, balanced in eve? a bs costs ~100mil, a frig costs ~500k, a frig can kill a bs. that's balanced how excactly?more stuff and option and variation ads flavor, and it's cool. join the cool club, and support this topic!"
"variety can also act as it's own balancing- the more modules and ships there are- the more viable fits to perform the same task with varying pros and cons. this creates it's own balancing effect of giving you more options to pick where your ship is weak and strong. ie: common tradeoff- you have a badass active tank but low cap- but can fit a nos- but lose some dps to do so.by expanding variety we just expand the many tradeoffs you can make- possibly helping many \"unbalanced\" ships or modules now by making them more viable or useful."
"more modules and more ships doesnt exactly mean better.and we will already get new stuff. from the fanfest presentation:1. t3 frigate2. t3 modulesenough new stuff imho"
"im sure all of us are looking forward to more t3 goodies- but overall i think my point is, eve as a whole will benefit. first, overall diversity has an effect on everyone from the newest to the oldest player, t3 does not. whether it be as an issue of player choice, or purely for balancing benefits, diversity helps everyone. when it comes to the rl marketing of eve- complexity and variety of options, ships, modules, and career paths seems to be one of eve's biggest draws. when it comes to pve or pvp players- more choices and substitutes in the market mean more new ways to increase your stats, at a lower cost, due to more substitute goods. traders get a more competitive market because more substitute goods means a shift towards a perfectly competitive system. overall, it becomes a better game for everyone the more useful stuff you have. i agree useless mods or ships would not be helpful- but i really think ccp is much smarter than that- and could easily diversify the choices and provide viable new stat tradeoffs, enhancing the game for us all."
"solutionthe basic mechanic that needs to be modified is the docking timer, which prevents performing those actions within a minute after the last aggressive act was committed. a common suggestion has been to simply increase the docking time, but that is a bad solution for two reasons. first, unless the timer is fairly long, it doesn't address the issue of capital ship docking games, especially the lowsec version, where the capital ship has plenty of time to de-aggro and dock. second, the longer the time is, the more irritating it will be to legitimate attempts to dock, for example after a fight is finished.here is a better solution:that third bullet point represents the change in a nutshell. let me clarify that point:currently, the timer to enter the station resets itself each time you attack, and only runs down if you abstain from attacking for the duration of the timer. so if you stop attacking for a short time, you can re-enter the station regardless of what your opponents do. what i'm suggesting is that the station timer be reset any time you fire or any time someone fires on you, so long as you have an aggression flag active to them.this means that if you leave a station and see a camp there, you can still dock again so long as you hold your fire. but once you return fire, you are committing yourself to the fight, and the station will not shelter you if you fare poorly. if this happens, you still have the option to flee away from the station (assuming you aren't scrambled or can outrun your pursuers), and if you can avoid combat until the docking timer runs down, you can return to the station and dock. it also means that as long as you are flagged (aggression flag, not the docking timer), you will regain the full docking timer if anyone you are flagged to fires on you. it also means that if you hold fire long enough for your aggression flag to expire, you are free to dock even if you are attacked again on the way.in short, this is not an nerf, it simply plugs a hole in the game system to prevent exploiting a technicality to engage in fights with zero risk.constructive criticism or other comments are welcome.edit: i've been convinced that the mechanics i proposed should apply only to docking timers, therefore i've edited out the references to gate timers. unlike stations, ships can be engaged on the other side of gates, and therefor gates don't offer the same exploit potential. the one exception to this is gates between highsec and nullsec systems, allowing non-wt combatants to de-aggress and flee to the safety of highsec. in such cases, the 15 minute aggression flag should probably be retained to allow the other side to continue the fight in highsec, but that would be the subject of a different proposal."
"after reading all the failed attempts at changing the mechanic, i am very impressed by the proposal. it's balanced to not favor those who want to exploit the mechanic, but to at least provide some way to redock if you undock into a station camp.that being said, this should be extended to jumping as well. it's not as bad as station games, but playing ping-pong with wts isn't exactly a fun time...supported.edit: now with more thumbs!"
"an end to docking games indeed. wanabee pirates beware!"
"ccp would be idiots to let dominion roll out with the current system in place. with your proposed ideas, we could have a fair and eloquent solution, which does not favor any one side."
"docking games are terrible the op is right, it will only get worse with dominion. please listen to this idea ccp"
"supported. docking games blow. so does neutral remtoe repping, but i see that that would be added to the list of aggro items wich would help the problem at least a little."
"i've seen several \"solutions\" to docking games, but this one is one of the better and more balanced ones i've seen."
"supported."
"excellent."
"op makes much sense. why would station docking personnel risk letting somebody dock when there's shells flying at them?"
"this is worth logging in for to say +1"
"the only thing i don't like is that sometimes you will land 800-1300 meters off a station, so you have to approach it before being able to dock and a frigate (especially an inty) could easily agress you, thus preventing you to dock."
"how will this not just turn the docking games currently into an overused (and abused) agro with a tank and just have everyone blob in from next door.i also think making logistics actions aggressive with have much farther sweeping (role killing) changes than just docking games."
"note that while i use the term 'docking games' frequently, the modified timer mechanics i suggested deliberately apply to gate travel as well as docking.this is definitely not a nerf to piracy. in fact, for the most part, it has no impact on the usual pirate tactics, except those that involve exploiting gates or stations to attack superior forces in safety. in fact, enterprising pirates (and non-pirate pvpers) might take note that baiting becomes more dangerous under this system (the bait ship can't escape if it engages), but also become more powerful, as well (the target can't either, once it engages).i should rephrase that. it becomes harder to escape. interceptors and other particularly fast ships, for example, could burn away and evade until the timer expired, allowing them to escape, which is fine. certain forms of ew might become useful in breaking away from combat. stabs would still behave as normal. in general, combat at gates and stations would become the same as combat at belts."
"not at all. if you have no aggression flag, you never get a timer in the first place. you only get a timer (and an aggression flag) if you make an aggressive act, and you timer is only reset if you attack or are attacked while you still are flagged.in the example you gave, you could sit outside the station as long as you wanted, and so long as you don't aggress, you may dock freely.the point of this change is not to give free ganks against unsuspecting people, it's to make the decision to engage a commitment.i'm not really sure how to respond to this. yes, it's absolutely true. but keep in mind that the mechanic is only initially triggered against a pilot by that pilot's act of aggression. until he attacks, he may redock at will. if he chooses to attack without proper intel, then he may have to deal with the consequences, but how is this different from almost every other aspect of eve?i believe that logistics actions already generates an aggression flag, allowing those hostile to the ship you're assisting to attack you, as well. (note that this is an aggression flag, not a criminal flag.)so yes, this would also address the issue of 'neutral' logistics/rr assisting wts and using docking games as a means to eliminate the risk of doing so. they can still do so, but are making a decision to commit to the battle when doing so."
"this is the cleanest solution to docking games i've ever seen. i love it."
"i like the solution... thumbs up from me...ambushes might take a different tone for empire wars, low sec fights, and even 0.0 station defenses... and anything to get better fights is a major thumbs up here!edit: this may also mean guardians won't have to circle gates during rr-gangs, which is a major plus as they won't be able to use stargates as a get-out-of-death-free mechanism.edit: please dev's take notice that remote repping here is a major concern, and should be an agro mechanic."
"i for one dont wish to see the carrier blobs of dominion under the current mechanic"
"no.cleanest solution would be to remove docking timers entirely."
"hell yeah, good idea."
"logging in to say that becq makes sense. listen to the man ccp!"
"big +1 time to get rid of some of this silly risk free pvp."
"so long as rr is included, i see no reason why this shouldn't be implemented immediately, especially with dominion less than two weeks away. supported."
"i am in favor of this proposal."
"sounds good. i only see one problem.a player can exploit the aggression timer to hold the target indefinably.pilot a unlocks and engages pilot b. pilot a can not kill pilot b. pilot b keeps a point on pilot a so he can not dock. pilot a is stuck sitting on station till downtime. it's a simple example but you could extrapolate a number of other ways to exploit the mechanic.a way to fix this issue is to have an extended deaggression timer. so pilot a in the example above stops attacking and say 10 minutes later he can redock. if pilot b can not kill a within 10 minutes he never will. you can also add time to the docking timers based on ship size."
"i hate the docking game, it makes empire combat so dull - supported"
"sold.i definitely support this proposal, and look forward to seeing the truly talented pilots rise to the opportunity."
"worst-case, you always have the ability to self-destruct and get away, or log off and have your ship disappear after 15 minutes. still, i think that's a reasonable amendment."
"actually, i think that this issue is already handled. the station/gate timer will renew with each new aggression by or against the pilot, so long as there is an aggression flag. the aggression flag, however, is unchanged, and will therefore only renew with each actual aggression by the pilot. so in the situation you describe, the pilot could wait out the fifteen minute aggression flag. once he is no longer flagged, the station/undock timer no longer resets, which means he'll be able to redock a minute later.so in the case of the situation you describe, pilot a can simply drop aggro and wait 16 minutes. if neither side manages to destroy the other or call in reinforcements to help during that time, the the fight deserves to end. in an analogous case where player b can kill player a at any time but is drawing out the process, player a is free to give in to the inevitable and self-destruct to speed the process (as suggested above).oh, and if one player in the above situation logs off or loses connection, then they'd stay in space for the 15 minutes then emergency-warp as normal. so technically you could shave off a minute via loggoffski, but i think that the 15 minute timer is generous enough that this isn't really a serious issue."
"simple and elegant, i hope the code can be equally well implemented."
"i think this is a good idea, i would however like to see changes to docking radius as well.some stations are ok, but some stations have docking radius that is way to large!!"
"gets my vote."
"i and my other account both support this. good heavens, an end to having an aggressive force that you outnumber and can outfight but can't actually do anything about because they're sitting up a station's undock chute? please yes. this isn't even looking at the sov-related issues brought up by the op, just the masses of groups who use this as a substitute for ability."
"supported.let docking games die!"
"supported!"
"a simple solution to something that is very broken."
"very much in favor of this proposal by becq."
"very nice"
"this is a nice simple solution. good idea and thumbs up"
"what about the size of the ship determine how long it takes to dock? i.e. interceptor 20 seconds to re-dock after last aggression and say a dread being like 2 minutes.the bigger the boat the longer it takes to negotiate a dock right?i mean i really hate docking games as much as the next guy but then with said proposal it would be people just baiting ships on a station to agress and once they do they are boned because the ship that caused them to agress is a bait super tank and they are screwed and local spikes for the gank or a ceptor tackles you after you shoot him and your there for the 10-20 minutes till a gank squad x's up and travels the 20+ jumps to kill you. again, the docking games need to be fixed but perma-aggression no matter what you do seems a bit too far on the scale of balance."

"well i would sign this aswell but theres one issue which bothers me.1. im a freighter pilot undocking from a station. i suddenly find 20 guys warping to the station. as i undock i pass one of their battleships which activates a smartbomb and hits me.2. im a lone pilot in lowsec in warp from a gate to a station. inbetween sits a pirate with a smartbomb rokh and his mates. he smartbombs me while im deaccelerating from warp into docking range...in both cases im royaly buttered as i cant dock due to new aggrotimer.i must say the redocking thing is annyoing if you want people to comit to the fight. the only argument speaking against this idea is that you loose the ability to safe your ship if you dont intend to fight in the first place."
"in both cases you've not aggressed so you can jump / dock as normal. re-read the proposal, it covers this :)+1 support from me. i do think that perhaps its a bit too harsh on gates but by and large i support it and it fits with the htfu mentality :)"

"an elegant and simple solution to a horrible problem. i'd like to point out that docking games aren't only played by pirates, but really by any side of a war that considers itself \"outnumbered\". this gives them the ability to believe they are, in fact, very skilled, because they are staying in space, while still being outnumbered.how many times have i seen someone brag \"you are x people against just me but you won't even engage\" at a station's undock chute in a maelstrom ? docking games are even worse with the usage of neutral reppers, especially in high sec. instead of it being the already complicated matter of \"we need the dps to kill that battleship before it deagresses and redocks\", which usually is more than 3 battleships at point blank, it becomes: we need an incredible number of battleships to cancel this neutral battleships's repair. there is no point at shooting the neutral repper, since he's going to dock when you make him go into half armor, and then he'll have done a better job at removing dps from the primary than by repairing. and massive eccm keeps it from being jammed easily.by the way, i believe the op did not mention anything about gate games, which is very correct: gate games are more a matter of skills and organization and having the right ships, so they don't need to be changed."

"you should make that applicable for all stations you don't own- your own station should accept you no matter what- just makes sense. but- to solve the problem just put a global countdown on station repair- and a time. meaning if you do it, it takes the time- 45 sec lets say, and you cant do it again for x minutes (10, 15?) allows normal everyday repair to act fine- no issue- and even the realistic mechanic of hiding in your own station, but not insta-repair silliness.edit: spelling"
"great idea, supported, also how about making the docking areas of a station external so that you can just target and shoot people when they're trading/inventing/manufacturing or any other non combat things"
"thats the case because not only is a shield resist bonus pretty good, it's congruent with the nature of the race.im i the only one who thinks a 7 low slot tempest with 7 turrets and a single damage bonus would be a bad idea (if we care about diversity). sure, it's projectiles, it's practically a the macherial (but with 25% less damage :o) but then again... another 7 low slot battleship?? one of the problems with shield tanking is that so few ships are designed for it. this combined with the fact that armour tanking is firstly incompatible with projectiles and it has poor synergy with speed and agility. it's for this reason most forget that the tempest is actually already faster than some battlecruisers and the typhoon faster still.as for the maelstrom...your condemning minmatar mission runners and everyone who valued the maelstroms active shield tanking potential to a ship that barely tanks and ganks more than a raven, in a tier of battleships ships with specialised tanking bonuses. i mean, if you do believe that the dev team are unlikely to make a 7 mid slot minmatar battleship due to the dogmatic approaches they take with ship design, then you may need to rethink your slots and bonuses on that ship a little."
"i'm not hugely wedded to any specific idea including mine, at the moment, so i'm not going to bother defending the examples i gave.however, the point i obviously failed to make with you is that i want to take the approach of working out what roles they can do first, then proposing changes to the hulls that would let them excel in that role. it's the common denominator all of the most successful battleships have, and something that none of the tempest / maelstrom changes i've seen have managed to capture."
"wait a minute - you don't understand what a stacking nerf is, but my post is stupidity? you're trading a 37.5% bonus for a 36%*0.57 = 20.5% bonus and calling it identical. that's a difference of 193 dps tanked(assuming overheating, a dc ii, and no tank rigs), which last i checked is a fair bit. and the reason you waste an active tank bonus on a fleet sniper is that the tempest can't hack it. give it a seventh turret so it isn't wasting a bonus just to get up to the dps of an 8-turret ship, and maybe mess with some of its other stats, like targeting range, and there'd be no need to make the mael the fleet sniper in the first place. but of course, this is all a moot point. you fail at eve ship design 101, and you're busy scurrying to solve exactly the wrong problem. the problem isn't that the ships have too many bonuses(because they don't, they have exactly the same number as everyone else's), it's that the ships are incoherent lumps of stats instead of clearly envisioned ships with roles. the ones that aren't - the maelstrom, sleipnir, vagabond, rapier, and wolf come to mind - are great ships. ccp just seems to think that minmatar should be \"versatile\", and that 4/4 highs on the typhoon is versatility. that's the problem with minmatar, not that they occupy the same design space that the other three races inhabit comfortably."
"what i was trying to illustrate that it isn't just that easy. unlike every other race, you just can't get 10 minmatar pilots to agree on what one ship would do. along with this, your trying to second guess the developers by tiptoe'ing over rules or trends that may not matter whilst trampling over others that do, instead of just asking for exactly what you want and leaving the dev's to give you what you need. i am also the last person you need to explain the value of roles and niches to, it's something i tried to adhere to in my last iteration to mixed success, this is a new idea, i want to see what people think, if unsuccessful their will be more.either way in this iteration the tempest and maelstrom all provide distinct roles that avoid not only conflicting with each other, but with ships in other races. maelstrom heavy fleet sniper, close range shield tanker, tempest small gang high alpha hit and run sniper or utility rr. it a 10.4% difference in active tanking abilities. (840 dps 8 slot shield tank vs 938 7 slot tank + boost bonus) on a more realistic fit with a mwd, the stacking penalties are reduced (unless you want to argue that maelstroms are used exclusively in the role of station dock-undocking games?) and with the less slots you devote to active tanking, the better the 7 mid slot ship performs.as for roles, see my first response to the above poster."

"bs making op matar race even more op , most ships have equal or more medium slots as the caldari ones ??? wtf.. if you want to make this ,then make the same with caldari remove stupid resist bonus --> +1 med slot +cpu/pg to be able to fit it +cap to be able to run it , then lower signature , move 1 utility high to another med or low slot , add drones and more pg thats what should be done too"
"they aren't bullets they are projectiles ffs."
"fully supported.oras kinetic bonused ships only gets that bonus for 25% of their ammo types i think ccp should make the same with guns also. like 5% dmg for nuclear/phased plasma ammos except the usually 5% bonus to medium projectile turret damage per level .now this would be similar , if matars want to use out the choosable dmg type of their guns they can still do but without the dmg bonus. especiall with the new changes in projectile ammos.same could be applied for hybrids/lasers but they choose between range/dmg not dmg types.and as others said drones get better speed/range for lower dmg,when you use different types not just lower dmg for altered dmg type.anyway this change would make missile ships able to use out their weapons' advantage of changeable dmg type , which is an intended pros for missiles in the first place."
"minmatar get the bonus to all their guns, but get damage and range and tracking changes for being able to switch damage types.you get no penalty for switching ammo types. no reduced range, no less explosion velocity. you just don't get bonused for that damage type. perfectly balanced, if not overpowered.drones can be easily popped, they are balanced. hybrids and lasers already get penalties for switching ammo. it's the range/damage relationship you talked about. there is nothing wrong with it. they are forced to use the same damage type while missile users can switch."

"there is no denying that out of the ew the most powerful is jamming. several things have been done to try and bring them down in effectiveness with the other ew but at its current state, they are still by far the best ew against targets because the only thing they can do against you is f.o.f missiles, smart bombs or drones if they were able to put them on you before you jammed them.i guess the fact that ecm can turn any player no matter how old or experienced into a one week old noob with very little effort. all the other ew a player can still do things even though it be at a lesser effectiveness, but they can still do things. get closer, turn on a propulsion device, etc. if your jammed, you are pretty much screwed for 20 seconds and hopefully they don't get another cycle on you.anyways, to my proposal. when you try to lock anything while jammed it says you can't because you ship can only lock zero targets. so that got me to thinking how about if a jam is successful, it takes away a ships number of lockable targets instead of it taking it immediately to zero. in an example:lets say a racial jammer if successful in a jam removes 4 or 5 lockable targets from the enemy ship. so if a rook hits a megathron with one jam then the mega can only lock say 3-4 targets then. gets hit with two then it drops to zero. i am not sure about the numbers but you get the idea.yes this is a nerf but maybe that will bring it down to more in line with the other ew without messing with the other aspects of the success of hitting a jam.so in closing depending on the jammer used, if sucessful on a jam removes a specific number of targets locked on the enemy ship. maybe even if when a jam hits forces the target to unlock everything and then it can only lock a lower amount of targets depending on the ship.flame away."
"great idea, finally a sollution to e-war being so overpowered."
"i hate ecm and how it makes you die without a fight, but i don't think this is the way forward with it."
"no problemo except that you neglected to suggest what nifty secondary e-war will caldari ew ships be getting. long range neuts, webs and warp scamblers are all pretty awesome, so i assume you'll be posting what equally useful ability the caldari ships will be getting to match once their ecm is \"more in line with the other ew\". perhaps some kind of anti-drone ew, which would be consistent with their racial opposition - allow caldari ew ships a module that they can fit to \"steal\" other ships drones, each module allowing them to pre-empt 25mbit of bandwidth."
"leave ecm alone, its fine wear it is and dosent need any more fixes. yes its powerful, and dosent let you do anything, but have you ever had a curse dead cap you while your flying a cap dependant ship? what about a dampener ship cut your targerting range down from 125 km to 20 km? i am feeling pretty nerfed by that but i dont complain when it happens. the counters for ecm are a:dont fly alone most ecm boats have a buffer tank made of wet tissue paper all it takes is 1 or 2 vollys and they go piff, wich means all it takes is one target lock. b: eccm/projected eccm one modual makes a world of difference. c: friend or foe missials (see the thing about paper matchet tank) oh here is another thought, when your buddy gets a lock on that e-war boat assign your drones to assist him. just one guy with eccm can can make a world of difference. if yah get pwned by a falcon or rook, dont complain, type gf and admire a pilot who found a gimic other than lots of big guns that actually works."
"i have to agree with mr. henik. he's covered most of the important points. there is already balance there and ecm is not the end all be all. in a cruiser fight a caracal that limits your targeting range and then forces the engagement range with microwarp drive use can be an unexpected bit of nasty. you have to target in order to start jamming in the first place. modules cannot counter target painting, etc. i tend to carry eccm modules as standard equipment on test matches and often feel like a fool when my opponent doesn't use ecm at all, but when they do it's worth it. everything in new eden is a cat and mouse game, the trick is just making sure you're the cat."

"because you have not yet properly identified the problem. the problem is determining whether the player is afk or not. if it is an absolute truth that the cloaker is afk then he is not a threat. i thought i had made myself clear on this :). if he is not afk he is a threat. the problem is determining whether the cloaker is afk or actually playing the game.consider the following.a mission runner at his pc makes 50 million in 5 hours. one day he decides to create a macro and instead of being at the pc for the whole 5 hours decides to go afk while still making his 50 million.is it fair he's away from the game and still able to meet his goal? after all, he would have still made the 50 million isk if he hadn't created the macro. why is it important he be at the keys to make his isk? if you're honest in answering these questions then you'll understand why afk play is against the spirit of eve :).if your goal as an afk cloaker is to degrade the system's security (and face it, you know it is ;)) what is wrong with requiring you to be at the keyboard to accomplish this goal?"
"omg stop whining. empire is that way ->"
"yet another thread that shows why w-space style local is better... afk cloakers have zero impact on w-space operations. do people spend large amounts of time cloaked (afk and at the keyboard) in wormholes? yes. do other people stop doing what they would be doing because thier might be a cloaker. no. fix local. problem solved."
"nope. you went on a rant. i responded in kind. i drew a line between what you are suggesting to what is currently in practice. afk is afk. your arguements are shifitng to justify your sandy clam whine."
"on the same note but a different stance to get rid of the afk cloakers my idea involves simply that the cloak uses 101% of your cap recharge rateso if you go afk then after say 10mins your cloak will disarm because you have no cap, but the 101% cap usage rate is 101% of anything, so if you happen to use a cap booster 800 then next cycle it will take 808 cap away..the only way for the cloak not to use cap will be if your in warp speed... so even orbating objects uses the cloak cap rate... whereas whilst in warp you regen cap at normal warp rate... this is how i would work the afk cloakers..."
"another solution looking for a problem. first find a problem. than you might try to apply your solution to it."
"people, i don't think you understand why afk cloaking is a problem. it's not the little minus sign in local or the fact a hostile is in your space. no, those are very common phenomenon in 0.0 space and they don't bother me a bit.the thing that does bother me is that someone can come to my space and decide when, where, who and how he will attack. there is absolutely nothing you can do about it.it's not what they can do while cloaked, it's what they can do when they're not edit: let me clarify, as a ratter you shouldn't care about a solo vagabond or a bomber, both can be fended off with a decent setup and/or a friend. however, afk cloakers and especially bombers are mostly only after miners because they know miners can't survive 2 bombs. there is a counter for all ships except bombers."
"oh please... grow a damn backbone.the same could be said for a covert ops/black ops/stealth bomber death squad.cloak or no cloak.. anyone can go anywhere and do anything they want... the cloak just makes it harder to find them.afk cloaking is only a problem when you make it one... either you man up and deal with it in such a way that you don't shrink in terror... or you ignore it to the point where you deal with security breeches like you would normally deal with them in 0.0 or whs or low sec for that matter.for crying out loud... you people must live paranoid lives or something.eve is eve.... it's not supposed to be easy or pleasant.... its supposed to be challenging... this argument has been beaten with a bloody stick and has been shot down each and every time.why people think there's going to be a change is even beyond my abilities to rationalize.wrong again... bombers are glass cannons... you target one... he can't cloak... then shoot them. the only thing you have to fear is when you decide to fly in a straight line... if you do.. expect a bomb thrown in your face...otherwise your ok for the most part.don't mine solo...don't fly/roam solo... work in teams...."
"and what makes you think bombers will hang around long enough for you to lock and shoot them? if you align to a planet or moon you can decloak, attack and warp away with 2 to 3 seconds, i've seen it plenty of times.working together, yeah right. how exactly will stacking 10 miners together help fight bombers when one bomb can kill all 10 of them at the same time?"
"ever tried sling bubbles on the belt. so bombers get sucked into it on warp in. that might give your miners time to warp out."
"ok i have highlighted my issue... i do agree with what you say in 'princaple' however you say it sholdnt be easy or pleasent, and yet a guy can come into a system at 1130 (or whatever time the server comes up) cloak and stay there until 10.59 the following day. now unless im mistaken this is a very easy way to cause havoc/agro or even play the game as it wasn't meant to be played... my personal issue isn't with sb/cov ops or black ops, its with people that use the cloaks on any ship and sit their cloaked up for hours... you assume that everyone who afk cloaks is a sb... i have many times found myself in this situation when a bs/bs warps to me and guess what he had cloaked for hours in that system without me being able to probe him down ot his cloak deactivating... (and yes im a pvper) how many hulks would it take to shoot a bs down?another counter measure against cloakers is how about an ability that allows the scanning of faint traces of 'spatial disruption' that will with the right skills (and talking max level scanning or new skill) so this way there is the ablity to find the cloakers... obviosly if they are not afk then they will simply warped claoked and not be found...in this game and its mechanics there is always a action/reaction scenario all ships etc have their nemesis on the battlefield and yet people who cloak have complete immunity from being found...this isn't right/fair/*put in your expletives here*the work in teams scenario is great in theory but not all of us are in large alliances/corps or are you suggesting that unless your in one or other you should be?"
"i and a fleet of ten other stealth bombers sit 50km from a gate for several minutes. a scout comes through and we place our hands on our f1 and f2 keys. an entire fleet comes through, thinking the system is empty because we have all disappeared from local, and we uncloak and fire our bombs and then pelt the people that are still alive with torps.this is a stupid idea. if somebody is logged into a system, they shall appear in local chat, afk or not."
"oh no.there is someone in my local who is not blue and who might not be afk. quickly, i must dock up and do nothing until he goes away.that summary has nothing to do with why people want afk cloaking mechanics changed, being afk while logged into the game is a completely different ballpark to creating a macro to make isk.a cloaker comes into \"your\" system, cloaks and goes afk. he's not making isk, he's not mining, ratting, running missions... anything. he's afk. he's gaining no advantage over any other person in eve. he's doing nothing wrong. he's causing no problem.people want it changing because there's someone in their local who isn't blue and they're too scared to undock and run a mission or play the game in case they get probed down and lose a ship.effectively, the people who want it changing are pretty spineless and want it changed because they're too scared to undock if there's a hint of risk involved. there's no sense to it at all. someone who's afk in space is not a problem, neither is someone who's sat actively probing for mission runners.the problem isn't the cloaking mechanic, it's working as intended. the problem is that people are too spineless to undock when there's someone who's not part of their napfest in local and they don't know where in space he is."
"verone, you asked a question. i answered it. you now lock caps and put words and my mouth why?the cloaker is accomplishing something. otherwise why is parking a cloaked ship in hostile territory even done? afk cloaking serves a purpose. you don't have to admit it to me. but you know it :). it will do no one any good arguing about it.if nothing is being accomplished then why do it? if the cloaker is afk why not just log off? and the honest answer is because it is an effective way to run down the security of a system. stay afk cloaked long enough and the system will eventually lower its security alert to normal. and the problem i have with this is one side has to work hard to maintain the status quo. the other side can literally fall asleep and just wait for the other side to eventually wear down.listen, don't get upset at me because i'm telling it how it is. you know it. i know it. i would have more respect for you if you at the very least admitted this is psychological warfare. and it is a perfectly legal tactic. i take issue with the fact you can do this even while sleeping or at school (ie, not playing the game). that is my problem with this tactic. anyway, you can pretend like you really don't understand what the issue here is :).i can't speak for everyone else, but the umpteenth time, i want it changed so that if you're afk (ie, not playing the game) you're unable to influence the security of a system.again, i can't speak for everyone else. but i can tell you that in my case it has nothing to do with spine or with me being scared. so you can stop it right there with the \"you're too skerred or chicken\" childish nonsense. i'm talking about a player being afk virtually 24/7. name-calling won't change the facts.again, it has nothing to do with spines or napfests. if you want to cloak yourself for 23 hours per day i am not asking to have this nerfed. i am asking that you be in front of your pc. stop degrading the problem into something that isn't.so, again, before you throw it out there again. what i am asking for is if you're going to afk-cloak for 23 hours per day then be prepared to be in front of the pc for 23 hours per day."
"the afk cloaker is influencing nothing but the people who're staying docked. he's doing no harm to anyone at all in the system, and gaining no benefit or advantage over any other player at all for being cloaked, doing nothing, in any system.the basic fact of the matter is that the people docked have no control over this individual's actions and can't make him go away, and they don't like it.whether he's at the computer or not is irrelevant, people want this changed because they want to feel safe in their claimed space, nothing more. if he's not at the computer then he's not playing the game and is no threat, if he is, then he's playing and is an active threat.what people are annoyed about is not being able to distinguish between people being afk and people playing. why should you have the ability to do so?there is no rule against someone being logged into the game and being afk as long as they're not profiting from it by making isk or using any form of automation to get ahead of any other player. people cloaked afk in a system are gaining no advantage.it's the people who're in the system's choice to undock and take the risk, or not.these people are committing no crime by being logged in, and the mechanic needs no modification."
"all the goon tears that i've tasted lately have been delicious! i am sure this will bring even more, and thus i am in favor of this suggestion."
"mr. sun, i'm having a difficult time seeing your complaint about the maelstrom. whilst i admit i am completely unskilled in matar ships and in artillery the maelstrom immediately reminded me of the raven, if the raven used guns. the slot layout matches, armor, shield and capacitor are similar. the raven has slightly more cpu but the maelstrom has an amazing power output by comparison. the only reason most shield tank in a raven is because they wish to retain low power slots for ballistic computers. ravens can armor tank very well but unless you're in a fleet you've little use for so many free mid slots. i could easily envision a well armor tanked maelstrom with plenty of gun assist modules doing nearly the ravens job. so far as cross training... one does not simply \"hop into\" a raven skill wise. if you expect to get anywhere you'll need a great number of missile skills, medium rail and supporting skills don't hurt for smaller targets, and you'll need an exceptional level of capacitor and shield skill to be capacitor stable and still have enough boost to survive. i've run the numbers though. there are differences between shield tanking and armor tanking in terms of final output ( time, hp to power ratios, etc ) but they can be made very similar with the proper rigs and modules. i won't bore you with a detailed comparison of shield tanked ravens swapping out three capacitor control circuits for armor repair rigs but i assure you it works fine. i'm just not seeing your complaint."

"not suppoted this would mmount to a massive nerf to caladari and relegate them to status of ecm only. defenders are already deacent, i use them as a life extedner on my e-war boats all the time. a single rocket pod can negate a ton of incoming damage i use one on my ferox and moa(though admitadly i havent flown either in forever."
"just a drive-by: in my opinion, the only reasonable fix for defender missiles is to make them toggles (like hardeners) instead of activated items (like weapons). you should be able to turn them on, then have them automatically attempt to shoot down missiles that get launched at you, instead of having to activate them after being attacked.i'd like to say they should be able to be used against missiles targeted at a member of your gang (rather than only those targeted at you), but i think that this might be hugely overpowered in large fleet combat."
"cva already has something like that...those are dead easy to work with...every time you limit something, people find ways around it. alt alliances, alt corporations, alts for market orders or for r&d slots, etc etc etc. build a wall, and the people will build a latter. build a bigger wall, people will build a longer latter. get it yet?"

"i second that!i find it a bit amusing that we have been down this road before during the last elections: all those who keep trying to undermine take care representatives, often pointing out ankhe as the \"evil-mastermind -carebear\" out to destroy their game, don't seem to understand how the csm-ccp interaction actually works and what kind of qualities and experience makes a good csm candidate. (after all, we had a chance to observe it for the last 3 terms, its time to step out from that narrow and stuffy cave and look at the big picture...)obviously each candidate has some unique experience he/she can bring to the table. however, after elected, csm in order to successfully influence ccp must try to work as a whole, trying to find common ground. z0d doesn't have to be an expert in every field of the game. he knows his stuff very well, he is a respected leader among those who know him personally, and he shares the open minded approach of his predecessors - a perfect recipe for a solid csm candidate."

"i would be interested in what you plan to do for low sec because it does seem to be criminally under utilised space.being part of a smallish corp that is too young to have capitals we are pretty much barred from 0.0 unless we break up our own corp so we've been driven to worm holes and low sec. my experience of low sec is that you can go looking through an entire region and find only worthless drone anomalies.infact it's so empty that's there's no way to even bait yourself a bit of pvp because no trap is ever going to be believable there's lots of talk about how much null is going to get buffed but nothing that shows how this will be of use to corps who can't join in."
"giving unique resources or rewards in lowsec would be a good start to tempt people out of empire. the new navy battleships (only available from factional warfare stores) being an example of this.one of my platforms is risk vs reward and so far the increased risk in lowsec has yet to result in better rewards. if there are cool things to find, stuff to shoot and a reason to risk pirates and pvpers then everybody gains (including the pirates and pvpers ).i'd love to say i have all the answers, but i don't and that is where you and others can help if you want to live in npc 0.0 then you can survive without capitals. though they are handy for logistics there are other ways. if you restrict your activity to npc 0.0 with fast moving raids into sov 0.0 then there are still fights to be had, but you have to keep looking out for and avoiding the mega blobs...wormholes are great but can be tricky to live in, especially for more casual corps. they can yield great profit and when t3 frigs roll round i hope that temps more people to try w-space. we regularly head into wormholes to earn money and get pvp kills in equal amounts.a buff to exploration in lowsec might help out some especially if there are some unique drops from complexes, anomalies and the like. there are some nice features of lowsec that need to be built upon but it must not be seen purely as a stepping stone to 0.0. it needs to be worthwhile in its own right. to help with piracy and the like it would be nice to revisit the global criminal countdown. of course it would be even more awesome to use some of the new sov mechanics (activity indexes) to implement the corruption system discussed in vegas. this is similar to large areas of 0.0 too. hopefully this will change...it does look like the 0.0 changes are aimed at medium to large alliances and there is still not much to tempt corps and smaller alliances deeper into 0.0. yes you could become \"pets\" of a larger alliance, but that means all the political stuff and blue lists. the physical size of the infrastructure hub needed to improve space means alliances without titan bridge access are going to have to escort a freighter through 0.0 - a fairly large barrier to entry.i'd like to see that at least fit into a jump freighter, which is within the reach of a smaller alliance.then there are the hitpoints on the sov structures which will likely cause capital blobs on a scale not before seen in eve tl:drbuffing lowsec to contain unique rewards would hopefully tempt more people out of empire, increasing the population and thus giving more chances for pvp as well as chances for profit."

"i would like to strengthen market pvp. one major issue since launch have been the factor that you really only have two valves to adjust on when it comes to the competitiveness of your product: price & availability. (how cheap can you make it and where do you sell it.)as things stand now the most complex factor is price, and there is a lot you can do to affect that, but in the end it is about optimization of the process, not the product itself.what i would like to see is the possibility to differentiate your product, from other products. this is of course a complex issue. how do you make an effective market system for finding and comparing products when they can suddenly be a lot more different than today? how will this affect large volume traders etc.?its a scary process to start and change what is the very core of eves market and economical system, but i believe it needs to be done eventually. if you consider ships pvp, a lot of new aspects have been added to the actual game play over time, adding complexity to the individual battles that just were not there to begin with. in the mean time market and industry game play have stayed largely the same. sure the material chains have become a lot more complex, but once the actual end product has been created, your product is the same as everyone elses, and the end consumer has no reason to take your product over the competitions, besides price and where you choose to sell it. price & availability.i have played around with ideas of my own for some time on this subject, but really i am not here to sell my own ideas, and presenting them here in their current form would just turn this thread into an ideas discussion, which it is really not."

"i have three suggestions for improving the star map (that is, the map of all solar systems in known-space):(1) in unflattened mode, allow the camera to zoom in on a target much closer than it currently allows.if i target aldrat on the star map and zoom in at maximum, the camera is still far enough away from aldrat that other systems that aren't in the vicinity of aldrat are right in my face. for example: otsela, colelie, avenod, or eoa-zc, depending upon which direction i'm looking at aldrat from. the camera should be allowed to get in one-quarter the current distance. i imagine that this will only require a parameter change.(2) there should be an option to *not* select a system on mouseover, only on click.right now, if i select an entire constellation or region and use left-click-and-drag to rotate the map to study it's jump lines, then as soon as my mouse cursor hovers over any solar system, then the game removes the highlight from the constellation or region i selected, even while i'm doing a click-and-drag to rotate the view. this makes it very hard to study stargate connectivity. (i know there are flat pdfs available for various regions, but i haven't been able to get the hang of using these, particularly because they are flat. if ccp were to implement this, then it would be much easier to study stargate connections right on the in-game 3d map.)(3) [this may actually be a bug fix request instead of a suggestion.] releasing the mouse button on top of a solar system should not select that solar system unless the mouse button was pressed on top of that solar system to begin with.right now, if i start a left-click-and-drag on empty space to rotate the map, and i just so happen to release the mouse when the mouse is over another solar system, then the game interprets that as a click on the solar system. if \"auto frame selection\" happens to be on, this results in an unexpected recentering.thank you for your time and consideration.[edit - 2009.11.26, 05:08 eve time] zorvoz in post #7 made some good suggestions. i think i understand what he's getting at, and have elaborated on his ideas in my post #15."

"ability to not select hasn't been an issue for me, but i can certainly see it as an improvementbut a very big yes on being able to zoom much much closer....maybe also having a fully spherical range of angle drag (instead of the \"wall\" at top-down or bottom-up)"
"yes please.also, please please please fix the \"actual color\" setting for coloring the stars -- the colors have been washed-out with white since apocrypha, and it looks ugly -- you can barely tell the difference between the colors anymore. reds and blues used to be distinct and easily differentiable... they both just look... white now."
"here's an additional proposal, take it or leave it, just an idea.have an entirely different interface, but keep the star map how it is. i'd like to see some sort of drop down menu system or a selection system that allows to show/hide low sec and 0.0. also, have the constellations in a drop-down or something similar to how the contracts is setup with specifying the types. faction space and such, something a little bit more specific that will show only the region/area that you want it to show, making it a little bit easier to find agents that high sec runners want to use. this way, when you have something selected in your drop-down, such as only showing caldari space, the map hides the entire other bit of the map and zooms into the caldari space and fills the screen.just a thought."
"oh yes, i remember suffering from some of these."

"docking games are poo - so most definitely yes.the only thing i'd suggest adding (because from an immersion standpoint it's very cool) is that docking timers and the like from stations should be affected by the pilot's standing with the station owner and (in high sec and in some low sec stations) by sec status.it makes sense that the caldari navy are going to cut some slack to the guy with the +9.5 standing with them and try and let him in faster if they can. he's a staunch ally after all.concord or the spacelane patrol should probably think twice, even in low sec, from allowing some notorious -10 sec status pirate to dock."

"your solution does not fix the scenario you were complaining about in your original post.carriers repping a titan would not get an docking timer to start with so shooting the carrier would not extend timers in those cases.a better solution would be for rr to get a docking timer ( 60 secs ) as aggression currently does.your solution is very bad, for reason some have pointed out.once you fire on someone , if they have a scrambler you wont be able to leave ever.your stuck there until downtime or until they run out of ammo if they dont have the dps to kill you or you kill them."
"supported, nothing more boring than docking games tbh."
"awesome proposal. i wish i had more than 2 thumbs !"
"this question was brought up, previously. the timer resets for as long as you have an aggression flag. once the aggression flag drops (15 minutes) the docking timer no longer resets. which means that 16 minutes after your last shot, you will be able to redock. alternatively, you can logoffski and your emergency warp will occur 15 minutes after your last shot, shaving off and entire minute! regarding remote repair and aggression, it's possible i'm misunderstanding the current mechanics. i believe that repairing a ship that is aggression flagged (including, for example, a war target in empire space) gives you an aggression flags you against your target's opponents, thus allowing them to, for example, shoot at you for the next 15 minutes without risk of concord.assuming this is true, then my suggestion mechanics will work as follows:1) ships a and b are fighting.2) ship c (otherwise neutral) begins to repair ship b, thus getting an aggression flag with respect to ship a. no timer is current set as no 'real' aggression has been made.3) ship a fires on ship c. since ship c has flagged itself, it's docking timer is reset to 1 minute.4) as long as ship a continues to fire on ship c, the timer will continue to reset, until 15 minutes after the last repair cycle ship c makes.it's been mentioned that ships in nullsec do not get aggression flags. i had thought that they got aggression flags but not criminal flags, and that the aggression flags were irrelevant in nullsec. if the current mechanics don't set an aggression flag in nullsec, then the simple solution might be to change that so that they do."
"simple change, seems easy to implement. going to be desperately needed in the age of docking supercapitals. easily supported."
"currently - when you shoot someone there flag is reset to 15 minutes as well as yours iirc.or i am i thinking of something else /me scratches head.and yeah there are no aggression flags in null. to much calculations for the servers me thinks.realy even 15 minutes if its made to work like that is a bit much to have someone else dictate your own game experience.1 minute should be fine for killin something if you have appropriate fp.its only rr'rs that can insta dock and its only rr'rs that need fixin imho.i have another objection as wellexamplestarbuck -\"galactica this is starbuck, were down to throwing rocks at the bastards, were coming in hot, request clearance for combat landings to the port flight pod\"galactica actual -\"sorry starbuck, you've been engaged in hostile actions against cylons, please wait outside for 15 minutes before we allow you to land.\"ok enough of the bsg analogies.any docking timer should only occur at npc stations.an outpost is a very expensive corporate/alliance asset.as such it should be a position of strength to fight from.an outpost should never refuse docking request from a member of its controlling corporation / alliance, live fire/ rr or whatever that pilot has been doing."
"great idea!"
"can you imagine any means by which a large alliance (one that can field a sizeable capital fleet) could ever lose an outpost system, if the defenders can play capital fleet docking games with 100% free, nearly instant (30 second) repairs? frankly, i see this as a far more important problem than the current docking games. high-sec docking games are boring and annoying. sovereignty docking games will be (in my opinion) game-breaking."
"make blocklists tradable, with export and import functions.you would need the ability to revert to your last ban list or to be able to load an old banlist in the instance that you imported an undesirable banlist. the maximum pilots allowed on a banlist would also need to be increased past the current maximum.*fixed the name of the thread and changed all references from ban to block. :) thx i hadn't noticed.- there is one flaw with this idea and i will be reposting with solutions to make this a viable option for players.-t'amber"

"reiterating points i've made before with respect to this change:it is really unnecessary to reintroduce split weapon bonuses when, if balance was required, reducing the focused turret bonuses could have done the job just as well.minmatar dreadnought pilots from many diverse and opposing alliances supported the original motions calling on the csm to bring this matter up with the content developers. when he finally looked at it, chronotis did an excellent job of taking the original idea for the ship and blending it with player requests for change, creating a compromise that left the ship competitive without overpowering it.the naglfar requires the most training of all of the dreadnoughts. two (three with dominion) capital weapon systems, and (for optimal fitting flexibility) both styles of capital tanking. the tanking flexibility was balanced by not having as many slots to tank with as it's peers (phoenix has 7 mid slots; moros has 7 low slots and revelation has 8 low slots). if training time is not a factor in balancing ships with their peers it should be.additionally, nozh is reinflicting the old problem with split weapon bonuses - that is, it takes two bonuses on the ship to achieve the damage boost that other dreadnoughts do with one, and it takes two damage mods to get the same effect as one. this was debated with chronotis when the previous round of naglfar changes were on the drawing board, and he willingly concede the point.this change appears ill-informed and disrespectful, both of the player base and of nozh's coworkers. it must be reversed."

"as ecm has in recent times seen changes based on the assumption that it was too powerful and been reduced significantly, primarily by way of a range reduction, allow me to first briefly clarify why i believe another nerf to ecm is appropriate.in short, a single well fit ecm boat can realistically jam 3-4 tech 1 ships, with little regard for how well those ships are flown or fitted. as a result, it is very hard to do anything about ecm in low sec in particular, as no lock mean no scramble. while the range nerf to ecm certainly made things more sane, as you can now more easily get into range of the ecm boat, getting into range with a few ships does not even guarantee that the ecm boat is at any severe disadvantage. i have been in combat situations with two to four ships at 10 km from an enemy falcon but unable to even force it to warp out, let alone kill it.in addition to the effect of ecm being very powerful and hard to counter, it makes for very boring fights - in essence most of your highslots and med slots might as well not have been fitted once you get jammed, as you probably wont get a chance to use them for anything for the remainder of the fight.lastly there are some curious details attached to ecm modules themselves, which separate them further from other ewar, namely enabling ships to ultrafocus in using ecm. i am referring to the \"off-race\" jamming chances of racially focused ecm, multi-spectrum ecm and the ecm low slot modules, none of which have equivalents in any of the other ewar and serve to make ecm that much easier to use, and makes it quite easy to set up an ecm boat that is reasonably effective against any ship it could square up against.now, let me assure you that while i think ecm spoils much of the fun there is to be had at the moment, i am not out to destroy it. the two main problems with ecm as a whole right now is that it dumbs down most combat scenarios it is introduced in and that there is no good counter available.my solution is based on the following assumptions:1) ecm boats should be in trouble if too close to hostile ships and without significant support (additional ewar or logistics).2) altering the current ecm mechanic to allow other mechanics already in the game to have more of an impact would be desirable.3) allowing players under jam to have some inbuilt options for counteracting the effect would be desirable.4) a simple solution would be easiest to implement and easiest to foresee the consequences of, and thus be desirable.my proposed solution:this change will not make ecm impotent. it still prevents a good portion of gun/missile dps, ewar and tackle of the target ship while keeping intact its range based defense. however anyone fighting under ecm is now only limited by their own locking time, rather than their locking time and the 20 second jam. thus an ecm boat can no long just hang out near a small number of enemy dps ships without significant backup and permajamming becomes hard to achieve using only ecm, as that would require quite a lot of coordination. permajamming should still be pretty easy to achieve on a few target ships, if you employ a combination of ecm and sensor dampening, which i think is fair for such a powerful effect."

"i am not aware of what the ecm mechanic was like in 2004 - i started playing in 2006. you state that my idea is already in effect and that the 20sec cycle time / 20 sec jam time is reasonable, but you offer no explanation? i'd like a little more to work with here than statements. you linked the ecm burst module, which is not the module i am discussing - that would be the targeted ecm modules. granted, ecm bursts and drones would also be affected but they should be able to work with the same base mechanic. your numbers also seem to be missing some factors - what is the target namely. assuming your numbers are correct and we're talking about a decent combat ship here, you are talking about fitting a single module on a falcon that has a good probability of denying locking for a full engagement for an enemy ship. a falcon is capable of fielding quite a few ecm modules, and racial jammers do have probabilities of jamming off-race ships. additionally the argument that your odds are diminished because you forced your opponent to fit a mid slot specifically to counter ecm is flawed. you've basically forced your opponent to dedicate a med slot on each of their ships to try and negate the effects of ecm and you still have a decent chance of your ecm working. also mind that not all ships have the luxury of that 4th-5th med slot they don't quite know what to do with - the majority of the ships i fly in small scale pvp would perform much worse if i had to dedicate a med slot to eccm and i dare say that would not affect the outcome if i ran into a small gang with a falcon. yes, an arazu or a keres would actually be able to do something in this situation, provided the falcon doesn't jam them first or - god forbid - bounced out and into the fight again. incidentally, it is my impression that sensor dampeners are not good for anything but trying to keep stealth bombers alive these days, so the odds of running into that perfect counter is rather slim."
"stop whining and fit eccm, which you seem to totally forget in your topic. too bad that you can't go all-out damage with tracking comps and the like in your med slots, that's the whole point of ecm. ecm is fine as it is."
"you don't go all out damage with med slots, you go all out damage with low slots. all small gang warfare ships need their med slots for general combat stuff, such as:1) tackling gear (1-2 slots)2) speed mod (0-1 slot)3) capacitor injector (0-1 slot)allow me to illustrate the problem with eccm as it is currently by comparing it to capacitor injectors as a counter for neuts: if you fit a capacitor booster you will be able to keep some modules running for a limited time, given that you're only up against one bonused ship neuting you, or a few unbonused. if you fit an eccm a single falcon with a standard fit is still perfectly capable of keeping you jammed for an entire fight regardless. the module literally make too little a difference in the sole situation it could possibly help to warrant fitting it."
"3 med slots is all i need in small pvp. mwd scram and sebo/eccm.i can agree that eccm needs a boost, but i definitely disagree that ecm needs to be nerfed."
"some ships have room for them, yes. myrm or domi for instance. other ships too take heavy a blow from missing that extra bit if tank or that cap booster injector. let's try to narrow down our disagreement here, shall we?do you agree that a falcon has a good chance for jamming 3-4 tech 1 bc/bs who have not fitted eccm for the majority of a fight? do you also agree that it could do so outside of tackle range (and thus be able to get away should the dice roll come up short)? do you agree that a ship that is jammed has little recourse in a fight, if it is also tackled, since jam is often permanent and there is nothing much to do once you are in that situation?"
"yes, i can agree on all of that. now let's look from the other side:a falcon- virtually no damage output- has no tank- ecm range: already nerfed- drones on it = dead- sniper on it = dead- keep some ships in reserve = deadthere are plenty was to deal with a falcon besides eccm, it just requires some strategy."
"your description of ecm is slanted. if ecm were too powerfull we would see many more ecm boats out there. right now about 1 out of every 5-10 ships is an ecm boat. that is pretty balanced. ecm does not need to be balanced with other e-war. the idea is the races need to be somewhat balanced for pvp. ecm is caldari's best weapon. if you nerf ecm, caldari are just pathetic. ecm pilots have many downsides. you are never top damage dealer not do you ever get a km. we have ecm bursts already and they are almost never used, for good reason. ecm is and should be a powerful weapon in the game. it adds complexity to how you set up your gang instead of just saying lets bring allot of shields and guns. so i vote no."
"a sniper than can go beyond 100 km is rare in low sec pvp, but that might be a viable option yes. i'm pretty sure i don't like needing a sniper in every gang for the sole purpose of countering ecm.you only have a very limited window to get drones on the ecm boat, since if your drones aggro something else and you get perma jammed, you can't get them back on to the ecm boat. even with drones it takes a long time to actually break an untanked boat, if you don't have particularly large drone bays and i have personally had a falcon simply speed tank my ogre ii's while jamming my geddon. ships in reserve works ok if there is only a single ecm boat. you can warp on top of them and thus compromise their situation somewhat. still in all three scenarios there is nothing preventing a well prepared falcon pilot from escaping, so \"dead\" is a quite big overstatement as i see it.i would have no problem with ecm boats getting a bit of tank for this change and the rook has a good bit of damage output actually. oh and of course they can all field a very heavy shield tank, they just usually don't since ecm is all the offense and defense they need. it is true that their range has been looked at and i am not proposing changing that here - i think the range they operate at now is fair.now answer me this: do you agree that the best counter for ecm at current is either ecm of your own or a significant amount of ships on your side?"
"what he said.not supported."
"nope, because of the high sensor strength of recons ecm doesn't work. it's superior tactics that win fights against ecm. a bigger fleet? yes, i mean, the ecm boats use 4-5 jammers, so it's easy to overcome a single one. a brutix with eccm fitted has a magno strength of 35.6, enough window to send a pack of medium drones at it. dead might be an overstatement and so what if it gets away, gone is gone. you just need to rethink your strategy and not try to gank a falcon with 4 battleships. furthermore i completely agree with cearain."
"i think 1/5 of the ships you meet anywhere in eve is quite a lot, when you take into account that they can't really kill a lot of stuff on their own. i also don't agree that ratios says anything about quality - i see a lot of cerbs in pvp, but i still think it is an underpowered ship. i agree that ecm is the sole brightspot caldari have at the moment, but the fix for that should be making missiles viable in pvp, aside from the drake which does fine atm. what you're saying here is that it would be alright if all gallente had was crap ships and the dominix, but the dominix gets 50% to drone dps per level of gallente battleship - you can't take powerlevel over an entire faction of ships is what i am getting at. and yeah you never get top damage but i can't say i see why you wouldn't get any killmails. i don't really see the great drawback to this - all recons, interdictors and logistics have that \"problem\"?ecm should be powerful, yes. as i see it, ecm is capable of settling every small scale fight at the moment, small scale being less than 10 people on each side. the best way to counter it, is bring your own ecm, not fitting eccm. needing to field a bigger fleet to overcome ecm basically means you don't want pvp in groups of less than 10 to be viable, as i see it and that is the effect ecm has atm again as i see it. so i just need to pay that 120 mil for a t2 cruiser that requires a good few mil sp to just fly and then i have a chance? so pvp should not be open to people that haven't played for say, a year then? again, i still think effectively loosing that medium slot in fights against anything else is too much of a disadvantage but i've already made that argument and we apparently just don't agree. about the assigning drones to scare them off not being good enough to kill them, well, what is? if i want to kill any other ship in the game, i have a pretty good idea of how i would do it, but an ecm boat all i have available is ecm or blob. is that really the best solution?also i do take a tactical approach to fighting ecm boats, in fact we discussed it in this very thread a few posts back, so no need to go assume i just ran my head into a wall and came here."
"i don't think its one fifth of ships. i really don't know and admit i have no way to tell. in the fleets i fly in its usually around 1 in 10 is an ecm ship. but i have nothing close to a statistically relevent sample to base that on. but even if it were 1 in 5 consider this: there are only 4 factions and caldari is the biggest faction. the best weapon the largest of 4 factions has is likely to appear allot. so no i don't think that is too many. i would think if gallente were the most popular race we would have 1/5 to 1/10 of the ships being drone boats. heck maybe 1/10 of the ships now in a a gangs are drone boats. ok here there are numerous ecm ships in caldari not just one ship. bb falcon rook scorpion griffin. i mean its clear that ecm is a big part of the caldari lineup. its not just one ship like the dominix. nerfing ecm to caldari is like nerfing drones for gallente or nerfing speed for minmatar. i'm not saying the epeen hit is a great drawback but some people do look and care about that. for those players it is a drawback. your right its a drawback for logistics and other ships as well. but its still a drawback. bring your own ecm. you have to bring your own mix of ships to succeed. yeah eve forces you to strike a balance with tank gank and ewar. it seems you want to be able to have an effective 10 man gang while completely ignoring the best ewar in the game. that can't be done and i hope it never can be done."
"an arazu- virtually no damage output- has no tank- damp range: still waaaay lower than the nerfed ecm range- drones on it = dead- sniper on it = dead- keep some ships in reserve = deadi see some similarities"
"i was using an exaggerated example to prove my point. my point was merely that just because part of your lineup really really sucks, another part does not get to be ludicrously better than anything else in the game. blasters are underpowered atm, but i don't think droneboats should be better because blasterboats are bad. i am going to be a bit cheeky and bold a flatout contradiction in this quote. so, you think it is alright that, in order to get any kind of success in small gang pvp, i need to include a ship from a subset of 5 ships all from the same race in my gangs? how is that \"bringing my own mix\" to any extent, if that one ship determines if i have any chance at all?furthermore, how is having to retarget your target every twenty seconds, loosing tackle and ewar on that target in the process, going to be \"ignored\"?what i am proposing here is not a nerf that makes ecm something you can just ignore - which some of the other ewar is in a lot of situations, mind - but something you can actually do stuff to counter. you got tracking disrupted, you can move closer/negate the opponents speed to react. you get sensor dampened, you move closer or just hope the extra locking time isn't too much of an advantage for the enemy. you get target painted, but that hardly matters most of the time. you get jammed and you sit there waiting to die. you probably wont get your lock again, certainly not if you have no friends that are unjammed or untackled. you can't even direct your drones, and there is probably a ship agressed to you that is close by that can tank those fof missiles just fine. is it so hard to see why i would like there to be something, anything, to do about being jammed, once you are actually jammed?"
"no. they're already called \"lockbreaker bombs.\""
"wow you can use those in lowsec and empire?"
"i think ecm should get a sig radius penalty / tracking penalty.ecm verus big slow ships works well , versus cruisers is moderate and is poor verus frigates.kinda the reverse of damps where range damping is more effective against smaller ships with smaller lock ranges."
"solution to getting jamed, #1 warp out/warp back in #2 find out who can get a lock on that annoying ecm boat and assign drones to assist him #3 get your own ecm ships infact get your own e-war ships, no offence but i can hit a falcon with a big fat no bat with a couple targeting range damps. eccm is also a great fix, because it greatly increases that falcons chance of missing a cycle. each jammerh has to focus n you is another jammer he cant use on your buddy. non boosted gang, 3-4 ships jammed depending on what ships are on the field. boosted gang, maby 2. simple equasion i can fly a scorpian or i can fly a rokh scorpian has no real dps and is a high target priority for any competent fc. rokh in blaster config can push 800 dps with my current skills has a ******ed buffer tank and can reach farther than most other blaster boats. so tell me what is the point of flying a jam boat if it cant do what it was ment to do effectivly? why sacrifice 800 dps and 250 k effective hp from my fc's lineup unless i can bring somthing to the table that is worth the sacrifice?"
"this is very sensible"
"nah jujst delete ewar altogether, it distracts from tanking and pewpewingkthxbye"
"sure, but you can still shoot them with projectiles/missiles/drones - point is you have a hell of a lot more options then you would when you can't lock them.you have played the game post-damp nerf right? i mean logged in in the last oh say... two years?i love it when people use this one as their main argument. isn't that the answer to all problems? bring more people. your missing the point.riiiiiight. that is why soooo many people fit them because they are worth fitting. everyone must be altering their loss mails and altering them. it's a conspiracy.would be awesome if they always went for the ship jamming you. so everyone train for missile boats too?i really wish i felt as strongly about eccm being viable to fit as much as you. do you still fit the eccm if the jamming boat that you scouted on sisi is not alone?yeah, i was hoping for people that play on tranquility, but have fun with those test matches mate.and you can still shoot those pretty awesome guys while they are neuting, webbing, scramming you. i am not apposed to a secondary ew for caldari. i think that would be interesting.jamming ships are always primary 99% of the time for a reason. ask anyone that if they had to pick which ew they would like to have used on them are they gonna pick being jammed. you can even take the argument to ew drones. if anyone packs ew drones it is always ecm drones 99% of the time."
"if ecm were too powerfull we would see many more ecm boats out there. right now about 1 out of every 5-10 ships is an ecm boat. that is pretty balanced. ecm does not need to be balanced with other e-war. the idea is the races need to be somewhat balanced for pvp. ecm is caldari's best weapon. if you nerf ecm, caldari are just pathetic. ecm pilots have many downsides. you are never top damage dealer nor do you ever get a km. there is no need to make caldari any worse than they already are for pvp."
"ok so eccm is useless. alright since i am fair mded i decided to take a little time out of my day and do some number crunchingi will pick a fairly common middle of the road pvp boat, the dominix and place it under a falcon with a perfactly skilled pilot who's one mission in life is to jam galente ships. feel free to double check my math but this is what i got with my horribal american public school education the formula: the chance of one module to jam one ship on one cycle is p = ecm strength / ship sensor strength.hence, the probability that the jam fails is 1-p, the probability that at n jammers all fail is (1-p)^nbaseline domi sensor str 22 boosted 43.1 overheated booster 49.5 falcon jam str=14.128 baseline jam chance 1 modual jam/sensor =.64 36% chance of faiure chance for 5 jammers to suceed is 89.3%now baseline bosted jam chance .1296ok jam baslines str22 p=.64 str boosted 43.1 p=.32 boster overheat p=.28what this means chance of faiure for each modual is baseline 36% boosted 68% overheated booster 72% chance of faiure.multiple jammers chance all failining base line 1: 36%, 2: 12%, 3 :4% 4: 1.6% 5 .6%boosted jam 1:68%, 2: 46%, 3: 31%, 4: 21% 4: 14% 5: 9%overheated booster 1:72%, 2: 51%, 3: 37%, 4: 26% 5: 19%"
"this is with a tec 2 fit falcon vs tec 2 fit dominix. what the results mean is that even with the most perfactly skilled e-warpilot flying the most ideal ship for jammning and prefitted to target that one dominix the dominix still has aproximatly 1 in five chance of getting a lock on that falcon and sicking his drones on it. .in my entire time flying jam boats i have only run that kind of set up once and that was to counter station humping games played by a guy in a hyperion. now lets also remember that that is the result of one booster on one ship,2 eccm moduals jump the sensor str on tha domi into the low 100s and the chances of that falcon pilot missing a cycle on a ship is going to increase exponentially with each aditional target on the field. god help the poor falcon pilot who trys to get a jam on a boosted ship without racials. now i should also point out that this dosent factor things like projected eccm, and sensor backup arrays. oh and dont gime any crap about i dont have the slots for it. thats a domi set up with mwd,scram and web, and it still has 2 med slots to play with. end result dead jam boat. end of story."
"so in closing eccm is a good thing if your worried about jam boats, i recomend to any fc that is worried about jam boats to get a ship with impressive sensor str and assign its pilot to deal with jammer ships that show up. this is not the end all tactic either. stealth bombers, particuarly those who shoot em are a massive threat, as are other ecm and e-war ships, snipers, and competent fcs. can a good e-war pilot turn the tide of a 10v10 or 5v5 fight yes. is ecm powerful yes is it unstopable no can ecm be countered and factored for by a psudo competent gang leader hell yes. can ecm be countered with good fitting hell yes."
"in light of upcoming changes in dominion, and presuming at least some of it works as intended, i hereby propose the following:- decouple jump bridge operation from pos password- decouple jump bridge linking from \"same alliance\" limitationinstead- introduce \"shared secret\" value per jump bridge- allow to link a jump bridge to any jump bridge within range, if their shared secrets are the same- allow anyone who knows the shared secret, which is to be requested when initiating jump, to pass through the linked jump bridges- optionally require, and/or allow to turn on as a separate setting, to only allow passage if the standings towards the entity owning the remote bridge are above zero or above x value which can be edited- optionally allow passage only to pilots with standings better than x- optionally allow anyone who knows the jb shared secret to top up jb fuel (secret to be asked when requesting \"access resources\", only if the requestor is not in the owning alliance)what this proposal seeks to implement:- decoupling jb and pos passwords allows for lesser security compromise when sharing passwords. a hostile pilot, even knowing the jb password, will be attacked by pos weapons, and will be unable to enter pos shield- to allow building logistics networks through diplomacy and teamwork, better utilizing larger 0.0 space fragmentation which is supposed to happen in dominion"

"i have a feeling that i am not the only one who is beginning to get annoyed at the incessant spam from the isk farmers in local chat; somewhat specifically, jita. it is getting to the point where the isk spammers are surpassing the typical posting of scams/spam/banter in jita local, and i find this quite annoying (along with many other people) yes, it is possible to block and/or petition them, but they will just be back in 5 minutes with a new character named 'asdfasg asdfg' spitting out the same garbage into local. i have filed many, many petitions while witnessing this in-game, and while the offending characters seem to be banned fairly promptly...again, it's only a matter of minutes before they are back.either the farmers are not very smart, or they simply don't care to be subtle, because they all seem to post one of several urls which point to sites that presumably sell isk for \"real $$$\". to me, it seems that no legitimate player would have any reason to be linking these sites in-game. and also, by the mighty magic wand of ccp, there is probably a way to determine that a player has linked to one of these sites in a local chat channel (this is relying on the fact that the farmers don't really take the time to obfuscate the url, and just post it as plain text to be interpreted and linked by the game engine).what i propose is that any player who is using a trial account and links one of these known 'rmt' web addresses in any local channel would simply be autobanned (because these sites are a violation of the eula and any rule-abiding player has no business promoting them in game). if some idiotic n00b who is trying eve accidentally posts one of these sites, (s)he could then file a petition out of game, and hopefully have their account unbanned (perhaps after a day or three). if it was a farmer, it is very likely that the account would be a trial account, and it is very unlikely that any attempt would be made to get the account reactivated. if a non-trial account is for some reason linking these sites, and if it is determined by the other players to be a problem, then an \"isk spammer\" petition could be filed via the usual channels and dealt with accordingly.this may seem a bit drastic, but given the scope of the farmer infestation, i really don't think that it is unreasonable. it would also serve to further make futile any efforts of the spammers/farmers to continue making new accounts, as their text could hopefully be screened and never even posted while they still receive the banhammer. i do not know the ramifications of trying to interpret all weblinks posted to local chat by trial accounts, but i trust that the fine folks working behind the scenes would be able to figure something out. if the isk spammers were to modify their methods of posting weblinks, then hopefully the filter could be easily adapted to recognize this and take the appropriate action.additionally, by limiting any auto-banning to trial accounts only, it would hopefully reduce or even eliminate any \"false positives\" and would not interfere with players who wish to legitimately play the game.if you like or dislike this idea, please leave your support and/or any feedback or criticism"
"obligatory +1 for posterity"
"oh mighty ccp gods, please, please.it's bad enough that 9/10 of most local chat is in game contract spammers, but the isk selling spammers are the worst. can we get a little clean up so we can all enjoy the game? it'd cut down on advertisement of illegal isk too."
"yes, yes, yesss !!!!!!!ohhh dear god yes!!!!!!my isk farmer block list is the size of the last us public survey and growing by 10 to 20 people per day, and i'm not even a frequent visitor in jita.i know you're deep into dominion and all, but pull your collective geek heads away from the screens and sit quietly watching jita local for just 1 minute, and you'll see the scope of the problem.voidspawn**edit**the fact that the eve community could crash the petition system in about 10 seconds also seem to be woooooshing over ccp's head. if the 600+ people in jita local petition every single attempt at isk selling, then their whole system would crash, and would continue to do so until they stopped people from petitioning jita local."
"*priceless* :) i think we all will live better without scammers and iskies :) thumbs up !!!"
"i like this idea, not only because it seems like it could be very effective while minimizing collateral damage, but it's also sort of humorous in a twisted ironic kind of way; the isk spammers would succeed in identifying themselves and then removing themselves from the game like the previous posts say, if you aren't aware of what's going on in jita, take just 60 seconds to peek at jita's local chat. then, try to petition one or more of these incessant and probably automated-macro-backed spambots and watch just how quickly they return to local..."
"i support the basic idea, but also propose a minor modification:if a trial account tries to link this site, the chat comment should fail to go through and a warning message should appear on the screen saying \"you attempted to post a url to a known illegal isk-selling site. the use of such sites is forbidden by ccp, and mentioning specific such sites is also forbidden. if you post a url to a known isk-selling site again, your account will be suspended.\"if it's a clueless noob, then fine, they've been given fair warning and they probably won't do it again. if it's an isk seller and they try again, then the account gets shut down."
"rather than the chat system having filters looking at every line spoken i think a better approach is a more \"agent\" based one.thus ccp would have a modified automated client that monitors the chat rather then having the filters hardcoded into the main system.this probably won't be needed with the new reporting system, users should be reporting quick enough.i imagine they'll be toying with auto-temp-gag after x reports.still believe there needs to be a gm in the process before any ban has been handed out."
"i think you're right that there needs to be some sort of gm confirmation before any character is banned. it does seem that the more valid spammers i've reported the faster their text seems to cease from local. but then they just pop back in with another character.i think that ccp more or less has the notification and immediate-dealings-with down fairly well, but what seems to be lacking at present are preventative measures."
"yes, it's not very hard to implement an ai filter that categorizes messages (just like an email spam filter really), have it sort out messages that are potentially spam and have a gm look over the flagged messages, so that he can then gag/ban the offender.supporting the modified proposal."
"the original proposal is good, this modified proposal is better. i also propose that one of thes agents would sit in every newbie system as well as the main market and mission hubs in order to nail them asap."
"i <3 this idea."
"i too <3 this idea, been in jita 3 days didnt have no one on the blocked list... now its practically full >_<"
"yes !"
"please do it - yesterday"
"i agree that something should be done, it does ruin the local channel.i think autoban may cause problems for noob/idiot/drunk genuine gamers though.i think a more subtle approach would be an advertising charge for posting in local.10,000 isk for standard post.100,000 isk for post with contract link.1m isk for url link or for link with identifyable url in text. ( this would make isk sellers cry ) :)"
"just a thought i had, would definitely require some work on ccp's end but perhaps less work in the long run in regards to having to spend man-hours looking into and rectifying account hacks. (and less head-aches for those that have been hacked and their possessions liquidated)perhaps add a feature in the account section of eve's website that allows the player to log and remember their 'home' ip address, that being the one in which they will log on from the majority of the time. in addition, allow the player to set up a bank of say 5-6 security questions.with that done, whenever the player logs on from his home pc, which many do, there will be no change whatsoever. but if someone were to log on from a different ip, they would be addressed with a random question chosen from the previously established pool. if this is the user, no big deal, but it would be my hope that it would deter would be assailants that have acquired your password via key logger, as you would have no reason to normally put in the answer to those security questions.mind you i know this would be useless and an extra step for those of us with a rotating ip but i think the majority of people have static ip's from their isp and would benefit the masses more than the inconvenience it was to the minority.and for those of us who have experienced the grief account hacks, it would a nice piece of mind that there was at least a lessened chance of it happening again."
"your assuming everyone will have a static ip address.this is not the case."
"i agree the current mechanic where faction war pilots have to watch fleetmates die while thrid parties attack certain members of certain corps out of their fleet, needs fixing. but the op suggestion is a very slanted way to fix it. i would be more inclined to vote for something like one of two different solutions:1) you can't war dec faction war corps. its a very simple solutution and easy to implement. faction war corps can't join alliances therefore can't hold sov and have various other limitations like standings requirements that you would like to avoid but fw corps have to swallow. perhaps this is a decent balance. not really sure.an alternate 2) if you war dec a fw corp then you war dec *everyone*. in effect you stand in the shoes of the militia you are fighting for. so if you wardec amarr you also are in it against caldari *and* any other thrid party entities that have decced *either* minmatar or gallente. if it were like this you would still be able to be in an alliance and have no standing requirements that fw corps suffer from. accordinly the fw corps alone should get the lp bonuses and the ability to do plexes and fw proper things etc. if you are third party war deccer you can stay in your alliance but you do not get the fw proper benefits. a potential problem with this is o.o alliances may just completely overwhelm fw. i don't know. but at least it has some semblence of ballance. the problem with the op solution is you may be in a big enough alliance where you can be pretty sure you can bring enough forces to dominate a single fw militia. you may be able to bring your 0.0 resources such as cap ships in order to camp their hq preventing their t1 ships from getting any pew pew. while it might sound like fun for some i think it pretty much sucks so i vote against it. if you want to get in fw for the pew pew with out getting in fw....well at least offer something that isn't so slanted. at least make your proposal such that you need to deal with the same number of conflicts those in fw have to deal with."
"not supported primarily for the reason that in a mixed fleet, (lets give minmatar and third party) will be split on who can engage what when caldari come to join in. splitting up the militia forces is bad.the csm meeting notes have ccp saying they will allow alliances in that do not hold any 0.0 sov. sounds good to me."
"1. seleene for president. 2. every time nozh logs in to target paint sieged dreads he must suddenly appear in the drone regions with his autopilot set back to the caldari nub starting system and have the tutorial automatically pop up. this is a good start to the long journey of nozh actually learning something about this game."
"i think your focus may be too narrow. i don't think you should look at rigs in a vacuum. you need to consider whether there is too much gank or tank in the game as a whole. if there is too much gank in the game now then the shield/armor mods (including rigs) should be buffed and the weapon mods (including rigs) should be nerfed.now i think the game is fairly well balanced and the rigs gave a nice needed boost to tank as a whole. this is because i personally like pvp to have a bit more strategy and be less twitchy. if you have more tank there will be more time to switch ammo and range etc. there will be more strategy in a fight. if its all gank then you just hope you were lucky enough to fit the right ammo and choose the right range when you start because you won't have time to adjust. so for these reasons i would prefer they do not boost the gank in the game. not rigs or any other gank mods for that matter. but specificially i do still use gank rigs on some of my ship fits. if you have the powergrid or cpu you can fit those rigs for *no* penalty at all. plus they are *much* cheaper than trimarks or shield extenders. the armor rigs do indeed slow you down allot and that is why i sometimes prefer the weapon mods. dictating range is often important so is the ability to burn out when you need to. 3 armor rigs really hurts that effort. as far as the negatives for the shields its harder to measure. so while i agree that i usually fit the armor and shield rigs i dont think that is a bad thing, and weapon rigs are still used as well. for these reasons i would be against your idea."
"i agree with all of the above"

"simply add an afk timer, if your character doesn't interact with anything for 5 to 10 minutes he gets a small marker that shows he is afk. that way we know if someone decided to go watch a movie while in your space or if they're actually playing the game."
"only for his corp. nobody else deserves that much intel."
"it's not \"intel\" if he's afk. so don't make it sound like it's some kind of in-game advantage to know he's afk. if he's afk he isn't playing. but because he's still logged in a system has to function as if he's still active and playing because there's no way of telling whether he really is playing or not. the best solution is if you're character is idle and in space for a certain period of time you're automatically logged off. but i won't suggest that because i don't want you to have a ***** attack :p."
"of course it is intel. you know he is less dangerous. that is a valuable information for you. as you dont belong to his friends you should not have that information."
"sure, then the evil cloaker will just sit there long enough to get the afk marker, everyone will go back to normal, and then he'll strike. then the whining about this new tactic will start a bunch of silly new threads. the solution isn't adding more free intel, it's the removal of the intel that already shouldn't be there. fix local and suddely an afk person can terrorize no one, because no one will know they are there."

"i mean, this forum is supposed to be about communicating with ccp via the csm, right? the mods here are aware of that purpose, one would assume.maybe ccp should just give us a list of \"approved topics\" that they're willing to listen to based on the changes that they've already decided to make rather than just continuing with this charade of \"player involvement\"?"

"\"normal\" game developers delay releases all the time. ccp should try it and stop with rushing an expansion which obviously still has many faults. everyone who follows the dev blogs, spends time on sisi, is part of a 0.0 alliance, reads the discussions, knows there's an incredible ammount of things wrong with dominion. i'm not gonna detail that here, i'm just gonna assume people who agree with me have more or less the same information.releasing dominion within 1,5 week from now with so many obvious flaws will have the potential of bringing eve closer to mmo death.maybe the corporate owners of ccp don't care. maybe their marketing guys whispered in their ears that \"there absolutely can't be any delay\". maybe competing space mmo's are rushing towards the limelight and ccp has to block their moves with a high-profile high-powered pr buffed expansion.ccp: don't be tempted by external forces to ignore things you should fix internally! also go back to two-way feedback between developers trusted by the community and the community itself. maybe in your opinion it won't affect the bottom line much, but for us players getting a warm and fuzzy feeling about the devs and what they're trying to do is very important regarding our consumer behaviour: do we continue to buy this product or not? are we pleased by the company's service? do we have the feeling the company is taking his clients seriously?at the moment, we, the consumer, are not being taken seriously.ccp, make a good expansion and communicate with your clients more effectively. recognize the fact that ****ing off your long-term subscribers, who've been with you for years, can be the ultimate recipe for mmo death. for killing your own child.anyway, i could rant a lot longer... i'm under the impression a lot of people know very well what i'm talking about.now..i'm simply calling here that the csm put forward to ccp as soon as possible, the very simple idea of postponing the release of dominion.and let ccp developers without - or at least with less - time stress get it right. you made us wait for wis/incarna for like 3 years, we can wait for a better 0.0/supercap patch a bit longer...................edit: if you don't believe this is not a troll check my posting history. i never speak up on eve-o unless i have something to say which i deem to be important. so please treat this post seriously.another edit: this is my personal opinion and doesn't reflect what my corp and/or alliance thinks. this is me, as a paying customer (i pay for 5 accounts), bringing this issue to the csm."
"supporting this product or service.in all seriousness i approve of this. 1.5 weeks to dominion and allot of key features are untestable on sisi or obviously don't work. i'm thinking military and industrial level display, growth and decay calculations which even when they do seem to work don't account for small systems with only a few belts etc, an oversight with a simple fix with time. ccp need time to get this right before release it affects far too much to implement now and fix later."

"wormhole pos's aren't exposed to danger?sure they don't have to worry about a cap fleet showing up to curb stomp them, but there are logistical issues for pos's in w-space that don't exist in k-space.for all practical purposes, wormhole poses are cut off from known space supply lines each time the located wormhole collapses and is replaced. the next wormhole could lead to a distant part of k-space or another w-space system. this means that corporations moving into wormhole systems have to plan to be self-sufficient (i have no idea how to get the fuels that aren't manufactured reliably).if the pos consumables run out, the starbase will offline.yes, waging war on a pos directly is very difficult (the same as fighting one in high sec), but there are obvious alternatives. attack the ships that operate out of the station. eventually it will offline.as long as pos's are effected by the same system phenomena that targets player ships (like some buff or debuff aspects of the game), i think it is fine how it is. it would be potentially ruining to plant a pos in a system that halves the effectiveness of shields. but if it is a profitable system, that seems like a fair trade."
"well it appears your knowledge of worm holes is limited.(just an observation, no one can know everything about eve)the class 5 and 6 worm holes people do have to worry about caps showing up as they can have worm hole opennings that allow at least one cap in and back. i know of certain corps that make it part of their game play to go into other worm holes and kill off other peoples pos's for the fun and games and the isk that drops... so yes it can happen.the fuel must be carried inside as there is no ice inside worm holes to mine. so one is always looking for a way to high sec to get your stuff to sell out and your fuel and other stuff in.some people want to have the sleepers come and attack pos's in wormholes and somehow kill them. i could sorta see this happening if you had a small pos with no defenses... but any pos with defenses should be able to take out bs's.thanks for your responses."

"i think ccp summed it up best and drew the wrong conclusion.if there are so few black ops ships in the game, less than even the titans then that is not the reason to let is sit in the corner alone like some ugly stepchild . . . that is the reason to go back and give it some loving to bring it back into the fold.if they are so committed to making ships begin to have specialized roles then ask what role the bo's should have and address the question of whether the current design does make someone look to this ship for that role or not.yes, they need someone looking into this."
"supported, up the jump range so that it can fill its intended role. cov ops cloak would be nice, and for god's sake please bump their base stats up so that they can be a match for their t1 counterparts. either that or mke a drastic reduction in the overall price of the ship, i think the main thing that is killing black ops is the billion isk price tag for a ship that has a nifty trick for its size. compaired to what else i can get my hands on for that amount of isk (carrier, marauder, some of the cheaper dreads,) and the capabilitys that these ships offer compaired to their simarly priced counterpart its just not worth the investment."
"op's logic is incredibly flawed, despite his very nice pvp stats and seniority in the game. did he get his account hacked?? just trolling for kicks?flawed from the start. all other races are locked into using weapon systems that deal specific damage types. to deal a different damage type, they fit non-racial weapons and forego their ship's bonuses. mini's sort of an exception, please say they're overpowered though. so, which race was it again that is actually able to deal straight em, straight exp, straight therm and straight kin damage? oh, right, the missile-spewing caldari. all other races have to stick to sub-standard damage due to mixed damage types from their race's weapons.you think that's bad? try dealing straight explosive damage with a gallente or amarr ship. quit complaining!...unless he's dealing his race's damage, like all the other races are forced to. caldari has a choice at least.just plain wrong. no other races can discard their damage bonus ('cept mini, sort of). i'm sure they would if they could.a) yeah, umm... everyone but amarr deals kinetic damage, so at least multiply out the numbers for everyone, please?b) \"1/3\" -- where do you get that figure from? why is it relevant to caldari, but not to other races?c) yeah, drones are totally the equivalent of dealing damage across all types. totally. no, really, i'm being completely serious panda here. totally.d) more reasons... don't care enough to type them out.all the races except caldari use a certain type of weapon system that is limited to specific damage types. if they want to deal damage besides their weapon type's damage, they have to mount non-racial weapons.since hybrids only deal kin/therm dmg, gallente effectively have almost every ship that deals their race's damage type. the exception would be the myrm, which doesn't have a turret bonus. the difference though, is that they're locked into it and can't switch.failthis threadchoose 2 please.except that there are a couple of non-caldari missile ships which shouldn't be kinetic bonused (sacrilage, etc)."
"very much supported.older caldari ships (raven, caracal, kestrel) get a universal bonus. why not the rest?"
"well, in principle i support this topic. but there are some details one would have to consider.t2 ships. we already had the discussion about khanid ships. they get universal damagebonus, but only to shortrange launchers/missiles.should caldari t2 ships get their boni only for heavy missiles, or should the kinetic bonus be exclusive for caldari t2 ?for all those peeps that complain it would be unfair: how about you get only lead/standard charges/lenses but get them in all 4 damagetypes. and your ships get only boni for your \"racial\" damagetype ?"

"make insurance market-based(aka, platinum pays out 100% of market value, not 100% of \"base price\"), and lower/eliminate the drop rates of unnamed, mineral-equivalent loot. it'd be more complex than that to transition the market over, but that's the basic solution."

"fully support this solution"
"make an exemption for jamming and ecm bursts as these are primarily defensive measures used to stop someone from scrambling and do not deal any direct damage."
"clear,simple and probably easy to implement."
"simple, elegant solution. not sure if it should really apply to gates as well though."
"very simply, the timers that control station docking and gate jumping after aggression should be modified as follows:* so long as a ship does not commit an aggressive act (weapons, drones, ew, remote repair of a combatant, etc), no timer applies to docking or gate use (beyond the usual session change limits).* if a ship acts in an aggressive manner, that ship gains the usual aggression flag, and the station/gate timer is set to one minute. until the timer runs out, the ship cannot dock or use gates.* once flagged, any hostile act whether it's by the ship in question or against it will reset the station/gate timer to the full one minute.---------on one side i hate docking games like most of eve, but the gatecamp engager in me is screaming.jumping into chokepoints, engaging and killing x number of campers before de-aggressing and jumping out when the reinforcement blob arrives.i have a ship capable of tanking 3 dreads worth of dps. jump into the typical gatecamp of 1 tackler, 2 drakes and ofc the mandatory falcon. end up sitting on the gate permajammed for 25 minutes while they bring in enough reinforcement to take me down.unable to get a lock due to falcon. unable to outrun the tackler. and the refreshing 1 minute timer that will not run down with the new mechanic. a less mobile sitting duck have not been seen in new eden.for station games i think the mechanic would work fairly well since you can't dock in the station and boobytrap the enemy pilot's hangar.for gates i do not think the idea is well enough thought out as there is a way to lock down the hostile by 1 ship holding aggro and follow the jump.then again gatecampers would benefit from this as well, so..meh why not. idea supported."

"censure (pronounced /'s<U+025B>nr/) is a process by which a formal reprimand is issued to an individual by an authoritative body. in a deliberative assembly, a motion to censure is used.as an addition to the welcomed issue raised by former csm member lavista vista, i believe the incarnation of the csm that will next meet ccp should deliver a censure to them on behalf of the eve community, for recent actions regarding their censoring of the comment pages to the mothership devblog. it would be no more than a gesture but i think ccp should be brought to account and encouraged to explain themselves."
"when a thread has been discussed by the csm.....1. place the meeting minutes for the item at the top of the thread in a special highlighted section using a custom forum feature.2. place the meeting minutes in a standard post within the thread (to mark the time it was updated in the conversation flow).3. include links to related devblogs or ccp comments.this will allow more detailed discussion of raised issues while letting new-comers to the issue know it has been discussed."

"this could prove to be very use full. even thought being able to park in the pos bubble while red fleets are in system is very use full or when i move my pricey hauler like the orca down the bridge to work like a feri. so if i see reds and cant enter shield i would have to turn around and run fast. also if im to pay for my jump it would be nice to have a pre pay option and or consume from hold on the fly. also i would need to knoow how much im burning to know what to put back in. one last thing would be awsome is to be able to chain jumps through the by selecting next jump."
"i worry slightly about the annoyance value of making people remember another password. also, i'd be curious to see just what kind of superhighway goons/pl/nc put together to span most of 0.0 if this goes through(though of course your bloc's will be nothing to sneeze at either). but of course, that latter one is good in the context of what dominion is trying to do - allow alliances to fracture while keeping their bridges intact. overall, i think i support this."

"i routinely warp off jita 4/4 within half a second of hitting the warp button. in a freighter. warp to jita 4(planet or station, whichever), and you'll get out of the traffic jam basically instantly. in an iteron v i don't even have to use that trick, it can warp to the perimeter gate without any great difficulty 95% of the time. also, the number of times i've had my model superimposed over other ones at the jita undock(with all the weird and amusing chimeras that produces), i'd suggest that they've probably done this already."
"take a fast small ship. undock and fly 300k from the station in a straight line.make a bookmark. next time you are there with a slow ship. warp to the bookmark first.benefits. you warp instantly and dont get into the jam. you can align to the gate without getting bumped from the bookmarked spot. scanning you is rather hard. and people wont see where you really warp to."
"just a list of stuff that could be cool. comments and critic please.1) drone/fighter formations. since you are adding fleet formations, add formations to drones too?2) fix stuttering/shaking of capital ships. not sure how to explain other than look at this video:"
"drone / fighter formations: yesstuttering: i havent experienced this or seen itcollision: this could potentially cause alot more server stress, this would require some more information from the devscamera options: yes - this is on my csm agendain-game combat simulator: no - buy some ships and test em out :)universe size: to fix this motion blur and depth of field effects would help - this is on my csm agendagui improvements: yes - this is a high priority on my csm agendaliving universe: yes - this is an interesting idea, and could be implimented in multiple ways. a faction warfare implimentation for pve comes to mind, where missions join together to enage huge npc fleets, or escalating missions with more npc fleets every gate until infinity... this is partially covered on my agendascience vessels: not sure - also an interesting idea, maybe some further explanations of your idea would help.eve vision coming soon[tm]your views and visions are very close to the issues i would be pushing as a csm representative. convo me ingame if you would like to expand on any of your ideas and feel free to have a look through my agenda www.shipsofeve.com/csm-t'amber"
"allright, let me redefine my idea then. the biggest sellingpoint for me on this idea would be to make nice movies. so a simulator would let you setup ships around space the way youd like, define actions, then take some footage. but the combat simulator part would be to actually have any gameplay reason to add this. allthough i dont see any negative aspects with having it, the fact that you are against it tells me there might be reasons to not have that :) either way, the main point would be to have a 3d envirnment to setup movie footage wihtout having to take them \"live\" on tq or sisi. this would allow you to do things you usually wouldnt be able to.good suggestions. other things like stations needing supplies. currently players can buy up npc goods at one place and sell them higher somewhere else. expanding on this feature, you could actually setup a station supply list and storage. each station would have a certain amount of goods that are consumed on a daily basis. every so often npc supply lines would deliver goods and the supplies would rise again. here players could be ahead of the npcs and deliver goods to stations earlier and make a small profit. or, you could have players attack these supply lines and get some of the goods themself (high sec would have concord at you). however this could create a shortage of supply for a station or certain stations. that could open up global mission content to help get the supplies needed etc. things like this could happen with pirates too, creating local \"events\" so to speak. players could choose to interact but not required.other idea would be to have npc factions have a manufacturing supply of ships. you could essentially thin out navy fleets/concord in certain areas by destroying these ships, and depending on a factions manufacturing capability it could take a certain amount of time for it to recover. to have any significant impact on npc space would require a huuuuge amount of effort tho. again, this is only a minor part of what could be added to the game to make things happen out there, and not all be behind the scenes. and these are just genereal ideas without having thought them through properly. :)well, i was pretty much looking for non-combat/mining ships in general. allthough for instance you could have a ship that could locate space anomalies, comets, phenomenon, gather intel on them, get some kinda research and data that could lead to new technology. maybe a new production tier, or special items or something. just one example. you could have a very specialized probing/scanning ship, that could ...say give you the site types right away (grav, ladar, wormhole etc). uhm... anything really that doesnt directly have a combat or mining purpose.how about transport ships. like shuttles, just for us leet capsulers ;) like owning a ferrari in space ;p"
"this would be cool, but i've got to agree, waste of coding time."
"third party add-ons, for all your random eve-related needs."
"yes i fully agree!"
"to me walking in stations, aka ambulation, aka incarna seems like a great move from ccp's part. when i first started my trial, i was struck down by the fact that is this all? i mean, i just fly in a ship, thats it?!?! (back then i didnt know how great eve was, mind you :p) and the fact that they are adding some secret agents, where you have to get offline to aquire these missions(could be drug transportation to saving some politicians life who's best before date has expired or just some actions that the faction in question does not want anyone else to know about... etc etc.)i cant understand what people mean when they say that wis is only a five minute hype... it brings alot of content! imagine the amount of new players who start playing eve, to me thats a huge sign with an arrow pointing to a bucket saying \"fresh meat, ready for picking.\". i for one do appreciate the rp aspect that this brings in, makes the eve lore more appealing!new player experience? any way that could be improved to make the newbs more comfortable with the learning curve? well, heck, incarna certainly gives me ideas...and now for some small talk, why not make eft (eve fitting tool) in game? a computer you can access in wis that allows you to plan the fit of your ships that you own!(would certainly help us mac players since there is no eft available for mac, at least not to my knowledge). more mini games! i would rupture my colon if there was texa's hold'em in eve xd heck, if the copyrights allow it, even a eve version of monopoly(isk used of course ;) )i cant honestly see why wis is being spoken as a bad move from ccp's part, i just cant."
"having seen wis at fanfest last year, i wasn't too impressed. i feel most of it will detract from the actual gameplay."
"and if it does, is that such a bad thing? i would imagine wis to bring in more players compared to the amount that are actually derailed from the actual game, by wich i presume you mean, pvp and lowsec/nullsec fighting? and how it affects pve and mining? not at all i would say... solo pve'rs will still solo pve and fleet pve'rs will now have a place to gather up a fleet and go pve. and miners(such as myself) well, they wont change, we never change! we just mine xd"
"a lot of time in eve is already spent doing 'peripheral' things, by this i mean activities like buying mods and fitting a ship, flying to a certain destination, managing assets etc.to me, these activities become boring rather quickly, and i know of situations where i myself and others said 'meh' and logged off when there was a call for an op because we weren't in the right spot, didn't have the right equipment, or were waiting for a skill or job to finish. adding another huge set of activities that draw away from eve's core activities namely generating and acquiring resources and materials and destroying them (pve and pvp if you like, but the distinction isn't so clear), will not improve the game i'm afraid.but, i would be delighted if proven wrong.- sok."

"you got my votes, keep up the good work.jag/"
"thanks for everyone that supports z0d, you vote for the right man."
"for me it's not a case for not voting for you because you get a bit upset in local sometimes. or even for the times you have accused me of using exploits ( which anyone who knows me will know a) im not that good b) i dont cheat in computer games). for me the main problem is your inability to see the massive inbalance in the soverignty system between caldari-gallente and more recently the same imbalance allowing you guys to do lev4 fw missions in a stealth bomber (while we must use very well fit bc or hacs). it's fairly simple though, while you guys were capturing systems, anyone who can fly a t1 frig could go and do any plex which enables multiple alts to be used after a few days training i imagine and even if alts are not used allows many more people to be capturing more plexes at any one time. secondly that you think damps are anyway near as effective ewar as ecm is just rediculous. any pvper knows how much more effective ecm is and when this is used by rats in caldari plexes it's even more effective. i have regulary been jammed (ie unable to do anything) and still being shot by missiles at 150km from npcs, all you have to deal with in gallente plexes is blasters (uber short range) and a slightly slow locking time (oh noes)."
"i hope you will stand by your words, damar!good luck !"
"of course he won't, he's a selfish fraud.not that i give him any chance of being elected, maybe be becomes some low alternate if he's lucky, though, so he can sit there and be quiet while z0d fixes the real fw problems."
"page one with you!"
"it seems you would be the ideal candidate, representing smaller groups and in general the more carebare inclined. sadly there is not alot of self promotion going on (as indicated already by the other posters). well you got my votes anyway. wish you good luck."
"it will be interesting how many votes the 'no show' candidates garner out of sheer randomness.the good news is a wide field helps spread the random factor out enough that there will be little chance of an 'accidental election'.the one thing i wish ccp had done was put a shuffle on the candidates list so it was not the same person at the top of the page each time. i know some folks had to 'f3' to find specific candidates in the wish to vote for them.mikemike azariah"
"if you have already made your mind up what are you using a tool like this for?this is the first attempt i've seen to correlate candidates opinions in a framework for comparison. it's flawed like every other thing on planet, including every system of government in existence, but it is better than nothing. i want to see moar of this stuff going on."
"abstaining was not removed by csm2, just enforced by it. that rule is in the original csm documents prepared by xhagen.personally i agree with it - either you want to bring something up with ccp or you don't. if you don't know about the issue, part of your job is to learn about it. if you can't be bothered to do that or don't have the time to do that, you shouldn't be on the csm."

"they're all made out of ticky tackyand they all look just the same."
"i dont see how anyone that plays around in highsec and lowsec can vote for someone in a massive 0.0 alliance, be it goons or otherwise.fortunately there are some independent candidates in every election, and that must be why dierdra won the last elections."
"im running this revieuw black op's topic in the assemly hall and im curious about the csm's candidate's toughts about this subject. i do need to vote yet and i have a few friends that need to vote aswell..."
"some of the reasons why i have not yet flown them in combat are listed there. i'm not sure if giving them a huge boost in jump range would be the solution however, maybe up to 6ly max so they can outrange jump bridges.zz joe makes some good suggestions there to improve their t2 skill bonuses, but to make them more combat effective you can go two ways with those. adding t2 resistances on par with hacs would be an easy way to give them more staying power but i have also seen requests for better dps.i would like to cooperate with a few people who have more experience with them to formulating a proposal to 'buff' them if you help me get elected.- sok."
"you might want to edit the thread title to \"review\" but to answer the question, i do agree that black ops ships need reviewing again.the fuel bay was a great start but as stated in the thread, it suffers from being worse than the t1 hull in every other way (technically it one higher resist, but with the lower base armour/shield/hull that doesn't help).a slight buff to ehp and dps may well get more people to frontline them instead of leaving them behind once the fleet has been bridged.up until recently i was only flying bombers and recons so i'm well versed in covert gameplay, probe drops, bombing runs etc and we've used blackops bridges a number of times.i'd like the clocked ships decloaking each other \"bug\" fixed too - at least for people in your fleet..."
"i support the idea of reviewing black ops.the ships should not be just another tick on the 'i can fly that, too' checklist.mike"
"they are fine as they are right now, it should not be easy to move around in a blackops. if ccp wants to give them some love, then i would recommend the following:hp buffed to at least the same as their t1 hulls (what zz joe mentioned)improved jump range (4 - 6.5ly base with jump drive calibration v)my 2 isk"
"i've been able to fly black ops for over a year(i was bored one month...), but i've never even seriously considered getting into one. they just have too many drawbacks. i'm not sure what the right fix is, though \"all of the above\" is tempting, but i do know that ccp really needs to stop pre-nerfing things."

"ashina is exactly the kind of person that ccp should be seeking out for feedback. by forming cas combat day, ashina has shown infinite patience, teaching abilities, and has helped keep a non-player corporation together and remarkably loyal without the benefits and mechanisms provided to help player corps succeed. there should always be a strong voice for the many of us that love playing eve, but for various reasons (time, desire, etc.) don't wish to have their playtime dictated by corporate needs. i can think of no better person to represent what i want an eve experience to be than ashina.~boig"
"what can i say about ash, she has bee supportive of a group of us younger players moving to npc 0.0. provides help and advice to us especially in the form of the now infamous cas combat days. these are exceptionally well organised fleets alowing even the newest of players the ability to keep up and even get kills.one player i can think of was 'days' old on his first ccd.you really cant say more than that.i suppport ash all the way for csmwe are in your debt."

"insurance reform has been a long time coming... and needed as the game progresses...the ability to break an empire's back by destroying their ships needs to be possible... and insurance always seemed a guard-rail for newbies getting used to the game anyways. please do something... follow the t2 lead and only partially insure ships... remove insurance on anything larger than a cruiser, etc. no risk battleship and drake gangs are commonplace in 0.0, insuring capital ships seems asinine, and insurance fraud as linked to by that post is only bound to increase as prices of minerals slides further.a sensible solution would be preferred... (and hopefully a well thought out means of presenting the problem and solution to the community to avoid mass hysteria)"
"it is evident that the prices of t1 ships - and therefore minerals are wholly determined by insurance values. in the past ccp have removed mineral price ceilings (reprocessing npc items) and floors (npc buy orders), but insurance is the elephant in the room. earlier in the game's evolutionary progress, i believe it was valuable and necesary. now it is become a giant hinderance to the emergence of a true player economy, not to mention a vast isk fountain, not to mention anti-immersive behaviour like suicide ganking (a legal absurdity made possible and necessary by the economic absurdity of negative-value battleships and the gameplay absurdity of omnipotent concord police).the one real value of insurance is to protect new players. however simple schemes like simply reducing insurance payouts by x% per loss are susceptible to farming with alts. it is also worth noting that without further change, a reduction or removal of insurance would lead to a freefall plunge in t1 ship value, so the absolute loss suffered from ship loss would be considerably reduced in any case.the other issue of course is that at the moment, insurance is essentially a huge demand subsidy to miners. the industrial economy is at the moment capable of producing many more ships than the war economy requires. an alternative or even a companion to insurance reform might be to consider methods of increasing demand. which is to say: ship loss. at the very least, some dicussion as to why supply so outstrips demand is merited."
"you could take the route that has been discussed before: remove insurance from self-destruction or being killed by concord/faction police. people will still use alts to kill their bs for the profit, but there's really nothing much you can do except reducing insurance payouts..."

"i think you're forgetting that t3 production requires gas from wormholes. solely because of that fact, the demand for a dedicated gas harvester is rising, and will soon require a dedicated ship for the job. i don't think it's a matter of \"if\" we will ever see a gas harvester, but \"when\"."

"i agree with much of above as my frame of reference appears very similar to the quoted poster... but my take on the situation...simple response to this would be... if you were in deep space and this was occurring, would the situation be acceptable by all parties (that is, deemed fair based on gaming mechanics)? i do not see why gates and stations should be safe havens for many, acting as a saving grace and tactical object in many situations. the scenario far more relevant to me is flying a guardian in an rr-bs gang using the gate as my de-aggressor when too much firepower is on me, in which i decloak and burn back to the gate, come back in, and get reps before the enemy can re-primary me. if i'm stuck on this side of the gate, i'm forced to use \"non-session changing\" game mechanics to find a way to survive or escape during a fight, rather than rely on get-out-of-fight-free methods due to no aggro from repping.

"this is not intended to be the typical missile whine thread. also i have no intention of proposing a rollback of recent changes to missiles. what i am proposing is that missiles be given a more mainstream role in game play with a few (opinion) modest changes.tldr version1. eliminate the guided vs. unguided distinction.2. allow all modules that improve gun tracking (tracking computers, enhancers, links) to improve explosion radius and explosion velocity or introduce new modules that have this functionality.3. allow modules that dilute gun tracking (tracking disrupter) to affect missile explosion velocity and explosion radius.4. radically increase (2x or more) missile flight speed while reducing burn time so that range stays as it is now.rationale:1. eliminate the guided vs. unguided distinction.there are no wasted skills for guns that i am aware of. that is to say, surgical strike boost hits from all guns. not so with guided missile precision. this skill only applies to 1/2 of all missiles used. there is no reason for this other than to support a blurb on an in game description. missile users are given no way to improve the explosion radius of short range missiles and this is bad game mechanics. by eliminating this distinction, gmp and rigor rigs would give bonuses to all missiles.2. allow all modules that improve gun tracking (tracking computers, enhancers, links) to improve explosion radius and explosion velocity or introduce new modules that provide this functionality.gun users have an option to equip their ships with ewar, damage mods, tackle,etc. missile users have to make these choices also. however, one option is not available to missile users. there is no modue (mid or low) that can increase a missiles performance other than a painter. (which helps both guns and missiles). guns are not limited to only the aid of a painter and neither should missiles be.3. allow modules that dilute gun tracking (tracking disrupter) to affect missile explosion velocity and explosion radius.alot of the recent changes to missiles were brought about due to the speed nerf. missiles might have been unbalanced if not adjusted. if the guided missile distinction is eliminated and missile enhancers introduced, it would only be good balance to give opponents a better tool to defend against missiles, and no, defender missiles do not count.4. radically increase (2x or more) missile flight speed while reducing burn time so that range stays as it is now.arty ships can fling ammo the size of a small car across space and do instant damage, but missiles, with their own propulsion, take forever. missile ships are not allowed in many fleets because of the time it takes for missiles to get onto the intended target. there is no reason this can not be improved. instant damage? no. but it should be aloooot faster.i hope you can consider these proposals and see how they not only mainstream missile but also improve game play. recent posts point to issues concerning every thing from rofkets (they do suck) to citadale cruise and torps can be addressed by these also. they are not overpowered because in order to get a benefit from enhancing modules a player must sacrifice fitting other modules. they are further held in check by the td proposal.the only unintended problem is the big ass boost it gives to the curse."

"i have to say, as i have started many new characters, that the learning skills do not set a character back 1 month. if no cybernetics are plugged in, the current time to get a learning skill to level 3 is maybe 5 hours, and level 3 to level 4 takes 18 hours. then advanced learning skills take less than a day to get to level 3. that's plenty enough for a new character. this being said, i do not support this thread as they are optional skills, which has been mentioned, and they do not set a character back more than a week to a week and a half to train to main4/adv3 stats. they still have 2 weeks remaining to train other skills to a good level, and get organized. i hope i do not come across this issue again, ccp did a good thing by making it a +100% training time multiplier for new characters.just a side note: with cybernetics i and +3 implants in right off the bat, a new character can have all of his starting skills to level 4 and be in a good position to get the advanced learning skills to level 4. keep the skills as they are, no changes needed."

"edited after commanderdata211 rfchey all,i had an idea reading the last csm minute about the crew issue. particulary they dont want it to be too dependent on npc. let's create a market then! i usually have few thoughts, generally confused but this one seem interesting and very low effort for ccp, possibly creating unique players flying around new eve. needless to say it should be released with incarna.general purposes:1) find a use for corpses2) give crew to the masses so they stfu3) create a new industrial process with already existing items4) further differenciate ship fittings and overall player performance without really tweaking ships much5) create a new contract market for \"original human truly named officer mods\"6) enhance solo capabilities, making pirates happy while not releasing a single wtfpwnd ship7) generally enhance ship rolesmy idea requires :1) skill points data at death time used to calculate a corpse class (1-4)2) corpses to have 5 implantable slots3) 4 bpos / 4 bpcs + 4 modules4) calculation done at industrial level5) calculation done at pve/pvp level6) ships crew number tweakedgame integration :1) pvp players find a use for their beloved corpses and sell to the market 2) skill data at death time is used to calculate a new class attribute (1-4) set on corpse 3) corpses are implanted (existing implants effects) by scientists trained in cloning stuff in a biochemical reactor at pos an thus \"revived\".4) implanted corpses can board ships/be sold contract or may be reversed engineered to obtain bpos which can be then copied into bpcs. during this procedure bpos loose the original implant set bonuses and acquire a new fixed general name (see below) and a generic bonus (module timer) depending on skill level at death time + implants used as required materials: automa : 0-15m sp + 2% implant -> 0.2 % efficiency module timer enhanced automa :15-30m sp + 3% implant -> 0.3 % efficiency module timer humanoid drone :30-60m sp + 4% implant -> 0.4 % efficiency module timer human drone :60->up sp + 5% implant -> 0.5 % efficiency module timer all percentages and stuff can be tweaked with / bonuses chosen but it is imperative to keep bonuses low in order to allow for large crews on bigger ships = more realistic 5) bonuses are stackable with a heavy malus if original corpses are used (conflicting with yours or other corpses')because crew would fight over control of specific ship subsystems, while normal malus for standard crew/module stacking.6) it would really make sense to have a staff bay you can load and interact with. it could be divided into racks (high/med/low slots) in order get some balance. crew could be fired away in some sort of pod (jettison to emergency warp if not interdicted) to be recovered later.7) preventing people from suicide farming their own corpses, by recycling them to the market, is not needed because the cost of mc is generally higher than the price paid by random contracts. since \"boosting\" effects come from skill class but most of it from implants used by scientists, it wouldnt be economically convenient to suicide.8)crew is dropped as a module, fighting to stay alive in the wreck till it pops. depending on your luck you may find a new good mod or an \"original named (the original name eheh) human officer\" mod <flame on> or support!"

"this idea seems very interesting and i like the idea of making them into items that you can place in some sort of hangar within the ship as opposed to new fitting slots, or rigs to enable a crew. however, i am a bit unclear as to what direct function you propose to make the crew do. it seemed to me that what you are proposing from the corpses is to reverse engineer implants out of them. this does not seem to have anything to do with the corpse turning into a member of your crew.getting back to the crew idea specifically (btw, i love the idea of being able to either animate a corpse to become a crew member or melt them for implants) what relation will they specifically have with the ship that you are piloting and have them in. you also mentioned something about the crew fighting for a specific subsystem in a ship. did you mean to say that if you have a human drone crew member \"in control\" of your offensive subsystems that you will get a .5% boost to offensive modules?i'd like to hear a little bit more about your idea, so i am reserving my thumbs up but you have me on the hook. i think that creating a valid market for corpses is an awesome idea.you mentioned also that the crews will fight one another for control over their specific"

"there is no contradiction in what i said. you have to consider ewar in order to have a good fleet. thats eve and i hope it stays that way. you have to balance tank gank and ewar. if your proposal went through you could certainly ignore ewar and just play a simpletons game of tank and gank. but that is lame.i certainly think its a good thing to have some ewar and ecm in any gang. but you can't just fit *all* ewar ships. you also need some dps and likely some tank.you can use ecm bursts in low sec. few fit them becasue they suck."
"ok, so if i bring tracking disruption, that would be as powerful as ecm? what about sensor damps? or target painting? no, i'd say it wouldn't. i'd say you're talking about ecm specifically. there is a contradiction in your statement, as it can be rephrased as \"you can put together your own gang, as long as you have some dps, tackle and one of these 4-5 ships specific ships that get a bonus to this specific ewar\". in my opinion it should be possible to make a good small gang without including any specific empires ships - be that caldari, gallente, minmatar or amarr. there should be more options than that. if ecm only breaks locks, rather than preventing them for a set amount of time, that's not something you can ignore. your lock breaks, web and scramble is disabled, allowing whatever was subject to their effects to maneuver till you get it again. that's important - could very well win a fight. so if i have a small gang and i choose to fly without ecm, i will be at a disadvantage in some situations, but not all. ecm as it stands is the nobrainer choice - it makes it possible to negate damage, allows ships that are in trouble to leave the fight and denies your opponent information. there is no situation where it does not apply in small scale low sec pvp. you always need locks to keep people scrambled and use your highslots for anything at all. now that you mention tank/gank being a simpletons game, let's look at what it takes for a pilot to manage ecm shall we? here's how i believe it usually goes:1) come into the fight at decent range (i.e. outside of most damage that could possibly be applied to you).2) activate your racial ecm on choice enemy ships. this probably means everything that threatens you in any way. oh but if there's only a few, just jam 'em all. yeah don't worry if you don't have enough racial jammers - if you use an off-race one, it'll likely be jammed through 2/3 of the fight anyway. also, within a minute the rest of your gang, which is unopposed due to noone on the other side having locks, should have at least fumbled their way to killing something or tackling the lot, meaning you have nothing to worry about. 3) be proud of yourself for not playing a simpletons game, but rather this highly complex equation of activating 4-5 mods on 2-3 enemies while not managing anything else like drones, capacitor, tank, range or tracking. also, i never argued 10 falcons would be a good gang - noone is saying they don't need other ships. they just need any damagedealer and any tackler, from any empires navy, not one out of a specific 4-5 ships."
"currenty they are too powerfull. its too easy with the use of other game mechanics to bomb and killing a whole fleet of battleships with 6 coordinated bombs. bombing combined with a prober that probes out the location of the battleship fleet to get a warpin point within 10 sec's is too powerfull. its the new dd and it need to be looked at.it go's as followed: squad leader of a bomber gang is in a cov op and lay down probes around a gate on such a way that he covers the gate perfectly at 0.5au. a med gang plays for bait at the gate (no batteships allowd). enymie battleship gang warps in. prober runs scan and warp or squad warp bomb squad at 30km. bombs are launched and battleships die. is it intended that 6 bombers can take out an 12+ batteships with bombs?"
"if your bs cant stand 6 bombs then learn how to fit one so that it has at least 48k ehp. i'm told it's not hard."

"yes, you don't need a 70k ehp minimum on a carebear bs, but you do on a fleet bs. titans are wonderful like that. because of the fact that multiple bombs blow each other up after a certain point, a dd-proof fleet battleship is proof against any number of bombs coming in a single wave. in other words, a proper fleet-fit bs should not die to a bomber run, it'd take two, separated by several seconds. and if someone is willing to risk half a billion worth of bombers on a double wave to strike your fleet, and pulls it off, you should probably take a bit of a hit in the process. bombs are finally usable, after two years of waiting. this is a good thing."
"they work as intended as glass cannon vs blobs.and it takes much more than you are describing to get a proper hit on a fleet and then getting out without getting killed yourself. you need to get a warpin with a good exit option for yourself.not supported."
"it's a good idea and will probably work beautifully on the large scale (bc/bs and large fleets).however, it does nothing for the small scale, cruisers and below have so few lockable targets and sensor strengths that they will not benefit from a reduced lock count mechanic.nor does it address the fact that ecm is game-breaking (read: overpowered) when gangs are max. 5-6 people or that practically all frigates (very few slots overall so no eccm possible) can be perma-jammed with a single rigged jammer on a bonused ship.i hate the cinematic mechanic behind ecm and would love to see it gone, but it has to be in a way that allows for ecm to do its job without being overpowered on any scale."

"cannot agree. those builders who vent the excess minerals and pass the profits along to entrepeneurs are removing the heat from the system, much like a really big hurricane.they are moving the economy back to equalibrium. if the excess ships are not removed they remain stockpiled to gamebreak alter, or they reduce price of player-earned labour, supply v. demand.it was forced out of equilibrium by macro accounts, and then they unloaded cheap mins after unholy rage. years of cheating hit the markets, the natural order is that more cheating will redistribute the wealth to the clever and resourceful. capitalism at work. greed is good.this insurance fraud can only be maintained if the macros were to return. i'm sure ccp will not let them. so enjoy it while it lasts.edit: cosmo says so on 2nd page!t2 insurance needs reform, after dominion supply changes."
"they could just remove the top level purchased insurance and see the result.and while they are at it remove all payed insuance payout on suicide kills (only pay base fee)"
"no insurance company in the present day world pays a dime when you are careless/reckless with the insured property, duplicate that in eve and issue is resolved.no payout on pvp kills (ie. player on mail) or self-destructs. if ship is insured and it is lost to another player you do however get a partial (50-75%) refund on the premium.there is no reason to penalise new players, who are more likely to lose boats starting out, by making the initial grind all the more difficult.cannot be supported in current iteration."
"removing insurance just on suicide kills would necessitate a concord nerf. that's a whole different issue."
"um, how is proposing a change to the way insurance works not supporting a proposal that insurance needs to be changed?a straight reduction in insurance value would actually benefit new players."
"this is different than concord- if concord kills a ship then there should be no payout.self destructing, keep as it is. let them do it.more ships blown up = more need for minerals = more demand = higher mineral prices = relief for starving miners.more ships blown up = more demand = higher pricesboth being about a market equalibrium."
"in other words, insurance is effectively an npc buy order, as i said in my post above. hardly what we would normally think of as a \"market equilibrium\"; the market has little to do with it. ccp have - rightly - been progressively removing npc market buy/sell orders as they encroach on and distort the price levels the market sets: it's time for them to remove or amend this one too.this is not about suicide ganking. this is about a player driven market."
"yes, insurance is a \"floor\" you do understand if you remove payouts that the price of ships would plummet before actually begin rising again? i don't need to explain why do i?insurance is not a commodity, it's an incentive to place a ship in harm's way.don't get me wrong, mind you i rarely... if ever, fly a t1 ship these days. nature of the business."
"i agree with malcanis, the current insurance system is an artificial price floor which has no place in a player-run economy.for the solution i'd like to see insurance payout based on actual market value, the base prices made sense 6 years ago but they are out of date."
"who said anything about \"removing\"...?"
"root mean square price aggregated by volume of sum mineral requirement would seem to be the simplest method."
"be careful how this gets implemented. from the way you described this i believe you're thinking about some sort of built in auto-calculation of the insurance rates based on the market average. people could take advantage of this by posting sell orders for t1 ships at ridiculous prices (hundreds of billions of isk each) in order to jack up the \"average\" market value, and this way they could potentially get auto-calculated insurance payouts worth far, far more than they should be.i support the idea of tweaking the insurance system, but do not use an auto-calculation method based on the average market price. otherwise, we'll have an even bigger insurance fraud mess than we already have."

"wow, terrible idea, and i'm amazed to see so many people supporting it. has the general consensus over eve changed that much since i played regularly?this would remove a massive tactical element from the gameplay; the moment you agress anything you're 100% stuck in that system/situation till the fight is over and either you or the guys agressing you are dead, now either people are failing to understand that and how serious a change it would be, or you seem to think its a good idea (which it is not).all it would mean is that people are even less likely to fight in small gangs, due to being stuck and totally vulnerable to larger gangs the moment they enagage anything. there would be no such thing as a retreat, and fights would generally end in one side being 100% obliterated assuming people are competant with points; as there's no other way for the fight to end. this would especially be the case in situations where you're fighting people near their 'home', they can keep trickling in greater numbers until you simply become overwhelmed.solo pvp is dead, small gang pvp is on its way, and now you want to make anyone who fights on a gate stuck there until he's killed the entire other gang?jesus.edit: this is also especially insane as all you need to do is make stations spit outs by default."

"docking games are maddening. i like how this proposal pushes commitment to the fight but doesn't seem to force it on those who don't aggress in the first place."
"i support this idea for stations but not for gates. the simple reason is that you have the option to put tacklers on the other side of a gate should the target try to de-agress and jump out but until there is a \"bribe scotty\" option there isn't anything to stop them docking, repairing and undocking again in seconds.i agree this is the outcome for gate fights should this station concept be applied to gates. not only do you have the option to put tackle on the other side of the gate, but there isn't any instant repping ability with gates to prolong the fight.leave gates out of this change.that is an even worse idea as it promotes lazy bubblecamping of stations. just have enough dps in station/outside to pop a bs in under 1 minute. yes you can argue they shouldn't undock without intel and that is a fair point, but lets not give people more reason to play station games"
"oo-b"
"seems a pretty sound, simple idea.another idea could be for ccp to sort it so that you are out of docking range as soon as you undock (read: fix the silly docking ranges on some stations). lets see them try docking games when they end up 5km from the happy spot...hal."
"problem is, this would tilt the balance in favor of pirates camping a station, so it's a less elegant solution than the op's idea. you pop out, they scramble/web, and you've got a *long* crawl back to safety. on the other hand, the discussed solution nerfs docking games while still preserving the capacity to disengage if not aggressing in the first place. overall, supported for stations, not for gates."
"simple, effective. i'm supporting this. but only if it applies to stations rather than gates as the reasons for that have been said before."
"did you even read the thread? or at least think through the op? its been explained before so i wont bother, but seriously, read and understand, then post."
"dock ***ging is not a 'tactical element' besides, there have been plenty of times i have engaged targets, more warped in, and we gtfo without using a gate. you see i call it a system scanner. i spam it, and when suddenly a horde of intys, hics and dictors shows up on it, i usually call out \"gtfo!!\" and then we warp away.sometimes someone gets stuck, cause he wasn't aligned like he should have been... and then he dies, and we make fun of him mercilessly for days. sometimes that someone is me."

"excellent suggestion. supported."
"having been living in npc 0.0 i can't but to support this proposal.this should have been implemented a long time ago, even without the upcoming sov changes. +1 to op"
"1. we are talking about tactics to increase damage ( while flying is space ) , everybody can fit mods to there ships to increase damage.2. people with skill3. yes mini has less base damage , because they can choose damage types , there ships hulls get r.o.f. and d.p.l. bonuses not 5% per level to exp damage.drones : drones with less raw damage get better tracking and range, as gallente train ship hulls up they get 10% more dps whatever flavour they choose.4. & 5. yes i know this is why they have the highest base damages in game.6. start a thread7. yes we know.the concept your having trouble grasping is that especially solo its not very wise to only fire kinetic.caldari missile boat tactics and bonuses clash with each other , they are not compatible.this is not the case for other races ships or caldari rails boats i might add."
"supported. selectable damage on missiles is one of the inherent bonuses of the weapon. you're supposed to be free to choose whichever damage type you like. you shouldn't be expected to forfeit this advantage just to take advantage of your ship's inbuilt bonuses, or vice versa. caldari are supposed to be missile specialists- yes, kinetic damage is basically their hat, but this seems like an arbitrary and silly limitation. why are caldari ships only bonussed to kinetic missiles?"
"until all other weapon systems can freely choose different damage types with no penalties that are not based on skill, this would be a little bit overpowered.gallente get bonused to kinetic and thermal. amarr get bonused to em and themal.minmatar get bonued to all, but ammos have dps issues and optimal range issuescaldari get bonused to kinetic. but have option of using any ammo.if caldari got bonused to all types of ammo it would be a little unfair to everybody else."
"number 3 needs more work. but support for all else.solo pvp caldari is what i want to see.more nublets to teach that you should use drones more.now if only ecm drones worked too...also, add caliber size flexibility for launchers and you have some interesting engagements with shieldtanking ships.as passive tank/run away/bring 2 falcons will not be their only option for pvp.edit:missiles sacrifice, range for dps or dps for range...speeding up the missiles ruins counter-missileboat ability.saw a hmldrake at 15km vs your vexor, if he's using fofs and you are not tanking well, you would leave, but with the faster speed...never mind, that helps missile sniping more than affecting skirmish pvp.you guys need that badly.good luck man."
"so in other words, homogenize missiles to be turrets. no support. --isaac"
"missiles should constantly accelerate as they race towards their targets. that way you could engage even targets far away without having to wait half a minute."
"controlled burst: 5% per level reduced capacitor use for gun turret.use for projectile guns none. 5. homogenize t2 skill training of missiles to those of guns. no more specialization in torps without specialization in rockets and hams (and you get both short and long range t1 missile of each class with one skill).6. no assault missile launchers. make it use medium sized missiles (with the target size drawbacks) like the undersized guns. 7. instant acceleration and miss chance. when your missile reach max speed it is hard to turn to follow a target. if you want to homogenize guns and missiles you get the whole package, not half of it. not supportededit:forgot:8. no fof.[/b] guns don't have the option to fire when blinded."
"actually , i t seems to make sence to me. #1: yes#2: add a mod that has effect equivalent to that of a tracking enchaser for missiles#3: alright, although maybe making defer missiles usefull would be more sensible, but whatever#4: actually i licke the idea of them constantly accelerating, but yeah, missile sniping sucks."

"ok, i thought the first part of this post was a little overly harsh, but i *absolutely* agree that training the learning skills does teach people about the role of patience in eve, and for the exact reason, i think the learning skills are a good idea.david"
"yes they are dumb. get rid of them.there only worth training if your going to stick with the game.and when your new to the game you have no way of knowing that yet.end result is those that do train them are more likelly to quit as there slower getting there ship skills etc up and start doing more interesting stuff.or they dont train do interesting stuff quicker and then get ****ed off because everything starts to take ages to train.of course you wont get much support in these forums.most people are of the opinion if they suffered with them so should everybody else who ever joins the game.lets not bother trying to make the game better.qftso eve would be better of not having to rely on players being lucky enough to get good advice when they join, would it not ?"
"nuff said"
"well, here's my opinion as a new player to eve (2.5 wks), or from the mouth of a babe if you will...learning has been/is still a pretty big buffer between my entrance into the game and getting to what i want to be doing. no, i am not 'stupid', training to the exclusion of all the things i find fun, but it's still been a bit of a monkey wrench thrown into my plans of enjoying this game, especially since i love pretty much everything about it. obviously, if everybody, new or old, just instantly got a 11+(10+10%) point boost to all of their stats as op suggests all of the agony endured by the older players would be rendered pointless. (srsly, no pun intended!)instead, i was thinking that every million skill points, until 5m sp:-base stats could get a 1p static boost, and -2 more points would be available for the dynamic remapping. adjustments to point distribution cap would be unnecessary. the lower value of the primary would be offset by the fact that you can boost the secondary higher. 5m sp works out to about two months of play. of course, the frequency of these upgrades could be tweaked, but the magnitude of improvement once maxed is roughly in line with the strength of the current learning skills. oh, just occurred to me. would be nice when you got the new points if you could do a full remap, and would simplify code implementation. i butchered one character when i was starting out because i was out of remaps with a horrible distribution. what do you guys think?"

"supported. the number 100 is probably, in ccp's infinite wisdom, hardcoded, but, to give the \"hard working developers\" some leeway, it might also have something to do with the original rendering engine's zoom function being coded to not load textures on models over a certain distance or something to that effect. i know that this was the case in some other games such as the homeworld series. that said, if you want to look further than 100kms, it's fairly easy to zoom out further than 100kms and swing the camera around 180 degrees, and the textures and models are certainly fully loaded there these days.sometimes, i get the feeling that the eve code is a royal mess."

"sorry i think i've been unclear about it, my post was written quickly and english is not my mother language. the idea is :you get bonuses from the implanted corpses aboard, each one giving out the bonus of the implants it was revived with as if they were on you (full effect or good percentage). reverse engineering gives you either nothing (failed job) or a bpo (successful) which can be then copied into a bpc. so if instead he's a copy made from bpo/bpc that effect should be generic and lower (see below).this distinction original-copy allows for the creation of a double market :- precious unique, personalized \"ex-human very officer crew member\" or- standard market module to give out fixed but generic bonuses (5% reduced module timer or similar) the relation with you and the ship is basically additioned implant sets, giving out unique (expensive) bonuses or general (cheaper) efficiency ones. your crew helps you take care of subsystems allowing you some more power (balance is to be thinked about carefully ofc).you would have two choices for your ship, if it's uber : you put unique bonuses given by dedicated implant sets used to revive \"subjects\" : let's say hg crystal set used to revive nathan rev's corpse. you would put my corpse in a shield boosting ship, not on a armor buffered one). your player has his own implant bonuses + would acquire full (or good percentage) corpse implant set (remember stacking penalized) on a specific subsystem.if it's not intended as a uber ship you would most likely buy standard crew (my corpse made by bps, loosing its name and unique bonuses but aquiring new general ones :2%-5% subsystem/module effectiveness (timer for example) depending on skillpoint class of the corpse and implants used (+2,+3,+4,+5 attributes). they are generic, they can be used for any subsystem, while the unique ones are likely to be very subsystem focused (crystal, slave and such).stacking :1) if you stack bonuses, by either using yourself the same implant set one of your unique corpses has or you put 2 same implanted unique corpses on the same ship, you would get very low bonuses because they would ideally fight over control of the same subsystem (ie shields), thus being highly inefficient.2) if you instead use the \"standard moduled corpses\" you could have some stacking on the same subsystem, example normal penalty for gyrostab/bcu but you could also assign 4 to 4 different subsystems.balancing is all related to the staff bay slots. bay could be divided for 1/2/3 rack where you put your max number of unique (obviously you would assign them to the relevant rack because of their specific bonuses) or moduled corpses (in this case you stack em or distribute em where you like in order to get a generic bonus on 1 or more specific subsystem).i hope i made myself somehow clearer and pls anyone feel free to contribute as well. more brains, more logic. the idea it to keep it simple, as simple as possible to have ccp look into it. pls look 1st post, changed some"
"yeah the word i had in mind was zombies. how cool would it be having to recover your zombie from your worst enemy or having your worst enemy fighting for you together with other mixed crew i think i'd put my worst enemies on mining bargez ehehhe"
"still not quite clear on what you mean by the reverse engineering to get bpo's out of the corpse to then produce copies from that bpo. what will these blueprints be for? if you are talking about seeding implant bpo's through the reprocessing of corpses then there are a few things to consider. first of all, i don't think it smart to seed bpo's of implants like that specifically. if, instead, they dropped bpc's and created a type of alchemy system to facilitate the production i think that would work a lot better.the idea of the class system for the corpses intrigues me but i had an addition for them in mind in terms of getting materials for building the implants. how about class 3-4 corpses have a percentage chance to produce a bpc, and the class 1-2 produce a new raw material with which to build the implant from. these numbers would have to be looked at to balance bpc/material ratio but the gist is there.the thing that i notice is that in the explanation you don't describe what exactly these bpo's will be for exactly, and if they are for building implants you haven't outlined a means to get the materials.also, i am not too sure i like the idea you have laid out for the corpses to become crews that affect you in a way that implants do. if you resurrect a corpse that had learning implants, what will happen to those implants and what kind of affect will those have on you as a whole or the ship you are flying.need some answers to those questions but again, i like the idea of adding corpses as a viable market. i think this would add something specifically to pvping that it desperately needs. there are not many markets that can be groomed solely with pvp. i think also a good addition to the idea would be to make the process of getting bpc's out of corpses and the manufacturing of implants take place only at pos's in either low sec or null sec. this would give another incentive to explore 0.0 and elsewhere, which is something that those places severely need."
"the idea of bpos is to give those willing to take chances with reverse engineering on a billion isk worth revived body (by pirate implants set for example) a safe way to then make some serious money either by selling copies, bpcs, or directly producing copy cat individuals for the large market. the idea of bpos is because you risk a lot during reverse engineering :a) it could fail and you loose your unique revived bodyb) even if it succeeds, original bonuses are gone..replaced by standard onesit's a good idea, a corpse could have a double use : a) being reprocessed to get material to be then able to implant other bodiesb) being implanted and then sold (unique) or reversed engineered to get a bp (bpo or bpc to be balanced/analyzed) depending on this, the whole concept may change (the best balanced solution should be chosen but remember that the more you ask to implement the less you may get from ccp). my idea was originally point b, while your brainstorming could lead to solution a :a) corpses are both source and final destination of specifically created implants : you use the good corpse to implant and the bad ones to melt for raw materialsb) corpses are just receivers of already existing implants, pirate sets when unique but once reversed engineered raw materials to be used are: bodies and normal learning implants which would not give out learning bonuses but generic module timer reduction (as per schema 1st post)."
"they are not for building implants, they are meant for crew replication at a standard level. let's say you have my corpse, revived by implants bought off the market (crystal set-unique bonuses). you could put it in your ship and get the unique bonus or you could sacrifice it in an industrial reverse engineering process by which, if successfull, you get a bp which you will then use to mass produce a standarded bonus crew member. that was the original idea to allow a double market, unique/contract/highpriced and a parallel standard/market/lowpriced crew member.as for unique bodies, they can revived with a \"some grade pirate set\", giving out full or good percentage of bonuses. if instead you build standard crew members you would use the learning sets (+2-5% - 1st post schema) not to get those original bonuses but a generic module, stackable bonus (ie harvesting timer or missile/turret timer or again shield boosting /armor rep timers).i agree, pvp needs some reform without unbalancing the game by working on single ships and pvp needs to be community supported (professions as scientist and industrialist), in a word...integrated with the game.absolutely, the industrial/scientific process should take place in low sec and, now i'm guessing, original unique crews could even be illegal in hisec, because you revived a real player body (ethically wrong concorde/some may say) instead of using scientific researched products (copy cats).sorry for the long post i had to split. i'll try reorganize the first post :-)"
"bump"
"this would make ecm as impotent as damps.if anything the cycle time needs to be 10 and the victim needs to go blind to all targets for 15 secs...this would encourage 1 cycle bursts of regular mods on more targets that actually disrupt fast-locking enemies in rr gangs.a nub \"ecm specialist\" would be annoying, and a micromanaging starcraft player would be a god among men.this would also finally counter rr blobs.the 20 sec cycle is still too long when an unarmed ecm ship gets ambushed. should be shorter than that to give them self-defence ability, since range is shorter for the best ship.if damps kept targets blind for 5 secs after they stopped, we arazu pilots might even get to use that 2nd script that sorta goes in that timeframe. the one for when the inty tries to relock and stop you from cloaking...what is that called? damn, if only i didn't need to use 3-4 damps on one targetonly way to op that would be if multiple ship blinding you for the extra time were to stack additionally on each target leading to real unbalance. ecm is nowhere near that.hell being outnumbered, means you are doomed as you have to hold down 3-4 guys all the time, while 20 players primary you.do not cripple what remains of ecm.drones >>> ecm btw.inties/cruisers/frigs >>> ecm boatsecm >>> ecm boatsreinforcements/sniper ship/bomber/covops decloak >>> ecm boatseccm might be broken, but i would not know, ecm has never been efficient enough for me to fit it."
"why were sensor damps nerfed?it's strange that gallente get to use 3-4 mid-slots on *one* target without getting much result, while caldari can jam multiple targets with a t1 cruiser for 20sec at a time.....answer is to buff sensor damps again instead?reduce the cycle time on ecm?currently i have skills for several gallente ships that i refuse to fly until buffed."
"ok so your cunning argument would be to boost ecm instead? you do realize all ecm ships are capable of abominable shield tanks, which supported by logistics is quite hard to break, only traditional ecm ship fits are all ecm, no tank. while your proposed buff does incite the behavior you say it does, it also makes permajamming way easier. let's keep damps out of this for the most part, shall we? this is a thread about ecm and all of my arguments are based around ecm being overpowered, even without comparison to the other ewar. drones, having more people, having your own ecm and having more people arriving later is something people bring up a lot here. i have already stated i am arguing ecm is overpowered in relation to small gang pvp, which is to say mostly something like 5 people versus 5 people or less. drones work unreliably, due to the range ecm can operate at and only serves to force the ecm boat off grid - it can enter the fight again relatively fast and regardless, 1 minute without a hostile lock is a completely insane advantage in terms of controlling the situation. ecm being one of the only good counters people can cite for ecm is not an argument against nerfing it - it's an argument for nerfing it. having more people in a counter for everything, much like ecm. solo gank arazu - double damp put it outside the targets lock range, then it just stayed there. basically it could lock out a solo belt ratter permanently due to 40-something km point and 2x 60% lock range and 60% lock time damp combo. the nerf was well reasoned, but sensor damps are pityful now."
"damps were nerfed because just one was overpowered, they were eventually thrown on everything non-caldari and no ship could get any lock- also i believe there was no \"chance\" to it working. you damp someone, they lose lock range/resas to the second part of your comment, let's look at a good falcon fit:highs: 2 200mm rail ii or amls, covops cloakmids: 1-2 of each racial jammer, sensor booster iilows: disruption mods, maybe a dc or even a plate.(sorry i'm at work, no eft)what you need to realize is that a falcon's ecm is its tank. if the jam fails, the ship will fall to anything larger than a bantam. also, each ecm is for only one target, maybe 2 would be needed. and if someone gets a lock on an ecm boat, it's all over.not supported."
"now please tell me why does half of pvpers have to fir eccm? because ecm is overpowered. we have counters to many other forms of e-war, but yet people are forced to fit eccm, because currently jamming is the largets threat. all ships below cruiser size are unable to counter ecm because there base sensor strength is so low, adn they do not have many slots any way. it is not even feasable on cruiser.it is also the only type of e-war that does not receive stacking penalty. solution: introduce ecm tracking, that way you cannot permajamm 6 septors with 6 jammers.that way if someone get up close and personal to you, you are in trouble.2nd: give ecm stacking penalty like on sensor dampeners. that way you cannot place 50 jammers on eccm fitted carrier to permajamm it. therefore large ships can fit eccm and they can effectively counter eccm with high sensor strength.small ships can get there transversal up and be out of ecm tracking, and free of the jam. that way ecm stops being solo****upmobile."
"why should people fit resists? oh because weapons are overpowered. maybe some eccm needs a boost. maybe instead of stacking 3x gyros, tcs, or mags you may want to toss on something else."
"weapons constitute a much larger role in pvp than all ewar combined - if you die, you will have been subject to damage. there are far more ships capable of dealing damage, than will realistically field ecm and be effective. should half a dusin ships dictate all low sec pvp fits?the problem with balancing ecm with eccm is that it becomes a rock-paper-scissors scenario:1) the side fighting the ecm has no eccm, gets jammed and gets dead. 2) the side fighting the ecm has tonnes of eccm and thus does not get jammed, and win. there's no interesting mechanic at play, it's all just fitting. i would think a solution based on how you fly would be better. take the mechanic of tracking disruptors for instance: if you use it to kill a gunnery ships range, it can try to close that range and it wont matter. if you try to kill it's tracking, it can try to web/scramble its target and attempt to maneuver in a way that minimizes its targets transversal velocity. at current, if you get jammed, literally the only counter there is like that is to try to get out of range of the ecm boat. a counter like that - a counter that is enabled via good flying, rather than relying on having enough people or having to fit a certain module to every ship - is what i was hoping to accomplish with this proposal."
"it's not purely chance based though, it's also based upon skills, what you're flying, what your opponent is flying, and their skills.in beginner small gang pvp you can get by with just targetting and slapping a multispec on someone. when you start getting to roaming gangs in 0.0 it's nowhere near that easy.if you want to introduce tracking to ecm, you must be prepared to do the same for nos, scrams/webs, drone control, rrs, and even eccm then. is it fair to an inty pilot orbiting a tackled bs that the bs's web and neut can track him with ease? and how would you skill the tracking? along with gunnery? how would you handle the current bonuses to ships like the kitsune, falcon, widow, and scorpion?then you realize that if you do it to all non-turret weaponry as i listed above, exactly to the scope in which you need to modify the game.see, making one little change affects many other things."
"i honestly see no point of introducing tracking to points, rr or nos. nos drains certain amount of cap. it is nowhere near being overpowered in it's current state. ecm is. ecm currently has no viable counter, i suggest tracking as 1 way of doing it. against nos/neut you have boosters. you simply would not skill tracking, you cannot skill disruptors range, you cannot skill painter range, yet you can skill ecm range, why should you be able to skill it's tracking? it is chanse based, and skill dictates that chanse, as i had a bs permajammed by a set of light cm drones."
"first not all ewar has to be equal - nor should it. but if that is a problem for some i would much rather see the other ewar get a boost than nerfing ewar into some sort of novelty item in eve. your proposal would definitely make ewar an after thought and turn the game into \"gank and tank\" monotony. i would say that the other ewar is more or less a novelty item now and thats not good. you want to bring a gang that has *none* of the 5 or 6 best ships from the largest of the 4 factions? you don't feel you can do this, and this is the problem. we just disagree on there being a problem here. yes they are powerful but they are always support roles. you need other ships and likely ships from other factions. its not like you can just fill your gang with 10 ecm dedicated ships. consider logistics ships. the alliance tournament had to actually make a rule limiting them because too many could make you darn close to unbeatable. they didn't need to do that with ecm. why? because although its a good idea to have some you can overdue it and lose. there is already a natural balance in the game that you have to strike with how much ecm is in your gang. if you want to train caldari thats fine but you won't have much in the way of decent dps and tank ships. the drake is the only real exception to this rule. so if you want to train caldari for pvp its generally going to be for the ecm ewar. if you give ewar this massive nerf your proposing, there will be no point in training caldari for pvp. yeah ok your response might be well then lets start completely reworking all of the caldari shield and gank ships so they don't suck. well again if eve is just gank and tank it loses allot. but also that is a big undertaking and i would rather ccp do other things. like make it when i hit the dock button i actually dock and don't have to spam it. or get sov figured out after the dominion patch. nerfing ecm because some people don't want to use it and would like to pretend its not there is not something i support."
"this is not true, ecm recieves the same stacking penalties that shield/armor resists get.an ecm strength of 5 vs a sensor strength of 10 gives a 50% chance to jam.2 ecms strength of 5 vs a sensor strength of 10 gives you a 75% that the target will be jammed each cycle, just like stacking resistance mods."
"not true, they do not get penalised, the 75% chanse works out because that is the way theory of probability works. the same way 2 50% webbers do not make your speed 0, and two t2 webbers do not make your speed -20% of what you have. they are independant modules, and tehrefore have two times independant 50% chanse to jam, which coupled together, according to theory of probability, results in 75% chanse to jam the given target. same way 3 sensor dampeners with (just an example) 25% targeting range reduction do not result in target getting 25km targeting range out of original 100km, instead each sensor dampener works with what's left after the previous one, first dampener cuts it to 75km, second cuts it by 25% from the 75km, resulting in 56.25km targeting range, and after third one you get 42% targeting range. however, that isn't the case in game atm, as they are subject to stacking penalty, meaning that they work same way as your armor hardeners 1rst sensor dampener gets 100% effect, second gets 83.5% (i do not remember exact value), third gets 50%, and forth gets only 25%, making putting more then 45 of them on the target impractical.cearain has a point that maybe stacking penalties should be removed from all other types of e-war. i see no reason why you should not be able to get a target to 4km targeting range if you have 8 dumpeners on it, that has effect somilar to permajamming, but you still do not have arazu as usefull as falcon, you stil cannot prevent 4 people from doing damage, and if they get up close and personal, you are in trouble. maybe introducing distance where if target is closer the 20km to the ecm ship, the jammers strength starts falling, and at distance 0 from the ecm boat jammers effect drops to 0."
"lol you have never fought against a curse, have you? yes new neuts only drain the equiv. of the ship, but it's per neut.curse vs falcon = dead falcon.oh, so tracking would only apply to ecm. nothing that you would ever use. so webbing has no counter and makes intys sitting ducks. no counter to it but trying to fly out of range. neuts can destroy cap in seconds.but no, only ecm is the bad bad boy.ecm is caldari's pvp tank. it's viable on 3 ships. those three ships are known as one thing: primary.it's not overpowered."
"yes, i have. cannot see curce being overpowered still. curce is only usefull at relatively close range against cap-dependant ships. falcon is usefull against everything except maybe supercaps because they are immune to e-war. webbing has very short range, a smart intie will not enter webbing range unless absolutely necessary."
"ecm already has a falloff. long range ecm was already nerfed, now you want to nerf >20km? that's essentially removing ecm out of the equation.simple solution, boost your own strength instead of looking to gimp a ship.for example, lets look at a sample cane fit off of shc:there is a simple way you can swap the damage control with a ladar backup array... it boosts your strength 48%, from 16 base to 21-22 base or so.let's say i have a typical named ecm at my current skills. my str is 9.9/16*100% = 56%with the backup array we have 9/22*100%. that's a 40% chance that i'll jam you, each time. if i have 2 ladars, i can roll the dice twice.now, this doesn't include falloff. my question to you is, does your cane's armor tank only work half the time? because my falcon's would.but let me guess, you shouldn't have to put a module in against ewar, right? i mean, it's not far that you might need to put a defense up. guess what? my tank against you still only works half the time.the only time it becomes that much talked about \"80-90%\" is when you go against a max skilled falcon specialist, running rigs and with recon v and dispersion v, approx 2 months of dedicated training. if you go against me like that, then yes you might actually lost your t1 bc. sorry, eve happens. throw in the smartbomb and i'm still dead, jam on you or not.edit to avoid 5-min timer: no cap means no jam. no cap means no tank for any ship. i guess my light missiles on a falcon will do much against a curse, when i have no cap? no.webbing is short range? throw in a loki with bonuses in the gang, or faction webs and you're webbing at insane ranges, 30-40+ km."
"can we just make a ship that has an anti-falcon dd. give it the exact same stats as the falcon otherwise, we should also invent some sort of anti-falcon dd eccm module. using this module would reduce the chance of you get insta'd.that way we can just spew back out all the tripe that the ecm protectors throw from their ass.a falcon dder- virtually no damage output- has no tank- drones on it = dead- sniper on it = dead- keep some ships in reserve = dead- it has no role outside of killing falcons"
"well, other than the last one, this would fit that list completely."
"ok, i'll post a non-troll response, truth be told, ecm is a very bad mechanic for eve, it's unfun for both parties, and i think the chance based element is stupid in a game like eve where pvp is often based on fitting strategy etc.personally, i'd like to see racial ecm always work, and reduce the targets max locked targets to 2 (1 on bonused ships), make multispecs reduce to 3 max locked targets (2 on bonused, possibly 1 on tech ii ships like falcon etc.) this improves alot of things i personally despise about ecm in its current incarnation.- it makes fighting against ecm bareable, espically for the solo pvper, it reduces ecms effectiveness in blobs.- ecm is no longer a \"get out of jail free card\" it's frustrating when you are solo pvping, having a 1vs1, or have a high value target tackled with a small gang only to have it saved by a falcon coming in at -100km. it's also annoying when pirates uncloak their falcon the second they start losing their camping ships to a solo player/small gang they underestimated.- ecm remains effective against rr/logistic alts/rr bss. with 1 max locked target, they have to choose either to rep or shoot, this also makes such gangs way more vulnerable to target switching as they need to unlock/lock new target to get reps on.- sensor dampeners now have increased synergy with ecm, and scan resolution scripts are way more valuable to ecm'd targets. (currently its better to just bring another falcon than a dedicated ecm ship)."
"while i understand your frustration, this solution does nothing but make any ecm ship useless.remember an ecm's tank is its jammers. its offensive capabilities are limited, with the exception of rook and scorp but the ecm is much less of an issue with them as they use mids to shield tank.your idea would make falcons completely worthless, because they'd be primary and unable to do anything to withstand any fire. instead boost signal boosters to encourage their use. give a secondary bonus to scan resolution or something.people stacking 3x mags/tcs/gyros is overkill anyway."
"i'd be all for buffing the ecm ships defensive capabilities if ecm changed from the current mechanic, 250km range, 25% shield resist bonus, an 8th mid, you name it, you've got it. it's not like the arazu/rapier have great tanks either, which is usually just dual lse + damage control."
"a well buffered bs/bc/hac with a cap booster can vaporise curce, end of story. obviously curce will be a nuisance to a cap dependant ship. that makes ecm useless against the majority of combat ships. it's a bad idea. there is the problem, if you are sensor dampened, adn you have no sensor booster, it does not make you useless on the field, ecm does. half the pvpers fit eccm, but barely anyone fits sensosr boosters, and if they do, not because they are scared of dampeners, but because they need faster lock time."
"i think it should be 10/10 or even 5/5 it will be more random that way, 20 seconds is a long time in pvp.it also means a failed jam is not as bad, the target unjammed has less time to do something if a jam fails before the dice is rolled again. it also makes sensor dampeners more viable.heck, even a 9 second jam time and 10 second cycle time would be nice to try out."
"a falcon isn't a well buffered bs/bc/hac. and other recons or t2 ships are hard to jam. study your ships and look for high-grav str ships. create a falcon killer. falcons die every day on tq. if you're set up with long range and you get damped by a beagle, you will become useless on the field. if arrays are boosted, even just slightly to say, 60% for t2 and best named, 40% base. give a 5% bonus to scan res. for that tradeoff you remove a dcii or bcu/tc/mag/gyro/plate/cpr (thise are lows, right? crap i forgot lol)either that, or set your drones to protect. use rr. you are looking for a 100% defense. that is not game balancing. the role of the kitsune, falcon, and blackbird are ecm. they are not solo ships. they put out crap dps, and they are almost always primary (ok not the lolkitsune but i digress.)you are talking about the falcon as if it's an instant-pwnmobile or that it will always jam you. it doesn't. it removes your offensive capabilities, just as the curse does. just as a rapier does to a vaga, inty, or other fast ship. just like the arazu damps. the removal of targetting is much more random than the other ships. if you neut a falcon they are dead. simple.20 seconds on a failed jam is a long time to sic drones on a falcon :)"
"no."
"\"bombs are finally usable, after two years of waiting. this is a good thing.\"bombs were improved in dominion?"
"there is a serious lack of skill implied here.be happy your not subject to space bombs in low sec or high sec.learn to fit properly and you might just be able to deal with it.as a stealth bomber pilot i have to deal with the fact i'm flying a stick with a nuke strapped to it. sticks burn easily...sniper bs's is a poor excuse... they are in themsleves glass cannons...if you can't survive a bomb impact... (maybe more depending on damage types)to get hit with 6 of them at once? hell you should be honored... its rare enough to find a coordinate strike with such skill."
"actualy its not, i have seen them being used effectivly alot in 1 single afternoon disrupting any sort of fleet engagements... and killing dozens with ease"
"have you seen anyone using damps, tracking disruption, tptrs, ewar drones, en masse, in organized squads? know why?ecm is the only ewar besides neuts that actually does it's job.bringing it closer to the others is not an option for gameplay.with nerfed ewar we will simply fit bigass guns and tank and be back to attrition. which gets boring superfast."
"ecm may not be fun, but it is in no way overpowered. you need a bonused ship to be able to use it effectively, and those bonused ships die whenever something looks at them funny.the only times i have been in a fight where ecm has been a real problem (granted, there are many of those) are instances where the fc, for some unknown reason, has figured that a bs or hac or t3 was a better target than the ecm ships.lusulphur is right: it's not ecm that is unbalanced. if anything, it's the other ewar that needs to be boosted... although i am not entirely sure of this (maybe better optimals or falloffs, but that'd be it).anyway, as being able to target one or two ships at a time is more of an inconvenience than anything else (unless you're a logistics ship), what you are essentially arguing for is to make ecm worthless. plus, if it was valuable, it would be damn sure that the one target they choose to shoot would be the (untanked) ecm ship. brilliant"
"small gang warfare issues: yes ecm can be a problem if you have fewer ships in your gang, but again the problem can be solved with a good mix of ships, yeah a tec 1 sub bs roam is gonna have a bad time of things if a falcon showsup. but then again, if you use tec 2 you have some choices. a combat reco ship with 1 slot in eccm will fill the role of e-war killer very well. alternativly use stealth bombers, a purifyer can inflict alot of pain on any e-war boat. just time your uncloak."
"ok now let's take an example and have a t2 faction ammo top-skilled geddon vs a caracal that has no tank at all and no resists.what happens? oh crap, nerf the geddon! if you're going to make \"common middle of the road pvp boat\" falcons, consider only 1 racial, maybe 2.also, your 14 str jam is based on recons v, two sdas, and rigged. and you also would likely need weapon disruption to v. that gives you 14.6 max.oh, and that falcon will cost what, 120m compared to the 90mil, insureable domi?with recons iv and no rigs, your str is roughly 9.so, here's the point -> .if you're going up against a maxed out ew-freak yes you will get jammed. damn that sucks. however how many of us are out there (i'm not even maxed out). oh, and if by that chance i miss a jam, your neuts will drain my cap in seconds and your drones will eat me alive. i will die."
"which, due to the introduction of medium rigs, and the fact that recon v is one of those things that is just so damn useful that every recon pilot should have it, are not unreasonable assumptions.and i believe it's signal disruption you want. weapon disruption is for tracking disruptors.anyway, it doesn't matter, as before the falcon locks him, the domi will have deployed sentry drones. set to aggressive, the falcon will die very quickly, jam or no jam."
"good catch."
"i agree with the idea of increasing low sec mission rewards.i've read the forums, which basically break down into two groups- mission runners who got ganked in low sec and think it sucks, and wanna-be pirates who can't pvp anything except a pve fitted noob mission runner saying 'hey, this is great! ccp shouldn't change a thing'!i think the wanna-bes are hoping to one day get a destroyer on their killboards.could happen.but seriously- level 1 and 2 missions in low sec? i think ganking noobs is a great way to make sure new players who aren't invested in the game leave and decided to find a new game. and i think it hurts the entire community.there is no way the reward for a level 1 or 2 mission balances the chance of loosing a ship and fittings, or getting pod killed, even after insurance payouts. what do level 1 missions pay? 100,000? plus the new player than needs to run around finding the gear for their new ship. put yourself in the position of a new player. they probably just got killed for the first time by another player. they are shocked and ****ed. now to add insult to injury, they need to run back and forth buying new gear.level 3 missions, (or even high quality level 2 mission) i have no problem with them in low sec. but level 1 and 2? there is a chance a noob who just got ganked will just say 'eh, whatever, i learned something' but i think there is an equally good chance they are going to say 'thats how this game works? eff this. i'm going to play planet of hordecraft!!!'my 2 cents.david"
"i think corp taxes should be a percentage of all transactions from every player in the corp....im not that experianced in the game (playd about 5 months) so maybe im not thinking of something...either way i think this is something that should be discussed"
"would kill trader cause they buy and sell much stuff, you would tax their sell prize and not their profit"
"you can't tax all transactions, players would be locked out of many professions.the tax would eat into any profession that is margin based, making it impossible to profit.tax is currently only applied to rat bounties and mission rewards (not bonuses).if a corp wants to make it's isk from the trades made by their members then the method is to bring that activity into the corp hangers/wallets and have them work from there."

"z0d for chairman!"
"ank, i like you as a person, but you're being awfully weird itt."
"it's academic by now that i am 'weird', right? i am merely expressing my confidence in z0ds chances of becoming elected. i definitely expect him to end in the top 3 based on the overwhelming amount of support take care has mustered for its representative in game, and the success z0d has had rallying his vast personal networks. him becoming chairman is not that unlikely at this point, and i think he has a decent diplomatic personality for it and thus it would be a good thing for the csm as a whole.yeah it may be a bit \"american\" to talk about victory before the election is even over and it is premature, but i just have a very good feeling here.how do you estimate your odds? i personally think you are one of the better 0.0 choices as you try keep the big picture in mind and your pdf is concise and to the point (yes i read most candidate's stuff). and like us you appear to 'share' your influence with other players unlike some other csm we've had which are unfortunately much more dictatorial.will you be in the utrecht meetup (12 dec)?"
"we spoke briefly at fanfest '08 which is why i can say i like you as a person. i have not followed the entire drama nor the reasons why some people have a strong dislike of you but simply from what i've read here it appears as if you favour z0d more than he does himself, and occasionally you even sound protective which is..just..weird..(then again you are a girl)i have no idea about my own chances and yes i will be in utrecht 12/12 :)"

"inanna zuni *runs* to be honest, the csm raised many ui issues but usually got this as answer from ccp: \"yeah we want to redo the whole ui, some time\""
"why are you pimping another candidate?"
"the ui issues have been raised time and time, first on the forums and then by the csm when it was introduced, i'm fairly sure ccp are aware of it and we will see improvements soon(tm)"
"well, keep it up. if they eventually fix things just so you'll stop bringing it up, then all the better.i love how they extol the virtues of the sandbox nature of the game, yet via the ui, they only allow you a solitary, immutable, tool with which to interact with the sand."
"they've been saying that for almost three years."
"just like they said alliances will be allowed to join factional warfare in empyrean age 1.2, err november 2008, err q1 2009, err first thing after apocrypha; and we will have an interbus station and storyline agent soon, and 90% of the other things they promised to the csm were added to the backlog and be dealt with soon(tm).the reality is that ccp is rushing one expansion out after the other, and before they even patched out all the bugs and missing features with the last one, they're already on the hypemobile for the next expansion. there is no time to fix much of the existing content, because the moment one expansion is out, the deadlines for the next expansion are already rapidly approaching.i told them this in rather strong and uncensored words half a year ago, but there isn't much the csm can do about their business decisions until the players realize what is wrong and demand of ccp to change their strategy."
"this is one of those topics where nobody will disagree, thus as a differentiator between candidates it isn't that useful.i was at a roundtable during fanfest where ccp hammer stated his wish to throw the ui away and build it again from scratch. thus it is on the radar and apparently has been for ages.the csm can bring it up again and maybe ccp will finally put some time into the development, we can only hope."

"my wish list for black ops, given they truely suck as is...increase fuel bay to 4km3 - what is the point of being able to fit a jump portal mod if your gang exhausts the fuel the first time you jump. these ships should be able to work in 0.0 without having to be refueled every time the gang needs to move somewhere. as-is, you either need a gang member to bring along a transport ship or you fit cargo expanders, either is a poor choice.tanking - none of them can do this effectively unless it is all they do, and even then it is sub-par compared to their t1 or even faction equivalents. tanking a redeemer is an effort in futility. tanking sin & panther require the use of crystal implants and deadspace modules to get anywhere near being effective. the widow, while able to tank, sacrifices all of its ew role in doing so.fitting - this is another barrier to those who might have been wanting to fly a black ops. using the redeemer as an example, you need to waste your rig slots on reducing the cpu usage of your guns if you wish to fit t2 weapons and anything resembling a tank at the same time. even then you must use faction mods if you want to have any form of tackle.covert cynosural field generation - do not reduce the skill requirements for using these mods. not everything in this game should be available to the random pubbie at a weeks notice. what does need to be changed though is the inability of transport ships and strategic cruisers with the covert subsystem to fit them. if a ship can go through the portal, it should be able to light a cyno for it as well. should this be changed, some of the transport ships would need to be given an additional high slot so they can still fit their cloaks while filling this role."
"if nothing else bo need a longer jump range, at least on par with a dread.i would like to see it warp cloaked as well but the jump range is the main complaint i have about my sin."
"%5 to all damage types!supported because i fly exclusively caldari missile ships and extra dps across the board would be awesome for me... not because it would be balanced by any means."
"this argument is fundamentally pointless since those against it are, like climate change skeptics, completely set in their ways and will not change no matter how much sense you make. but for my 2 cents anyway:why are so many people taking the line that \"missile users get to switch damage types, they should be grateful for that since hybrids and lasers don't, so stop complaining about the damage bonus only applying to kinetic\"? this is fundamentally flawed reasoning and a completely indefensible position to take. missiles are supposed to be able to use all damage types; it's one of the integral advantages of the weapon, along with the lack of cap usage. if caldari are meant to be missile specialists, then why are so many of their ships so badly designed that they can't even make optimal use of their race's preferred weapon system? it means the ships themselves are fundamentally pre-nerfed even before you fit them, since they can't utilize their weapons the way they're supposed to be used without forfeiting another advantage- the basic bonuses that all ships are meant to get as a reward for training up the hull skill. this makes no sense as well as being completely unfair. nerf missiles or missile boats some other way to maintain balance if you have to, but this kinetic damage-only bonus joke has to be fixed.please do not regurgitate the \"you can switch damage types so that's a bonus you already have\" argument again; it will only prompt me and everyone with common sense to sneer at you."
"not supported. there is a reason why the any typhoon pilot will fit torps instead of acs, even if they only get a rof bonus and nothing else. acs suck badly at the moment. that will change slightly after the patch, but not enough to make a huge difference. typhoon pilots will still be fitting torps, and they will now be able to fit 5 instead of 4. and they do this even though missiles are supposedly \"bad\"."
"now why would you possibly want something like this? seriously though, very cool idea. be a bit of work for them to do it right, and the details will vary based on how spacebook winds up looking, but i like it. can see cool things resulting. supported."

"there is always a problem when you try to organize events on a mid level scale to reach out to the players who might be interested in your event. perhaps other requriement options then skill level and isk, such as ships or the ability to fit a particular module, say cov ops cloak or remote armor repairer?i know you put it on the list but to have it as a search criteria aswell would be nice."
"not a bad idea, i was thinking there would be a link to list the required items/ships for an operation/ event, being able to check whether your skills are sufficient would be a good function so that you can filter out events you can't join. i'll add that in when i get some time.-t'amber"

"still doesn't solve the problem. they'll just make the bogus sell orders on the ore instead once they realize that's how the system works.you can't use any kind of auto-calculation system based on market values of anything, regardless of what formula you use, as people will find a way to pad the market values to their benefit. exploiters are smart these days. there were some suggestions above that i should also discuss. the option of reducing or eliminating the insurance payout you get for self-destructing is a good one, but it has two main flaws:1) it doesn't account for alts legally destroying the ships in pvp. my primary solution to this whole problem (which i will mention later) should deal with this2) there are times that people really do have to self-destruct their ship for some reason, albeit these are rare cases (getting stuck in wormhole space with no probes is one that comes to mind). people shouldn't be completely *****-slapped for having to make this sacrifice; they should at least get something back to pad their losses a bit. solutions to this would be either my primary solution mentioned below, or ships destroyed by a self destruct automatically get the default payout for an uninsured ship, regardless of whether or not the ship had insurance.another suggestion above was to completely remove the insurance system outright. that simply isn't an option; players are now quite used to that system and if it is lost players would never want to risk their ships again, or they might even terminate their eve accounts over it. it isn't worth the risk.primary solutionthe only way i can think of that will really solve this problem without any possible holes for people to exploit would be to manually go through the insurance system and re-map all of the values, and this would have to be re-done on an annual basis. the insurance payout for 100% coverage should be noticably, but not extremely, less than the sum of the insurance fee, the average market value for the ship that is manually checked in order to weed out irrelevant data, and the average value of the possible salvage from the ship's wreck. it's long, it's messy, but it's foolproof, and if necessary i can help with some of the data analysis myself if ccp wishes it."
"hmmm... i think you're dismissing the concept too easily. what about basing it on actual mineral sales? that would ignore phoney high sell/low buy orders altogether.true, you could have alts selling back and forth to each other, but you'd be spending a titanic amount on broker fees to move the rms mineral sale price even a little. remember that rms calculations level out the effect of outlying values, both high and low. i really think the eve mineral economy is simply too vast to be affected significantly in this way. and un-naturally high buy orders are very susceptible to interference once people see what's happening (and they certainly will). it only takes one smart trader to ninja in a sell order at the right time and your putative insurance market manipulator is left holding vast amounts of someone else's trit at 16 isk per unit or whatever."
"no claims bonus, is all is needed to sort out this insurance mess.the more ships you lose the more it costs you to insure.could also tie in the new sov mechanics to insurance for 0.0 pvp"
"kind of harsh to penalise legitimate pvp in this way. 0.0 is economically disadvantaged enough as it is."
"hmm...that might work. to be safe it should be based on the average sale values over a period of time, perhaps 3 months, and then reduce the sum total of the mineral cost by perhaps 10% before calculating the insurance values. i can see how that would make anyone trying to pad the market lose a lot of money to transaction taxes before they can make a useable difference to the insurance payouts."
"i agree. this would make hisec wars more expensive as well, which is something my corp/alliance gets into frequently and my finances are streched thin as it is."

"in my very very humble opinion, \"browsing\" - thus declining missions to pick a \"better\" one - is not exploiting the system at all.one of the original purpose for fw was to get more ppl into pvp and into low-sec. so far the isk vs reward was so unbalanced that even looking at low-sec missions (common lvl3, lvl4 or lvl5 missions) was to a large part either stupid or an invitation to get ganked (as most of these systems are getting camped on their entry gates).right now ppl can \"hand pick\" the mission that fit their objective (hello sandbox) - for good lp reward or the right target system - and thus achieve their own player objects and go out into low-sec with the chance/risk of getting into pvp.it is not possible to just \"shut down\" an agent by just camping his home constellation and it is not possible to camp the target destination system, as ppl can shift these to their liking. with the ability to \"browse\" ppl can \"use\" these missions (as stated in my link below) to give their whole roaming a purpose and an objective to be achieved and gain standing and lp (till ccp gives occupancy a strategical and tactical meaning!).if the players objective is getting lp fast, they have to setup their fleet accordingly to avoid pvp, but they are still in low sec, they still have to travel and if the opposing force finds out they are flying around, it is the opposing militias task to stop this.if the opposing force still keeps camping just one system, it is not the fault of the \"game mechanics\" (aka being able to browse a mission) that these players are not being stopped.i stated here:giving your fw fleet a purpose: fw mission, plexing and pvp in one.why having these mission \"pickable\" is a very good idea and good for low-sec and fw and to get new players into trying out pvp.if the lp reward is too high, i could live with reducing the reward but making them \"not decline able without a standing loss\" is imho very stupid.the original intention of fw missions was to get players into low-sec.if players are able to \"farm\" this mission it is clearly the job of the opposing players to stop this. that would be the sandbox approach.you know sandbox? the one thingy you are all so proud of ?if ccp thinks that the reward and influx of lp is to high reduce the reward accordinglyccp wanted to have more faction navy ships in gamemaking the fw lp shop discount not static but standing/ rank related.that would reward those players that dedicate themself to the faction they work for and would make the \"influx\" of fw items lower again.there are plenty of better ways to \"reduce the lp inflation\" than just making the agents crap by making them again like the high-sec ones."
"given the abuse we have seen with fw missions (hello pervs). the change in dominion is imho a good step forward. i cant support your proposal."
"back to the top with ye!"
"need this badly :)regards"
"yeah, easier to manage your isk is good in my book.you often have personal projects, or something you want to save isk for by \"setting it aside\"."

"already this way on sisi. as near as i can tell, it asks you the first time you drag an object to the text input box, and then sticks with that choice."
"please!"
"basically i would like eve to be more interactive with the player, as in less text messages and more visual audio messages that make me feel like in space. last time i logged on to singularity they had added the transmission sounds around stations and gates and i really liked them although they were a bit loud. i don't think we need warning sounds for every module in game since in combat you are probably gonna be targeted by 50% of those modules and that would just clutter up audio so much you couldn't even comprehend what it was actually saying, we got visual effects for these (that could be improved by adding the module icon next to the brackets of the enemy ships). i would although like to hear a targeted warning like in star trek, (it's similar to the virus warning sound avast makes but only sounds once)"
"only 3 supports for more goodies to play with eh?"
"why on earth would you think thats a good idea for pvp? edit: just to clarify as i don't understand the reasoning behind supporting this. you think its a good idea if people only ever engage if they are sure they will win, therefore absolutely no close fights?"
"well i for one have heard of something called a warp disruptor, and i have also heard of something called engaging a gang the same size or even perhaps bigger than yours, in which situation your gang would for the most part be pointed. all this 'solution' would do is remove even more opportunity for a close and even sided fight; as people in this thread have repeatedly pointed out, people would only enagage if they are sure to win.and yes, docking and especially jumping gates are by definition, tactical elements of the gameplay. it just seems to me the people supporting this idea are fed up with having to use tactics themselves, and would rather their targets are pinned for them purely by the fact they engage."
"supported & about time"
"my bad, seems like i misunderstood."
"this is a well needed change. with regards to having a blob wait one or two systems over for you or your gang to agress, more emphasis should be places on intel. maybe you could buy a system scan from inside station indicating blues neuts and reds upto a number of jumps away?"
"i think its a great solution and well balanced"
"this should win the simplest and most elegant award ever. i fully support this combat. it will change the game drastically into a much better battlefield."
"exelent solution!"
"i like the idea of nerfing docking-games, but giving people the option to keep the enemy comitted until one side is destroyed or has warped off(though realistically, you aren't going to get away in a battleship...) has a far too large impact on the game.you wouldn't engage unless you can assure you can win the fight at hand.... which is hard to tell, given that the enemy can cyno-in at will (in lowsec) or have a legion of repping alts (in high-sec).in nullsec, the problem of carriers re-docking is marginalized by the fact that 20+ dreads will be able to annihilate a carrier in around 3-4 volleys, and a titan will even be able to instantly kill one of them.if you're going up against a sizeable force of carriers and a titan with less than 20 dreads, you're probably screwed, yes, which is mitigated by the fact that the titan costs 60bil (uninsureable) vs. the 200mil+fitting cost of a dread.carriers that don't agress and just rep are a problem without a titan of your own, so giving ships agression for remote-repping should definately be looked into.also, the hp buff to all ships, and the introduction of rigs (and abaddons ) has amplified this problem, so maybe enlengthening the dock/jump timer because of these unadressed consequences of these changes are in-order.there's just too many downfalls to being able to refresh someone else's aggro timer to make it a good addition to the game...."
"supported.htfu indeed :)"
"more like stfu, until you can learn to read a thread and not just the op or employ logical reasoning."
"support!"
"this man speaks the truth.although i would opt not to have this on gates, would make harassment of hostile territory harder."
"i'm totally for this; in fact, i suggested it here.really, it's genius. and it would solve so many issues. don't want to engage? fine, don't. want to engage? good, engage all the way."
"not supported, sorry, see above posts"
"not supported, its a stupid idea, every race has its own primary damage type, why should caldari get four?"
"your argument is wrong. period.if fixing this issue would make missiles overpowered, then tweak missiles properly so it wouldn't be unfair to everyone else. but still change the ships' bonuses. it's currently really unfair to caldari and just fundamentally bad balance.besides, when has a weapon system having an unfair advantage over the others been such a serious issue? *coughlaserscough*"
"point made.allow me to be captain obvious for just a moment. let's say you want to train frig missiles (both long and short ranged) to t2. you also want to train hybrid weapons (both rail and blaster) to t2. ponder the contrast:missiles: train standard missiles (2x skill) to 5 and then you get to train standard missile spec (3x skill). next train roflokets (1x skill) to 5 and get to train rocket spec (3x skill).hybrid:train small hybrid turret (1x skill) to 5 and then you get to train both small rail spec (3x skill) and small blaster (3x skill).this distinction applies across all guns vs missile training. there is an imbalance in training up the tree but it is not in favor of a missile user that wants to train both long and short ranged weapons. so unless you favor a system that requires different pre reqs for short ranged and long ranged guns as it is for missiles, your complaint is a red herring. i \"think\" you are saying that assault missile launchers give cruiser sized missile users an advantage over med guns vs. frigs. i agree. however, i think this is no more op then giving a dominix a damage bonus to scout drones. i will wait for your call to nerf that little oversight to respond further. sure, if you are willing to agree to an adjustment to explosion velocity and explosion radius values so that when missiles do hit a ship in their intended class they do full damage.agreed. let's get rid of fof missiles. in exchange, do away with the unspoken nerf to the drone bays of missile ships. i would like to field 5 medium drones on my drake please!"
"missiles have their pros and cons.guns have their pros and cons.i fly exclusively missiles. in fact, i have 4 gunnery skills trained: gunnery ii and small hybrid turret i because i was born with those, and weapon upgrades v and advanced weapon upgrades iii so that i can fit the pg-sucking t2 ham launchers on my drake without needing three ancillary current routers. i have no desire to switch to gunnery for any reason. guns are not better. missiles do not need to be more like guns.if you look at just about any missile boat fit, you will find at least one ballistic control system. that is a low-slot module that greatly increases missile damage. that's really all we need.(i am in support of somebody's suggestion that missiles speed up over time... that would be a beautiful thing. would need to figure out the calculation to make sure we don't increase their range in doing so, though.)"
"this idea has potential but needs to be refined."
"full support for points 1 and 4.cannot really support the other 2 however."
"dear captain obvious, you missed the bolded part. maybe it was unclear as english isn't my first language, but the meaning was \"homogenize the skill training in all the ways, including the progression of the skills in all his parts.\"seem pretty clear: require people to specialize in short range small missiles to be able to train for specialization in medium short range missiles and make 1 single skill requirement for short and long range missiles. btw: having trained missiles and rails, the possibility to train specialization in large missiles first is an advantage and fairly big. the we should nerf all the missile ships that get a bonus to 2 size of missiles. let's see: nighthawk, caracal, cerberus, onyx (unless the description is wrong it say bonus to kinetic missile damage, no size specified).ok, but then you need to nerf total damage of missiles. you are really wonderful:gimme more! gimme more! missile whiner. still not supported."
"why should i have to select ungrouped drones in my bay, right-click and then launch them every time when i can hit one button to activate a gun or module?i propose you either allow drones to be added to the slot layout with grouping mode or create a new slot window with hotkeys. we already have hotkeys to attack and dock etc..they also need to stack automatically if they are not damaged."
"how about you group them and use hotkeys then?"
"since i answer questions very often on helpchat, this is what i tell the newbies:---------------train the normal learnings to lvl 2 or 3 as quickly as you can and as you like, i suggest you at night because it is no immedialty visible progress. it will enable you to learn faster. if you decide to extend your trial, try to learn all normal attribute-skills to lvl 4 at least, learning itself to 5 but do it within your 1.6 mio sp boost. you will learn much faster afterwards and learnings will consume less time. but it will not hurt if you have your cruiser 2 days faster because you skip an attribute skill. but you should train those attributes to 4 for that area of skills you want to specialize in. as soon you have can afford the money, train the advanced attributes to at least 3, later to 4 when you have a nice base of skills to play the game.--------------the secret is to maintain a good balance between fun (read: flying and fitting the good stuff) and learnings. just my 2 isk :).regards"
"learning skills may have a place, but it's not right at the front of someone's playtime. and saying \"well, you've got to be patient!\" is a lesson that people should learn after they've decided to stick with the game. training for pre-reqs for t2 ships needs patience. training for capitals needs patience (advanced spaceship command 5, for example). but both those time sinks are more acceptable because they increase in relation to your experience--when you're experienced enough to start training for command ships, say, the time sink isn't as big a deal, because you have an existing array of \"do neat stuff\" skills that tide you over till it's done. sticking one right at the start is a bad bit of design.a better system might be that for every few thousand skill points, you get +1 to an attribute of your choice, to a total of 50-60 and a maximum of +10 in any one attribute."
"that's why there's no rule that says someone has to train them first! people have this ability to make their own decisions."
"isn't it ironic.... that we have a bunch of people complaining over learning skills.. and yet they obviously don't know how to use the support button?all of this over the subject of in-game education.:)"
"this actually could \"lube\" the eve economy. maybe some guy who actually has access to numbers could look at your assumptions.cool proposal!"
"not supported, eve is complicated enough for new players as it is without having to add something else to change fitting."
"please for the love of god increase the maximum number of tabs to at least 10. even for the carebear it would be usefull, having separate tabs for each type of ore they wish to mine or whatever."
"not much to say about this."
"no it isn't. it would require a complete and total revamp of the way ship movement works. the way it does things now is you set a destination or direction, and speed. from there, it moves along a straight path in the proper direction. the server tells all the clients which way your ship is going and at what speed and everything is done until you change direction.the way you're proposing would require that clients stream ship movement data in real time like a fps does, and the server would also have to stream that data to all the rest of the clients... thereby requiring a new system of how movement is handled as well as exponentially greater bandwidth and cpu cycles used simply on how ships are moving... ever been in a battle with a few hundred ships? those are laggy enough as it is, thanks. add to that the fact that missile damage is dependent upon the speed of the target, and gun tracking is dependent upon the speed of the target transverse to your own ship, and you have all sorts of calculations that will take longer and be less accurate due to the fact that the ship is not reliably moving at a specific speed or direction. it will mess with the game mechanics.basically, this is something that should not be considered, period. i hope i cleared things up for you."
"this would completely change the dynamic of eve.i vote no, sorry"
"whining? what are you on about? change the dynamics? oh stop.. all im asking for is to allow you to move your ship with the keyboard, whilst leaving your mouse hand free to do other stuff..ive seen you have totally got the wrong idea of what im asking for!! im not saying flying to a destination! or click anyway in space - so no need for the bad attitude !i mean just be able to spin the ship around! you know when you hold left mouse button and move your mouse around thats all!!if you cannot not to see the huge benefit of that then im confused..really...every game in the world allows you to move your char,ship with keyboard..sometimes i think you guys should get out alot more.."
"completely and utterly misunderstood my point - so no you havent cleared anything up..infact im sorry you spent time typing.."
"i don't see any harm in the arrow keys performing the left-mouse click and drag function. options are good."
"i know very little about programming so i wont go into if its easy or not. but i would certanly use this option."
"you obviously did not read my post. if you had, you would know exactly why keyboard control would be problematic.you guys can all show as much support for this as you want... in fact, i think it would be great to have keyboard control and you certainly will not hear me complain if they ever do implement it. i'm saying that it is unrealistic and would require too many changes to the way the game handles ship movement and calculates mechanics.you said spin the ship around, not spin the camera around. that's two completely different things and therein lies the misunderstanding (and i'm not the only one that interpreted your post the way you wrote it if you look at the replies before me). using arrow keys to move the camera is something that i can support so long as the arrow keys still work for text when the cursor is in a text box."
"make camera keyboard-controllable, and add a keybinding which is equivalent to doubleclick at the center of the screen (set ship direction.)"
"simple answer, go play jumpgate evolution when it comes out.more complex, other posters have said it already. this would require a complete revamp of the ship movement system. that is a huge overhaul. i doubt it will ever happen.now to be fair, i hate flying small ships in part do to the point and click movement that eve has. it is far to cumbersome. so, i fly bigger ships. it is rare for me to be flying anything under a bc sized ship. i am often pulled kicking and screaming out of my domi when an fc is asking for a \"light gang\"."
"you havent listened at all have you m8? that misunderstanding has been resolved go back and read the rest of the posts.kthx."
"agreed"
"if you want to haul the ore out to k-space for refining, go for it. i know my corp uses and loves their 75% refinery, because it means about a billion fewer trips dealing with refinery junk. high-end holes also have the option of a rorqual being used for compression. the current system is fine. tweaks of the numbers may be desirable, and i'd love to see the refinery be able to refine anything in a batch instead of just a single type of ore at once, but there is no need for a 100% refinery."
"while i won't support this topic, i do think a new refining module is needed. not just for wh-systems, though. it is stupid that in high-sec one can refine without loss (which itself does make sense), yet outside of high there is a fixed loss of 25% or worse.with enough skills it should be possible to get 100% anywhere.[edit ] it could be a huge module, requiring a tower for itself."
"about refining. the system is completly obsolete.you have more ore when you reprocess some loot in station with no skill, then all skill at 5 with refining array in pos.it's not possible for you to use rorqual in class 1 et 2 because the gates is too small. they are some month ago. i have make the proposition to create a new pos module. this module will be compress the ore like the rorqual."
"that's what you think.class 3 as well by the way....but we found a way around that problem."
"hrm.stepping away from the subject of wormhole systems... swapping the refining effiency could be a real boost for player corps in high sec (and other places). right now the only reason to have a pos in high sec is for research. if pos refining was better then npc station, then there would be a pretty powerful incentive for players to create corps in high sec."
"moving around between empires and stations if a real hassle for someone whose main occupation consists of ratting and mission running. i propose a system that allows you to get a letter of recomendation from your agent for a hefty processing fee. and this will allow you to activate one agent of his level and quality or lower provided the agent belongs to a allied faction. for example a recomendation from a caldari agent would work on caldari ammar and ammatar. but would not work on gallente or minmatar agents and vice versa. this would make it easier to relocate and still have a cash flow. it seems that standing is primarily a system to keep low sp pilots from getting in over their heads in empire ut other than that it serves as a hinderance for someone who is involved in a corperate re-location to unknown territory"
"faction standings already do this, but the change is gradual and you really have to work on them. you can buy some standing gains through data centers though and it doesn't take longer than a few days to grind standings for lvl 4's.standings certainly aren't there to keep newbies from getting into too much trouble. more likely it is there to provide consequenses and prevent lazy people from taking advantage of the benefits high standings offer without working for it. i'm not against this kind of system though, if you implement proper limitations and give thought about how it could be exploited. it propably has a lot of issues, so i'm not convinced the extra problems are justified just so people can avoid a little grinding. i'm not for it either, since previous choices and actions should have consequenses. it also isn't like you can't get the standings you need, but you just don't want to work for them. i can't blame you for it and everyone who has had to move around in empire has propably done it, but it isn't exactly the best reason to implement something."
"first off, hello everyone, my first time posting on this forum, so please excuse me if i didnt pay attention to something i should have so, what is going on with these so called compactor ships, i hear you ask.wel it's like this. me being an industrial/miner i have always found that it is hard to find a hauler to ship my ore from the mining point to the refining point.now i know that there is the rorqual, but it's big, not allowed in empire. and most of all. very expensive.so i was thinking, why not overhaul a couple of mining barges and exhumers, and rebuild them into empire compacting ships?.couple of things on this though, to keep it fair 1. for the t1 versions, they are cheap, but also not very effective. so for instance : for every 2 cycles of a equivelant t1 mining barge, they get 1 compacting cycle for simple ore's such as veld, skor and pye2. with each size you go up, your total compacting amount rises by so many percent. this prevents small ships from being able to compact as much as a full size t2 one.3. make them only able to compact simple ore type's such as veld, skor, pyrox and maybe another one4. make it so the largest t2 version can fit special modules to compress the somewhat more advanced ore's, maybe even ice.as i see it, this will allow smaller corp's and individual players to mine more effectively without the need for multiple accounts or large investments.offcourse, the rorq will stay king of them all, and be able to compress the most.also : we will need sizes in compressed blocks, so there will be a clear difference between what has been compressed by a rorq or a t2 compactor ship.prices should be around that of their mining barge/exhumer cousins.hope you guys are able to do something with this.just trying to add my 2 cents to the game ( sorry for any possible spelling mistake's, speed typing this )"
"i'm not really sure this is needed. for high sec you have the orca which will hold 175k m3 of ore. a ore compactor ship will still take an secondary toon to run, and the orca gives mining bonuses. -------------voting for the council of stellar management is now online.make your voice heard:"
"imho the orca fills that gap in highsec nicely. for lowsec/0.0 the rorqual gives you more support."
"this is a very baaaad idea.what your going to do is making the mining idustrie run rampant and out of control.while everyone would like the buff... this is overkill.the rorquals ability to compress ore exceeds everyone expectations but its strictly reserved for 0.0/low sec operations because of its high gains...so you need high risks.you want high gains without the risk (if you call it that).can't support that.the orca is more than adequate for your hauling needs."
"i am rather new to the pvp scene but when a friend invited me to a gank fleet in low sec i decided to try it out. now i understood this was a criminal activity and i did expect a security standing loss but the sheer size of the penalty i received was completely unbalanced compared to the months i needed to gain it. i understand commission of crime in highsec is met with swift death by concord and a massive security loss, but crimes in lowsec should not result in such a drastic loss as .6 per agro as i received. until changes are made to concord and the way security status is handled the eve penal system will discourage many players from venturing out into lowsec for pvp.i think eve is due for a security status and standing overhaul and i would like to hear some opinions on the subject.personally some of my thoughts include changes to the way low security status is handled. for one, i think concord should not react to your security status. if youre a -10 going into empire i am all for making you fair game for bounty hunters and the navel npc's but concord should stay out of it unless the pirate in question commits a crime whilst in high sec. this will make it easier for fledgling bounty hunters to make a living as well as allow pirates to restock and sell their wares in better market economies. fighting the navy and legions of bounty hunters is nearly as harsh a punishment as concord but at least it gives them a chance to escape without being banned for running from concord. concord exists to serve and protect newer players from piracy not to punish people who have chosen a pvp lifestyle and occasionally need to venture into high.a second thought if mine is to either give massive increases to security status gain for fighting npcs or change security losses so that when crimes are committed in lowsec the loss is equal to or only slightly greater than gains. i also propose exemptions for logistics ships in lowsec pvp fleets. the punishment for aiding a criminal is that your poorly tanked shield repping cruiser gets ****d by station guns or other players who decide to target you. this is more than enough of a punishment for most players.i would like to hear other thoughts and suggestions for how to fix the system to make lowsec more pvp friendly."
"1. concord only cares about -10 in the genesis region. as they are sov holders there.2. ratting up from bad sec status is a question of a few days ratting. not months. and that is even to fast imho. you should *fell* the pain from your actions.that said ... you got what you deserve. now work yourself up again."
"i'm happy with the current system. lowsec is safer then 0.0 and there's a reason for it."
"i think that is the idea. working as intended, i'd say.from what i've read, working up your sec status isn't as bad as some think. it's some weeks of hard work at worst.if you want to pvp in low-sec, why care about your sec-status anyway?"
"the point that your refusing to accept is if you do the crime you do the time.it would be no different than committing a murder... difference is... you can work your way out of going to jail by killing other...murderers.... except they are ai... yeah...*bad example but you get the drift*"
"sorry man, but reverse engineering implant bpos out of zombified corpses officially falls into the category of \"too weird for me\"."
"pls read above, it's crew bpo to be obtained by re.tnx"
"3-7 are all okay, but the rest is a little overboard. still though, supported."
"i am feeling pretty much the same as ashina sito about this. all in all supported."
"allow us to double-click an object in our overview or a bookmark in our peoples and places to warp to zero, instead of right-clicking and choosing."
"you don't want this.people would end up warping themselves when selecting the destination. may sound strange but it will happen. now, adding something like the \"ctrl/mouse click to lock a target in the overview\" kinda of a hot key for warping would work. instead of doing it on the overview you could do it on the bracket in space though."
"ok, a single well fit jamming boat would either be a rook or a falcon. so we are talking about a 90 million isk ship that has the ability to remove at most six 300k isk ships out of the fight. i believe this to be totally balanced, as obviously any tech ii ship (or tech iii) is going to be superior to a tech i ship.also, there is a counter if your being jammed, its called warping! (obviously unless you are pointed, then you are screwed. the ship can't continue to jam you if you have warped away, all you need to do is jump right back into the fight afterwards. if the jammer's didn't have that twenty second timer, all they would be good for is breaking the lock quickly for a few seconds, not enough to actually accomplish anything....my two cents"
"ecm is balanced imo. you already have to get close enough to be engaged by almost everything. i do agree other forms of ew need to be adjusted up a bit."
"no it's not. who told you that?be a man and control your drones yourself...? or don't bring them. besides, you kill things more efficiently when you focus fire anyway. when you start attacking a target, just tell your drones to attack the same target. doesn't sound all that complicated to me.(god, i'm a better drone pilot than most drone pilots and i only brought my drone skillgroup above 5,000 sp last week)"
"this. not supported. drone micro management is important. otherwise you will loose lots of drones."
"adding this feature would not only effect mission running but also pvp and pve (ratting). i think it's too much automation. we're already able to use hotkeys to attack, dock, and orbit.i vote no, sorry"
"let me see if i get the gist of your argument. you feel that the blob should be the be all-end all of eve? the very thought that your sniping battleship gang should be even remotely vulnerable to a numerically inferior force sends you to the forums. you sir, are quite pathetic."
"no, in apocrypha. they're usable now(hence the whining), not just after the upcoming patch."
"sorry... i have to agree with this.stealth bombers are easy prey provided you know how to deal with them.this smells of a whine post.... sorry.. not supporting."
"it takes alot of coordination and practice to use a bomber. if all that preparation didn't amount to being able to kill a few battleships, i don't think anyone would use bombers again. sorry not supported"
"bump and +3"
"hersch is a really good guy and deserves the support of all voters."
"one of my best friend in eve, i've helped you and shown you the bases in pve, i've seen you grow up in skills and knowledge in many diversified areas, not knowing different aspect of the game never stopped you finding any answers to any challenges that came your way.you have my votes with complete confidence.gem."
"i've played in his corp for a year. he has a strong sense of what happens in industry but also all of the trade / mercenary / wardec problems that go with it. he is also expanding his involvement with 0.0 based players, so i believe that he can provide constructive advice all-round while avoiding ideas that disadvantage players with different styles.irl a great guy who is interested in people too.3 votes from me."
"you got my vote..i am sure your views on economy and metagame will bring something to the table.."
"some comments about damar rocarion are unfair - he has killed me many times - i have heard him lose his cool but on other occasions he has been courteous and one one occasion that comes to mind even sympathetic. there are plenty of rude pigs in the caldari militia (even the odd one in ours) damar is not one of them.i am not going to vote for him because he seems only marginally interested in the complete imbalance between caldari and gallente plexes - perma jammed for 2 minutes by rats (happened to me yesterday) - can not be alluded to by his words \"npcs defending plexes need to be adjusted somewhat\". its a gross imbalance and needs too be fixed along with the obscene range on caldari battleship rats. without more precise details of how he thinks the imbalance needs to be addressed i could not vote for him.some of his other ideas such as encouraging plexing via reward have merit at the very least they need to be discussed.damar you have to specifically adress the imbalances for anyone in the gallente to support you - you may win a spot without our votes but if you want our respect then deal with issues of balance not just rewards."
"i think damar would make an excellent addition to the honorable institute that is the csm :)"
"voted! nice website btw!"
"friendly bump and +3 votes"
"i ran on a moddable ui as a big part of my last two campaigns, linking your thread both times to illustrate my point, and the only reason i'm not this time is that it was taken to ccp by csm3 and rejected(which didn't surprise me, but did make me a very sad panda). there's too many changes that need to happen for it to be useful for me to list them all in mid-campaign, but i do feel strongly about the topic, and will raise ui issues a fair bit if elected. that said, i'm hardly alone in that. if you want to vote on the ui, i think i'd be a good person to vote for, but there are others as well. we all play eve, we all know it needs work. here's hoping ccp finds room in their dev cycle for that overhaul soon."
"just vote for herschel cause he needs the votes and he's good candidate. i hope he gets in this time."
"as some said, it's hard for candidates to disagree that the ui need work. yet ehre is a point that we actually can disagree on: i would oppose a mod-able ui. strongly in fact. not that it will be an issue as ccp has allready rejected the idea. i like the fact that eve is not like other mmo where it is not the strength of your player skills that determine who wins but the strength of your ui modding powers..."
"qft.i want a new/changeable font asap. all if this is a long time waiting though."
"considering how many goons there are and how many alts they have, do you really think they care if you vote for them? do you think that they care that i voted for alekseyev karrde with all my votes(as everyone should)? ofcourse not. they have enough votes to get themselves in anyways. so quit complaining and go vote for alekseyev karrde."
"there are many different play styles in eve from the hisec mission runner to the market pvper. 0.0 is just as important (if not more so) than all other play styles. only those who are actively involved in that game can speak as experts about it. to ignore those candidates is to ignore their right to speak in how the game develops. you're choice to not vote for them is just that, your choice, but it does not make their views invalid, inferior or unimportant."
"i didn't see where he said to ignore null-sec. he just doesn't want a goon. there are plenty of other null-sec candidates to choose from. as for why he'd be against a goon for csm, well if you're familiar with the goons it should go without saying."
"who said do not vote for anyone in a 0.0 alliance? are you infering that goons are the only worthy 0.0 alliance? goons are similiar to criminalsyou also implied that the gameplay in 0.0 is more important that any other gameplay. how can one persons game be more important than anothers? they're both customers, paying the same amount in order to play. i was in a big 0.0 alliance. yes it was fun. but how is fighting for and defending sovereignty more important that any other parts of he game? i expect a response."

"consider this:1. only a rof bonus? you do know that rof bonus is a better damage bonus to torps than a pure bonus to damage right?2. besides stealth bombers, what other ship gets any other bonus to torps other than a rof bonus?3. would typhoon pilots continue to fit torps if they only got rof bonus to explosive damage torps and no other missiles, or choose to fit acs that get a rof bonus to all ammo types?"

"fully support idear !!very good one indeed"
"dynamically linking insurance to mineral prices to make sure that the insurance value is always around 5-10% less than the market value (barring extremely sudden, extremely large shifts, which are very unlikely imo) is the way forward, i think.of course this will almost certainly lead to an initial sharp fall in mineral prices. this inevitably means that miners will see a reduction in income. however, the current situation is that there is an oversupply of minerals. in short: we have too many miners. let the market decide how many we need and how much they should earn.however, there is certainly a very strong case for eliminating non-mining sources of minerals. specifically: rat loot. some reform of drone alloys might also be considered. replacing a percentage of the minerals from drone alloys with moon minerals, or even first-stage reactions might be a possibility."
"be careful with this idea too. in the missions against enemies that don't have bounties (i.e. drones or empire faction ships) the can loot makes up a significant portion of the income, especially with drones. missions of equal level and difficulty should have roughly equal overall value in terms of isk earned through all the various means (loot, salvage, bounties, mission reward, lp). dropping the amounts on the drone alloys should be buffered by an increase to the mission reward itself, or perhaps a tweak to what items they drop for salvage."
"replacing named item drops with named item bpcs (or some sleeperesque equivalent that could maybe also be used for invention) would not only eliminate the mineral supply but it would also increase mineral demand. additional bonus: looting missions wouldn't require so much cargo space.changing drone drops is a tougher issue, but tbh this should be debated in its own thread. this one is about insurance reform."
"of course it has been posted already. iirc, the answer was that the almighty server would not be able to handle all those drones, especially when looking at carrier bays.i'm still expecting the day drones are removed completely..."
"fully supported."
"drools"
"agreed. no support."
"i play eve to pvp and i have 2 alts i need to support that both pvp. finally i found the ability to make good isk by using one of my pvp toons to do the isk grind in a reasonable amount of time so i can ... you guessed it \"pvp\".the current set up allows me to log in, fly around to all the mission agents, run some missions and make some needed isk to \"pvp\". even though i find pretty much every isk grind method in eve mind numbly boring (including fw missions) this was at least something i could do in low sec with out having to run a high sec alt.now ccp wants to make it pretty much a waste of time just like every other isk grinding method in the game, just because a \"few\" exploit it.. big surprise really.hey ccp ask your self a damn question.. what in this game isn't farmed in some way or another for the much needed isk? why would fw missions be any different? why ruin it for those of us that finally have a way to make decent isk because a few abuse it?"
"agree with gar 100%. the ability to pick my mission is keeping me in fac war right now. and i do it all pvp, plex, and mission.the lack of a incentive to mission will pretty much seal the deal for me to leave fac war, and imho will lead to a lot less interest in low sec.bad idea to change this in dominion. this is my third stint in fac war, the first two times, i never bothered to mission because quite frankly it sucked. the changes were good and very needed."
"100% agree, as it stands right now fw missions are barely worth doing. any level of nerf will send people back to their highsec mission running hubs which will defeat the whole purpose of faction warfare.why is it so bad to let players pick the missions they enjoy running or find the most profitable. demanding that players run 4 annoying missions for every 1 fun or profitable mission is counter productive to the point of playing a game.if ccp must nerf fw missions at least put in some sort of viable alternative, giving lp for plexing or a small amount of lp for every enemy npc you kill, and a larger amount for every enemy player you kill.please ccp don't nerf this source of income for fw without some sort of viable alternative."
"1. you already get lp for killing wt. (i think that was added a while back)2. according to the discussion in test server feedback fw lvl4 missions can be done in a cruiser and give the lp of a normal lvl5. <sarcasm>geez you seriously need a buff!</sarcasm>3. fw lp store has prices reduced compared to normal lp store. need more buff?"

"1: we get [ship hull lp]x[ship tech level lp]x[pilot fw rank] devided among everyone on grid. or in actual gameplay, practically nothing. it would take years to save up for a faction bs, even with the reduced price.2: i highly doubt it. lvl2s and 3s can be done in af and bombers. all the people i see doing lvl4s in amarr/min fw are doing them in battleships. perhaps this person in the discussion was using a hac?part of the reason the payoff should be slightly higher, or at least the same: the lovely beacon that pops up in everyone's overview that calls every pirate and wt to a free km. 3: no argument there. the current (reduced) lp prices are fine, although a sliding scale based on rank might work too."
"dude you are lucky to get 100 lp for a kill of an enemy and that's actually pretty good for most. prior to my alt leaving fw i made about 5k lp's from kills and it took several months to get that.the lp's from kills is a pathetic amount.you are also missing the entire \"risk\" vs reward aspect in fw missions. the second you warp to a fw mission, \"anyone\" in system can see your mission plex and warp to it. fw missions are the highest risk missions in this game and should receive the highest payout because of it."
"please dont forget to check the support tick box.since a lot of ppl come here with a \"you farm those missons for lp\", this is not about the reward.if ccp thinks the reward is to high, just reduce it's payout.in my link some of you dont seem to bother to read i stated out something very important:so rather than gate camping/station games/or aimless roaming around your fleet will have an target system(s) an objective, as well an incentive to pvp.if you as an player are the opinion that i in fw am earning to much isk or better lp, feel free to shoot me! im in low-sec! not gate guns! no need for a scanner the beacon is visible to everybody, yes including neutrals!hey! that would be like ... a sandbox !"
"i have already been chased out of more than one mission, and participated in hunting down people in em. however, there isn't always possible to arrange for taking down a superior force of fw enemy targets. sometimes it's too many of them. worst case scenario your mission is in one of a number of enemy \"home\" systems, or heavily contested due to plexing ones. should really a single person have to fleet up beyond small gang scale just to complete this, and should other people have to follow him/her into it? a waste of time is what it sounds like to me. i came to fw to pvp, and that is what i want to do, escaping as much downtime due to plexing or missions as possible. i am for small scale pvp in missions or plexes, but i do want to be able to pick where the fight is happening, and i do not want it to happen in a system next to my enemy's high security border, that sounds stupid to me in every way except ccp logic, which i suppose is the superior force in this e-universe...sure, change the system if you want. reduce reward based on proximity to enemy high security zones for example. reduce reward in general. taking away the possibility to turn down missions however, would be killing the only good thing about these fw missions."
"exactly.. posting again because i forgot to check the support box..."
"supported."
"not supported for the following reasons...the problem is not that fw is farmed (all npc content is farmed- thats the point) the problem is that fw missions can potentially make 200-300 mill per hour. a figure many multiples higher then any other \"farming\" method of acquiring isk.the best solution would be to revamp faction warfare in its entirety. i hope this is planned because this \"fix\" is a band aid for the actual problem. (problem being faction warfare sucks)"
"if you all think that there reward is to high, lower the reward.browsing/cycline/failing/chosing hasnt anything to do with that.that only allows you to :* choose your target system to contribute to the occupancy/victory points* pick missions suiteable to your fleet/ship (and especially for newer players this can be crucial, and wasnt fw meant to be for newer players)"
"i support this. a lot."
"*thumbs up*"
"valid points"
"sandboxing is good"
"translation: whaaaah wahaaah dont nerf my income source!not supported.while i don't like to see fw missions go back to the previous state after all the lobbying i did to buff them, the current situation is unacceptable. ccp unfortunately was rather clueless and tipped them out of balance in the other extreme.fw needs to be sent back to the drawing board as basically all aspects of it are out of balance. until then, kill fw missions, until the triggers are fixed, the npc balance is fixed, and running them with neutrals is fixed.the whole idea of cherrypicking location is silly, in a war the central command tells you where to go kill the enemies, and shooting the same scarecrow in your own backyard over and over doesn't count."
"the current system is lame and needs to change. everyone is just taking the path of least resistance right now so that they can solo farm them while avoiding pvp. eve is not a solo game, and avoiding pvp while isk farming is not what low-sec is about.just nerfing the current system isn't so great either. there should be ways to earn isk in fw to replace losses or people have to resort to mission running or something else to keep them \"in the game\".put the penalty on decline in, as it always should have been, but:1. make the missions that take a gang to complete lucrative enough that people will start taking gangs out to do them. they should be worth several times what a mission that can be completed solo in low-sec is.2. escallate the value of one side's missions the more they successfully complete. this will provide more incentive to pvp.3. up the lp reward for enemy kills. factional warfare is about fighting for an npc faction against other players. there should be direct rewards for doing so. the better you are at it, the more you should make. your isk making potential in fw should be directly tied in every way to pvp, whether it's plexing, mission running, or just direct fleet-on-fleet combat."
"did you even read what i wrote?this is not about the reward. if you think the \"income\" is to high, lower the reward!central command consiting from a random system generator?central command that doesnt even take strategical or tactical decisions regarding the flow of occupany apart from randomly picking a system?shouldnt this be a player driven game, not a wowish go here kill ten rats?did you even read my posts?*edit*central command that even favours after dt play thus literally destroying the teamwork of a whole militia to a few ppl on at the \"correct\" time?"
"yes i did read your posts.maybe i should summarize them as \"waaah waaah don't nerf my easy income\" instead.i agree with davet517's post and statement."
"diaf you stupid ****."
"so working in a team and setting an player created objective within an sandbox is easy income and needs to be nerfed?you dont like the involvement of neutrals in fw?we have rr neutrals already in pvp. also ppl working together is now an exploit?those ppl still need to share the reward and if its an alt so what?ppl are multiboxing to increase their profit, thus multiboxing with an orca and a hulk to haul, give boni and get the roids is an exploit too?sandbox anyone? dont like it you can shoot me!its not like im farming lvl4 missions afk in a cnr in motsu and complain about my salvage.i just want to pick my mission regarding my player created objectives.if the reward is to high, lower the reward. the declining and \"picking\" missions is \"game mechanic and balacing -wise\" something different. they interact but can be examine independently and the \"picking part\" is not broken/unbalanced.lower the reward into obliviion - frag - but that's not my point.so you read my post, do you even understand them?"
"garr she's just a corp hopping fool. now if they put a 60 day timer on corp changing then she'd have her playstyle nerfed and would be complaining. her entire argument is a strawman. of course i'm going to proceed with the obligatory ad hominem attack for idiotic views on pvp and eve in general. ankh you are not on the csm anymore shut your cake hole and go get a life."
"walk me trough then how one is suppose to make a income if not by missions while in faction warfare.200-300m a hour sounds like a very generously overkill figure considering if it's done \"solo\". i've done missions myself and the rate at what you have to do em then must be close to industrial machinelike to reach that figure. now, i never done em on my own though, always in small gang but hey.. maybe i am a wave going against the current?i forsee someone infintetly more wise than me suggest.. kill wartargets!! oh yea sure! for the already mentioned 100lp per guy!? at best!! .. and no, besides that you don't get isk for killing em.i forsee someone even more infintely awesomely intelligent suggest.. get a alt!! trader alt, miner alt, missioner alt.. whatever sort of alt, just get one!! but isn't that sort of besides the point here? shouldn't we be discussing this from a player with a single accounts point of view.it is entirely possible for someone to loose 300-1bill worth of isk in a single fw battle, even more if you're very tenacious at it. how many 100isk fw targets do you have to take down in your t1 frigate to raise that sum of isk again, and be ready for another fight considering you don't quit fw and go back to highsec for carebearing. since that is the entire point of fw if i haven't missunderstood something.if i could raise 200-300m isk each our missioning i would do it, and it would have been awesome. i could have comitted countless battleships to each battle i took part in, and it would have been a blast. however i cannot, and i assume most people cannot either. this change will make it even less so. in all honesty, the risk to reward in fw missions can easily validate how fw missions work now, although i wouldn't mind if proposed change to actual rewards were considered. if your gang is small or you're alone you take a easy mission for a small reward. if your gang is big, you want big isk and big pvp, you browse for a mission with close proximity to danger and head on out there. say no to linear gameplay, and say yes to deciding on your own!"
"waaah waah i want to have recon in the same system as my mission agent too, all day long.it's too easy because the mission is completed almost instantly, with alts not in factional warfare, and/or flying cloaked stealth bombers in case of the minmatar/caldari.might as well a \"give me free loyalty points\" button. no matter if the rewards are reduced, the button shouldn't be there in the first place."
"guess i'll go back to empire and carebear.i don't do alts, i can't currentley sell plex (real life), i want to learn and get better at pvp but i need isk for ships and mods.in fw i mission, plex, and pvp (well get blown up anyway) all in lowsec.i guess i could drop corp/fw, mission in high sec for standings and isk and just join fw on the weekends, some people do.unlike alot of missions in highsec fw mission rats don't have bounties, i thought the little extra lp and being able to browse was a way to even things out./signed"
"either through running the exploration sites that now spawn in fw zones or by going back to highsec to mission every once in a while.i know fw costs a lot of money, hell, i spent countless billions on it and i left every once in a while to get isk back until i got myself some extra accounts to run afk-dominixes to rake in plenty of isk to support my habit.if you're smarter you can make much more money trading with your market alt so you don't even need multiple accounts.but yeah, exploration. your plexing ship comes with a probe launcher for a reason.i already told ccp that fw needs to be more sustainable so that people don't have to go back to highsec. but having an isk printing machine like the fw missions currently are, is not the solution, it's just another imbalance. i don't like to see them totally nerfed to hell, they should be a balanced income source, with a max income figure of around 50 mil/hr.npc balance has already been brought up by erik finnegan so we'll likely see gallente/amarr getting buffed and minmatar/caldari getting nerfed soon."
"(a) taking stuff to personal? loosing valid arguments in a discussion? you might want to reconsider your point of view(b) i'm sorry but having a fw mission in your missions agent system is not possible, at least not to my \"limited knowledge\" being in there from the start.if so that might be an exploit so you might want to bug report that.(c) ->\"alts not in fw remote repping all day long in pvp\" - news at 10\"corporation outside fw deccing corps inside fw all day long\" - news at 11\"alts hauling ore for hulk pilots in highsec all day long\" - news at 12 so what?they are in low sec - so why dont you just shoot them!but hey that would be like getting into pvp!but wasnt that point of fw - getting ppl into pvp?but \"big letters make better arguments; sorry i started it\" - news at 1edit:so lower the reward! in addition we get lp for missions. we trade them for items and then we have to sell them on contracts.if the items become more and more available the price will drop.the eve market will adapt. so the sandbox works fine.so your point was ?"
"if you need an alt in order to play a \"sandbox\" game then the game is broke, but it might make the company more money that way./still signed in support of op"
"you really don't get my point and just resort to flawed arguments don't you?no matter how in how many forums you crosspost your rabble, any reasonable csm will see that this is just driven by personal interest and has nothing to do with game balance.still not supported, stop your whining.fortunately you don't need alts to play fw. i haven't had alts for almost a year while i was in fw, and there weren't easy-isk missions back then. hell, lots of people played fw for a year without the missions, so why can't you?"
"so you are basically saying l4 fw missions should not be more profitable profitable (as in isk/hour) than l4 highsec missions yes? thats the way to do it - force everybody into highsec, great plan really...great do it! but after you change the number of hugh quality l4 fw agents!!!! explain to me why gallente have over twice as many positive quality l4 fw agents than minmatar and then we can talk about the missions itself being unbalanced!"
"personal interest in sandbox! how dare i try to make my own content! even though i totally willing to loose all the ingame incentive it might have by not getting any lps for what i want to do so that my selfish personallity can bath in ... what?trying to get my arguments past you?thanks for the bump then!"
"i'm not saying that anywhere, how did you get to that conclusion?fw missions are currently broken and should be temporarily removed until they can be reintroduced in a balanced way.i'd be in favor of balancing that aspect, yes.all nice but you have to keep in mind that this is not your personal game. thus your self-interest may not prevail over others when it comes to game mechanic changes. that is what the csm is all about. being neutral and looking at an issue from all perspectives. and from a neutral standpoint, these missions have to be brought in line, unfortunately.this is why no single csm will raise your issue, the majority of the csm will vote down this issue if it does happen, and why ccp game design will laugh at any csm that somehow manages to get it through anyway.summary: not gonna happen."
"where did i say that they do not need to get balanced?im just argueing that the current installation on sisi with having standing losses on decline for more than once every 4 hours is seriously counterproductive to what ccp originally seem to have designed fw.so rather than destroying the incentive and destroying a possible useable tool to create player created content within the game, a far more easy way to stop the farming and rebalance the reward with \"other stuff\" in the game would be just reducing the reward on the mission.but again, you dont get it, i dont get it either so we agree to disagree.you havent come up with any alternative ideas to balance this apart from \"soontm\" while my idea is a simple and easy way to bring balance and keep a new introduced game play feature within the game.and btw. even though this discussion is heated:\"okay, girl. you're not my nemesis. ... look, i'm just trying to change the world, okay? i don't have time for a grudge match with every poseur in a parka. ... besides there's kids in that park, so... \"so sail safe and watch your back."
"risk vs rewards folks.agree, fw missions and the ability to cycle missions have brought many people to low-sec and removing the ability to decline missions without penalty will just send folks back to empire."
"agree, full support."
"definitive support"
"this!this is just a new way of isk farming, plain and simple. you should not join fw to farm missions & lp. you should join it to pvp & fight the enemy militia and be rewarded with lp!"
"pirate!i don't understand why you're complaining though, the missions by all factions are still done in lowsec... i think this still brings it back to one of my arguments. even from a rp perspective, since there is a uniform chance of picking a \"reduced risk mission\" or a \"high risk\", i don't mind the vaklear generals calling me a ***** pod pilot if it helps me avoid enemy faction home systems, or pirate camps in bottleneck systems. i want the danger to come to me when i'm out trying to make isk on my own or in a too little gang to fight anyone who is out looking for ganks, not the other way round. i'm pretty sure everyone else who doesn't have a near infinite amount of isk available thinks the same in the long run. anything else would sooner or later drive people who aren't as resourceful out of fw, and into highsec, because unless you end up with a 0.0 corp who is willing to support you, that is the only alternative. i know at least the minmatar militia's oppinion on missions and plexing, i wouldn't hold my breath if i call for support in the general militia chan against anything that is outnumbering me more than 2-3 to 1. unless it's a huge blob, then it's sort of pointless trying to do missions regardless."
"there are a few things that we have to seperate from each other imho in this discussionrisk vs. reward balance.yes, even i think that the reward is a bit to high. i like it because right now the risk vs. rewards is pretty much balanced toward my playstyle but i do see that others are farming these to death and there is a too high influx of lp into the game.so reduce the reward to make them \"not worth\" getting farmed again. though that likely will be so low that there is harldy anything as reward left.picking picking missions in a target missions.fw missions were originally designed to contribute to the vp score of a system. having them being located randomly made them totally pointless as you couldnt really effectively contribute. see how hard we even struggle with our focused constellation plexing effort.being able to pick missions in a target system allowes now to contribute to this so this is imho a good change of the game.being able to decline missions without a standing loss.under the assumption that fw still should be an entry point for new(er) players to get their first step into pvp, not being able to complete your missions because you are a.) newb.) low skilledc.) start solo as everybodyyou might end up picking a mission in a system that is fw main battleground from the veterans in fw and you get podded repeatedly in there trying to do that mission.so you try and cant complete it because your outgunned and outskilled and then on top of it you get a heavy standing loss of the small amount you grinded together. that is not an incentive to try again for that new(er) player. he'll just drop fw and goes back to grinding missions in high sec.player vs players in a sandbox.a game imbalance is the difference in strenghts of the npcs in the fw missions and plexes. due to their choice weapons some are far more dangerous and more difficult to tank than others. this is something that ccp needs to fix and balance.a player imbalance is for example the price difference of a jaguar in jita vs rens. this is something the players have caused/created themself and something the players can \"fix\" and \"rebalance\" them self - if they try.now adapt this on factional warfare.the risk flying in fw and the reason why fw missions were originally designed so easy is because the main point was to get one militia player to fight the other militia player. one player should be the content for the other player.so if now one players is flying in fw and opening plexes and mission beacons visible to all, it is actually the other factions player duty to stop him from doing so.if now one side totally refuses to play at all (like the plex/occupancy game in caldari gallente fw) ccp is not trying to balance a player created imbalance and it doesnt look like they will. so people are picking missions in a system they like, with a reward they think is worth the risk encountering an opposing player, he is still out there and actually the opposing faction has everything in their own hands to stop this player from completing this mission. somebody suggested taking the reward out of the other players pockets, but basically you can do that by just preventing the other players faction to do their missions.its a player issue. if one side refuses to play, the other one scores, that simple.... more to come"
"lp inflation into the market is to high.fw missions dont give out isk at least not noticeable. fw npcs dont give out bounties. we have to buy faction items and then sell them on contracts.so basically we dont generate isk but rather redistribute it.if the supply of faction items/ships goes up the price will go down. eve markets has shown countless time that it was pretty stable and was able to adjust to the various changes that came. so the the price will drop the lp per isk reward will sink. more faction items will be availabale for more players and more players will fly faction ships. wasnt an increased usage of faction navy ships one goal and a reason to rebalance them ?another thing is that the \"lp price\" for faction items in the lp shop could have been adjusted. one thing that springs to my mind is that the discount is equal for everybody. how about making the discount relative to the achieved standing/rank with the militia.---so, here we are with a multitude things we have to balance versus each other and one very very simple approach would be to reduce the lp reward to rebalance it, but being able to \"cherry pick mission\" is imho not the broken part that needs fixing or needs to be nerfed.p.s.this 5min wait out is really terrible. please increase the character limit ..."
"myself having no first hand experience fromthe actual topic (fw / fw missions) you might want to disregard my input. however, the argued imbalance between input needed and rewards of fw missions cannot be solved through comparisons to \"normal\" mission running. the whole pve scene, be it in fw or outside, needs a thorough and wholehearted reconsideration and revamp.all pve content in the game needs to have their rewards lowered significantly. why, you may ask (even though the answer is pretty selfevident). the industrial side of the game is frowned upon by all the self-acclaimed pvp gurus to whom it is impossible to understand that being able to cut down on the costs of ships and equipment could, in fact, be considered the most player-versus-player-like activity in the whole game if only the isk genrating machinery of pve, incl. npc bounties and mission rewards, was turned belly up (or at least drastically nerfed).normal missions should be limited to early gameplay so that new players are able to learn how to handle their vessels and perhaps gain basic skillbooks and new kinds of ship equipment to learn how to use them in the future when they need to use the thus learned piloting skills in a pvp environment against other players.now the problem is that all artificial economic environments without need a money printer to ensure that the world does not run out of currency through e.g. ppl leaving the environment (the game). but the isk generator of eve should not disturb the foundations of any part of the gameplay.eve is a sandbox game or at least has aspirations to become one =p, but the current pve system makes mining, for example, not only boring but pretty pointless, too. in a fully functioning eve universe, the combat-oriented players would require the industrialists and the ones acquiring the raw materials, and the latter ones would depend not only on each other but on the fighters, too.i surely hope that solutions to exisiting problems within the game, i.e. the band-aid approach does not mean that game developers cannot see a wider picture. i also understand that ccp has no interest in losing paying customers due to nerfing pve content. but the end of the day, however, eve is not a good pve game, nor should it be. in the long run, we should see the game changing towards a many-sided, if not altogether \"transdisciplinary\" pvp game, where the combat and the production go hand-in-hand.we will not suffice with a sandbox, we want the whole effing saharathat all i really wanted to say, but a few words for laughs & inspirationthinking somewhat outside and regardless of the (sand)box, the sahara approach could mean player-run financial services (banking and insurance etc.), multiple currencies around the universe (the dustxxx console thingy could provide a means to introduce this), player-run nation (or racial) states with their own laws and regulations, democratically set and enforced (except for the amarr regions, ofc) and spaghetti monster knows what - topped with voice channel karaoke bars and ambulation-triggered poker rooms and ****ography. sky ain't the limit in space.sorry for drifting off-topic, but this is all related to fw missions - at least if we have a true sandbox b"

"hi there. i am a miner and i want mining to be a profession again which can compete to any others. right now, for highsec, mining is not profitable as lvl 4 missionrunning. in fact, it cannot beat it at all. here are some of my thoughts:i)disallow miners to be fitted to any other ship than mining cruisers and frigs. this would reduce the number of iterons mining afk greatly. for thus, introduce mining cruisers for amarr and gallente.ii) introduce some afk-system. if you are in space for some amount of time, lets say about 10 minutes, then your modules of your ship deactivate. it would also reduce people doing missions afk. the afk culture is too much for this game i think.iii)give us bigger giant secure cans. anchorable only for 4 hours. size around 25k m3 as example. exact numbers must be determined by ccp. iv)boost the defence of a miner. we need to be able to protect ourselves also in highsec when in a hulk. ganking hulks has become some sport. v) bumping hulks is an issue. but tbh, i have no idea what to do against. but those ppl follow you around und keep you bumping out of the belt. and you cannot do anything about it, except changing belts or system, which does not help always. vi) remove zydrine and morphit from drone loot. a miner has to go to nullsec/lowsec to get those minerals. a missionrunner can loot it in highsec from drones. no way to get my support for that. i do missions by myself. and i am not happy with it. this are my thoughts. i am glad for any other ideas to make mining worthy again. also in high security space. right now, i do not see any advantage of sitting in a hulk when i compare it to lvl 4 missionrunning in highsec space with all the loot, bounty and salvage. regards"
"you missed by far the biggest competition that miners have: minerals from reprocessed rat loot. replace all rat loot with named me0 pe0 bpcs, with a small chance of 3- or 5-run bpcs and you not only eliminate a source of minerals that produces about half as much as miners do, but you will also actually increase mineral demand as well. i would suggest that the named items have their mineral compositions changed so they use a very high proportion of mid ends, specifically nocxium.just removing high-ends from drone loot altogether would totally cripple the drone regions. in my insurance thread i suggested replacing a percentage of the minerals with moon materials as a possible alternative. faction drone bpcs are another."
"thanks for your reply. yes, i did not mention reprocessing modules, because i did not have any solution for it. your solution is a good idea. for drone loot: adding moonminerals may be a solution but in the end, it would affect moon-mining. bad idea for my mind. i think it would be better to introduce new loot to drone regions where you can reprocess high ends from. regards"
"that's idiotic. you nerf the terrible one-miner iteron(estimated profit per hour: 450,000 isk or less), but also destroy the 8-miner battleship, the veldnought and veldatar, and just generally destroy the entire concept of fitting generic modules to any ship you want. also idiotic. doubly so the way you phrased it, which would imply my guns turning off every 10 minutes in pvp, but even if i assume you meant \"if you're afk\", it's still dumb. the game can't tell if you're afk, and sometimes your domi just doesn't require human input. not a terrible idea, but really, the orca was intended to be what you want, and it does a good job of it. rokh. 8 mining lasers. orca nearby. full shield tank(with cpu mods in lows). you now have zero need to fear suicide gankers. fit an afterburner on your miner rokh. you really don't get all that much of it. mission loot needs to be looked at, but not for reasons of \"they get minerals i don't!\". no support."
"yeah its terrible. but an afk industrial mines. when you are not able to activly play the game, you should not be able to generate isk from roids. period. and for bs-mining.. i do not support it. tbh. it was meant only for afk-people, not for those activly playing. and yes, a game can see if you are there or not. yes the orca is good. but i need a second person for that which splits my income which is already very low compared to soloing lvl 4. why should i mine with a rokh when i have a hulk? i can get this minerals too by doing missions. but the risk of a lvl 4 is not comparable of the risk a miner has to take in nullsec to get it.please take this into account.regards"
"you have provided no argument for your view.battleship mining is not normally an afk activity because the cargohold is not particularly large. it does not take 10 minutes to fill the hold."
"i think mining is a profession, just like pirates, missionrunners etc. if i train mining i cannot fly missions with a hulk, but i can mine with 8 miners in a battleship even high-end ore? i think this needs to be tuned. we could also restrict normal miners to veldspar and scordite."
"you would be surprised how well a hulk can do level 3 kill missions..."
"before even argue futher.... pls read the dev blogs about the new patch... they announce that there will be introduced a new kind of ore. called 'king arkornor\" and similar named ores. i assume they have better refining rates. so mining get a boost... but only in 0.0 where there is more risk involved mining vs afk mining in high sec. now before u say high sec income is poor blah blah thats true but eve is a game of risk and reward... live with it orelse wow ---> that way"
"thats a lie!. you are doing it seriously wrong.here are some of my thoughts:omg. yes. afk mining ittys are definitely a threat for any serious miner! *lol*amarr -> arbitratorgallente -> vexor*facepalms* it is called orca. well you can try to tank your ship properly. but nothing in eve is 100% safe. that does include mining. bumping miner is fun. :dlet me guess you flame them in local and ask them why they are doing it? thats like pumping oil into the fire. ;) i highly doubt that there are enough mission runner in highsec to sustain the market for those minerals needed for production.my last words for you:1. if you are doing claims. invest a little bit of time into research. (mining cruiser)2. not everyone is willing to train up for an exhumer/mining barge for the occasional mining op with their corp. mining bs + orca are a nice help to get enough minerals for e.g. carrier. you shouldnt punish people for that.3. a single hulk pilot with an orca next to him can easily get 8-10m/hour in *highsec*. thats about the same isk/hour an average mission runner has.=> bring a friend."
"i guess i'm not sure i understand this point of view in a game in which warp disruptors exist. if i'm ratting in a belt in nullsec (and not paying attention to local, which is a regularly enforced capital crime!) and a hostile lands near me and points me, then i am locked in combat until i blow up or blow him up (or drive him off if i'm carebearing with no point). and in this case, i don't even get a chance to 'commit' by aggressing; i'm locked into combat the second the hostile acquires a lock on me.in light of that, why do you feel it's particularly heavy-handed to create mechanics that are less severe at stations? allowing a pointed ship to escape by docking even after being pointed (so long as they haven't themselves aggressed) is pretty mild by comparison. allowing them to dock 'at will' with a minute's lead time seems overly easy by comparison. surely you don't feel that warp disruptors and scrams should also be removed from the game because they lock you into a fight that you might not win, right?and by the way, even after aggressing, you are no more 'locked in combat' by this mechanic than you are at that belt. if you are in a fast ship, or if you have the right kind of ew, or if you have some support from ships with the right kind of ew (which could include webs, damps, ecm, or even a warp scram to shut off the hostile's mwd) then you can break their point and warp away normally.tl;dr: if you think this mechanic is too severe, compare it to being warp scrambled at a belt."
"which is why i don't start fights i can't definitely win in a belt or at a planet. compare trying to bait someone into a belt, gate, and station, then apply the sucess rate of belts to the entire game. currently the majority of pvp in eve happens at gates, and the point is this change would extend the belt situation to gates and stations as well, which is a bad idea because it means more blobbing, less willingness to engage, more falcon alts etc and more general ***gotry that sucks the fun out of pvp in the first place.edit: just try and imagine for a second how much harder this would make engaging a larger gang, especially in hostile territory. now i'm aware that is a concept that is totally unfamiliar to the vast majority of eve, but some people don't enjoy being a part of blobs, and especially don't enjoy having to avoid a fight purely because the other side brought more numbers. all this change would do, especially for the gates side of things, is make that situation even harder to manage for the smaller side. then again perhaps that is the motivation for supporting this change, if that is the case, it makes me sad to see so many supporting it. the notion that people should be punished for attempting to engage in a fight in a game like eve is one of total insanity."
"a very nice and smooth solution to what has been an annoying feature for years now."
"people won't; why would they? congratulations, you have just destroyed risk vs reward.it's hard enough getting people to engage on remotely close numbers as it is even on a station, and after 1-2 bait -> ganks it'll become totally pointless to engage anything unless you know you can win; at which point the other side refuses to engage as the balance is no longer in their favour. all i'm doing here is using your own hypotheses, which is the amazing thing. as people in this thread are so fantastically keen on pointing out, under this change people shouldn't be engaging unless they're sure they can win, but both sides can't be sure to win the same fight.the amount of idiocy and self contradiction on these forums is honestly mind blowing."
"while i dont think docking games will be a huge problem in dominion station ping-pong (have you seen how fast someone dies in a 150 vs 150?) i do think that docking games is broken and a fix is well overdue.note that i think this mechanic should only apply to stations. an rrbs fleet who is loosing badly should still be able to save some guys by deaggro and jump."
"dumb idea. firstly because you slyly included remote rep aggro in there.remote repping anywhere should not prevent you from docking or using gates - logistic ships have a hard enough time surviving as is. secondly, the biggest problem i have with war targets is them docking and not undocking, or docking and redocking before they engage. this doesn't solve that problem. once you leave station, you should be dedicated to the situation. and there should be a timer immediately applied if anyone engages you, whether or not you engaged them. stations shouldn't be seen as santuary, but as a place to put your ****. that's it.if you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen (or just stayed docked) not supported without an extended timer for any engagement."

"the situations are not compareable, really. if i'm tackled at a belt, i am a) not very smart as i had enough of warning seeing you in the local channel and b) in a pve ship, so not able to fight back with too much efficency (though if i'm ratting in 0.0, i'll have some means to try and break away)if i engage at the station, i am willing to enter risk, however, the proposed changes would increase that risk to a degree that'd be bad for the game, e.g. noone would engage unless they can be sure to win. and with cynos (covops cynos for jammed 0.0 systems), neutral repping alts and whatnot, making that sure is nigh impossible.currently, engagements on a station have pros and cons for the attacker and the defender.the attacker...... can dictate the range. you can get your e-war into proper position, keep your lighter ships out of web range etc., while the defender is forced to have his entire fleet sit at the same spot....has the initiative. you can roam around with the intent to horribly gank someone with having a bunch of capitals/neutral rep alts on standby, but you don't really have a swarm of similar ship ready to jump in as soon as a hostile enters local (unless you're a large, well organized 0.0 alliance)the defender...... has ships to match the enemy fleet in stock (ideally)... can retreat into the station if the enemy can't break him in time(though note that the attack might aswell dock, unless it's a 0.0 outpost, whichshould favour the defender anyway)... doesn't need to warp in, which takes a while.taking most advantages of the defender away while doing nothing for the attacker would imbalance this unhealthilythese proposed changes would lead to an immense increase in the usage of new \"guaranteed-success\" tactics, amplifying into making a cap-fleet on standby or a good amount of neutral reppers mandatory if you want to engage and stand a chance of winning. it would serve to further the usage of massive blobs. which, given that titans are losing their aoe dd, will be prevailent in the upcoming future, moreso than before."
"not good.the system as proposed is vulnerable to being exploited with logonski attacks. i undock, you shoot at me, i shoot at you, then your five buddies log on, e-warp to the station, and i'm toast.you could fix this and make it more viable, though still somewhat vulnerable to logonskis if you made it so that my timer resets and i cannot dock as long as someone that i agressed is still shooting at me.that way, in the scenario above. i undock, you undock, i shoot at you, you shoot at me, your five buddies logonski, my five buddies undock and pop you, or i pop you myself. i dock.yes?"

"i have to agree with this minmatar terrorist."
"you can train torps without a specialization in rockets or hams is your point. my point is that you can not train a specialization in both cruise and torps without training both t1 cruise and torp to 5 first. not so with guns. if you do the math across any one weapon system it takes longer to train both long and short t2 missiles in any class than the same class of guns. care to debate that?can we also nerf all drone ships that get a bonus to at least 4 sizes of drones? why should a dominix and all other drone boats with a big enough bay get a bonus to all (light,medium, heavy and sentry) drones? no problem there, can we also get instant damage as a compromise?gallente get to have cake (drone damage across all sizes) and eat it too (all damage types) then sit back and call others whiners.classic."
"still missing it i see. as i was saying if you change a thing in the way the skills progression work, you should change all (and not only the part convenient for missile users).so if your hypothetic changes were to be implemented you should get the whole package, from a single skill to learn t1 long and short range missiles to a longer progression to learn the large specialization shield missiles instead of jumping steps.seeing that the comment was in reply to your proposal to do that, yes, it is exactly what i mean.already put in the original comment.my dear whiner, you have ever got your main weapon destroyed by enemy fire?not a few shots, the whole weapon?your whole suggestion is aimed to get the drawbacks of missiles removed without paying anything. essentially you want a super weapon do it all."
"i agree with the op. i cant say that i get your point. missiles are rather flawed at the moment, and could do with improvements, without turning them into a super weapon.i think op basically wants missiles to have more use in pvp by making them quicker (supported) and have skills affect explosion size for all missiles (supported). this hardly makes it a super weapon.furthermore, i agree that training all missile skill specs take a lot of time in comparison with gunnery skills. support gunnery skills (apart from controlled bursts) also have uses over 3 weapon platforms, while all missile support skills only have a use on 1 weapon platform to begin with. a few missile support skills also do not support the whole weapon platform. this makes the skills rather crippled for their training time.so basically, while the whole idea could use some working on, i do support this issue."
"no one but you sir has proposed \"homogeizing\" guns and missiles. it is a term you introduced into this thread as your interpretation of my intent. i do not want missiles to be exactly like guns. please refrain from continuing to argue how to make missiles exactly like guns in this thread and start your own thread on that subject.what i do propose is that missile systems should be adjusted, as a matter of balance, with respect to modules that improve and disrupt their performance (tc,te,tl,td), as well as skills (gmp) that improve all missiles and not just half. it would also make for better game play if they were more useful in small gangs and fleets (more velocity).i do not believe there is any imbalance created by such changes if made as a whole. missile improvement mods would be self regulating with concern to balance just as tracking mods are now on guns. you sacrifice fitting other modules to get the improvement.you have not argued any of my proposals on the merits of the changes themselves. you simply keep parroting that they do not make missiles exactly like guns. debate the changes on their merits if you like but please stop trolling.i beg forgiveness for the use of the word \"mainstream\" as it obviously has caused a bunch in your undergarments. in an effort to make the title snappy, i seemed to have developed some new form of troll bait.your objection is duly noted. now either stick to the subject or go make your own thread on how to make missiles exactly like guns.moderators notified"
"it is the argument of your whole idea.you request is to make missiles practically identical to guns, only with a different name. i extended your proposals to the logical conclusion to show what you were aiming at. and it is not balanced simply because your way of changing missile is aiming to get guns with the added bonus of choosing the damage kind at will."
"i agree with all of the ideas in the op. i myself am a pvper whose skills are focused on missiles, however i have found it very difficult to be an effective pvper with missiles and would like to see them get a boost to put them more in line with the pvp capability of drones and guns"
"the only acceptable pointwhere is my equivalent of the guided missile precision skill?target size reduce my chance to hit and the quality of my hits. i would greatly like to have a skill that will increase the signature of my targets.you (missile users) have 2 skills helping with the target motion and size: target navigation prediction helping with target speed (roughly equivalent to the tracking of guns) and guided missile precision, helping with target size. gun users have 1 skill: motion prediction, helping with turret tracking. and the modules helping with tracking (again), to compensate for the missing skill helping with target size. i would greatly prefer a skill to a module. after i have learned the skill it is always available, modules are dependent from energy and space. and, btw, you are asking for your module to increase both explosion speed and explosion radius. greedybeing contrary to 2, adding 3 would be a non sense. maybe you have missed it the thousand of times it has been repeated: eve engine can't manage missile (and ships) higher than the current without acting \"funny\" (being broken were the words a dev used).that the main reason for the speed nerf and the missile formula changes. all the above are well know information.taken singularly your requests aren't so outrageous, together you are asking for a huge buff of missiles without real drawbacks or are simply inapplicable.to \"resolve\" thing the way you want them resolved it would require to make missile guns under a disguise. but then it would require to remove the missile advantages too to balance them."
"first of all thank you for responding to this thread and not the one featured in your imagination. secondly, thank you for conceding this point. i \"think\" i see an inconsistency here. first you agree that gmp should apply to all missiles...then you say the skill itself is unbalanced. dubious.guns do not need good tracking to hit a smaller target that is not moving or which is moving with insufficient radial velocity so as to overcome the guns tracking (turning) speed. this is why a frig siting still or moving in a strait line toward or away from a bs can be insta popped.in a recent post,taja calaren described the difference quite clearly:"
"so you are saying the only reason there are mods to assist tracking is because there is no second skill to improve tracking? to make up for a skill that would add no more than 5 to tracking per level, turret users get tracking computers, enhancers and links? my god!based on this logic i would gladly give up gmp for access to those modules for missiles. so you would support doing away with those modules in exchange for a skill for turrets similar to gmp? please make that proposal in your own post. i will support it.missile tracking,(i know there is no such thing) unlike gun tracking is dependent on both inputs unlike guns.this is blatantly incorrect. the posts i have read refer to missiles acting \"funny\" during prior attempts to reduce damage based on target speed and missile explosion velocity not missile velocity. i am sure of this, but if you could link this mysterious dev post refering to missile velocity i would love to read it.there now. that was not so hard was it? glad to see we agree. now go wash your mouth out. i hear crow taste bad."
"the csm is not working well, if at all. ccp originally introduced the csm after the debacle when it was found that ccp developers were cheating in game and the person who exposed the cheat, (the forum blanks his name, it is \"ku gut sumen\" without the spaces), was permanently banned. since then the csm has been devolved by ccp to simply become a group of players who are charged with bringing player requested changes to ccp's attention. ccp has no obligation to implement or even answer to any of these requests, and often doesn't.and therein lies the rub. ccp takes the player base's money and offers no accountability for it. ccp's developer-player comunication, in the form of the forums, as in the case of the latest naglfar and mothership nerf, often just lead to massive threadnaughts with posts getting deleted or players getting warned for expressing their anger and no final resolution.none of this gets us, the player base that provides ccp with its funds, anywhere. it also reduces ccp's creditability amongst the players.proposalscrap the csm. it is simply ineffective and a continual source of frustration for the players as well as the csm members themselves.extend the current proposal voting system so that vote counts are tallied, with one vote per player per proposal.on a regular basis, initially monthly, take a set amount of proposals with the highest number of votes and implement them. the implementation is obligatory and if technically unfeasible the developers are obligated to explain why to the player base, here, or in a new section of the forum.the number of player requests would have to be adjusted to fit in with ideas originating from ccp itself and these would take priority, say on a 60/40 basis.the monthly proposals would be divided into two groups. new game feature requests and bug fixes. bug fixes are currently working features that make no sense, such as the 100km look-at limit.to avoid abuse by players, developers are required to give an estimation of how long any new game feature request would take, and adjust the implementation priority based on that. bug fixes take the highest priority.on a regular basis, once every six months, this system would be reviewed and adjusted to better suit the workload on the ccp developers and the realities of feature development and player demands.proswould do away with a major source of player frustration by enforcing a certain amount of accountability on ccp's partwould give players a feeling of getting better value for their moneywe wouldn't have to listen to ccp explaining various nerfs in terms of \"balance\". if cp is unable to explain exactly how their concept of balancing works, the voting system can simply undo or change that featurethreadnaughts would be less a waste of ascii/utf-8ccp nozh would get get less hate on the forumscons:i can honestly only see some uncomfortable, but not bad changes for ccp.ccp will have to act more like a corporation that listens to its shareholders, where we, the player base who provide ccp's financing, would be the \"shareholders\"ccp would be forced to publish a list of development prioritiesthe system will certainly be rocky in the beginning, but i believe it will improve with time as things settle down.i would appreciate your ideas, modifications, and votes on the proposal."
"the problem here is that many proposals are put forward which are impractical to implement. also, given the relatively small percentage of players who even bother with the forum and the even smaller fraction who bother to check this part of it, such a voting method would hardly be much less representative than the current csm. it would also be extremely sucseptible to manipulation.and at the end of the day ccp would never bind themselves to outside authority in the way you suggest. you're conflating \"listening to the customers\" with \"doing whatever the customers tell you\". any parent can easily explain the difference.you assert that \"the csm is not working well, if at all\". on what basis do you say this? ccp regard the csm as a mechanism for player representatives to make suggestions and voice concerns in a more formal, structured and accountable way than forum rabble-rabble. the csm was never intended to run the game. if you think it's failed because it doesn't have final authority, then you are the one who has failed to understand what it is for in the first place.in short: your expectations are unrealistic, and in the unlikely event that they were implemented, would quickly destroy the game. not supported."

"currently, t2 battleships just don't have a role in conventional pvp. blackops ships are extremely specialized and are really only useful for the covert jump bridge generator, while marauders are specialized pve ships too expensive for what they do to be really useful in pvp (and the reduced sensor strength appears to be a deliberate attempt to keep them away from pvp). what we need is a t2 battleship class designed to be taken into pvp to just straight-up kick ass in the same way that assault frigates do for frigates and heavy assault cruisers do for cruisers (please don't get started on assault frigate balance, that's beyond the scope of this post). as an extension of the tree that goes from assault ships to heavy assault ships (and to be completely honest, picks up force command ships on their way through the battlecruiser hulls) i propose the main assault ship, based on the racial tier 3 bs hulls. here is a sample ship i put together:caldari t2 main assault ship: gargoylehull: rokhcpu: 860powergrid: 16,000slots:hi - 8med - 6low - 5launcher hardpoints: 3turret hardpoints: 8rig slots: 2calibration: 400 pointsdrone capacity: 125m3drone bandwidth: 125mbit/secstructure: 8,000 hpcargo capacity: 300m3armour: 7,500 hparmour em damage resistance: 50%armour explosive damage resistance: 10%armour kinetic damage resistance: 34.375%armour thermal damage resistance: 58.75%shield capacity: 10,000 hpshield recharge time: 2,600 secondsshield em damage resistance: 0%shield explosive damage resistance: 50%shield kinetic damage resistance: 70%shield thermal damage resistance: 80%capacitor: 6,400 gjrecharge time: 1,250 secmaximum targetting range: 100kmmax locked targets: 7targeting speed: 8 secscan resolution: 80mmgravimetric sensor strength: 28 pointssignature radius: 510mmax velocity: 94 m/seccaldari battleship skill bonus: 10% large hybrid optimal range and 5% shield resistance per level.main assault ship skill bonus: 5% large hybrid damage and 5% large hybrid rate of fire increase per level.skill requirements:caldari battleship v---caldari cruiser ivmain assault ship---heavy assault ships iv---advanced weapon upgrades vshield management v---engineering iiiif anyone has any suggestions about a better class name i'd appreciate it (i considered ship-of-the-line, the old naval term for a main battleship, but found it too clunky).thoughts?"
"good post, i like the example, you failed to mention the price for this beast and i sure you noticed that the price increase from t1 hulls to t2 is huge for cruisers (10x) and even more for frigs. by that scale, maurauders arent that bad. i don't know how much pvp you have done but moving around in a bs through enemy space in anything but a blob fleet is almost suicide, no matter what the individual capability of the ship is. i would like t2 bs but in my experience having a t2 bs is unlikely to be beneficial in pvp, you will just provide a much juicier target."

"there's no hotkey to launch drones."
"i would like to see a new command for drones that would allow a pilot to instruct his/her drones to orbit a \"target\" without actually engaging it in combat. that would make it quicker to engage in combat if it becomes neccessary, it could also be used to trick a pilot into firing on me at an inappropriate time/place."
"i r confuze.for some reason i get it. but i dont.it's potentially possible... but really? what use is it? is there a use for this? 0.0? might as well just attack. lowsec? might as well just attack. highsec? might as well just attack... if not just scare them off."
"could be useful for dealing with can flippers or other types of games in high sec,but if we were to get new drone commands i'd rather get a \"launch undamaged drones\" command."
"i agree with this. there have been a few times i've wanted my drones to go to a certain ship, whether to be near an opponent if he makes an aggressive move or to fly toward the enemy that's out of range so they'll be able to attack quicker when he gets in range. approach would be a good term, but orbit is also acceptable.supported."

"i know drones are already op as it is, especially on many gallente ships, but i think that this idea would add quite a bit of diversity into ship fits.i propose a small extra section of the fitting window, separate from the large ring, sort of a little window at the top with 3 slots in it.it's basically a separate rig system, but specifically targeted on modifying your drone bay. two of the same drone bay upgrades can not be fitted at the same time.a bar underneath would show how much drone cpu you have left (calibration)there won't be any sizes for these upgrades, but instead, some of the bonuses will scale with the ship size. the upgrades themselves would be listed under ship modifications > drone bay upgrades, and would be manufactured using the same salvaged parts that are used to construct the currently available drone rigs.note: i'm not sure on this one detail, there are already modules for increasing drone speed/control range. should they be converted to drone bay upgrades or left as is, and no drone bay upgrades should be created to mimic those upgrades.note: drone cpu (from here-on referred to as dcpu) is set at 1000 for most ships, 750 for t2 ships, 900 for faction ships and certain drone-based ships (e.g vexor, myrmidon, dominix, arbitrator)examples:name: drone bay expander idcpu cost: 400bonus: increase drone bay capacity (frigates: 5m3, cruisers: 10m3, battlecruisers: 20m3, battleships: 30m3)name: scout drone weapon upgrades idcpu cost: 300bonus: increases the following stats for all scout (light/medium) drones: damage dealt (not modifier) by 7.5%, and rof by 7.5%name: drone processor upgrade idcpu cost: 500bonus: increases drone mb/s (frigates: 5mb/s, cruisers: 10mb/s, battlecruisers: 15mb/s, battleships: 20mb/s)name: drone propulsion stabilizers idcpu cost: 200bonus: increases drone movement and orbit speed (25% for scout drones, 35% for heavy drones)name: sentry drone internal weapon control cpu idcpu cost: 250bonus: increases sentry drone tracking (12%) and rof (5%)name: drone bay micro-shield extenders idcpu cost: 200bonus: increases scout drone shield hp (50%), increases heavy drone shield hp (25%)name: drone bay power relaydcpu cost: 500bonus: decreases drone mb/s by (frigates: -5mb/s, cruisers: -15mb/s, battlecruisers -30mb/s, battleship -50mb/s) in exchange for +10% capacitor recharge ratename: armor logistics drone upgradesdcpu cost: 250bonus: increases amount repaired by all armor maintenance bots by 20%name: shield logistics drone upgradesdcpu cost: 250bonus: increases amount boosted by all shield maintenance bots by 20%afterthought: i know that drones are already very powerful and useful, but i'd like to see more fitting variety and more frigates/cruisers using drones. thus, i propose that all of the bonuses applied directly to drones (not sacrificing drone mb/s for cap) are halved for t2 drones.so, what do you guys think...viable idea subject to change?constructive criticism?horrible idea?i've got my flame shield hardener iii on so go ahead and flame away if you wish"

"ninja edit: the ishtar and domi can already field a full set of heavies. for hyperion/mega this would only boost their drone bays to about 100 m3, enough for 10 mediums, 20 lights, or 4 heavies."
"i dont think you should have a seperate drone cpu. if you're going to be able to install drone bay modules, i think they should have a fitting cost in terms of normal powergrid and cpu (and these costs will be rather hefty), while also implementing a rig drawback.i do agree with the idea of giving ships a few extra fitting slots in the spirit of \"drone bay fitting slots\". however, i do not think that these \"drone bay fitting slots\" should be limited to drone bays, but could be extended to every specialised bay, like your ammo bay, fuel bay, cargohold, etc."
"another different fitting limit, and another weird set of restrictions on what can go where, is not the right approach here. this change is better performed with traditional modules using traditional pg/cpu, than with your new \"dcpu\" modules."
"jita local chat is completely out of control. the isk spammers have been pulling out all the stops and flooding that systems local chat with advertisements for their ill-gotten goods like there's no tomorrow (which i really hope is the case once the right click to report spammers option hits).with that in mind i propose ccp implement any of the following measures as a stopgap until dominion and the above mentioned feature goes live:a. mute jita local chat entirely.b. switch jita local to moderated mode and appoint veteran members of the player community as temporary moderators.c. same as above, except just appoint veteran players as temporary moderators of jita local.d. station a developer, isd member, gm, or some other representative of ccp in jita permanently to be able to ban the spammers on sight.e. implement the right click to report feature early through use of an emergency patch.f. prevent any character on an account that is not more than 25 days old from speaking in jita local chat.g. strip trial accounts of the ability to speak in local if the number of players in system exceeds a certain threshold, say, 50.h. impose a two post per minute limit on local chat. make it so that the excess posts just vanish, but are seen locally so that the spammers still think they're flooding the channel, but really aren't.i. temporarily expand the gm ranks with members who's only duty is to respond to, and watch for isk spammers in jita and other trade hubs.j. start paying an isk bounty, claimable only by players on accounts greater than 30 days old, to the first person to report a new isk spammer. make it a trivial yet somewhat meaningful amount like 500k isk in order to combat the player apathy because of how annoying it is to report through the current system.k. release an emergency patch that allows players to ignore chat, invites, mail, and anything else coming from characters less than 5 days old unless that character has been placed on a white-list (for instance, if you invite a friend to try eve before dominion is released).l. freeze the creation of new characters until dominion is released.m. moderate the creation of new characters until dominion hits. make it so that a gm has to at least glance over a list of names and approve them before they can actually be logged on to.n. try aggressive take-down tactics such as those used by the mpaa and riaa to get the advertised isk spammer sites knocked offline. put those tactics to good use for a change.o. if ccp has another operation in the works like operation unholy rage, unleash it for gods sakes so those damned spammers shut up!anything else would probably do, but at this point its important that ccp just do something!"
"silly arbitrary limit."
"how about 249km....thought it was the kind of obvious one, see as far as you target.fake edit: silly 256 bit overflow limit, 257 is for kids."
"thank you :)"
"i'm not protective of him as a person, i'm protective of the ideal that is take care, and the potential that the csm holds for eve as a game and for the gaming industry as a whole."
"zod, i used the csm vote match- and our opinions match 67%. plus we agree on many key issues, and thus i've decided to throw the weight of my 2 accounts behind you. best of luck, and hope you deliver."
"j ai voter bonne chance a toi!!!"
"+1 for me.z0d is the guy you would like to play with, always ready to give help, support, and aswers.vote zod !"
"perhaps it would be possible to reduce the number of ecm ships spawning in plexes. however, often times when someone has complained to me personally about being permajammed, is when a gallente has been in the plex and is chased off.as we know, this triggers full npc spawn. now, situation is perhaps that a cruiser sits alone in a plex when hostile battlecruiser comes along and looks for easy kill. however, now with full spawn inside, it's pretty likely he will be jammed the moment he enters. and then we get lolmails like executioner killing an abaddon.of course, sometimes i've had to credit people like val erian for essentially saving my life in this way, such as when i killed two pirate battlecruisers with a caracal.that aside, i'm ready to agree that caldari npc ecm could be toned down. amarr/gallente npcs need boosting somewhat to remove their current weakness, which is speed tanking t1 frigate capturing an offensive plex. after all, even caldari npcs can be kite tanked and i know gallentes do it.damar rocarionbrigadier generalp.s: i'm also still waiting for ankh to actually prove any of his accusations about bugging timers and flying cloaked/stabbed ships. so far, she has only proved that she herself flew such things"
"i would not vote for you because of the lack of experience in pos warfare and sov mechanics. while the fw stance is appreciated, it isn't the entire game. a wider scope of experience is something i feel a csm should strive for.good luck in the polls, damar."
"too bad it has already been proven many times over and everyone can look for the proof themselves.what damar, his corpmates, and his alts have done, is use a cloaked ship in combination with warping out / logging off to keep the timer running, while moving on to the next plex. i worked closely with ccp to get this exploit fixed and ccp is aware of the caldari having used this exploit to their advantage.there still is another exploit going on which involves running timers without being present. this exploit has been used by the caldari to capture all gallente plexes while keeping their own decontested, and is still being used to prevent the gallente from capturing any systems back. after the timer has run down in its exploited state, the plex itself becomes bugged and will not respawn until downtime. which is why the gallente could never find plexes in systems they wished to contest/decontest and why the caldari won by focussing on after-dt plexes almost exclusively.unfortunately, despite erik finnegan and my efforts to inform ccp of the situation, they are still not dedicating much time to fixing fw issues, and this exploit is recently also used being on the minmatar-amarr front causing a great deal of frustration.initially i was against resetting the fw front on the gallente-caldari side, but seeing that the caldari won solely due to exploits, npc and reward imbalances, i think even fw \"expert\" damar would agree that the current situation is unacceptable and has to be reset (after everything gets fixed and those responsible are banned), do you not?"
"despite all the foaming about 'personal agenda', the biggest personal agenda i'm seeing here is ankh's, who clearly hates damar and is doing everything in his power to derail the campaign train"
"i am doing what is best for eve as a whole.and i'm not the one running for csm nor the one posting with a bunch of nameless alts.i don't need to derail his campaign train though, as that is already a wreck and damar doesn't have a chance in hell to win a seat in the csm. he has an unlikeable personality and is despised even by the majority of the caldari militia due to his obvious personal agenda and constant emo raging."
"posts like these just proves that you have no idea what is happening in fw."
"i too, am in love with damar, and will vote! srspoast: voting for damar, i trust that he will try his very best to make fw better(oh and, thanks for making eve better (didnt you take credit for fw missions ankh? turning fw to huge carebear fest))"
"+1 damar"
"i must say i'm impressed that if a person i regularly get into arguments votes for me. i really appreciate it, really do.damar rocarionbrigadier general"
"you get into arguments with everyone so that's not very surprising."
"one more day to vote! good luck, aleks!"
"haha..roma. weak. what a load of crap!emp...right on brother!"
"bump ... elf got my vote"
"one day of voting left. good luck, teadaze!"
"you are a goon - so you won't be getting my vote. i do like your attitude, your approach and your experience, but my own experience with goonswarm members has shown me that they as a collective (which you are a member of), are not to be trusted. that unfortunately tars you with the same brush.sorry, but we can only judge you by the company that you keep."
"i've voted for you after doing quite a bit of research on your stances and attitude compared to others. you have a matured sense of handling yourself when confronted against a lot of unpopular posts, and that is something i greatly admire. after reviewing your topics and ideas i have to say i'm very excited to see what you have to offer us, and how far you are able to take your ideas. as for goonswarm tags..while goonswarm is something most people may look at with distrust, i feel that i know better. i remember moo, long ago, and how their \"shady tactics\" helped form a large portion of the game's security features for gates, concord, and sentry guns. goonswarm, in my eyes, is something rather similar. while not all of the tactics are community approved, and i don't feel they should be(this is eve, not church), they are still valid tactics that lead to how people view and play the game. i could not, in good conscious, hold it against you.good luck!judge not the diamond amongst the rough. for however harsh the landscape and sands around it, the diamond still glitters."
"it's your choice obviously but i'd hope that you can see the difference between the actions of goon members ingame, on forums etc and goons on the csm. check out bagehi's post for examples.if your only criteria is that the candidate is a member of an alliance that you like then good luck with getting useful things done in the csm."
"it's not so much based on whether i \"like\" an alliance or a corp that dictated my vote, it was more down to who i see as being a good representative of the player community and to someone who i felt that i could trust.my vote eventually went to someone who my own corp/alliance has warred with a few times - and with whom there is very little love lost. but in my dealings with them (and those who i fly with in the main agree), we respect them for their gamemanship and their treatment of fellow players.that is something that i see sadly lacking in gs. whether it's ingame, on the forums, on fansites, etc, i have yet to see any gs member act with anything approaching gamemanship. for yourself, i have never met nor have i flown against you. you seem like a decent person but to myself, that is unfortunately only part of the equation. however, i have flown against other gs members ( a couple who have been/still are csm's) and to be perfectly frank, the experience left me with a very bitter taste. so much so that till now, i have barely even bothered with the whole concept of the csm.so back to my point. i do not consider that a gs member can - based on their actions both in and out of the game - be suitable representatives for what is essentially, a community based group within the eve-o player base. your alliances gameplay is essentially anathema to the whole idea of the csm."
"does it? or does the prescence of the rough around it simply make it appear to glitter in comparison?again, i agree with helen highwaters views and was the most logical person to vote for according to the csm vote match, however keeping company with goonswarm places you in a position to be easily influenced by them, so i wont be voting.ive never met you ingame or had any contact with you whatsoever (just as many of your prospective voters havent) so under those circumstances your corporation and alliance are major factors in deciding wether to vote for you.good luck with your campaign helen highwater."
"i've seen that a lot in this thread. it's a shame that people can agree with so much of her ideas, attitude, and plans and then dismiss them completely because of her association with friends. i think it's one of the most irrational things you can do during an election. the right person for the job is the right person for the job, regardless of who they may drink at the pub with. so long as they don't let the friends impact how they work their job, there's no harm done."
"and how do you guarantee that this will be the case?"
"i couldn't guarantee it for her, nor for any other csm candidate. if you want to ask for a guarantee from her, it's only fair to consider same for the other csm candidates. all of them have the possibility to be corrupted, or be of strong enough individual character to be incorruptible. i trust her as an individual, and i trust goon's ability in community management. how they handle their in-game fun is very different from how they handle events that they know is important, and game-changing. don't forget that goons helped lay the groundwork for the alliance mechanic.i'll restate again, to clarify the importance of it: if you want to ask for a guarantee from her, it's only fair to consider same for the other csm candidates. all of them have the possibility to be corrupted, or be of strong enough individual character to be incorruptible."
"im aware nobody is above corruption, but there are those that are in a position to be influenced more, also you are right i would also expect the same from other candidates.as i already stated i do not know her, so this is irrelevant to me and anyone else voting who also doesnt know her.they were also instrumental in the disbanding of there rival alliance in a dramatic showing of lack of sportsmanship."
"then it isn't an issue of trust you have, it's that you dislike how her friends fly and how they enjoy their $15. a proper example, would be: i wouldn't refuse to vote for someone i completely agreed with just because they were part of a well-known mining corporation.but, now that i know it isn't trust but disagreement in play style, there's little else to argue. cheers."
"no its not, i never said it was, you are right, i disagree with the playstyle of goonswarm and am not eager to vote for one of them to hold any kind of peer position, its simply a shame because the gs ticker is in this case they only thing preventing me voting for this candidate.thanks for the debate though"
"dont blame the origin of a candidate, alliance/corp/pve/pvp, the real things who count are :1/her programm.2/if you trust her.and if the goon are not well viewed people, they are also players not totally formated by one think.the object of a csm candidate isnt in what world they live, but in what world they want to live."
"this."
"or get votes from pre-committed voting blocks that we don't even know about. that's politics, too, i guess.good idea about the random reshuffle."
"thanks. looking forward to it :)"
"not having closely followed the current csm campaigns, i feel a bit overwhelmed by the sheer mass of candidates that have turned out. usually, the girl'd get my vote out of principle, but the only one in election is running on a bit too narrow a platform, i'm afraid.i tried the vote match, but the results were not conclusive. so i came up with this hopefully provocative list of statements about the game and would like candidates to quickly express their stance (\"aye\" or \"nay\") as well as how strongly they would fight for or against it (\"0\" - unimportant detail, wouldn't lift a finger for it; \"9\" - my holy grail, would self-destruct in a low-grade clone for my beliefs).here goes:csm terms should be extended to one year, election for half its members every 6 months to increase continuity and competence.playing solo should be a viable and interesting playstyle in all trades and places, nore challenging but not impossible.to avoid blob warfare and, more generally, swarming, strength in numbers should be balanced by some penalty such as friendly fire, obstruction or some sort of negative mass effectships as players' main visual representation in-game should allow for some degree of individual customization such as corp and alliance logos and a set of colour schemes.the announced mining overhaul should not just increase variety and tactical depth of mining but add some optional relaxed but challanging, afk-unfriendly interaction to significantly increase yields or quality.missions should be less static by limiting agent quality and mission availability the more an agent is perused (and vice versa).player actions should always have consequences. extreme player actions (mass murder, treason, warfare, outlawry) should have lasting if not permanent consequences. redemption should always come at a far greater cost than the possible gain from the deed.pve should be more surprising by introducing random events that spawn in-space, limited-use mission agents as well as through unpredictable turns of events and forks within missions, making missions hardly ever twice the same.enviroments need some life. the regions/constellations/systems and of course the stunning new planets could do with some interesting backgrounds, random individuality and even some proper economic properties tied to the local npc market.warp to zero should be replaced with skill and module-based warp precision (to reduce random deviation in direction and distance) as well as some sort of counter-measure to increase the time to gank them.allow corporations and alliances to wardec npc empires (with serious consequences - sieging rookie systems should still be extremely difficult and met with quickly rising npc resistance).ships crews and fuels would introduce further depth to ship management, a strong incentive to keep your ship alive, as well as a serious isk sinkship insurance should adapt cost and payout to a pilot's sec status and history.npc corps should be joinable at great standings for individual perks (exclusive missions and rewards) and serious disadvantages (50% taxes, standings hits towards their enemies).that's it. answer some or all. btw, don't count on me agreeing on all of them - some may be trick questions to spot a silver-tongued deceiver. ;)"
"# csm terms should be extended to one year, election for half its members every 6 months to increase continuity and competence.no, often a bunch of slacking csm are already worn down after 4 months in office and motivation drops to a low. i rather see a fresh bunch of csm voted in that will offer new issues and new perspectives. however, ex-csm should somehow be kept in the loop by ccp, on a non-official status. as for continuity, that's what take care is all about, ankhesentapemkah, erik finnegan, and now me, all benefitting from the prior csm experience.# playing solo should be a viable and interesting playstyle in all trades and places, nore challenging but not impossible.yes, and the same goes for having only one account. i have a lot of accounts myself (for trade and industry), but i hate that players are encouraged to metagame by using alts for almost everything.# to avoid blob warfare and, more generally, swarming, strength in numbers should be balanced by some penalty such as friendly fire, obstruction or some sort of negative mass effectno, as annoying as the blob is, there should not be 'stacking penalty'-like mechanics. i rather see the higher-level game mechanics change, so there are objectives that encourage players to move in smaller, faster fleets.# ships as players' main visual representation in-game should allow for some degree of individual customization such as corp and alliance logos and a set of colour schemes.there are so many mmos that already have deep character customization, i don't see why we can't have the same in eve. ankh already found that the variations of ships are basically paint jobs already, as they use the same texture and material, just have a few color settings adjusted. why can't players do the same, it's not like it will cause lag, especially not if players have the option to turn it off. she tried to raise this as an issue but it was voted down by the rest of the csm.# the announced mining overhaul should not just increase variety and tactical depth of mining but add some optional relaxed but challanging, afk-unfriendly interaction to significantly increase yields or quality.as long as this mining 'minigame' is not extremely repetetive, stressful, or boring i'm all for it. afk-mining should be viable but there should be a mechanic that allows players to perform regular interaction during mining.# missions should be less static by limiting agent quality and mission availability the more an agent is perused (and vice versa).yes, but keep in mind that a lot of npc corps only have a handful of l4 combat agents. i do support the idea of mission runners moving around to discover better agents, instead of camping the same hub for months.# player actions should always have consequences. extreme player actions (mass murder, treason, warfare, outlawry) should have lasting if not permanent consequences. redemption should always come at a far greater cost than the possible gain from the deed.i'm not in favor of permanent consequence that completely trashes one's character, unless there is an alternative which allows the player to sustain himself through other means (for example, pirate factions). i agree that the consequence to actions is currently far too low.# pve should be more surprising by introducing random events that spawn in-space, limited-use mission agents as well as through unpredictable turns of events and forks within missions, making missions hardly ever twice the same.yes already pushed strongly by take care in the past."
"# enviroments need some life. the regions/constellations/systems and of course the stunning new planets could do with some interesting backgrounds, random individuality and even some proper economic properties tied to the local npc market.while i don't like dust, i do hope that ccp starts developing things you mention as part of this system.# warp to zero should be replaced with skill and module-based warp precision (to reduce random deviation in direction and distance) as well as some sort of counter-measure to increase the time to gank them.this can work out in different ways. i don't know about this.# allow corporations and alliances to wardec npc empires (with serious consequences - sieging rookie systems should still be extremely difficult and met with quickly rising npc resistance).no, fw already showed that the players always find a way around the npc defenses to get easy ganks and griefing. i rather see that criminals get booted from npc corps into a wardeccable (pirate) corp.# ships crews and fuels would introduce further depth to ship management, a strong incentive to keep your ship alive, as well as a serious isk sinkship crews has already been raised by take care.# ship insurance should adapt cost and payout to a pilot's sec status and history.maybe but at the moment i would like to start by removing insurace from concord kills.# npc corps should be joinable at great standings for individual perks (exclusive missions and rewards) and serious disadvantages (50% taxes, standings hits towards their enemies).npc corps used to be joinable in the past, i don't understand why this was removed. there is no harm by allowing this again. the exclusive things you mention are already in place for factional warfare and could be adapted for npc corps in a modified ways."

"hi, i am a concerned voter.since i started playing this game in early 2006 i've seen ccp make the game worse patch after patch, probably because ccp is the government and the government can't do anything right. now that eve has democracy i intend to exercise my sacred right to vote. i can't say i've been happy with my past csm representatives. i voted for larkonis in the last election not really knowing what he stood for (fraud, corruption and getting kicked off the council) and it is apparent he didn't bring up the issues i voiced to him several times during his run for csm - a reverse on the nos, speed and damp nerf. i would like to vote for a csm that's not completely crap at this game and realizes that nerfing everything that carebears complain about as \"op\" only serves to dumb the game down and make it more boring for the rest of us. is there such a candidate out there for me?"
"i had to chuckle when i saw your alliance tag, but have a look at my thread (link in sig), i might be what you're looking for. i have a great deal of pvp experience, and i know exactly what you mean by 'carebear op nerfs' and i am as much against them as possible."

"what the hell is htfu?"
"you're right, we do disagree. i really fail to understand how allowing players to fix the obvious mistakes that ccp won't qualifies as an unfair advantage, especially given that every other game with mods has like 90% of those mods being built for public use. that said, ccp has already said it won't happen, so this is all a moot point."
"dierda vall, thank you very much for the csm vote match. i thoroughly appreciate your effort. i was quite overwhelmed by all the candidates, and this helped me greatly in making up my mind.best wishes and regards."

"i had a widow at one point and sold it just about as fast as bought it. here's why. for a t2 battleship, it doesn't even stack up next to its little brother, the scorpion. a scorpoin has greater power grid (9000 to 8800), higher structure hitpoints (5469 to 4375), higher armor hitpoints (5469 to 4375), higher shield capacity (6641 to 5312) greater maximum targeting range (90000m to 72000m) and one more rig slot (3 to 2).the widow has the edge in cpu (760tf to 750tf), high slots (7 to 6), launcher hardpoints (5 ot 4), cargo capacity (650 to 550), plus a 10% bump on thermal resists only for armor and shield. i wanted to like this ship. to me, a black ops ship should strike fear in your heart. unfortunately, this ship doesn't do that. it's grossly over priced and extremely underwhelming in terms of hit points and resists. i fully support asking ccp to look at this ship (and all the other black ops ships) and giving them a healthy dose of lovin.ahs"

"supporting the discussion and, to some extent, the op proposal. here's another take on the issue at hand:as bookmarks are merely location parameters on the x, y, and z axii, and these parameters are visible in-game (at least when making a bm based on one's own location), i am surprised to notice that i have never tried toa) create a safe spot by altering the parameters of my current position to random valuesb) tried to share a bm by sending out/receiving the x,y, and z axis valuesin other words, i dunno (and am too lazy to log in now to check) if the parameters can be altered according to wish when creating a bm in space.not being able to change the parameters of a bookmark would mean that it is utterly irritating to see those parameters in the first place. being able to change them would mean that sharing bookmarks and creating safespots \"the traditional way\" is utterly stupid and a waste of time. hence a workaround for the time wasted in opening cans full of bms would be to send the axis values of the desired position to corpies, allies, friends or whomever via eve-mail.makes safe spots easier to make, but makes sense as in \"what the computer of my ship would be able to do\" anyway.b"
"excellent idea!"
"if i understand you correctly, then those are good ideas. let me see if i can flesh it out a bit.(4) the following options should be included for consideration by ccp:\"hide highsec\" - this option, when active, will cause all highsec systems to disappear from the map. you don't even see the dots floating in space on the map.\"hide lowsec\" - same as above, except for lowsec.\"hide nullsec\" - same as above, except for nullsec.\"hide avoidance\" - same as above, except for systems, constellations, or regions you have set on your avoidance list.\"hide other regions not on route\" - this option, when active, hides all solar systems that belong to another region unless they are part of the route set by your autopilot.\"hide other constellations not on route\" - this option, when active, hides all solar systems that belong to another constellation unless they are part of the route set by your autopilot.\"hide systems not controlled by...\" - this should have some sort of dropdown menu, like with the existing sovereignty menu in the control panel that shows a list of all factions and alliances that hold sovereignty. \"any alliance\" and \"any faction\" should also be options.(the next three are my own idea, as long as we're on the subject of hiding solar system dots. these ideas go towards helping understand the large closed loops in stargate connectivity.) \"hide deadend systems\" - this option, when active, hides all solar systems that connect to one, and only one, other solar system (that is, they have only one stargate). for example, the fora system would be hidden because it's only connected to eba.\"hide deadend constellations\" - this option, when active, hides all constellations that connect to one, and only one, other constellation. for example, the mobrault constellation would be hidden because it only connects to the braille constellation. the elerelle constellation, however, would still be shown because it connects to braille in the same region and to the 59h-og and anama constellations in other regions.\"hide branches\" - this option, when active, hides all systems that cannot plot at least two different and non-overlapping routes to some central reference point. (i'll say make yulai the reference point since that's where the concord assembly is headquartered, but the reference point could just as easily be arnon, dodixie, rens, amarr, or jita.) for example, all systems in belt, velvet, and sole constellations would be hidden because any route to the reference point must go through the bf-sdp system. so, two or more such routes must necessarily overlap at bf-sdp.given the phrasing of the above options, a solar system should be hidden if any one of the activated options apply.there should be one last option to show or hide connection lines where only one end of the line is hidden. thus, the player can see that a connection exists to a system the player has chosen to hide."
"insurance reform yes.one thing i'm seeing a lot of, though, is people tossing around words like average and mean.let's be very very clear on which one we're discussing, because they aren't the same thing."
"mean, modal, median, yeah yeah. if you dont want to use the mean mineral sale price, then explain why you think the modal or median would be better."

"sandbox ffs.this is all far-fetched, but as op stated \"longer term, we need a better system.\" player-run insurance companies will hit the eve universe at some point. probably not in years (and i do hope this game beyond gaming known as eve will continue to exist for as long as i am able to type =d)in other words, getting completely rid of the existing insurance mechanics would not mean the end of insurances in-game.player-run insurance companies could use api data for risk assessment to decide on the price and payout as well as regulations and limitations of an insurance deal. i'd like to be able to insure modules, too, but that would require a load of coding to distinguish between similar modules (but i'm confident that we will see this feature in eve at some far away date...). breaking down moduls by overheating might make the insurance company give out nanite repair paste as gratuity gifts ships should have mainenance logs (pretty much in the same vein as kill mails) to see by whom and how much damage has been dealt to a specific ship even when it is not completely destroyed, and how much has been paid to repair the said damage. all this information would affect the prioce and legth of the next insurance deal with the pilot (and especially regarding the same boat)miners would get \"better\" deals if they stay in hi-sec or have significant \"overwatch\" in low sec (low sec mining is stupid anyway) or 0.0 (related kills in killboards could provide a platform for the insurance companies to verify this, even tho they do not function sufficiently for any insurance company use atm). failure to meet the requirements of the insurance deal would void the responsibility of the company for the payout, ofc.insuance is cheaper if the customer gives the insurance company the right to sell insurance and fitting data to third parties (derived of repair logs that may or may not exist nowadays). pilots could try to double-insure their vessel (using more than one company) but the insuring side(s) should take this into conideration in the deals and consult each other to ensure exploitation of their services. etc., etc., etc.reliability problems and trust issues (as exemplified in the recent banking scamdal [sic]) would, of course, exist. but they exist in the \"real world\", too. however, the exploitation of trust has less dire impacts on the scammed and provide less revenue for the scammer than similar exploits of trust in rl, so i wouldn't be too worried about any large scale issues arising (tho exceptions might have devastating effects on individual pilots in-game). early implementation of such a player-run system would be a pain with scammers and actual verification problems of all sorts blurring the situation, but i am confident that, in the log run, player-run insurance companies would providea) the insurance services neededb) a nice platform to learn insurance mathematics and risk assessmentc) more wide-spread player-run banking and financial services (incl. real stock markets with corporate annual reports and all)i dunno if such \"development\" is positive, but it sure is in line with the sandbox approach - and as i think i stated in some post last night (tho with different wordings): why should we be content with a sandbox when we could have the whole effing saharasupporting the op as some sort of a start, but more in support of discussion around the issue as well as the sandboxesque development possibilities as regards insurancesb"
"yes, it really is! now dont get me wrong, there was pretty much nothing in your post i didn't like, but what you're talking about would suck up huge development resources and ad a vast amount of complexity. in essense what you're describing would require a true secondary market, sophisticated financial tools, etc. essentially a wholesale reform and upgrade of the economic basis of the game.i was thinking of something rather less ambitious (although still very economically significant): an end to the outright equation between insurance value and mineral/ship prices."
"indeed, i agree with you. but, like i stated in my support post, i believe this should only be a first step in completely removing npc insurance. what beau is talking about is the next steps. i agree, let's get a quick fix for now, but that won't make the problem go away.a long term solution wont be quick to implement. but the things that beau mentioned are things that industrialists and tycoons have been wanting for a long time now. if that could be combined with fixing insurance, then it's killing two frogs with one stone.like i said, i'm supporting this idea as a quick fix awaiting a more permanent solution (after all, just removing insurance would be a bit harsh)."

"damn, fw missions are the least of 3 exploited and unbalanced isk faucets(lvl4s in highsec, moongold!, in that order).i wholeheartedly support more players finding it easier to pvp, however, there is no way to track your enemies efficiently.there are no bountyhead agents who send mails automatically about multiple players so you can create a profile on your prey, whether they be wanted, hostile, wartargets, or militiamen...or they could reduce the turndown rate 30mins, and the standings loss to like 2% with all agents...that could be tweaked over a month at a time, but that would require a 6-minth delay per change.being able to choose target system and objective would equal avoiding pvp at all costs.the current flexibility is already being abused from what i've heard. and this will not become guild wars, aka single player in instance with ai buddies online. although, they do do that pretty damn well.until i hear of the aforementioned feature, i vote nay. tough luck."
"actually i'd rather see someone posting because they are driven by personal interests rather than a troll such as your self that has absolutely nothing constructive to say on this topic.which means arguing you is pointless because you have no point. you are just a bitter troll because someone else has something you don't have. now for the more reasonable here.. a few things you guys might not be aware of and another reason why fw mission should have higher rewards that they do. 1#.. fw mission isk pay outs is very low for level 4 missions, that means we get no real \"instant\" isk reward. maybe 2 to 3 million and the npc's have no bounties. that means we have to buy items with out lp's and wait for them to sell. 2# we don't have the opportunity to loot and salvage the missions like you do in high sec. that means for the most part the lp's are our only pay. 3# despite what people say they do have a lot of risk and not everyone runs them in stealth bombers. you have to constantly dodge wart targets and pirates and both can hold up your missions or make you have to quit it if they decide to camp you mission systems. i'd say overall from what i've seen, the bulk of the players do these as intended and aren't farming on a massive scale as many here love to claim and whine about. i do agree the lp rewards/npc's need to be adjusted and evened out among the various races but i think taking away the ability to pick the area you run the mission in, will kill them for the guys running them just to support their pvp. yet it will fail to affect the groups that are already farming them, due to the fact they will still be able to run around in gangs and complete what ever they get.ccp.. think about this before you do it because you are going to ruin a valid income source for many of us and do nothing to stop the abusers."

"-------for clarity lets gather some facts:lvl4 mission: generate instant isk as reward.lvl4 mission: generate lp as reward.lvl4 mission: generate instant isk with npcs bounties.lvl4 mission: are done in high-sec.lvl4 mission: if somebody shoots/steals you"
"current status of fw missions is untenable. insane rewards for no risk and penalties .. might as well introduce a 'save game' or 'print isk' function what i would like to see in regards to fw missions:- ability to select target system from a listing of five to eight possible locations per agent. no more single decline crap. shuffled at dt.- standings loss on failure (see below).- system vp awarded for missions to specific locations. shuffled weekly and advertised on opposing sides militia board (\"our informant tells us the tlf is focusing on 1-2-3 this week\").- rewards balanced out or missions tweaked to prevent the lone bomber from doing them.- if mission objective is killed/destroyed by anyone but your own militia the mission fails (remove standing hits for objectives).basically make missions have an impact on the war as a whole and use them to encourage pvp by requiring the missioneers to defend them to avoid standing hits.it is the militia high command that is sending us on these things yet they have no effect? the whole damn fw system needs to change, i would prefer a removal of all the broken things until they can be sorted but fear i am the only one :("
"i would bring this up if i could - however csm3 is finished.can the fw system be improved? yes definately. perhaps pilots should be able to select the constellation they want their mission in, or even the system. perhaps only contested systems are applicable for this. i dont know but there is a lot of room to improve the strategic element of fw missions.is making the fw missions un-declineable (change the existing mechanic) a solution? no. the isk generated by these missions does not compare to the isk generated by regular level 4's. they pose no real danger to the eve economy, so until ccp can implement a proper mechanic, please do not touch this one."
"fw missions do generate isk. also, npc's drop tags, for which there are npc buyorders. guess where that isk comes from?if you were intended to be able to pick up what mission and where you want, surely there would be a some sort of drop down menu?anyways, hoping for a nerf here, if not only for your bitter tears.ps. i've done hundreds of fw missions and never lost a ship(when doing missions), could you point me to the risk part? i've had some opportunity kills inside the missions too.done correctly, there is practically no risk in fw missions.how many ships have you lost doing missions?"
"every 10k lp translates into a faction frigate currently selling for as much as 45m .. that is up to 90m isk per lvl4 fw mission in lp alone .. and it is done at zero risk/penalty in less than 5 minutes, i would love to know what regular lvl4 agent you use if you can match that it is very much broken. missions are too easy, penalty non-existent and highly farm-able, all things that are bad for any game.i would rather the next csm make ccp engage in a brainstorming session to improve not only fw but low-sec in general (ie. pirates (some anyway ) are people too). high and null-sec have been getting hand and foot the last several patches and all low-sec has received is a scaling of sec hit according to system security :("
"[mal is insisting on continuing the job, despite the train car full of alliance soldiers] mal: hell, this job i would pull for free. zoe: then can i have your share? mal: no! zoe: if you die can i have your share? mal: yes. so, im pretty much willing to do these missions for free, only if i can pick my target system? that makes me .. kinda stupid, but i would be happy.would that make you happy?i'm must be doing something horribly wrong, doctor.maybe though i just suck at the game .but again, willing to do these apparent no risk missions for no reward, if i can pick my target system.and on another note, actually, if ccp only introduces the \"standing hit by declining feature\" without reducing the rewards as well, i would be better off than what i proposed because my lp income would not change. i just would have to fly to random systems rather than dedicated.the only feature i want to keep out of the game is the randomness of the target system i have to fly to.so where am i whoring lps and crying about my income?"
"i do not care about choosing mission system, i can even live without choosing mission type. but there is one thing that will effectively kill fw mission: expiration time. 12 hours for doing a mission which may happen in a system full of enemies that do bust it often is too short, right now you can just ignore it and go to sleep, after the change failing to do 5 missions will kill your standing very swiftly.there are two simple solutions to that: - no penalty for mission expiration (as opposed to cancelling it)- extending expiration time like for normal missions (at least a few days)ps. firetails sell for 31m not 45 atm, and the price is falling constantly in the last months"
"so the market adjust and \"soon\" it will be not profitable anymore for \"farmers\" to farm missions for lp and those that remain can keep playing the game as intended.and that even already without an change to missons.*waves hand*: \"this is not the financiel isk crisis you are looking for. \"(\"you\" as general you, not directed toward you faelwenn)"
"fw doesn't need missions, they don't add anything to fw."
"it wouldnt matter if you could endlessly turn down fw missions if mission mechanics were working as they do for lvl 4 hisec missions.in lvl 4's the mission rewards are based on \"complexity\" of the mission. in effect the quickest (easiest) missions pay the least. its why materials for war has such a low completion timer (about 12 mins last i saw) and relatively crap payout (other then the nice implant which is a static bonus for that mission)what im saying is this- if everyone who does fw missions always choose the same \"shoot this one guy and then warpout\" mission then the rewards should self lower as they do for lvl 4 missions.fairly soon your favorite 5 min to finish mission- will be worth maybe 300-500 lp. that is comparable to similar timed lvl 4 missions.right now fw missions are broken. you can make 200+ mill per hour by choosing the \"easiest\" mission over and over again."
"why not 500+? where do you get your numbers? i invite you to join fw yourself and do some missions. surely for 200+ per hour it's worth your time. do them for some days, sell the stuff on contracts, and after that check exactly how much per hour you made (adding all the time to fly and collect.also your theory is flawed in assuming empire mission payment = agent reward. the most money comes from loot, bounty and salvage, and they do not change, so a mission is not getting worse as it is blitzed (where fw missions do - all the easy ones give much less lp than the hard ones)"
"500m isk/hour only ? nah it is much more , you can do those missions in 1 min and gives 10k lp each --> 600k lp/hour . so with 4 accs running it is 2.4m lp/hour, if we calculate with 1 lp =2000isk then we get the final 5bill isk/hour ,now that is what i earn by runnin fw mission usually,at least according to future mutant and similarly talented high sec dwellers.imho the real income is around 50-60m/hour which is in acceptable range compared to high sec lvl4 40m/hour with much less risk involved.2nd the money come from the lp not the loot/bounties , first you have to change it into fw items then sell them on contracts, then if more ppl doing fw missions lp value will go down due to competition on contracts. currently i cant see any competition at all or very few(for matar fw items) , that shows me the current fw mission system is just fine at least for matari.any change would make it worthless , and ppl will go back to doing braindead lvl4s in high sec.the only change could be that , you cant do more than x number missions/day/agent. that way the fw missioning would be limited, if somebody still has more time to spend he can do regular missions or go pvp. i see no reason to nerf something because some ppl can play 20hours/day and earn so much that makes others jelaous.anyway if somebody thinks fw missions is so awesome ,then join millitia and do it youself too, it is not like you will be denied from joining."
"as proposal i would support that.and yes fw does not need missions but right now, plexes dont give any real reward apart from standing but fw missions have been adding some flavour and reward to \"that\" part of the game.we dont need mining in the game we just could buy the ore from npcs, but it adds flavour. for some mining is boring for some it is not. being able to \"pick missions in a target system/constellation\" i can have my fleet get some lps, while doing plexes and do mission in the same system, while focussing on a target constellation to gain occupancy. it rewards my fleet/corp members with the few (and according to the reports compareable low) shared lp reward for their time doing the plexes because of the missions.again good proposal, i would support that but the current changes with the standing loss on declining/incompleting a mission does hurt, while a simple lowering of the reward would not destroy the gameplay but at the same time will introduce balance."
"this is a great way to do it as it will finally give people a reward for plexing.plexes are great as they can restrict the size of the ship going in thus giving newer players a more even battlefeild as opposed to a guy in a rifte being ganked by a harbinger.plexes should be the focal point of fw with all pvp happening in and oround plexes. make them worth going into and this will happen."
"being ganked by a harbinger sparks the \"f, i need to get out fast\" response from newer players, whereas being ganked by another rifter does not. even though epic failures of more experienced pilots do exist (and i include myself in that group), the odds of the newer player surviving the fight are just as nominal against the other rifter as they are against the harbinger.sorry to spoil your enthusiasm."
"i agree with you beau but for a new player the psychological difference in encountering \"somebody\" in a rifter vs encountering \"somebody\" in a harbringer makes the difference between staying and fighting or running away. it might be the same bad decision but he will try to fight.in addition not all new players check the age of the character before they engage to estimate the potentail skillpoint difference between them and the target."
"it is not wise in the long run to encourage new players to fail in pvp combat. running away is a real pvp option - if it enrages the opponent into uncontrollable smack about how wimpy or un-pvp-ish running away is, the retreating party has, most definitely, won the player vs player confrontation it is the psychological reaction that takes place after the situation that counts, not the one prior to it - at least as far as encouraging pvp is concerned. the aggressor should know that if he/she tries to gank a rifter in a harbi, the opponent is likely to flee if they don't have support nearby (and point/scram fitted)"
"i know, but that's not currently not in the focus of what i want from this proposal.i dont mind ccp lowering the reward for fw mission. they even might drop the reward to less than a 100lp for a lvl4 mission, if they think that is reasonable.what is bothering me, is that i would like to determine the target system that my mission is located in.not to have easy pvp or to avoid it at all, but to determine a player created objective rather than the randomness of the current mission generator.being able to decline missions without a standingloss was allowing that to me and that is all what i wanted to keep in the game."

"there are approximately eight billion problems in eve more pressing than afk mining in haulers. and if you don't support battleship mining, i suggest you talk with some 2003-era miners, they'll set you straight. no, a game can see if i'm providing input to it or not. i have two monitors and a dvd player on my computer. please tell me how the game can tell the difference between me sitting at my computer watching a movie, checking the eve client once a minute but not doing anything, and me being afk. and this is why people mine in groups, yes. it's a multiplayer game - you should get bonuses from playing with other people. failing that, cargo fit on a hulk is about 18km3, and it's even more secure than a secure can. because you want to fit a tank and an afterburner?oh, agreed - nullsec income levels need work. but the problem is not measured in morphite/hour."
"as much as i also dislike seeing mining haulers, forcing this kind of restriction is unfair toward other ship classes that have proven themselves to be efficient miners. mining battleships may not be as popular as they once were, but some players still mine in apocs/rokhs simply because they dont want to skill for barges.whilst i agree that gsc's could use a buff - since once you start mining in a barge you end up filling them in about one cycle - i would disagree with your solution because you can already mine into a jetcan. it might not be as safe as mining into a gsc, but its a relativly good trade off between risk and efficiency.you could always mine into an alt.agreed.. to some extent. i believe it should be possible for a well organised group to gank hulks in highsec, because you shouldn't be totally safe anyway (as following with the mantra of eve), but due to the increase in popularity of hulk ganking i think this could be looked into.you can fit a pretty hefty tank on a hulk, but i doubt its enough to hold until concord arrives.agreed. as amusing a passtime as bumping afk haulers is.i believe this has been the issue of much debate on the forums. there have been some pretty good threads about it, try searching for them."
"i honestly do not understand how people like you have fun mining 23/7... in a hulk or mining ship... in empire... this is a pvp game, go back to wow."
"i have mixed feelings about the \"simple solution approach\" to this problem. docking games most definitely constitute problem that needs to be solved or, rather, should've been solved ages ago. \"gate jumping games\" are not such a problem as they should - as someone mentioned - be taken into consideration by both sides of a potential fight anyway.however similar the docking game problem is on paper in empire as in null sec, i claim that the situation cannot be solved in both with a single change in game mechanics.disregarding the empire side due to not coming up with any great ideas (perhaps the op's suggestion works fine there): in 0.0 the owner of a station should have serious advantages [sic] to the attacking forces, and imho the docking game approach is a part of this advantage (unless ofc the owner lets the attacker dock, too so, for small stuff, stick with the existing game mechanics, please.but then the big but: large or gigantic camps on dwellings are called sieges. a siege is a way to deprive the inhabitants of a dwelling of new resources (food, water, energy, and what-not) as well as waste disposal (causing diseases etc.).as regards the docking game, my 0.0 proposal would consist of1) not changing the current mechanics in day-to-day gameplay (or maybe change the timer from 60 to, say, 120secs), i.e. small and medium-sized fights would need to take place elsewhere unless the other side wishes to let the station owners dock at will (after 60secs)2) implementing \"station siege\" where a significant attacking force could disable station services by keeping energy and nutrition from coming to the station. after besieging a station over a considerable time with a considerable power, the station services (such as repair facilities and clone upgrades - i'm sure all 0.0 dwellers have jump clones somewhere) would one by one cease to function, making docking games a practical impossibility. a smaller force could besiege a station, too, but then it would take longer for the station services to fail (r-click a station when in appropriate proximity of it, choose \"siege\", or \"whatever the term once my vocabulary gets fixed\", and the size and amount of the besieging ships could determine how long it takes for station services to fail.3)once a station is sieged up to an extent, it will be impossible for anyone to dock at the besieged station attempting to do so gives out the msg \"running out of food and water, go find your destiny elsewhere\" (pod pilots constituting only a disappearing percentage of the inhabitants of a station, this would be rather appropriate). undocking is possible at all times, ofc - thus making a call backup+undock combo a good way to counter the siege.4)the player stations really do need windows (but not ones that directly tell how many ships there are, make 'em poor besieged count 'em manually...).5)once a siege is over - no matter if the station ownership changes as a result of the event if other station ownership change requirements are met - the owner of the station can hasten the renewal of the station services' operation by bringing in \"station revitalizing stuff\" that could be sold, for example, at nearby npc stations during and after a siege (and disappearing so that it cannot be stacked \"just in case\", or some other way of making this idea feasible).i support the op in the short term - the original idea seems a whole lot easier (read: faster) to implement, but as mentioned by critiques in this thread, it has its downsides, too.i sure hope i like my idea tomorrow b"
"this is the point. you commit, when you commit, you can guerrilla all you want just don't expect to do so in the shadow of a station and be fine.this is the new law for pirates, wardeccers and cowards.ever heard of a siege? someone corners your group and you all hold up as long as you can, but eventually you have to go outside and fight to the last man, or scatter in all directions, or stay docked and cry.bring enough ecm and an fc and your guys can get away. but the winner will not be decided by who can squeeze back through the castle walls before they get hit with a calvary charge.rl, look it up sometime. under \"war is hell.\" undocking is still consent. htfu"
"best be trolling, especially with the classic real life analogies 'fight to the last man!' 'cavalry charge!', 'war is hell'. this is a game; its not a cavalry charge, its a blob. fight to the last man = get ganked. war is hell = pvp is **** (thanks to this change), and has about as much relevance to real life as your post does to fixing docking games. 'bring enough ecm', so we want falcons online back already? and you have totally missed the point about only engaging if you're guaranteed to win. both sides can't be guaranteed to win the fight, so where the **** do the fights come from. but anyway at least you have confirmed my point that people supporting this change are the people who do not want fights in the first place, but want a quick gank with their massive blob of thundering ******s (the cavalry charge you were referring to, not quite as poetic but far more accurate) so they can get back to their business of pretending to be in a castle or farming the fields or whatever it is you think you're doing.but anyway its all a waste of breath until you can learn to distinguish between a game and real life, and not make game design changes based on situations in real life warfare."
"before we get to it, let's just clear up some of the language and misconceptions that are muddying this.aggression timer this is the 15 min timer you get when you perform an act that is deemed aggressive to a third party. this includes attacking him directly, or else aiding someone with whom he is currently egressed. this happens everywhere. they just don't show it in 0.0. there is an amusing exploit you can test this with - aggress someone in 0.0 on a lowsec gate and both jump through (once primary aggression (see below) has cleared). engage your target again and gate guns ignore you because you are continuing aggression, not starting new aggression. (old bug is old and is bound to be fixed eventually, and it may not always happen, so make sure you test with something that doesn't insta pop)primary aggression this is the 1 min timer you get when you perform an aggressive act on another party, ie weapons(/drones), scram or ewar. it is impossible to dock or jump a gate with primary aggression. remote repair of a target does not give you primary aggression.the op has proposed the following:once primary aggression is acquired, the timer can be reset by committing primary aggression on the initial aggressorthe naysayers response is summarized as:omg i have to risk my ship in combat. nowai that suxxorz!!eleventyone!if i undock then i won't be able to dock again it's not fair!!the second fear is valid, but misunderstands the aggression mechanic as described above. as long as you do not aggress you will always be able to redock in docking range after 30 seconds.in order to make the first point, people say such things as \"oh but what if you aggress something and can't kill it - it just keeps you there till his friends arrive from 20 jumps away.\" if you're aggressing something you can't kill, though, darwin requires that you loose your ship at the very least. if you undocked and there was a small fleet outside which you drove off apart from a tackler, well, then the same applies unless you have friends.if you can't find friends to help you kill or drive off a single tackler in the time it takes people to come 10-20 jumps (ie at least 10-20 minutes) then you're playing the wrong game. if you want to play by yourself then can i recommend privateer: elite 2, or one of its more recent descendants.as initially proposed the op's idea would not stop carriers repping a titan from re-docking when they got aggro unless rr was counted as primary aggression, and there's a valid debate to be had about that. in all other ways, forcing someone to commit to their act of aggression instead of hiding behind a docking mechanic to mitigate the risk to his ship can only be a good thing.bear in mind that the trap works both ways too - you undock your bait ship and reapproach the station remaining unaggressed. they open up on you, and your fleet undocks and pins them to the very wall they were pressing you against, allowing you to totally destroy them rather than just 1 or 2 that can't dock before their primary aggression expires.there's no way that this is a bad thing"
"getting so sick of repeating the same stuff, but here we go again.i don't give a flying **** about darwin, that has absolutely no relevance as we're discussing game mechanics here and what is best for the state of the game.its not about a single tackler, its about your gang being stuck unable to either jump or dock to avoid an incoming blob. you're advocating the removal of any tactical retreat from pvp, therefore favouring pure escalation of numbers over any thought and planning (it becomes irrelevant as there's no way to avoid getting blobbed). there's no such thing as 'lets go and see if we can get a fight, if they blob us, we can always reapproach and deagro to split their numbers or get out', there's just 'if they blob us, we lose our ships'. thanks for demonstrating that in the bit i quoted; the only options left are to either not engage, or to get more numbers. i'm saying this is a bad thing for pvp. i don't like flying in large gangs, i don't like their structure of the fc basically playing a rts and everyone else sitting there like a moron simply following orders. and as a result, i don't want to be forced into flying large gangs by people looking for some free and easy bait n ganks.no, see above for full details.this bit actually made me laugh, as all you are doing here is complaining about the inneffectiveness of blobbing someone because they can just dock up on you.there was a time in eve when trying to boost the strength of the numbers game was a bad thing, i guess those days are over and the reign of the tactless morons has long since begun."
"this, and i can't even fly a nag yet (and now i'm pretty sure i don't want to). i get a lot of flak on the forums for my ranting about the way the minnies are being continually screwed over with every single patch that ccp brings out, such as the coming navy armageddon which is quite possibly the best bs in game, making that, uhm, only 4 very good bs's the amarr have compared to, at most, 2 halfway decent ones for the other races.it's kind of paranoid, but one seriously gets the feeling that none of the ccp developers actually fly any minnie ships in pvp."
"definitively supporting.at the very least they should change it so the training time is more similar. training 40% more for less dps, less tank and less everything is just pure idiocy."
"given that the static data dump is out for dominion, it's probably too late now for anything to change before the patch hits.but we can at least try to get this reviewed in the first post-dominion patch."
"dont mess with my vertical masterpiece"
"how exactly am i wrong. period. ?i might have a few logic fallacies and whatnot, but i think my argument is pretty solid. you want one race to be able to ignore the \"racial flavor\" \"law\" that all other races must follow without any apparent penalties. not to pull a \"no u\" but i think your argument is more wrong than mine.nobody here has seriously said anything about lowering missile base damage or anything to that matter to make up for the adjustable damage types (without penalties).yeah and can lasers freely choose any type of damage with no penalties to damage amount or range or other aspects of the weapon? sorry but no. lasers are getting looked at.yeah, it's really really unfair to let caldari ignore the racial flavor rule by giving them bonused everything ammo. please explain to me how it's unfair for caldari to be able to use any damage type without losing range or velocity or explosion velocity or explosion radius. all you lose is the bonus to your racial damage type. and some ships aren't even limited by that!"
"your wrong because other races allready ignore the \"racial flavour law\".gallente get 5% kinetic bonus from r.o.f. and d.p.l. for every hull level trained on hybrid bonused ship hulls.gallente get 7.5% & 10% per level bonuses to all damage flavours from drones.( em / kin & exp ) are not i repeat not gallente racial damage types.amarr get 5% thermal bonus from r.o.f. and d.p.l. for every hull level trained on laser bonused ship hulls.amarr get 10% per level bonuses to all damage flavour from drones.( therm / kin / exp ) are not i repeat not amarr racial damage types.minmatar get 5% em/therm/kin from r.o.f and d.p.l. for every hull level trained on projectile bonused ship hulls.( em/therm/kin ) are not i repeat not mini racial damage types.currently if you compare cmb bonuses for solo / small gang work to other damage improvement bonuses they equate to roughly 1/3rd the value.r.o.f. and d.p.l. bonuses at 5% basically mean that for every hull level you train you get 5% more d.p.s.so for 30 days training to cruiser level 5 for example you get 25% more dps in all engagements you fight. averaged out you get 25% more dps for 30 days training.now compare the cmb bonuses.kinetic missiles are useful against t1 armor reppers and mini t2 only this accounts for about 1/3rd of engagements.so for 30 days training to cal cruiser 5 for example you get 25% more dps in 1/3rd of engagements you fight. averaged out you get ~8.5% more dps for 30 days training.theres really no need to worry about lowering missile base damage. ask most serious pvp'rs and they'll tell you guns are better for pvp than missiles that fact is hardly ever disputed.missile boats are in a need of a boost to bring them up to par.if you want proof then look at ships that allready get rainbow damage bonuses to missiles , raven & sacraven is not overpowered versus other bs , in fact for pvp its one of the poorer ships although not by any huge margin.sac is not overpowered versus other short range ships despite getting double rainbow damage bonuses to short range / high damage missiles.in fact sac is one of the most unpopular hacs.if you consider ship hulls to be balanced at low skill level then its a mathmatical impossibility for them to also be balanced at high skill level and vica versa.due to the 25% | 8.5% disparity explained above.5% per level rof | dpl works fine for guns + a few missile boats that have them.5% kinetic equate to somewhere between ( 1.25% and 1.6% ) r.o.f. per level.30 days training is 30 days training it should be equally valuable for anyone who trains it no matter the ship hull."
"."
"you create the inconsistency cutting the post in half, the skill itself is not imbalanced as it is compensated by the existence of the modules, it become unbalanced if you introduce extra modules for missiles without introducing the skill for guns.guns have 1 skill, 2 modules and 1 rig. missile have 2 skills, 0 modules, 2 rigs.both system get the same end result, reducing the effect of size and movement on damage mitigation.as the post of taja calaren you cited say, if you overcompensate for tracking you get a reduction of the size effect on hits as the to hit formula use tracking * size in his calculation and the values aren't capped at 1 (i.e. if your tracking is x1.5 the angular velocity of the target and the target is 1/2 of the signature of your weapon you get 1,5*1/2= 0.75 chance to it [simplified]).but it work the same way in the damage resolution of missiles. explosion size and explosion speed are multiplied by each other, so if you get one above 1:1 with the target value for one of the elements you compensate the other. so \" eliminate the guided vs. unguided distinction\" is acceptable as it will allow all your missile to benefit for the skill/rigs, asking for extra modules affecting both values so that missiles get 2 skills, 2 modules 2 rigs against 1 skill, 2 module, 1 rig isn't."

"you want ccp to act like a banking or utility company? really? where are you from that these companies are considerd good models for customer service/innovation/etc? i'm facinated. edit: where you live are the banks and utility companies bound to impliment policy based on popular vote of the customers? since that's what's being proposed here."
"no, that's not what i said. it's what you read, but it's not what i wrote.yes they are. it's called a free market economy, i can choose whichever i like. any company that doesn't want to supply what people want, doesn't have to.ok, so that's two points of no substance, got anything else?and to be clear, i don't care what is suggested in the op. i read point 1, scrap the csm.it does not matter what else it says, because this is the csm forum, and the csm won't entertain this thread because of point 1. but i will support, for no reason, because of point 1 alone. it could go on to suggest replacing it with a troupe of flying elephants that **** candy corn onto dead babies, that would be an improvement on the csm. so that's why i'm supporting, but why are you retorting with nonsense?"
"rock-paper-scissorsmarauder <<< falcon <<< sniper bc <<< maraudereverything has to have a counter. mauraders need a boost but not to their sensor strength.and we do not need another expensive, useless hull. blackops anyone?"
"even if something like this went through, you wouldn't see them as anything other than the occasional novelty toy of the super rich. until insurance is made to cover at least part of the cost of more expensive t2 ships, any of the t2 battleships are more a liability for the target they represent than anything they could bring to the field."
"the very first thread i ever made on the forums included a proposal like that, but in retrospect, i think they did a better job with t2 battleships than i would have, even with the hilarious failure of the black ops class. if there's a role for another t2 battleship, it ought to be a fleet-command role, i think, not another expensive heavy-combat ship. we already have 13 faction battleships and, to some extent, 4 marauders for that. funny note - hacs insure for something like 60 mil post-dominion. you're getting your wish in less than a week."
"supported wtb khanid bs with cruise missiles"
"just boost blackops ships a bit.decent res, ability to tank, etc"
"i doubt it would be actually used in pvp much with what it would cost,no matter how tough they made it, it would catch focus fire and go boom near instantly."
"supporting simply for the pure awesomeness of the example ship."
"keep it tech one with bonus to salvage per level. enough powegride and cpu to run say 4 salvagers and 4 tractor beams."
"wait, what?have i not run a thrasher with this 4&4 setup. you need a bonus to it, too? why?what next? \"plz more cargo space so no need to dock so often\"?giving the destys any more pg, cpu or cap, would make them (or at least a few of them) seriously overbuffed."
"simply just ask to rename the destroyers as \"garbagers\" fit better to their role actually... i'll add that ccp thoughts are too concentrated in big class ships instead of small ones... we need at least 1 faction destroyer ( for the amarr with turrets not with stupid rockets ) and 1 frigate new hull for each race and its t2 counterpart... and we still need the 75% ab bonus to the af!!!!!"
"i already can run a destroyer with 4 salvagers and 4 tractors a mwd and cargo expanders,why do you need a bonus to do that?, i dont use it anymore because it is a pain now that im doing level 4's but it's easy enough to fit"
"with no skills, i can fit 4 salvagers, 4 tractor beams, a mwd, an expanded cargohold i, and 3 cargo rigs with no cpu/pg problems. and when my character is added to it, i get a max speed of 1146m/s and a cargo capacity of 804m3. i don't know what your problem with fitting it is. are you trying to use a 10mn ab/mwd?"
"meh...4x tractors, 4x salvager ii1x 1mn ab, stuffcargo expanders3x small salvage tackle65% salvage chance/cycle, expanders to keep speed below 450 so you don't outrun your loot can. only problem is that all but the coercer cap out pretty quickly... but this role is ideal for the amarr dessie.what they need, and have needed forever, is a dedicated industrial hull for this task, and fixing the failure that is destroyers since rmr.tier 1 industrial hull, 8x 'utility' highs, decent maneuverability & speed, salvage chance boost &/or tractor range boost."
"not sure if this has been proposed before. but not knowing what is outside the station or if the undock area is clear before undocking is a bit silly. this would go well with the anti docking-games proposal also made.a simple list of ships in proximity to the station (sub 100km) would do the trick, or even a list of players in the area outside would do.even simpler, a threat indicator that lights if there is anyone of negative security status within x km of the station could also be an option.i realise this would need to be developed on further."
"yea, ccp once looked into this but said no, something to do with node changes and coding problems."

"not a bad idea per se. i can see this come in handy in many situations.however (and i dunno if this is a positive or negative in the end), we'd see more people fitting smartbomb(s) - effectively countering the usability of such a command.i would like to see smartbombs used more, so if for no other reason, the op gets my supportedit: spelling"

"edit: fail in posting - lost my own msg and posted a full quote of op. argh. quick rewrite:great thumbs up for addressing this issue, but as others have pointed out, the suggested solution seems unimplementable.however, the pvp/sandbox intention of eve urgently requires a pve nerf. even though some sort of isk generation mechanisms are needed to counter the natural loss of isk due to ppl quitting et cetera, the current pve imbalance is, in a word, intolerable.as regards the faction boats and modules, the op is slightly mistaken. the isk flow does not go to other mission runners but to fw, which is (or at least is meant to be) a pvp scene.there are loads of great pve games out there, but eve never was nor will it ever become one of them."
"forgot something:dependency of the in-game economy on the isk grind of pve could be seriously decreased e.g. by making pvp wrecks drop significantly more loot and salvagables (with new salvage items that could be used to build something else than mere rigs) - maybe even boost (might need renaming, too) of the hacking/archeaology skills and modules.lost raw material in ship and module losses are the most significant isk sink of the game that needs to be balanced out by the pve grind. this, quite naturally, offers an incentive for players to acquire alts to grind the isk whilst they play the actual game elsewhere.however lucrative in the short term, this approach will not provide long term growth for ccp as it provides further \"speedbumps\" for new players.hell, need to give this thread the official thumbs up after all even tho i do not support the op solution. my self-acclaimingly \"great\" ideas won't be heard if they are in not supported threads"
"fully supported even though increasing the amount of tabs doesn't really make the overview good, it only makes it slightly more tolerable i'd love to see the overview restructured completely. i have a few ideas that might spark interest (or be utterly ridiculous if analytically reviewed by superior pod pilots ).first of all, allow multiple overview tabs be viewed simultaneously (thus making them into different overviews rather than tabs)second, and only if the first point is implemented, introduce a means to filter overview objects by proximity (\"only objects that you can warp to\" / \"only objects falling short of min. warp range\" / \"custom range\" for drone range, smartbombs, and what not)third, allow player-generated exceptions to the overview rules -> \"hide planets from overview\" + exception \"show planet iii in overview\", or \"hide pilots of your own fleet/alliance\" + exception \"the sob that stole my officer loot the other day and whom i wish to backstab as soon as the current fight is over\", or \"hide pods\" + exception \"the one with the multi-billion bounty\"fourth - tho this is rather academic or trivial, make overview settings intelligent enough to use pilot data to hide settings that have no effect (such as \"show militia members\" or \"show alliance members\" when not in a militia/an alliance)b"

"i think a better solution would be to make notes able to be turned into physical objects, just like bookmarks(though with fewer stupid annoyances in the process), and just stash it in the cargohold. i'm not sure how necessary this is, but it seems like an interesting idea."
"as a rule, i think that something should be automated in-game if, and only if, it could reasonably be automated by a computer in the in-game universe(unless a change to that is necessary for functional gameplay). hence why i favour such things as warning sounds for hostiles entering local - checking corp on a known list of players against a red list is something your \"ship's computer\" already does, it should be able to tell you what it finds. this doesn't meet that requirement. where exactly is a person getting the intel from in-universe? ccp has all the intel, but concord doesn't, never mind your ship. as much as intel-gathering is kind of annoying, i can't support this."

"this is just my opinion, and a bit of idea collection, but here it is:as i see it, the destroyers are supposed to be an average between frigates and cruisers, like their big battlecruiser brothers are between cruisers and battleships. and frankly, destroyers are absolutely useless at the moment. they can't deal with their own faction's tier 3 frigates. what we need is for the destroyers to be the super-frigate/mini-battlecruisers that they are meant to be. instead, most pilots are using them as mere salvage-haulers.i also think that the destroyers we have are far too similar. we need to bring some racial variations into play - for example, amarrian ships are known for having sturdy armor tanks, while the minmatar are versatile, fast ships mixing tanks and weapons.coercer: the prophecy has a 5% armor resistance bonus. therefore, the coercer should also have a tank bonus. also, its slot layout renders it next to useless - one mid slot. this makes it difficult to use in combat, and therefore it should recieve an additional mid, to bring it in line with the punisher. finally, the coercer has problems fueling a full rack of guns and armor repairers (it has the same peak capacitor regeneration as the punisher). in light of this fact, cap capacity or recharge time should be boosted.cormorant: firstly, this ship should have been a missile ship. two supporting arguments for this change:1) seeing as the caldari are the missile race, their only destroyer should also be a missile ship.2) if we look at the flow of ships that most caldari pilot will fly, it looks like this: kestrel - cormorant - caracal - drake - ravenas the cormorant is the only turret-based ship in this flow, many of us are simply skipping from the kestrel to the caracal, based on our skills. its bonuses should be changed from turrets to missiles (either a 5% velocity or damage bonus), and the 50% range bonus should be removed completely. an extra mid slot would also be extremely helpful.catalyst:in my opinion, the catalyst should receive a 50m3 drone bay and 25 bandwidth, while scaling back the damage of its turrets. currently, most pilots are leaving the drone bay empty, as the ability to launch one light drone is not worth the effort.the ship needs an active armor tank bonus (perhaps a 5% bonus to armor repairers, similar to what its big brothers - the brutix and myrmidon - currently enjoy). it should also recieve another mid slot to bring it in line with the tristan.alternatively, the catalyst's bonuses should be brought into line - the current optimal/falloff mix is unacceptable, as sublepton has mentioned.thrasher:the thrasher is currently overpowered compared to it's brethren from the other factions. the changes above would fix this, though the thrasher should also receive an additional slot.these changes are geared more towards empire missioning than pvp, but both categories of pilots will enjoy the newly revamped destroyer class.in conclusion:coercer:5% armor resistance bonus per levelremoval of tracking bonus+1 medium power slot~10% boost to capacitor capacitycormorant:conversion to a missile ship (7 missiles/1 turret)+1 medium power slotremoval of 50% optimal bonus and turret bonuses5% missile damage/5% missile velocity bonus per levelcatalyst:conversion to a drone ship:+ 50m3 drone bay, 25 bandwidthremoval of all turret bonuses+ 10% drone damage, 10% drone hp per level+1 mid slotblaster boat:50% optimal bonus converted to 50% falloff bonus10% reduction in mwd cap penalty per level+1 mid slotthrasher:+1 low slotincrease in base speed to 300m/sall ships:increase in warp speed to 4.5au/s"

"i would love to see some attention given to destroyers. in particular i would love to see changes to the cormorant:1)make it a missile ship with a velocity/damage bonus 2) give it an extra low slot and/or give it some more pg3) decrease sig radius4) give it a scan res boost, so it can actually lock a frigate before the frig starts blazing awayon a more general note, i would like to see more then 1 kind of destie and perhaps a second type of t2 destie"

"well, since the game is supposed to be player driven, i don't see any problems with making that easier by providing more tools for the players to drive the game forward.very nicely done btw. i'm sure ccp will have a hard time making it useless if they even remotely follow your example"

"bad idea herschel, it is too easy to manipulate the market value, especially for ships with a low number of traded units.about removing the loot drops: it will unbalance the material/isk input in game, you risk big inflation problems. as a general proposal to revise insurance, supported."
"i am against lowering the insurance payout in general.the insurance payout acts as a lower bounder for the minerals. if minerals become to cheap, people can (and will) make profit by selfdestruction ships and thus they increase the demand of minerals and therefore increase the prices.removing insurance will only result in a sharp drop of mineral prices, making mining even less profitable. it is already not that profitable compared to other activities, for example level 4 mission-running.just lowering the insurance payout by 25-33% will lead us nowhere anyway because then mineral prices will simply drop by 25 - 33% and we will be where we were just before.a different insurance model in the long run is some other topic (with premium fees for people who get their ships blown up often and discounts for people who rarely use the insurance payout for example)."

"i'm torn, because fw needs a total revamp and implementing this change will pull some people out of fw.but then these people probably never left the eha/oicx systems and thus i huess it's no big loss. no support."
"this. put lp rewards on complexes or something. we need fights in plexes!"
"why do i get the sneaking suspicion that the very people whom are farming the hell out of these missions actually want ccp to continue with these changes.i think it's pretty clear the guys that are farming these missions like crazy are doing it in groups so they can camp out systems. it doesn't matter if ccp changes it for risk of fail or not being able to choose systems. they will simply just move in a group and bang them out and lower their income just a tad. this isn't a bad deal for them in reality because they can still easily farm out billions of isk with lp's as a group. more importanly these changes will mean less competition for them as less people will run the missions.however the threat to their income is the fact that right now \"everyone\" has the ability to also run these missions with out much problems. now that on the other hand is bad for profits, because if everyone is running them the lp become less valuable making these farm group efforts less worthwhile.yes ccp fix this so the farmers can continue biz as usual. the farmers themselves have even stated that the current set up on sise will not really hurt their methods. yet it will hurt the guys doing it to supplement their pvp income. why not lower the rewards to bring all 4 factions in line with each other and simply reduce the amount of missions each agent will give each player daily."
"because after the patch they will be the only ones who really can make the new stuff available in quantities and for profit and can set the price incredible high.everybody else will have to grind their way up the hardway while the amount of lp already hoarded will have an even better isk to lp ratio, while if ccp wouldnt do anything everybody could get on the \"lp farm train\" and thus increasing the supply reducing the lp to isk ration due to the higher supply of items.if ccp does nothing \"everybody\" will start farming \"zero isk\" missions in low sec, if they nerf missions they make those who already farmed mission even more rich.anyway im not in here to nerf or un-nerf the rewards per se, although they do need balancing. i just want to be able to decline a mission without a standing loss.thats all."

"if all the miners went back to wow who would the leet pirates gank,but mining is lucritive enough without help, everything is pvp in eve, not just the pew pew 'splodey parts, trading is pvp, industry is pvp and if you cant win on your own merits you don't deserve a win."
"some of us are just not into all out combat. shoot em up is not really my thing. getting a bpc, determining the ore you require, building the item and then flogging it on the market is fun for me.i got a real sense of achievement from not buying my first hulk, but building it. killboards hold no such interest.now you may not understand that, but i don't understand why you just want to blat other people, and yet, that is the wonderful part of eve. each person makes their own fun and chooses their own path.as for the op...who cares about how other people mine? its non of your business if i want to afk mine in ... for example ... a strategic bomber. its my choice. i can have a 1 laser indy or a battleship or what ever. you mine your way, i'll mine my way.there really is no defence against a suicide gank. you can boost the hulk, but the gankers will just get more ships. even if ganking is not profitable they will still do it for kicks, as stand over tactics, as part of a territorial dispute or to cause market spikes.i am half-half on bigger cans. as a trader (and when shipping ore or minerals) the extra 30% from cans is great, and the security in the ice mines is a must.. but.. they are a hassle to load and unload.on the other hand, you can always jet can mine, and that's cool if you accept the risk of losing to pirates. i lose cans now and then, and its annoying when it happens.. but hey .. eve is pvp and player pirates are just one of those parts of the game you have to deal with. it makes it a little more fun.mining is boring enough as is without adding in secure jet cans - that would be like shooting fish in a barrel.oh .. and there are thousands of belts out there to mine (especially since the macro deaths of june/july) so if the can flippers and suicide gankers get to you.. move along, find your own belt."
"sorry, but in a game that actively promotes survival of the fittest, darwin has no relevance?!? oh my god are you playing the wrong game. hello kitty is that way, sir ------->failing that give me isk and i'll give you 10x back.darwin has no relevance to the game mechanics. i mean come on! really?just because you're incapable of seeing any tactics for strategic retreat or splitting forces other than jumping gates or docking, doesn't mean the rest of us are so limited, and frankly if you took even 1 tenth of 1 second to check on killboards and realise what my background is you might consider that i'm not wholly inexperienced in the theatre of small gang work. there is almost not a single kill that my gangs get that is on a station because docking games bore me to the extent i rarely bother. all of the fights i get then are at gates or belts, in ships which don't have the luxury of tanking 20 man fleets for 1 minute in order to jump through in systems where i couldn't dock at the station even if there was one to dock in, and yet here you are ranting about how your favourite toy would be taken cruelly from you and that there'd be nothing but blob warfare left. well, having just last week turned back not 1 but 2 40-50 man bs fleets with a fleet of 10 frigates and 4-5 support (no prizes for guessing which frigs) i can tell you that there is plenty of non blob fun to be had still in this game. if you truly can't see that then you have my pity.the reason you keep having to repeat yourself is that we utterly refute the central thesis of your objection, as i just did once more. merely repeating it ad nauseum won't suddenly make you right. if it truly is your contention that docking games are the only means of prosecuting the kind of warfare you favour, the burden lies on you show that there are no other tactics to try to make your point.the axiom of this argument is that docking games, as defined by undocking aggressing a target in the hope of an opportunistic kill and redocking before the dps of any support can break you is not big and not clever and requires exactly as much skill as that required to pick your nose without giving yourself a lobotomy. we here (if the other supporters will allow me the liberty) consider it to be too close to consensual pvp which goes against the very essence of what eve stands for.unless you have a new argument to put to espouse your theory that docking games are the only way of controlling the battle space whilst outnumbered, your options pretty much are to repeat failed arguments again, concede, or (and something tells me, perhaps unfairly, that this would be your preference) try and argue against the premise of the axiom i defined.which it is i leave to you."

"aside from about 4 drones boats, gallente are stuck with only thermal and kinetic damage. this takes care of the fact that they actually get a bonus to both. for the drones, drones have built in advantages and disadvantages.aside from about 2 or 3 drone boats, amarr are stuck with only thermal and em damage. this takes care of the fact that they actually get a bonus to both. for the drones, drones have built in advantages and disadvantages.minmatar ammo does less damage and in many way is forced to fight in a non optimal range. you cannot possibly say that minmatar's situation is better than caldari'sthat is in no way an argument for getting caldari a bonus to all types of damage. if i had time, i could pull out a list of ships with holes to other race's damages and figure out some cute numbers of why we needed boosting.other races may get 25% bonus no matter what engagement because they are forced to use that damage, even if a better damage would work better. caldari simply choose to use different ammos which work better, because the outcome is better.tbh i wish i could use missiles in pvp because of the changing ammo types, huge optimal range. like i said earlier, numbers really don't mean much...i could make some up for my argument too"
"your the one claiming we play a game where all are stuck with bonuses only to racial damage , clearly not the case.if hybrids on gal only got 5% to thermal ( 2.5% equiv d.p.l. )and lasers on amarr only got 5% to em ( 2.5% equiv d.p.l. )and proj on mini only got 5% to exp ( 1.6% equiv d.p.l. )then your argument about racial damage would make sense. but this is not the game we are playing.youve done 7 \"asides\" and claimed 2 racial flavours for gal and amarr and overlooked the changes being made to proj ammo.your racial argument has more holes in it than clyde barrowyou seem to think that eve combat is only about damage type selection.yes everyone knows blasters and lasers cant change damage type , there no need to caps it for us.blasters and lasers have far better raw dps compared to missiles and proj to compensate for the fact that they cant select resistance holes.why are you even here then?you have just clearly stated to everyone that you dont have the first clue what your talking about.quote still harkonnen - \"tbh i wish i could use missiles in pvp\"youve never used missiles and your trying to tell people who do use missiles as well as guns how the balance is ?numbers are provided here to help people understand the issues. they are not \"made up\".if you disagree with my 1.6% per level assesment then please be so good as to explain to me against which target types you think kin is the optimal ammo."
"quoting this for the ownage factor"
"as if your argument doesn't have holes either. pointing out all the little flaws in my argument of how yes, other races get bonused to 2 damage types doesn't make up for the fact that caldari should not get bonused to all types of damage.edit: check out range on blasters, that may be why they do the most damage. .i've actually seen multiple fits of caldari ships with more dps than blasters. even where blasters get more damage, the range is so pitiful that it's often not worth it. blasters are supposed to have more raw damage. blasters don't have that much more damage.you are the king of assumptions. because i said i wished i could use missiles in pvp.....you assume i've never used missiles for pvp. you assume i've never used missiles at all. you assume i don't have a clue how missiles work. i have used missiles in pvp. i have used missiles before. i don't use them often due to most of my skills being in gunnery. i have seen missiles used. i may not know as much about missiles as you but i know what i'm talking about.also please spell my name correctly. if you read close enough to catch my name correctly maybe you'd read close enough to realize you're not as clever as you think with that response.i can't say that kinetic is the best damage vs any particular target, i don't pay attention to that. what i do know is that it's a balanced damage type that works decently against many ships. while em for example works very well against shield tankers but is generally screwed against armor tankers."
"you have to warp somewhere to see this part of the game. you could warp to another station if you don't feel safe warping to a gate/planet/belt. that way you will see this part of the game, yet still be in dock range when you land. and before you ask, no, no one can lock and shoot you while you are in warp."

"well ok, since there have been a few people who appear to kind of like the idea but haven't supported it for various reasons, what suggestions can anyone make on how to improve it?what i'm trying to make here is a ship class which is as much above a t1 bs as a hac is above its equivalent t1 cruiser- a ship that can take on 2-4 t1 bs at once and come out comfortably on top. if it isn't yet tough or powerful enough to live up to the considerable price tag it would inevitably attract, please tell me how far i'd need to go to make it so.how about, for the sake of the example, if i increased the gargoyle's mid-slots to 7?i think you may be exaggerating just a little bit. sure, that might happen in large fleet battles with 20+ ships per side, but in smaller engagements (5-10 ships per side) it'd be considerably more durable and worth its weight.also supporting my own topic since i didn't before."
"t2 battleship?i guess it will be a very expensiv bs-class like marauder, blackops or faction-bs - you'll see this ship very rare and never in pvp or fleet ops.but look:most important thing in eve are your skills.what will be, when skills not only allow to use a ship.for exampledominix -> gallente battleship i -> you fly awaybutgallente battleship iv + \"whatever\" battelship iv -> you got one extra bonus like 25% damage.gallente battleship iv + \"whatever else\" battelship iv -> you got one extra bonus like 10% armor resistance.etc.the [\"whatever\" battelship]-skill cost 500m isk and the [\"whatever else\" battelship]-skill too - thats bad shurebutyou have to pay for your high-damage/resistance/whatever-battleship and you can't loose it - you only loose a \"dominix\".fly safe!will gence"

"having only recently joined an alliance, i haven't encountered this particular problem until this weekend when i started having to invite people to a fleet op.it then became readily apparent that while cspa charges are not charged between corp members, they are between alliance members. since one of the clever fellows in our alliance charges some astronomical sum for people to talk to him, i had to get him to put me on his buddy list so i could invite him to fleet - but this seems a tad silly to me.a simple fix would be to give people the option in the cspa charge area to turn off charging cspa charges to alliance members who try and contact them (or just flat turn it off completely). this way i don't have to fill up my buddy list with everyone in my alliance, and remember to keep track of when the member corps add new members and then add them to my buddy list.i realise that the alternative is to turn your cspa charge to 0, but this is defeats the purpose behind the cspa charge, in my opinion.low priority, to be sure, but i think it would be a welcome fix, especially for the larger alliances - can you imagine having a biddy list that's a couple thousand people long and changes on a nearly daily basis?"
"i remember being in my first alliance before even knowing wtf a cspa charge was. it wasn't a problem in npc corp or player corps, so how was i supposed to know. at the first x to fleet time people said mean things to me :(the good thing was, that i learned to hunt down the settings and learned to use them. you can get around the cspa charge by putting organisations on your allowed list, so there is no need to buddy up everyone in your alliance."

"currently, most of the ships in eve have t2 varients, with the exception of the mining frigates, tier 2 battlecruisers, and tier 3 battleships. here are a few ideas for t2 varients of those ships, in addition to a few new modules.prospectors: varient of the mining frigates, these ships can fit covops cloaks and they would have a single gun slot used to fit a \"prospecting beam\". this beam effectively gives the ship a 2-minute long mining cycle during which it mines a single compressed unit of ore. these ships will have a dedicated 'mining bay' 1000m3 that only ore can be placed in to prevent abuse. bonuses will be to agility and cargo space. slot layout would be 2-1-2.defenders: varients of tier 2 bc's, these ships would fit \"gravity signatures\" that force all hostile ships locking members of the defender's fleet within 10km of the ship lock the defender instead. defenders would have extremely high ehp, but minimal dps. bonuses would be to hp and resistances. slot layout would be 5(4 gun/missiles slots)-8(2 for armor-tankers)-2(8 for armor tankers)flagships: a step up from command ships, flagships are battleships that trade firepower for no less than 3 gang assist modules. they would be very slow compared to other ships, but have immense buffer tanks as a result. bonuses would be to hp and effectiveness of gang modules. slots would be 7(4 weapon slots)-8(4)-4(8)let me know what you think please."
"vulture/damnation. full fill that role quite nicely already."
"yo disc o/ very much like the idea of a 'flagship' like a bs sized command ship.hell yes we need more ships in game.not sure the exacts, but il allways support more ships in game."
"i kind of like the scanner as it is, but think that it is far too manual. at present, your player skills at placing scanning bubbles and interpreting the results seems to outweigh the toon's in-game skills.i don't want to change the whole mechanic, just tweak it to make it a little more automated.step 1 ... place scanning bubbles as normalstep 2 ... perform an initial scan which gives you a list of detected objects. the same list, id tag, signal strength and type ship/structure/anomaly etc.. is fine.signal strength from the initial scan is effected by:- skills- probes used- size of scanned object- if its already bookmarked ... signals strength x 10- number of scan bubbles it's in- scan bubble size (probe range)step 3 ... player selects which objects they want scanned down and the system kicks off on auto mode.in auto mode, each object starts with its signal strength from the initial scan and then increases at a specified rate, up to 100% (just like targeting an object in combat). at various stages (25%, 50%, 75%) you get more info on the object and when you hit 100%, you can book mark it - no different from now.the rate at which a target's signal strength increases is relative to the same factors as above (skills, object size, scan radius, intersecting bubbles, etc). that means that if you are scanning for a battleship or a wh grav site, you can scan them down quickly, but it takes quite a while when scanning down a frigate.the number of objects that you can scan down at the same time is relative to your skills. maybe it starts at 1 or 2 and then based on skills, +1 scanned object per level. just like targetting, but based on an astrometrics skill level instead. the number of simultaneous objects being scanned down is also ship limited as well so only specialised probing ships can make use all the objects a level v toon could scan.at any time you can stop the second stage scan, get an approximate fix on the objects (just like now), reposition your probes and do an initial scan again.if you only have one probe out and have low skills.. it may take you 30 minutes to scan a site down, but you will ... eventually (assuming it takes less than an hour when your probes go pop).if you have high in-game skills and lots of probes out, and right down to only 0.5au range, then you can scan down almost any object within a few seconds. your success at scanning then relies more on your toons skills than your own.of course, if you happen to like the current method, then just perform the initial scan (my \"step 2\") over and over, and move your probes manually.not fully automatic scanning, but this is an improvement over the existing highly manual method and pushes the balance back towards having high toon skills."
"this proposal is so bad, i don't even know where to begin.first, you can't get a warpable result on most objects with only one probe out - you need at least four, which is, conviently enough, the number of probes you can launch once you have level 1 skill.second, your probing skills are designed to make the process of probing faster, not easier. think of it as a mini game within the game where the prize for being competent is something fun to do.the fact that i have seen people probe down a wormhole from initial probe deploy to let's go see what's inside this wormhole in under 3 minutes indicates to me that you're either not very good at scanning, or you have some other ulterior motive for this proposal.in either case, not supported./in before the obligatory learn2probe"

"it's a good idea, but i've heard this sooo many times. the only feasible way that i would think this would be done, to make any sense whatsoever, is to replace the background when you are docked, with what is outside the station, such as zooming out all the way or partial way when you are sitting in space at a station. but then, eve becomes more like vendetta online, which is a very crappy game. i personally prefer eve the way it is. it's been the same way for a long time with the docking deal-e-o, and not too many people have had issues. if anything, it should be an option, if ccp decided to do this, but would you really want this when you are sitting in jita and thousands of people are coming and going? think of the massive server load this would have...i am not for more lag, so no fellows, i don't support this, but had to put my input in.thanks for listening to my rambling!"

"yes, remove insurance, see how many noobs stick around.you guy ever think that that is the real reason they aren't updating payouts?not supported. if ank voted for it it is likely a stupid idea."
"each week ccp can calculated the avg price for every mineral based upon the volume and quantity sold. insurance rates for that week would then be set at perfect build price -1 to -5%. this would insure that prices for insurance are in line with the market. it would be very difficult for someone to casually manipulate the mineral market for all of eve for an entire week (unless chribba starts refining his veldspar and selling trit), so it would somewhat reduce the chance of insurance fraud."
"bad idea. not supportin dis since it doesn't address the issue and only makes pvp more of a barrier which strings out the following equation; less pvp = less lost ships = less bought ships = less money going to industrailists = market collaspethe solution? more money in the hands of players so they can buy more ships. maybe dominion will change this, we will see."
"ships prizes are currently artificially kept high due to insurance. if things are cheaper, the value of isk increases in comparison to other valuables. thus, lowering the insurance rate will indirectly increase players income.removing insurance entirely is anoter issue, and that's not what is being proposed here. i am in favour of both, but i think more things need to be changed before npc insurance can be removed. /me crosses fingers for the next industrial expansion"
"supported.if ccp is worried about how fw mission rewards compare to empire l4s, they should balance the payouts accordingly."
"this is simple. at present, a number of functions are arbitrarily bound to certain keys, preventing us from customizing it. examples range from functions that are common like bold and italics (control+b and control+i) to the nonsensically obscure: what possible reason could ccp have to prevent us from remapping \"disable turret effects\" off of \"control+alt+shift+t\"?? and then there is \"screen shot\", which is permanently locked onto \"print screen\"of course, if you have an unorthodox key board that for some reason doesn't have one of these keys (i for example do not have print screen on my laptop) then you are effectively locked out of using those functions.there is no reason for this. i think we should be allowed to utterly confuse ourselves by rebinding all of our keys as we see fit.edit: i see that the control+alt+shift+t example is now unlocked, but there are still other locked functions that i really do feel should be unlocked. again, if i want to use a totally obscure set up, or have a non-traditional keyboard, i don't think i should be unable to remap basic features."

"another attempt at this.complex spawning in factional warfare is related to downtime. a longer explanation by ccp greyscale can be found here. to summarize, in situations where only few systems are occupied by the enemy, the side which has an upper hand post-dt has a clear and distinct advantage.this has changed from back then. it seemed to me at times that ccp actually fixed it. but the recent capture of arzad by the minmatar - in a multi-week-long campaign - and then recapture within five days because a majority of the plexes spawned post-dt, and almost none during the day, showed that the problem is still present.this is annoying both for the minmatar who do not have to bother about capturing hostile systems, or even recapturing their own, unless they have a clear and distinct advantage post-dt, as well as for the amarr who are putting a lot of effort into this and have their success soured by a game mechanic that gives them an edge that is not very related to their efforts.unless fw is supposed to be the kind of gameplay where \"getting stronger forces post-dt\" is the goal and should be rewarded first and foremost, this needs to change.edited to add:quoting myself from the other thread:you can see the first in siseide and lantorn. it is basically impossible for the minmatar to recapture them without post-dt superiority.you could see the latter in halmah and arzad, both recaptured within days, despite especially in the arzad case of a minmatar superiority for most of the day."
"supported"
"definitely supported."
"please do not use arzad as an example, if you do you need to include a lot more than just the last month. every time a system flips on the matari/amarr front it is due to this single mechanic, the fact that the front is pretty much static speaks against the \"minmatar does not have numbers post dt\" point .. matari spent 2 weeks (technically multi-week i suppose) and amarr spent 2 weeks, check the dates if you please .. available pilots ebbs and flows like just everywhere else.something that has to be included:- the biggest difference is that a single matari is all it takes to capture any plex whereas amarr has to use largish gangs to do the same when offensive plexing.- then you have the black-hole effect (the post dt spawn) which required amarr to \"move\" a lot of plexes by offensive plexing in the minmatar backwater systems in the hope that they would respawn in arzad the following day.- then you have the geography of the bleaks allowing insanely fast moving of plexes compared to the maddeningly stretched out matari space.if you look at it and analyse it with everything in mind you will get the sense that ccp intended amarr to lose .. and fast the end:almost everything related to fw needs an overhaul, not just spawn mechanics. - missions need to make sense rp wise (maybe even play a part in occupancy)- npcs need to be changed to level the field.- plexes should not accumulate in massive stacks.- pvp inside plexes should be encouraged and not on gates/stations.- neutrals should be discouraged in interfering with what is essentially empires at war (standings perhaps?)etc. etc. etc. ad nauseum.not supported unless fw in general gets some sweet, sweet love."
"supported.see for example here for my comments on the other issues in fw. this thread is about one of them which i had hoped was fixed, but isn't. :-(oh, and edited to add:this is not about \"minmatar losing\". i was perfectly fine with losing e.g. siseide, because that happened when the minmatar militia was on the defense and definitively weaker. this is about a broken game mechanic, regardless who benefits from it. i bring it up now because arzad showed me that it indeed is still broken. i had put off a lot of indications about it not being fixed in the last months due to misperception and rationalization of defeat. but that's difficult to maintain now."

"faction warfare is a lot more fun when it doesn't consist of the 15+ bs blob a couple times a day and the post dt rush. taking systems would be a nice way of motivating people to come out and maybe give way to skirmish warfare again, but that's not gonna happen if they get rescued during the post dt rush. also, last i knew plex mechanics have nothing to do with regions: we've had the entire hed region scanned and free of plexes at a given time, which makes me seriously doubt that plexes can in fact be moved, at least regionally."

"yup, supported. an equal distribution throughout the day so it is fair for all tz's is necessary. this prevents the boring fleets (some call blobs, but they are fw players who want some fun) in late night/early morning with no clear objectives. even if they were to break into small frigates and plex the hell out of minmatar/amarr space, there would be no incentive for the amarr to react if they can easily push the favor back post-dt when the majority of the plexes spawn and they have the superior numbers (approx. 5 capitals & 13 bs in the re-claiming of arzad).fix plz kthxbai1. i disagree with your first point. it is just as easy for an amarr navy slicer/t2 interceptor to solo-capture any minmatar plex. the only reason they would be unable to do so is due to the efforts of sasawong and other defensive plexers in the minmatar militia.2. is this mechanic proven?3. the amarr did lose fast, and then ccp changed the mechanics so that capturing systems was a much longer process....only after the amarr recaptured most of their space (excluding ezzara and kourmonen).however i completely agree with your second paragraph. fw love is needed."

"tactical retreat and the blobwith the new mechanic in place tactical retreat requires you to shake of any points, either due to destruction of scrambling ships, jamming, neutings, sensor dampening or getting out of scramble range. today's tactical retreat merely requires you to have lots of ehp. i don't think carriers, dreads and battleships were designed and meant to be ships good at performing tactical retreats. new tactical retreats may require you think and act, rather than to wait for a timer and spam the dock button.also, the dock button isn't a tactical retreat, it is a strategic retreat. there are no counters to it, you cannot be chased and cornered.the current docking mechanics favor escalation of numbers, since as soon as larger ships are involved, you know that the hostile will have enough time to dock if the fight doesn't go his way unless you bring on an extreme blob very fast.at least, this is what i tell my pilots when i'm fc and someone is playing docking games: 'unless we can bring at least 20 gank battleships, don't bother engaging his abaddon, he will just dock if getting in over his head'. i need 20 to 1 odds to kill a docking gamer. if anything, docking games promote blobbing.and you know what, if a docking gamer isn't able to dock and is going down, you know what most pilots that are taking it down will do? call in their friends? of course not, most pilots don't want extra ppl on their killmail when they could have taken down the docking gamer themselves.the only odd situation is where neither ship (at a docking game) is able to kill each other or escape. then again, if you, as a docking gamer attack a ship that you can't kill *and* cannot escape from, *and* you cannot call in your own blob before they call in theirs, then you deserve to die.if you are concerned about hostiles calling in backup (through logon traps or not) just think that you can do exactly the same, and your docking games ship will simply be a bait ship.the new mechanic should not apply to stargates, just at stations, after all, a superior attacker (aka blob) already has options to try and catch a de-agressing ship at a stargate."
"supported. i'm ambivalent about the amendment proposed in [27]... the idea of a timer cutoff to prevent stalemates with points is a good one, but it might take that long to wear down a carrier or other cap that engaged a small gang."
"sounds like a great solution to an annoying problem."
"actually, darwinism is based on minute genetic mutations that take place over thousands to millions of years, allowing one mutation of the species to be more adapted to their environment than the other, in which case the other dies out and the process continues. stop hijacking an idea you think sounds cool because it makes your game sound hard. first of all going to nip this in the bud - i actually looked at your killboard before i posted my first reply to see if it was worth taking into account. it wasn't. i would advise you to try and stick to reasoning and leave your 10:1 ratio out of this.there are 3 ways of getting out of a fight. 1, mwd out of point range and warp out 2. jam everyone pointing your gang and warp out, 3. jump out or dock1. requires you to be in fast ships that can be useful in a fight while staying out of web range, a few hacs/recons and frigates.2. requires you to be an ecm *****, in which case you can go die in a fire in the first place.3. this is what we're discussing the total removal of; jumping or docking. oh my god, you managed to stay out of point range of battleships with a frigate gang? all you did here was employ strategy 1., staying out of point/web range. this is not possible if you want to fight with a small battleship/command gang, or even hacs, hence why you see so few in 0.0, and therefore they rely on the 3rd strategy if they get blobbed. here's an example of my most recent fight:3 of us in battleships in low sec. we came across a local gang of about 8, who were happy to engage us in a belt. the fight went well, but we were low on cap boosters and armor, and local started spiking just as their last ship dropped. so we warped to a gate into a system we had eyes in, that we knew was clear. the first part of their gang followed us to the gate, where we engaged, and they did in response. after one of their ships went down, we deagrod and waited out the timer while just about tanking their ever increasing gang. i jumped out just as i was hitting structure as i was primary, the others came as well and we warped out to a station to restock and reset the fight.now if they weren't terrible, they could have sent a tackler or two to the other side of the gate to pin us, and our situation may have been different; they could certainly afford the numbers. but as it was, they didn't, so we had a chance to tactically retreat, reset the fight, and come back and do this (nb - 1st engagement was at a belt, 2nd was at a planet as we wanted to avoid them playing docking games) . my point about this change is, without that ability to jump out and reset on a blob like that, we simply would have been overwhelmed by their sheer numbers despite the fact they're too useless to even send tacklers to the other side of the gate we're on. it was a gamble we took by engaging their gang on the gate, that they too might agress and not deagro in time to follow us over, with the risk that they might either kill us before we can jump or send a few ships to the other side to finish us off."
"continuing from my last post:no **** sherlock, you say i said something i didn't, they say i'll say that i didn't. i have not once said docking games are good, it is totally your misinterpretation and failure at comprehension that gives you that idea. if you're still struggling, how about taking quotes out of my posts and arguing against them instead. it would save everyone a lot of time, and you might learn something in the process. this is why i keep repeating myself, you seem incapable of reading; i'll try again though.docking games are not good, as defined by people repeatedly redocking in a fight to go from structure to 100% shield/armor instantly, and need to be fixed (simply docking in the first place to avoid a fight is not a docking game). however, all my posts in this thread are arguing that regardless of how bad docking games are, this fix is even worse because of the implications it has for situations not even remotely assosciated with docking games, especially with relation to the total nerfing of small battleship/command gangs, and the far increased risk that would now come with attempting to engage someone while in a smaller gang.i had actually taken it for granted that frigate gangs would remain largely unaffected by this, but judging by the example you posted, apparently it had to be spelled out."

"ignore the trolls, it's a good idea.the whole point of missiles is varying damage types. locking a ship into one type completely defeats the purpose of the weapon system. it would be like forcing drone pilots to only use their racial drones, or turret users to only use one type of ammo (you only get a bonus to firing iron rounds/ em rounds / radio). seriously, make more missile boats like the raven."

"known facts about black ops are:they jump in, blow something up, jump out. hit and run. i don't see where the tank is actually needed.dps wise all of them can get 700-800.so let's say a black ops fleet of 5 jumps in to gank a rorqual or a ratting bs from a constellation that's near another and has blocked, defended gates in between... do you need a tank to kill a rorq or any t1/t2 bs with 5 x 700 dps black ops ships? most will go down even with just 2 black ops bs shooting them very quickly.for any operations where resistance is expected you will simply have to be more tactical about it. the more numbers game doesn't work with b-ops. is that bad or good? i think it's great.the jump range could be 2.5 or 3 light years - but that's just a maybe.the only real change i'd suggest is remove the sin's drone damage bonus and it's drone bay. just because dominix was drone dependent doesn't mean that sin has to be.now we have these bonuses on sin:4 turrets5% velocity/125% cloaked velocity modifier5% to large hybrid turret damage & 10% per level to drone damage/hpafterwards:5 turrets5% velocity/125% cloaked velocity modifier5% to hybrid turret damage & 5% to rate of fire125m3 drone bay with 75 or 100mbit/s(like t2 mega).all in all if sin would receive such a change it would be without the drone damage disability that slows donw hit and run operations and be like the other b-ops ships."

(limited to one can so we dont get ppl using these like super freighters), or making special rules for these ships that allow ship to keep their fittings and allow only ammo in their cargofeel free to suggest names or modifications to the skill requirement or names for the \"ship transport freighters\" skill or even the size of the bay, maybe 20 battleships is too many...idklet's get this thing finally taken care of ^^"

"when ship prices are so low that people can make good isk by self-destructing them, then arguably there is not a shortfall in ship supply. t1 ships are effectively free. in fact you get paid to buy them! how much cheaper do you want them?this raises the prices of minerals which then in turn raises the prices of other things that are built from minerals - such as eg: modules. which aren't free and you're not paid to buy.so let's imagine that insurance values reduce by 25%, and ship values consequently by 20%. minerals prices will also fall by 20%. this means that building modules will be nearly 20% cheaper. module prices will then also fall.so we will have a situation where t1 ships are still virtually free, but it's considerably cheaper to fit them. please explain why you are against this."
"malcanis: there is another problem thoughwith mineral prices dropping, everything that con be bought gets cheaper, but that means everything that needs to sell stuff to the market (especially miners) will make far less isk, if the mineral prices drop by 20% thats 20% less money for everyone that sells mins. so either they go to missioning/ratting etc. and make isk from something else -> more money in the system, less minerals avaiable, stuff gets more expensive, inflation...perhaps even supply shortage on minerals till they get more expensive again.or we have the same problem again in 6 months, whith another cry for lower insurance...i aggree, that the situation isn't acceptable, and that insurance might need a change. but your solution will not solve the whole problem, only cure a symptom for a while"
"what you're saying is that we have a mineral production surplus. i agree, we do... kind of. this is because mineral demand is distorted by the huge insurance subsidy. if you look back to page 1 i hint that instead of just looking at a supply side solution, we should also consider the demand side. in short, find a way to replace the artificial demand from fixed insurance rats with greater player demand.and what better way to do that than to reduce the non-insurable component of ship loss, ie: module cost?in short, because of the insurance subsidy, minerals are being diverted into insurance-fraud ships when they should be used for building modules. resulting in excessively high ship and module prices for consumers.let the player market decide how much minerals are worth. when insurance values shadow mineral prices, they will.why should i have to pay excessive prices because miners want subsidising?"

"i've already raised this in csm2.it's not that no plexes spawn during the day, its that at downtime, all the plexes that have been warped to (even when not completed) despawn and are redistributed, hence the spike in available plexes in desirable locations after dt.like veshta said, everything related to fw needs fixing, and almost everything in her list has already been raised by me or by erik. fun thing is that with this particular issue, ccp said they already had a new plex distribution system waiting in january and that they would implement it right after apocrypha. but that's what they say with just about any fw issue. soon(tm) and then it just doesn't happen for over a year."
"i am pretty sure minmtar outnumber amarr at any given timezone greatlythere were always lots of you around spread among all systemsmost of them just did not seem to care to defend arzad so you lost it againfirst few days after you capped arzad there were very big minamtar fleets active after dt that greatly outnumbered usand because most of your milita didnt bother about arzad anymore you now want ccp to intervene?the amarr/minnie fw zone is already designed greatly in minnie favour and still not enough ?also arzad was lost due to other faulty mechanics in the first place1. the fact that amarr npcs can be speed tanked by almost any frig with ab easily2. abusing of the timer bug"
"not support unless more is done to fix fw.veshta has a more valid point to fix fw as a whole rather then asking to fix one part. you have the numbers minmatar just convince them to be on after dt you have done it before ...."
"imo the amount of effort spent capturing or recapturing some system is irrelevant here. the problem is that currently all plexing in captured systems takes place only after downtime. it just doesn't make sense to have (most) important stuff taking place at a time where the least amount of people can be online. in europe only the unemployed and lazy college students are able to attend post-dt.so either have it happen at some other predetermined peak time, or have the plexes spawn randomly over the course of a day or some other solution.supported."
"got to say i agree with vesh on this point (gets ready for friendly fire in next fleet).arzad was taken because some ppl actually helped our die hard plexers for once, but unfortunately that help did not continue and arzad was easily retaken. the mechanics are the same for both sides so i don't get why anyone would claim they have anything to do with it tbh.we minmatar constantly complain about the near total absence of amarr in the war zone during off peak times and it's a legitimate observation. which is why i don't understand why, when arzad has been recaptured, suddenly the minmatar are outnumbered around dt... it's simply not true. when i log on post dt i see all war zone local channels filled with purple stars and definitely waaay more purple than orange. the truth of the matter is that arzad fell because we couldn't raise enough pilots out of the many on line at dt to defend it.in short, the minnie militia in general do not give a crap about plexing and that is why arzad fell, not some mechanics that affects both sides equally.i would support this proposal too but fear it would be seen as \"plexing is now fixed\" which it certainly would not be as this change, on it's own would do nothing significant towards making anymore ppl plex. unless plexing earns lps and actually affects the systems in some meaningful way such as docking rights, the large majority of fw pilots will still never care about them.not signed withstanding a great deal more reworking of the plex system and fw as a whole."
"this thread is not about why one side can't get sufficient numbers for the post-dt fleets.this thread is about the question whether a game mechanic that makes post-dt fleets the most important fleets by far is a sensible game mechanic.it doesn't matter who benefits from that game mechanic currently. it's a stupid game mechanic."
"trust me i have tried solo capturing in every conceivable ship. the vengeance can do some plexes if of you tank it like mofo and even then its dicey. you severely underestimate the effect of the tp+missile spam - avoiding damage while remaining in capture range is practically impossible (at least in amarr hulls).which one, the moving plexes or black-hole? moving is what -dark used to take halmah in less than 4-5 days.black-hole has been mentioned by ccp i believe. plex spawning is based on exploration code and if they spawn in an \"illegal\" system they are taken out of rotation, makes sense as amount of plexes approaches zero as day progresses.vp to capture was changed before amarr started the long \"claw-back\" process. you are referring to the bunker hp buff i think .. i know because i was the first to max rank under the revised vp system the spawning mechanic most definitely needs to be near top of list when the proverbial thumbs are taken out up there in iceland.we should create thread with a comprehensive list of all the things that has to be included, everything is scattered across a billion threads"
"please do - i'm happy to contribute my ideas, too :-)"
"you made it about that by implying arzad fell because of the post dt mechanic...\"but the recent capture of arzad by the minmatar - in a multi-week-long campaign - and then recapture within five days because a majority of the plexes spawned post-dt, and almost none during the day, showed that the problem is still present.\"i pick you up on it because 1. i disagree that it adversely affected minmatar more than amarr (as is implied by ur statement) and 2. i disagree that plexes spawning evenly thru the day would have made any difference at all. arzad fell thru a complete lack of interest in defending it, a lack of interest that affects all timezones... there is simply no reason for most pilots to give a **** about occupancy.i think it is important to make this point because i fear that if ccp only fix the spawn times without making plexes mean something, the problem will still remain.. barely anybody will do them"
"no.i stated that the fall of arzad showed me that the bug is still in place - it was not obvious before that it was (mainly because the amarr were mostly stronger than the minmatar, but not enough to break more systems, so the post-dt bug was not really apparent). i made no claims about what would have happened to arzad if the bug had not been in place.i repeated this a few times, too.i argued against the absolutely silly game mechanic of plexes stacking up in a single system when the minmatar captured halmah, too.could we now please go back to the topic at hand - whether a game mechanic that makes post-dt fleets the most important fleets in fw, regardless who currently benefits the most of that, if anyone, is a good game meachnic?thanks :-)"
"i agree with op that this is not relevant to the topic. about the topic: i do support it"
"sure go back to discussing/gettin a fix for this broken mechanic in isolation and then marvel in ur own silliness when you realize you have achieved nothing since barely anybody will do them still.no discussion of plexes is meaningful unless all the related factors are taken into consideration, you are changing a tire on a carwreck with this approach, but pls... carry on edit, this ...\"whether a game mechanic that makes post-dt fleets the most important fleets in fw\" is the bit i have the most problem with. in reality, at least as far as plexing goes, the most important fleets are those that actually give a **** about plexes, since the vast majority do not that relegates the dt spawns pretty far down the list of what is wrong with plexes. lack of rewards/penalties for doing/not doing them and npc imbalances rate far higher on the list of reasons why ppl do not do plexes and lose systems as a consequence."
"agreed minkert, more diversity would be nice and it benefits all players. guys at the bottom of the food chain aren't necessarily benefiting from the new t3 stuff as it will be quite a while before they can use/afford any of it."

"i often question myself as to why we have self destruct! there are many reasons it is needed , such as getting rid of ships u no longer require and claiming insurance or indeed bieng trapped in a wormhole selfdestructing and then podding urself to get home , fair enough these are acceptable in the past two weeks we have had 2 x carriers tackled in missions/plexes and an orca in wh space , whats the first thing they do? self destruct this is not because are stuck , its simply to deny the attackers of a km and loot eve online says that they are trying to promote gang warfare , in every aspect! but when it comes to this there is simple no way to kill a carrier with a decent tank in under 2 mins unless you have a large fleet , if your on a roaming gang and cannot refit ships then its pritty much pointless suggestions increase time on self destruct i:e larger the ship the longer it takes to self destruct or do not let the self destruct inatiate if the target ship is pointed by players any feedback of similar situations would be welcome i know this is an issue and its begining to annoy me !!im sure there can be something done about this and done just say \"get a bigger gang\" support would be welcomed , i mean how many times have u missed out on a kill due to self destruct and the the person rubbing it in your face in local"

"yeah, this patch is really something else.naglfar terrible for years, finally after thousands of tears and petitions, it gets a rational, well thought out fix that made everyone happy. it even improved the racial feel of the nag, giving the xl projectiles a chance to shine.now this nerf, completely out of the blue. or did i miss the \"because of naglfar\" threads???additional kicks in the nuts:-bonuses worse than the original, terrible nag.-tack on another month of training time. yay.an aside;wishful thinking, perhaps but....the patch states that the projectile rate of fire bonus is removed for the missile fire bonus. does that mean the nag at least keeps the 7.5% damage bonus...? or are we looking at the 5% 5% nag from sisi, meaning pages of feedback and rational ideas meant precisely nothing?"
"this is driving me nuts. i feel ill reading all this. i love the nag but ccp must hate it. why gimp it again they gave us a good ship for what 2-3 months then they go right back to crap. when i first got my dread i trined capital armor, capital arty and cit torp's. (more training then any other cap) then they patched it. now i train sheild (more training but thats ok i guess its a good ship now) then this patch they gimp it.(oh and more trining to put cit cruise on it.) so now i gotta train another capital weapon system to make my ship worse. ok i need to get up and walk around a lil as i am starting to shake. oh p.s. what the hell do you mean i have to target paint a dread to hit it well you gotta be kidding me."
"yes, literally the same for me until i learned about these changes. i might as well go for the revelation now, or the moros just to be a little different.tank your dreads for em/therm people."
"it's a straight up fact that at 7.5% damage 7.5% rof projectiles, the naglfar would do too much damage in light of the cap weapon and projectile ammo changes.but making it split weapon again is just ridiculous. reduce the bonuses to an acceptable level if it's necessary, but this split bonus crap is untenable. there was a excellent post in \"dominion cap ships\" blog that showed that 7.5% damage 5% rof projectiles wasn't bad at all."
"its also a straight up fact that a considerable part of too much damage would never have connected with the target due to being speed / sig tanked."
"you're referring to the awful missile explosion radius, i'm assuming. and you're right on that part. it's the changes to ammo + capital range weapons that made the naglfar a \"monster\" however. three turrets with a 25% firing speed bonus (moros, rev) is an effective 4 turrets. two turrets with 37.5% damage bonus and 37.5% rof is an effective 4.407 turrets. on tq, projectiles are pure suck enough to warrant this.37.5% damage and 25% rof would be an effective 3.666 turrets. it would end up with the highest paper dps still, but the missiles would still be pure suckage to the point that it was on the same footing with the rev and moros.25% damage and 25% rof would be 3.333 turrets, for reference. the sisi nag has 2.5 turrets and 2.666 incredibly ****ty launchers.edit: still supported. both bonuses need to be turret based."
"quit hatin' on the nag, ccp!"
"i doubt you will have a chance. they explained multiple times why they changed it."
"sadly, i have to agree with darius, here.i don't like that change, i hate the reason behind of it, but they're not going to change it given the reason."
"example: typhoon class battleship.current bonus: 5% damage bonus to large projectiles, 5% damage bonus to torpedoes and cruise missilesproposed bonus: 5% bonus to large projectiles and torpedo and cruise launchers, (another bonus follows) 5% to shield boost amount per level (just an example)assumption made: currently split weapon systems are unpreffered choice for pvpgoal: to make ships with split weapon systems more viableeffects of the change as i see them: while you still have problem with having to use two damage mods, if you ship is all outriged for tank, it does not matter. now, you could use split weapon system not to rely on just one type of weapon, meaning if soemone speedtanks your gun, missiles still hit. generally, i want to make all ships with split weapon systems more viable in pvp, because i like ships in split weapon systems and their inferiority dissapoints me. i propose to merge all bunuses to weapon for ships with split weapons into one, and give them an additional bonus that fits their role. e.g. bonus to tank, or maybe rof bonus. your thoughts?"
"you missed the news? the phoon just gets buffed. 5/5 highslots.so now you can make it 5 torps and have 3 utility slots.or 5 projectile turrets."
"your post only oonfirms what i saidpeople do not tend to use split weapon systems.this change would promote split weapons. and this is not just about typhoon, their is plenty of other ships with 2 weapons, including drone ships and ships that have both missiles and hybrids."
"as a caldari missile pilot i would be affected by this. but i agree, defender missiles should attack all incoming enemy missiles./supported!"

"i disagree with the op.no new ships splitting up your ability to transport, costing 2x the skilltime and 2x the materials to do a single task: hauling.simply introduce ship docking arrays of various sizes. these are just different sorts of cans, just like general freight (no planq affect).they cannot be accessed except at a pos tower, orca/carrier ect, or station.small: 10k m/3, (usable for hauling smaller rigged ships via a standard industrial. roughly the same as can be carried currently as 'packaged' vessels).medium: 150k m/3large: 400k m/3giant: 900k m/3essentially these cans should be able to haul around 1/2 as many ships as they would if they were packaged (a frig equivalent 5k m/3, a bs 100k m/3, ect). ships *must* be assembled, and can have no cargo of any sort (not even ammo).edit:on a side note: maximum courier package sizes are being changed to 900+k m/3 so you can now courier assembled battleships."
"yes but even with the new change ull only be able to fit one tier 3 bs in which case u might as well fly the bs itself...this is for the transport of ship that are assembled and riggedalso for the cans (im guessing ur going with our second suggestion on reducing lag when a ship transport pops) what do u propose be the volume of the can itself? cause at this rate ur just as well off setting up a courier to move rigged ship but is again limited to only one or two bses"
"a tier 3 bs is... how large when it's packaged? let's say it's 50k m/3. the cans (or whatever they be... bays, racks, ect) should double the packaged size of the ship. so in this example a tier 3 bs would be 100k m/3 and you'd then be able to carry 9 of them in the largest size of these proposed containers. but you could also use a smaller can and have room for a few general freight cans as well.i *strongly* dislike the idea of yet another, tech 2 besides, hull with yet another required skill for such a very, very limited function. we have a ship already capable, all that is needed are the containers.edit:honestly, for all that it matters. haulers should simply be able to haul ships regardless of their state, with the cargo limit (no cargo, no ammo except in weapons) in place. freighters and their ilk cannot be accessed in space so the can never become a deployment platform anyway (except at a pos in limited situations) so why the big problem just making ships transportable as cargo in these superhaulers regardless of state?also, assembled ship sizes need to be brought down considerably on all sub-capital hulls anyway."
"been thinking about this for a long time. i think that now that we have \"super carriers\" we should now have a true mothership. insanely slow speed, insanely low warp speed, ultra-weak tank, can use normal stargates only due to some lolrp reason. no high slots, no med slots, no low slots, no rigs. make the ship bay size the ships bonus so it can move a maximum of say 30 fully fitted and rigged battleships at max skills. lots more little'uns. relatively low build cost, say in the same range of dreads. lots of risk for lots of rewards with a kickass escort."
"the abaddon is 495,000 m<U+FFFD> and other tier 3 bses have similar numbersso roughly 500,000 m<U+FFFD> or half a millionand sure they could reduce the size of an assembled ship but then u get the whiners that know that a ship that size cant possibly be that size in volume...its being realistic since a bs is about a kilometer long we have to make 20 the maximum because thats roughly the number that can be fit in 10,000,000 m<U+FFFD> of spacethe nidoggur is a little over 11,000,000 m<U+FFFD> so any thing much more than 20 battleships worth would give ppl enough space to get a carrier into highsec which is why freighters lost there ability to be rigged...except in that case it was because a rigged normal freighter had the space to fit a packaged carrier (1,000,000 m<U+FFFD>)"
"not necessarily. i mean seriously. there are alot of modules that have the whole \"can has be fitted = no / can has be fitted = yes\" argument. same with live ammo in a contract. just make it so you can't put capital ships of any kind in them."
"could be nice!!"
"\"insanely slow speed, insanely low warp speed, ultra-weak tank\" this sounds like all risk no reward, no one would buy it or fly it.a little background on the conversation that started this thread. a lot of people in this game have multiple accounts and lots of rigged ships between all those accounts. those are the only people i can think of that would even need a ship that can move multiple rigged ships for the most part. i know a number of people who use the orca to move their frigs and cruiser but its only barely usefull for and not intended for the roll of u-hall especially when rigged battle cruisers and battle ships comes in."
"gah, my math fails... ignore such drivel..."
"this new ship wouldn't break anything that we already have. good idea."
"yo dawg i put a freighter in your freighter so you can haul while you haul.not supported. freighters are too small to visually hold more than 2 assembled bs. carriers can only hold 2, shesh and you want 20 in your supership?"
"i didn't read the whole thread, but i read the entired csm-ccp meeting and they confirmed that the courier contracts will accept up to 900,000 m3 (in fact, exactly a charon's capacity with caldari freighter 5).you still won't be able to drop a ship directly into the cargo hold, but you can create a courier contract move assembled ships that way. we're already able to move assembled cruisers (courier contracts) in a freighter, but we will now be able to move assembled battleships.basically, your whole thread is useless because the issue is going to be resolved very soon."
"so you can move 1 whole battleship inside another slower ship? wow you're right that's exactly what we were talking about and this thread is now over. /sarcasmwhat we are proposing is something like a car carrier for ships."

"ofc!"

"agree, just lower the lp if the reward is too high."
"supported.the relatively high reward of fw missions was driving people to lowsec. i've heard complaints that it's too easy for the missioners to warp off and avoid a fight without risking anything from failure, but you aren't going to have any of these missioners to fight at all if people don't run these.i've been on both sides of the equation, and i'd rather have a higher volume of rabid carebears to shoot at."
"the problem are stealth bomber soloable missions for eg. caldari. there is big disparity between diffictulty level for the factions. ccp please do a real fix an redesign the missions by adding some gas glouds and/or tons of fast tackling npcs.the main issue seems to be the possibility to decline missions without gaining a standing loss. a simple balancing should fix this easily. just allow to drop and grow lps in dependency of how often given mission is finished. if people have to accept missions up to 16 jumps (or similiar) the fw missions are doomed again. not counting mission time (this will vary with current 4h \"fix\"), the fly time alone will take up to 35 minutes.so at the end we will possibly end at some 25-60min per mission - gallente needs more time and bigger ships if soloing. i don't think a hi-sec lvl4 mission runner will be motivated to step into low-sec and run fw missions if its come to the monetary aspect.other issue is a current lp distribution in dependency to the mileage. there is no one or at least i see no one. 3 jumps or 16 jumps , the all pay the same.oh, and this:\"imho the real income is around 50-60m/hour which is in acceptable range compared to high sec lvl4 40m/hour with much less risk involved.\"my calculation was the same. all exagurated calculations based on best case scenarios or cosmos tricks (fix fix ??) are not the general situation.\"currently i cant see any competition at all or very few(for matar fw items) , that shows me the current fw mission system is just fine at least for matari.\"same for gallente. \"any change would make it worthless , and ppl will go back to doing braindead lvl4s in high sec.\"this is the way we heading atm :-)could be true. if a player already grinded a few dozens milions of lps ,he of course would be in favor of \"fixing\". a intresting question would be if those ppl who whine for a nerf actualy have tons of lps prepared for a artificial created monopoly.i think ccp could take a closer look into this issue too. contrary to other nerf/fix/boost threadnoughts i do not see a broader group of players but a very significant small clique with a few bandwagon minions ;-)"
"while i agree with the statement that some fw mission tend to be too easy and the cherrypicking is probably not what was intended, here are some thoughts for you that i hope will keep you from doing that stupid change in the next patch, ccp:1) just changing it back to the state it was before cherrypicking was possible is the easiest, dirtiest fix one could think of. you didn't put a single second of thought into this. obviously the missions are imbalanced, otherwise people wouldn't click \"decline\" and \"request\" so frenetically to get a better mission. changing it back to the previous state is changing nothing on this imbalance. it was bad before the cherrypicking, and it will be even worse if you change it back.2) as stated, it will be worse than before the decline timer got removed. why? well, lp don't have a fixed isk value. the value of lp is determined by what you can get for them, what people are willing to pay for that, and, most importantly, by competition. \"exploiting\" the fw missions doesn't make isk out of nothing. actually, lp inflation made possible through this \"exploit\" will just drive prices for fw lp shop items down. now, what happens, if you allow a few people to farm those missions, while others haven't discovered this yet, and now change it back? of course, what wasn't exploitable at all up to now, suddenly puts those who farmed between the patches at a huge advantage. this has been stated before, but i will say it again: lp supply will go down dramatically after the patch, and prices for the unique items will skyrocket. do you really want those navy tier 1 bs to be so expensive? i liked the idea of them being flown on a regular basis. at last, they will always be more expensive than their standard version.3) there are lots of other problems regarding balance of fw missions. for example, while the good (three in lvl4) gallente missions can be flown solo with an ishtar or dual-boxing with a stealth bomber and a speedtank, caldari missions can be flown solo with a stealth bomber. the latter two impose zero risk, except for a 5-second or so window when warping to the mission beacon (btw., did you know that systems in black rise tend to be larger and thus warps are longer on average?;)). caldari of course get the edge by being able to solo those mission risk-free. i heard for minmatar missions it is the same. why don't you tackle those imbalances instead of reintroducing that timer?4) the timer was removed because some combinations of missions and location are just too hard for any sane player to do. while removing the timer completely might have been a bad idea, why the 4 hour timer? fw missions are not comparable to lvl4s in highsec. there you compare missions only by their profitability. also, you have more agents per system you can ask if you don't like a given mission. in fw, some missions are more profitable (i.e., faster to complete), but an additional factor is risk which doesn't exist in highsec. also, there aren't as many agents which can be asked for another mission. giving it the same timer is just stupid. why not introduce, e.g., a 5 minute timer? it will prevent the players from choosing only the very best missions at the very best places, but it will still keep it possible to choose your mission if you really want to. didn't you even think of this most simple variant?i find point 2) the most important. i, too, have been farming those missions, some of them with corpmates in a wolfpack, some of the solo dual-boxing. i get bored of farming too fast, but i already have piled up some lp for dominion. i would certainly get more money out of them if you really are so stubborn, ccp, but i would rather see faction ships flown more regularly in pvp. as of now, the price of faction ships is determined by their value for pve, rather than pvp (see navy raven, which is currently worth nearly 1.5 times as much as a navy mega)."
"in order to make certificates more usefull for everyone (and not only noobs) that should a great thing to implement 2 more permissions :- private- corporation- alliance- publicin corpo and alliance setting, we can add a new option to allow all members, or members with specific right, or only directors to see players certificates if the player have select the appropriate permission.by this he will become easier to found the guy we need for refining/buy stuff/fleet with/...ya like it ? ugh"

"insa rexion i must say you have earned my respect by looking at the whole picture in wanting to fix faction wars.its finialy good to hear from the other side, respect to you for it."
"i dont think theres an inability to \"view the bigger picture.\" i think it's just a differing of opinion.as far as making plexing/occupancy worthwhile, i don't think that needs any changes at the moment. if you want to make isk out of fw, you have missions in place that are simple to blitz in a matter of minutes. if you want reasons for plexing, there shouldn't be much more required than pvp and rp reasons. plexing brings fights; arzad did.but on the topic of the post-dt mechanic...while some people could care less about this (these people tend to be those least affected by it; those who can play post-dt), it is very frustrating for someone like myself who has to stay up past 4 am to partake in post-dt plexing. i did it a couple times after we captured arzad, but there's no way a working person can maintain that kind of schedule. it's rediculous people expect us to make rl sacrifices in the name of a fake game. does this really seem reasonable?no, it isn't.as far as getting people interested in plexing...i'm curious where you got this data that nobody gives a \"****\" about plexing? there are many plexers in the minmatar militia; you should feel fortunate you are not in the gallente militia. the majority of minmatar pvpers understand now that plexing can bring lots of fights, if done properly.if you want a big fw patch, great. i do too, and i've wanted one since i started. but talking about the post-dt mechanic like it's not important is not \"looking at the bigger picture.\" fw should be equally fun and meaningful to everyone. a us player who can't partake in post-dt plexing will care less about occupancy as they realize it's not something they have much control over when their efforts pre-dt will be reversed when they wake up the next day.yes, the ability to solo plexes is not acceptable. i think everyone realizes that. also, the ability for someone to bug a plex so that it continues to time itself down even when the plexer has left system or died (yes, i'm mentioning this because it's the amarrians favorite exploit).if you have suggestions for fixes, i'm sure you will be listened to. however, if all you aim to do is point at the other problems to say \"look, this isn't the only thing wrong with fw!\" then i think you are wasting your breath. fwers know there are a multitude of problems."
"i think all sides heavily use that bug.bug report #87218 in case a dev or bh reads this. ;-)"
"and #39065."
"honestly, i don't disagree with you and i hope this gets a fix as i see it must be very frustrating for players such as urself. my main fear is that if fixed in isolation, ccp may view this as \"plexing is fixed\" when it won't be if only a very small %age of players still engage in it.when 2 opposing sides in faction war both legitimately claim they \"won\" using 2 completely different but valid yardsticks (kills vs systems) then something is very wrong. yes plexes can sometimes get fights, but the majority of them are taken without even a whisper of resistance. the link between plexing and combat is tenuous at best and this needs to be changed. but whatever, i do not wish to undermine this particular issue further. it is a ****ty mechanic and i support fixing it. lets also make an effort to address the other problems in tandem with this one"
"yes please!i think there are two levels of complexity in the \"brokeness\" of fw.the simple level is stuff that is simply broken. post-dt plex spawns, the vastly different npc danger levels, the \"keep timer running\" bug, and such. things that require some kind of programming effort, but nothing more.than there are conceptual problems. for example the lack of stronger ties between plexing and pvp, the whole idea of plexing, etc. - things that require a game designer to sit down and figure out a better way.fixing the former would be a great step ahead, and likely requires not that much work. fixing the latter would be awesome, but requires a lot of work. so starting with the \"simple\" stuff first would be great."
"this to be honest. i don't mind babysteps as long as we're getting somewhere."

"you already have a lot of ships and modules that are unused, because something else does the job better.if you start adding more stuff it will either make the current stuff useless (if it's better than the ones used now) or will become useless itself (that's the balance problem).adding more stuff just for the sake of having new things doesn't make any sense. try pointing a niche which those new modules or ships would fill, and then you can think of new stuff."

"yes."

"also supporting this because it makes sense."
"do iittttttttt"
"for all you that have supported idea , thanks in the original proposal i did not mention the fact of removing the self destruct button all together , i would say that increasing the time makes sense for a larger ship ive read in other posts how people complain about \"how blobby eve is\" how \"gang warfare is always blobby\"its simple if u have a gang of 6 bs you cannot kill a carrier before 2 mins is up!and u say self destructing is a \"tactical move\" lol yeah ok basically its a cowards way out with no skill involved at all and in my opinion its abuse of a game mechanic you can tell who the pvp'rs are!if u want to take a carrier into a plex then u should be prepared to lose it and have it fitted to save urself not just self destruct , lol i just laugh at the carebears saying oh no do not take our self destruct away!!"
"leave the self-destruct timer as it is, 2 minutes for all ships, but cancel it as soon as someone locks you - should be very easy to implement."
"not supported. try ransoming for once. if your objective is to destroy the enemy's ship then congratulations. you just accomplished it. i see no issue with the current sd mechanics.end of."
"(thumb sideways)half support. i don't care about the killmail, he knows he died and i know he died and that is all that matters. i just want the loot. getting a ship to self destruct is the same has killing it yourself. it would be nice if it dropped loot after the self destruct.maybe we should talk no insurance on self destruct?"
"i'd quite happily support no inusurance payouts on self destruct. insurance should be for losses you can't control (i.e. someone blew you out of space) not losses you initiated (such as self destructing).as for removing the self-destruct option, that's a load of hooey. cowardly or not (and that's a subjective response) it is a viable tactical move to deny the enemy resources (in the form of loot) and tactical information (in the form of the kill mail detailing exactly what you were carrying/fitted with). self-destruction (aka scuttling in naval terms) has been a viable tactic since the advent of naval warfare. get over it and move on.i would support lengthening the self destruct timer based on ship class. if you need an rp reason, call it time to reach critical mass for the reactor is longer the larger the ship is. but only if that means the time gets shorter for small ships (say 15 seconds for frigates) to match their inability to actually survive for two minutes under fire.i mean i'm just saying, that door oughta swing both ways."
"if you don't have enough firepower to take out a ship before it self destructs, way i see it, you don't deserve the killmail anyway, you say it yourself, the game is supposed to promote gang warfare . . . . . bring more peoplesorry."
"right reasoning, wrong conclusions. if everyone is supposed to run around in a fleet that can kill 800k ehp in 120 seconds, small gang pvp will be a thing of the past."
"if they forced a self destruct then they did kill it. killmails aint the end game and there isn't any issue here. loot and a killmail is just the icing on the cake. but if it self destructed you accomplished what you set out to do. no need to whine and scream \"grief!1!\". sd working as intended. if you still think you're being griefed then this isn't the game for you and/or you need to htfu."
"yes."
"so you're saying the op who started this thread actually had more ships available to use but chose not to use them to preserve small gang pvp? of course not. i'm sure they used every ship they had available at that time, just like everyone else does. the status quo now did not eliminate the ops' fleets that could not kill the large target before it could self destruct. not changing that status quo will somehow change fleet sizes going forward? not logical."
"daaaaaamn i'm glad i focused on sub-capitals.it seems with every patch they nerf this capital or that capital despite nothing being wrong with it.carrier haulage - nerftnaglfar - nerft, fixt!, nerftat least now i can fly ... well, everything below capitals so when they nerf a favorable ship i can find another."

"im not sure if anyone else agree's with me on this but can we please have more class 2 and 3 wormholes ? i used to have a pos setup in a class 2 back when the wormholes were new. i left the system but kept a scout in it just in case i wanted to come back.. its been like 6-7 months now and i decided to go back. of course the system is taken now which i knew would happen eventually.however i have been scanning constantly now for a week straight in low sector and high sector sometimes 4-6 hours a day accross gallente,caldari,and minmatar space, while i find alot of class 2 and 3 and 5 wormholes. all the class 2 and 3 are taken, i have found some class 3 that are empty, but the class 2's seem to be all taken either by big corps or 1-2 man corps. i'v talked on the exploration channel offering 50-100m for a empty class 2 if anyone has found one but everyone reports the same thing. they are all taken now.if it is true that there is only 2400 or so wormholes i would hope that sometime in the future ccp would add more wormholes. especially class 2 and 3."
"i'm sure if you check you will find that some towers in c2/3 that show up on scan are actually abandoned. i share my w-space with 2/3 other people, as we get too many sites for 1 person to keep clear, especially when the gas clouds and roids pay a visit. we've actually seen plenty of empty c3's that our c2 has had access to."
"yep its true they are all \"taken\".and the only c3 that are empty are the onethat have only static 0.0 and some with lo sec.as you can see the problem is with hi sec static exits which all c2 posses( as far as i am aware ) that makes logistics to easy. i could even say non-existent."
"perhaps it's the static connections to high-sec that are the problem... remove those and logistics becomes more challenging and perhaps pos density would drop."
"if you want the access to the resources you either force them out or explore deeper, they were there first.many of the higher class wormholes are empty. granted they are harder to keep up logistically but are generally more rewarding and safer.although i would like to see ccp take a look at the higher class wormholes as some demand you having a 20 man fleet with lightning speed reaction. i would like to see less numbers but more specialization, fleets of all classes of ships instead of huge blobs of rr battleships and logistics."
"number of player complaining about local chan and want to see it disable.i'm agree with them, and not.with domi new way to improve systems we have a simple and effective solution to resolve the problem and make (almost) everyone happy.ccp make all nullsec local disable, as in wh space, and if a corpo/alliance howner want a active local chan they have to anchor a special structure for it : a global system communication.this module may require :lev 2 sovereignty (21 days)lev 3 strategic upgradelev 2 military and industrial upgradeedit :global interface system or global solar system communication are a better name (g.s.c. seem too familliar )"

"vote match! overviewthe vote match! website presents the user with a list of statements (\"pvp should be optional\", \"trade orders should have a 1000 isk minimum increment\", etc), and compares the answers the user gives to the answers given by csm candidates. using this comparison the website then calculates a match percentage, neatly identifying and displaying which candidate represents the user's views the best.i have been collecting data on the website usage, as a tool to improve and verify the questions. this analysis uses the data gathered. i also present a tenative census, showing which candidates were most popular with the website's users.overall post election assesmentpreparationthe preparation that was most important to the website was the gathering of questions. i did this in several threads, on the official eve online forums as well as the scrapheap challenge forums. as my statistics show that only 5 questions will need to be changed to removed, i think i managed quite well to get a good collection of balanced questions. i did make one mistake in changing a question shortly before opening the candidate entry phase, which resulted in two questions which more or less covered the same issue. i decided not to change the question when i found out - but i will take greater care checking all questions before opening the candidate entry phase next time.candidate responseevemails were sent to all candidates informing them of the website, giving them their log-in information and encouraging them to participate. as the candidate entry phase progressed, a reminder evemail was sent to all candidates who had not yet filled in a profile. additionally, i made two forum threads (one here and one at the shc forums) listing the unresponsive candidates to alert them or people who knew them. i also tried starting ingame conversations with the unresponsive candidates. through these efforts, 38 out of 49 candidates made a profile. two candidates chose not to participate because they felt the website did not represent their points of view or style of representation. nine candidates did not respond at all.part of the reason will be that at least a portion of the candidates are leaders of large corporations or alliances, which generally tenders their evemail unusable. i hope to get a higher response rate in the next election, when we call all enjoy an evemail client that is actually usable.user responseas this election was the first vote match! was active in, i am quite happy with the 3300 unique users (see vote match! usage below). it has given good insight in the questions, as well as show that the concept works. i am quite happy to report the feedback i received from both candidates and users was overwhelmingly positive.however, as we have seen voter numbers between 20000 and 27000 in previous elections, the current response lies far below the expected number of voters. since one of the goals of vote match! is to encourage more people to vote, it is clear that the website needs more exposure in future elections. this may be done through a more active advertisement campaign including login-screen advertisement."
"vote match! usagegraph of the 14 day election periodas the graph shows, the first few days the website was open were also the busiest. we reached over a thousand users in the first day. this was as we expected. we maxed out at 3389 unique users and 4614 users including duplicates.the difference between the unique users and all users is most likely due to people taking the matching test several times out of curiosity, as most of the difference stem from the first few days of the website being open. additionally, some matches by different people will register as the same user if they use the same ip address. college campuses or office buildings (any shared connection) will generate a difference between 'all users' and 'unique users'.vote match! question analysisthe answer index (ai) is the average answer on a question. as all answers range from -2 to +2, a perfectly balanced question has an ai of 0.0. questions where the ai is greater than 1 or smaller than -1 are questions i'll look into removing or changing as they do not get as many different answers as i would like. as stated in the preparation paragraph, i am also planning to remove one question which accidentally duplicated another issue.* only 4 questions are candidates for removal based on the current answers.* 1 question was perfectly balanced and resulted in an ai of 0.0question importance (qi) is also an interesting stat. as candidates can mark 3 questions as being 'important' to them, a question that no candidate finds important is one i will review for removal or change.* only 1 question was not important to anyone* the question that was marked 'important' most often was marked 'important' 9 timesvote match! censusbefore listing the top tens, i want to emphasise that vote match! was never intended to be a census tool. as such, i am not posting these lists as a prediction, but rather as way to see how the vote match! users correlate with the actual results. the reasons that the actual results can (and most likely will) differ from these lists is because we have no way of verifying that the vote match! users are an accurate cross section of all voters in the election. additionally, it is quite likely that this website is used more by people who are not sure who to vote for, and used less by people who already decided their vote. an example of this would be pilots in an organisation that direct all their votes to a predetermined candidate for 'block voting'. this behaviour skews my statistics towards candidates that attract more floating voters. the statistics also do not take personal (in-game) reputation into account, which may very well move pilots not to vote for their highest match. additionally, 11 csm candidates have not been included in the matching process as they did not fill in a profile.i have generated two candidate rankings based on two different calculations. the first list is based on calculating how many voters have the candidate as their top match. the second list ranks candidates based on the sum of fidelity for them of every voter. top match1: z0d2: helen highwater3: alpais4: basta ya5: jonathan dawnchaser6: daugar draaken7: herschel yamamoto8: kirana9: mrs trzzbk10: elvenlordtotal fidelity1: z0d2: helen highwater3: alpais4: basta ya5: elvenlord6: mike azariah7: teadaze8: jonathan dawnchaser9: song li10: darth sith"
"the future of vote match!while i quite liked providing this service, i think it would be best if ccp would incorporate a service like this in the csm section of the website. since ccp has complete control over the sign up process, they could achieve a 100% candidate response rate. ccp can also reach out to the player base a lot easier than i can which means a lot more pilots would become aware of this website. i did notice that particulary pilots who were not familiar with the candidates appreciated this service, and as such i think that this could be a great tool to get more players involved in the election. ccp did indicate they want to achieve a higher response rate, and giving players a better insight in where the various candidates stand is paramount in this.as for the website itself, one feature i hope to add for next time is the ability to chart the 'political position' of candidates in two dimensional answer space. it my sound a little abstract but it basically comes down to a chart like this.i would appreciate feedback to further improve this service :)"
"thanks for providing this service and i agree that ccp should have a look at this and implement it in some form.i don't like the dimensional graphs, as eve is too complex to just pick some polar opposites and place candidates on a scale somewhere between them. i like the question system much better."
"thanks diedra, great post. look forward to correlation/evaluation of this versus the key results. should be particularly interesting in respect to alliance influence on the outcome. i'm sure there will be many lessons to learn for future candidates!"
"i wouldnt remove the question system - the graphing would just be extra :)"
"i agree that advertising directly on the client's main page at the logon screen would greatly increase visibility and make players aware of important events in far greater numbers.they could also greatly increase the numbers of voters, if they incorporated voting after your initial logon and before choosing a character to get in the game.players could still at that point choose to vote or abstain from it."
"unfortunately i dont have 700mil to spend on a login ad :p hopefully i do in 6 months."
"funny thing... i didn't used it before vote... but i was curious and used it after i voted... actually best match (73%) was with candidate that i have chosen... strange thing i should say (especially when considering why i voted for that candidate), but maybe this thing works, or it is just coincidence...nice statistics anyway (i just like statistics, any kind of statistics)"
"(edit: spelling)consider to (also) make use of topics/issues handled by former csm. maybe in a second section.this second section will help to give a better profile on candidates and their overall knowledge of eve online.and on a (large) sidenote;vote match is a nice tool to see who's ideas match you the best.and with all the campaigns run it's always about \"what are your ideas?\" people with 'just' good ideas can be the worst csm's;the results say nothing about a csm's qualities;* ability to communicate (efficiently)- some talk too much ( we aleady got the point, can we vote now? / we already discussing in csm for over 4 hrs, not sure if you have but i do have a real life )- some write too much/ too detailed (their ideas) ( tldri - too long, didn't read it )- being able to see the bigger picture (or the lack off) ( too authistic )- are you able to speak/write topics/discuss in international understandable english?especially native english speakers easily make use of \"not common english\"-words, it will make your fellow (non native english) csm's have to grab the vocabulary book many times. try to make use of more common words (yes, it will cost you more energy).* are you still (being csm) triggered to show up every time when the counsil gets together?- \"my topics i ran for candidacy have been discussed, i have no further use/interest to appear in csm-meetings\" - \"i am only interested in my own topics, do i really need to study on all the other topics? (wich is 89%)\" - \"i visited iceland, i had my v.i.p. treatment by ccp, i had my adventure\" like i said before; when 9 muppets been elected we will get the muppetshow and not a working counsil.i hope the next run for csm (vote match)will be less about ideas only and/or will include a section about candidates capabilities. or just give a 'warning' that \"vote match is a tool to match your ideas however it says nothing about the candidates qualities to be able to function properly within the counsil\"* or maybe ccp/ xhagen should campaign more about what is being expected from csm candidates and what candidates can expect. (a summery of my post for example)/x"
"if you can come up with an objective metric for a persons capabilities i would love to hear it. i wasn't able to come up with one and i'm not going to resort to a checkbox \"are you a good communicator yes/no\".additionally, the text on step 4 reads"
"actually psycological test will be to much... but that question that there are quite good... though i think there should be more question about trade, i'm personally trader that's is why it's important to me (i most of the time trade in jita for the last few months)question likerenewal of ordersto rare reloadingquestions about wallet maybe (for example not showing right number of isk in some situations)i just didn't thought it was important, but somehow after i used vote match i realised that it's hard for me to understand who is better based on how 0.0 works etc when my style of play differs from most of the players. more questions for peaceful style of play (like mining, industry, science, trade) would be good... some csm candidates maybe don't care about it, that's why many peacful industrialists and traders could vote for someone who cares... for example one reason why i have chosen candidate i voted for was mentioning by him of some critical industrial defect in his program..."
"having used tools like this in conjunction with \"real\" elections, there is one extra feature i would wish for: the ability for candidates to write short comments on the reasoning behind their answers.tools like this make it easy pick out a few people with mostly compatible views, but picking the best candidate from that pool is much harder.the reason a candidate agrees or disagrees with my view on any particular issue can be far more important than the issue itself. it allows identification of both false positives and false negatives.obligatory silly example:candidate is in favor of universal health care. stated reason: \"we need universal health-care so that dissenters can be sterilized.\""
"thanks for providing this, please keep it up and improve for next time :d"
"this could easily lead to information overload.despite that, it would've been nice to be able to justify hard choices. maybe in addition to \"important questions\" it would be nice if candidates could justify just those questions. it would suddenly add new weight to those questions."
"interesting to see you say this. although you came up as my highest percentage match, iirc i actually chose not to vote for you because you had no website and had little to no further information that i could base a final decision on."
"i submitted before creating a jpsc thread (which was my mistake). by the time i had the thread (and its url) i couldn't change the listing in the candidate page. so i did the best i could to advertise the url for that thread in my bio (in game) and my signature here.but i am sure whoever you ended up voting for convinced you to vote for them. which is the whole point of an election.however, this isn't the place for this conversation."
"you could charge future csm candidates to participate. you could probably even make a profit.(38 candidates) * (50 million isk/candidate) = 1.9 billion isk. or you could do half that and still get past the 700 million mark."
"when is this announced?"
"not until wednesday :(("
"hi guys"
"am i the only one that read this and thought \"sour grapes?\" but the results haven't been announced yet. are you going to be this negative if you get elected?and the best way to convince people you are a good negotiator, mediator, and problem solver is to talk to people. discuss things, and not just your conclusion, but your method of approaching that conclusion. by doing that you can convince people to not only vote for you, but to convince other people to vote for you."
"just decided to say (don't ask why i haven't said that earlier because i don't know)i used that vote match thing after i voted for candidate i have chosen... (i didn't need it to choose candidate) actually vote match best result was that candidate who i voted for... maybe it really works..."
