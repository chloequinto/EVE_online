if anything update the nebulae in wh space so it looks all cool and shiny like the rest of eve we still have the old crappy nebulae with new cool pulsar mag etc effects and the contrast is rather odd

you sir made one of the best ideas that could really improve my eve lifestyle1
jack i hope you dont mind me linking to this in my humble eve blog i gave you credit for the idea i just wanted to share it and get it out there i hope to bring more recognition of it via the tweetfleet and any other means i can again great idea jack dant for csm7 harri out
thumbs up
totally agreed 1010
supportedhowever to be fair to the pos owner it should be a week afterall it could be computer died ice storm nuked the power supply player got the flu with projectile vomiting wife threw belongings on the curb and filed for divorce etc or it could be you won the lottery and went on a partying binge til the money was spent in a week you pulled a thorn from the foot of a supermodel and she professed undying love and sex for a week or you ran for local office won and then got a swollen head planning your eventual presidential campaign for a week etcif any of those things put you out of access to the internet for more than a week youve got problems more serious than the loss of some pixels or more enjoyable than the preservation of some pixels but you should have at least a week to try to recover from rl misfortune or fortune

hacking modules are a nice idea i would extend this idea to all stuff which is anchored around but offlineeg weapons without shield hanging around with out a pos its not worth the time to repair those and unanchor because they dont give enough isk at all a hacking module would come in handy1 supportedU266B when your ship gets blown to bits U266A U266B and you lose your faction fits U266A U263B dont worry U266A U266B U266A U266B U266B U266A U266B U266A be happy U263B
this is a great idea
and what if you were in a car wreck and in a coma for two weeks where do we draw the linedont forget that the pos has to be offline first which means either you werent keeping it fueled or you were gone long enough for it to run out of fuel be found offline and hacked for 3 days i dont care if you were marooned on a desert island with just a volleyball for company for a week its your failure to be prepared that costs you the posnot a threeday timer
dont you be bringing in stanely into this stop the evemail spam
currently the implant process contitutes a significant isk sink to the game with the lp payments going to the npcs how do you propose to balance the impact to the economy with simply removing themside note maybe add an insurance process for implants akin to ships in theory also an extra helpful game isk sink this would help to irradicate some of the risk aversion associated with implant use
you have a valid point ccp proposed the idea to the csm so i bet they have an idea ready personally i would say that removing learning implants will encourage more pvp the increased loss of ships will spur the purchase of new ships which in turn moves the economy all around it is quite possible that the removal of learning implants itself can be the payoff i know many people who will refuse to pvp because they have a billion isk in implants in their head they dont want to lose and then replace take that out of the equation and they would go out and either kill a bunch of other ships or lose their owni would say no to the insurance idea we really dont need to break that anymore than it already is frankly i am to the point where i believe insurance shouldnt even exist what company in their right mind insures something that is being taken out to be deliberately put in danger with such a high risk of damage
you have to be really unlucky to lose a pod in empire space a billion isk in implants isnt exactly that much a hg slave set will take up a fair portion of that if not the whole thing and people pvp with those taking out learning implants wont make people pvp  theyll then cry that they cant pvp because of how expensive it is to replace their ships which you lose a lot more than pods
the buying and trading of ships only transfers isk around it is not a sink to the gameso like combat shipspersonally i think the suggestion of insurance for implants is well placed and would contribute a much needed significant drain to the isk pot in the game
the only problem i see is what would happen to pirate implants you guys better post some ideas how to fix themthey could be simply moved to 610 slots omega removed but with removal of their 3 att stat they would become kinda weak no they could be boosted by replacing their att bonus with something else or increasing their other bonus not recommended15 slots could be left untouched eventually just for pirate implants purpose  is it worthi personally would like pirate implants to become some kind of permanent boosters that enchants any other hardwire implants with their 2nd effect so basically you could buy lets say snakes and enchant your 610 hardwires with them they both would be lost with pod ofcand good topic is good topic i support
i strong do not support thisimplants represent a risk vs rewardthese should be kept in evei fly with 3s in 00 and 4in high i balance that out according the reward vs risk i takegiving everyone 5 would be silly
i kinda like this idea but there is one huge downside attribute implants are a huge isk sink many many players believe a full set of 5 implants is an absolute must personally i run with 4s as i can get a full set of 4s for the price of a single 5 but as i said they are a big isk sinkwith the inflation i have seen in game in the last two yearsmostly over the last 6 months isk sinks need to be added not taken away or we risk inflation raising the entry level of general game play above what a new player can afford
really i recall seeing a lot of threads about people being ganked in highsec heck i have been podded on a gate from smartbombs in lowsec before while traveling in a shuttle some people who live in wh space run with high value implants and avoid pvp at all costs i am sure there are those that do the same in nullsec but yespeople will always find new reasons to  and complain about somethingi havent had any implants in my character for 2 months now i live and run out of wh space i have no jumpclone option i could spend another 400 mil for a set of 4s but i just dont care to the bonus to my training time just isnt that valuable to me each to their own
can you clarify for me then how buying new implants is an isk sink every implant i have purchases has been from another playernot an npc
the implants are sourced from lp stores and cost a certain amount of lp and isk its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
ganked in hisec  podded running into a discogeddon on a gate is unlucky i never said everyone pvpd with hg slaves  but there are people who do it all depends on what they can afford to lose
i support this because its a pain in the ass to replace them when i die which i do a lot
i think you need to realize that not every pod gets away in highsec people are podded in highsec probably a lot more than you believe them to be and luck has nothing to do with itahi dont exactly use the lp store i thought they could be created from blueprints that makes sense then i suppose more isk sinks are always needed so removing learning implants would create a loss in isk sinks i may have to rethink my support of this thread
ok theres also the pvp newbie crowd  we need ccp diagoras to get us the stats on ship losses overall in hisec and compare that to subsequent pod losses to really get a decent metric however pods instawarp off so you should be able to gtfo to a safe or the star or a planet most of the time
i would agree the only way to truly know would be the stats i agree that while pods insta warp that people should be able to get away but insta locking ships and smartbombs sometimes prevent this i wont mention the afk deaths because those ones deserve to be podded
on the issue of smartbombs its pretty rare that youre going to find someone with those in pvp situations much less so in hisec because if you hit a non wt or the station or a gate gun  and concord is going to come and say hi i mean sure its possible that a domi or other droneboat may have one or two fit but you have to be really careful about using them and the range isnt exactly farinstalocking ships still take a second or so to lock you and that really comes down to luck as to who ticks first the person trying to gtfo or the point on the instalock
not supportedreally implants prevent ship to ship combat so what pvp is not and never limited ship destruction your argument is immediately invalid every aspect of the game is confrontationindustry implants i need to compete against other producers of blueprints implants for copy speed material research and time research and why would i risk these on a roam is the intention that these too be removed because a vocal minority fails to understand levels of adversal play i choose to take the risk of implants for a greater reward is the sandbox so limited for some they can only see the kicking of castlesyour insipid argument could be extended to expensive mindlinks being risk adverse or an expensive set used for probe scanning and exploration remove those too because these pilots choose not engage ship to shipso where does it end
wow you totally didnt read the fact that i left out hardwiringsmight as well biomass your forum alt and roll a new one its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar

i recently got a friend to subscribe to eve but i dont think hell stay he hears about all the neat things going on ingame and got to see some of the stuff i do too he likes what he sees an wants to do the same but i see the excitement and enthusiasm melt away from his face when he learns he cant do anything except run missions and mine he doesnt like to hear that he cant do this or that because his skillpoints are too lowim doing the best i can to encourage and mentor him but im afraid its just not enough hes already fallen into the habit of setting skills in the queue and not logging in hes told me that he feels like a fifth wheel when we play together that his actions have no impact one way or another eventually hes going to ask himself why hes paying for a game that takes far too long to do anything an hell just unsubthe new player experience needs drastic improvement it needs to give new players more options and things they can actually do with such low sp and yes i still believe ccps nerf to starting sp was a mistake they reduced the amount of starting sp by 94
theres plenty to do with low skillpoints if you have an imagination and that includes valid isk makingthe person that responded saying there is no story to the game is not only flat out lying but goes on to demonstrate a complete lack of understanding of the creative opportunity available in new edenhaving said that this is a worthless thread that has no relevance to the csm other than as an idle aside
one thing that comes up time and again is getting noobs into player corpsmost small player corps wont touch them which only leaves the larger alliances with specific noob corpsi dont think the root of the problem is the player corps im sure there are loads of small corps that would love to expand but they have no way of telling wether a so called noob is actaully a noob or a veteran alt looking to scam their corp or assess them as a potential target for a war decnot sure how you can fix the latter but you could go some way towards it by altering the basic corp setup possible enhancements colud include a specific probationer role andor a probationers hanger this would make restricting access to corp stuff much easier and possibly encourage smaller corps to take on noobs and provide mentoring
i dont know about that i think if this thread has any value its to illustrate how important the npe is and how it still needs a lot of work to attract andor retain new players i believe this should be a high priority for ccp

1 not supportedif someone killing himself thats why generating to killmail for anyone else i understand pl want more epeen and officers loot when they using supcap blobmaybe the supcaps after sd could throw a couple of scrap metal to them
be happy it died you just cost them billions for a supasd should never create kill mail its a good way of saying a final fu to the 300man blob that just jumped you longer timers yesinsurance payout should still happen but at 50 of its total insurance contract payout because lets face it we all know that supercap payouts are laughable anyway compared to the cost of the ship its self not forgetting the fittingson a different note stop crying about people sding like i already stated its dead isnt it thats what you was aiming for
not everyone is just killing stuff for the sake of it some of us want at that super cap xtype loot piUFFFDatacenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
i believe all caps should shoot caps and structures not rifters
and whats the cost difference between a dread and a titan
what is the point to your question its a matter of the size of ship hitting another ship of a much smaller size cost really has nothing to do with it while a titan should never be able to hit a moving rifter a rifter should not be able to kill a titan
ok first things firstthe idea is any form of manual ship control that has a tactical impactnow the wasd thing was an example that was put there as something that most people would be able to comprehendso lets try a different approach since people seem to have trouble seperating the inherent implication of first person twitch play versus what i am actually talking about which is tactical movement controlso lets go with a better example of what i am talking about though some people may not have played the game that i am drawing the example fromthere was a series of games under the title of homeworldthis game featured a movement command system that worked well for the existing conditions such as the server tick someone mentioned and would allow quick tactical commands that fell in line even with things like time dialationbut the game and the ships executed such commands at their own speedeve already contains a tactical overlay system so it is not such a be stretch to have them enhance it with a system for issuing manual movement commandsthis could even be implemented in a staggered mannerfirst offering the control element as a modification to the existing tactical overlay systemthen later they could look at working out if it would be possible for objects and other ships intercept fire if it is blocking line of fireeffect between the target and attackerand if they felt it would be beneficial they could later consider things like limited fire arc and such but that for me is more a whimsical thingso please get off the first person flight sim wagon since that is not what i am talking aboutand as far as such a system favoring one type of player over another or giving some kind of unfair advantage i would like to hear your arguements on possible ways a system as i have just described could be abused or how it might grant said unfair advantage
they should make pi like dwarf fortress too rightpfffffffffft
i normally dismiss these threads in fact i canUFFFDt believe it has come back already i thought we just got rid of onethat said people talking about homeworld and strategy games like cc got me thinkingwe have engine trails that in effect represent where we have just been would it be possible to extend a line from the front of the ship representing its flight path the line could be in proportion to the speed of the ship and if you had say three way points on the flight path that could be manipulated in 3d in a similar manner to the probe interface perhaps that may give a more tactical elementagain though it could soak up a lot of dev time and change eve perhaps in a direction i am not so keen on i certainly do not support twitch gameplay
trouble with comparing it to homeworld is that in homeworld you gave the ships basic commands go over there and shoot that once they got there and started shooting the game took over and did all the work of ensuring the bad guys were in the firing arc of your ships as ships had to be pointing the right way to line up the shotsiirc the only ships that had trouble with firing arcs were the interceptorsfighters and cruisers those ships unless you put them in sphere always had to do flyby runs kinda like stealth bombers everything else got into range and pretty much stayed still except ion cannon frigates which had to track the whole damn ship to keep a bead on the enemy  unless you were doing tactical moves to get some of your fleet outside the firing arcs of the other fleetcompare that to eve where all the ships have turrets and 100 coverage fleet engagements dont need the tactical manoeuvring to get behind one of the bigger ships where it doesnt have any gun coverage so things can stay a lot more static
1 i suppose drones may be included too
not a bad idea at all maybe even a quick and easy fix who knows1
currently salvaging someone elses wreck doesnt trigger an aggression timer unless you also loot it id like this changed and id like to be allowed to blow people up without losing standings or having concord get upset if they come and salvage my wreck or my mission i dont mind if someone else wants to salvage my mission when im not doing it but when i have a friend who is already on it id like to be able to punish someone for trying to race them through iti dont see how this would punish newbs at all and it brings more nonsuicidal pvp to highsec it doesnt add any additional bating techniques either because if youre leaving wrecks behind youre likely leaving loot as well so if someone wanted to loot jack you they can already try to bait you that way
you realise the actual objective of most ninjasalvagers is not to get the salvageloot rightbut hey i might even 1 this as it will breathe life back into ninjasalvagingread more foolishtriggerhappy bears getting their pve blingbarges smashed into junk and maybe more officermods for me
nerf to a valid starter profession and yet more carebear greednot a new idea and discussed to death already please come up with something new or dont bother
this again for the 20 millionth timeccp has stated on numerous occasions that salvaging is working as intended and will not be changed wrecks do not belong to you thread
so many times in the past threads like this have popped up and the standard response from ccp is that salvage is working as planned it belongs to whoever gets it into their hold first that isnt going to change
do you even know what the word salvage means have you even bothered to look at the thousands of posts about this i suggest you do a little research before posting here and making yourself look like a complete moronoh and ill just leave these hereby gm ytterbium players are still completely free to salvage other pilot wrecks at will no matter if they belong to the same corporation or not and doing so is not considered as an exploitby ccp mitnalsalvaging is a miniprofession within eve and does not constitute stealingby ccp prism xsadly ive already explained the whole shebang a couple of times already and have heard no discussions as to changing the ownership of salvage things are working as they were designed and i do believe were quite happy about what the introduction of salvaging has done for usby gm faolchuthis is an intended game mechanic and is in no way an exploit people salvaging your missions npcs or the player you just blew up are doing nothing wrong the players are salvaging what is effectively floating rubbish in space and concord places no value on this wreckageeve is a harsh place you wont always have everything go your way its a do or die world and people do what they can to get along if salvaging some wreckage gets them a few more isk someone will do it it doesnt matter who just blew it upby ccp prism xif youre surprised as to why the server does not consider it your stuff its because its a mini profession designed for people who want to roam and look for salvage not to further increase the revenue from mission grinding i doubt anyone with a perspective thinks we need to highsec increase mission grinding any furthereve is a really hostile game we love how hostile it is we never meant for it to be a breezejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
nice collection of quotes there really sums it all up i really do think this is about people needing a shift in expectations salvage is not the posession of the person who blew the ship up if you accept that then you can move on if it upsets you that someone is salvaging ships you blew up then stop doing your mission for a bit simply warp off a ninjasalvager in a probe cant  doesnt want to do a level 4 mission theyll scan down another battleship you have a week to do a level 4 so come back lateror you can try being a ninjasalvager too and see if you get enjoyment out of it or try baiting the salvager and get a fight same works with canflippers i heard about a can flipper in a gulfonodi belt pretended to mine he fliped my tin i got a battlecruiser 10000km off the belt  dscan to only get the belt  waited  saw him  warped in and i lost my battlecruiser but the fight was ace and there was gf in local and lolsbut what you mustnt do is qq because it feeds them
where have you guys been lately seems as the months went on the involvement from the csm became less and less i recall seeing treabor and a few others post from time to time but thats about it the assembly hall is designed specifically for the csm to receive input from the players as a csm member it seems like you would be more active on the forums and more so in assembly hallby this i dont mean sarcastic idiot humor as your reply to everything you should be providing your own feedback encouraging discussion and development of ideas yes that means you mittani especially youand yes this belongs in ah
this also goes out to the future csm membersnew and old please take more part in the assembly hall doing so may even cut down on some of the repeat posts and trolling that occurs here
to be fair mittens did pipe up to let us all know how manpretty he thinks he is but that was over in general
sorry spencer but a thread like this is going to get you nothing but flamed you dont want to be placing bountiesit is pointless you are just giving them money find a good alliance willing to help you out and join them make friends and stick with em for safety stop letting pirates kill youwelcome to eve and best of luck
hire mercs or better just ignore join a 00 corp make some serious iskU266B when your ship gets blown to bits U266A U266B and you lose your faction fits U266A U263B dont worry U266A U266B U266A U266B U266B U266A U266B U266A be happy U263B
presets for fleets is fine idea also i think should be added a dialog for pilots to pick wingsquard to join when entering a fleet
i havent found supported button so i just post here to see it again
1 does you mine if there is an neutral player using a sb in your system new pos system new sov system
ok removing your trolling and talking about tactics of defensehow do you guys deal with it like if there is an sb fleet cloaked on your lvl5 industrial system and your industry is shut down for example new pos system new sov system
well my opinion here is that there should be increased pvp and increased risks so1 this is a valid point of view although hotdrops are good they heat up the fight and they should continue the way they are in my opinion since they scale the fight to higher levels and it would be hard to balance this without reducing the pvp level of the game dont you think the same 2 true although there are always the ships that logoff in the system and the danger could always came from the nearest system or from a wh it is never 100 safe and for now the only way to get a cloaked ship killed is for bad timing at gates or incompetence this makes hunting for a cloaked ship that enters in the system boring3 100 correct new pos system new sov system
i believe that only a select few should have the authority to create a new thread in the assembly hall either a csm who has had an issue brought to their attention or someone who has been given the authority to post their well thought out and discussed idea for a proposal from the features and ideas discussion forumanyone should be able to voice their concern approval or opinion in any threads that have been opened but not just open their own thread willy nilly
i agree most of the problem stems from trolls and peoples flat out unwillingness to discuss issues and tendancy to simply flame someone instead pretty much every proposal i have made on the new forums so far is a proposal i have made previously on the old forums that already went through id and yet i am continuously told by people to submit to id guess whatalready did that not doing it again just to appease one or two people but you are rightthere is a lot of repeat threads and random stuff posted to ah frankly if everybody just ignored the threads they dont like instead of flaming and ranting about it the thread would die and dissapear sooner but people keep bumping these thread to the top because they just cant keep their opinions to themselves posting to the topic once is fine to say you dont support it but to continually return and just flame is a problemhonestly to the op it is likely that what you ask for will not happen recently i just started blocking people and just ignoring the threads i have nothing good or constructive to say in i find it helps a lot for myself at least
where do i apply to be an isd moderator of csm forums so i can turn assembly hall into a posting utopia by enacting one strict law
i dont think it would be that simple likely you have to follow very strict rules of your own and wont be allowed to do whatever you want with peoples posts
anyone have an opinion on the second part of my proposal regarding capital ships
you may notice that i specifically wasnt talking about the ishkur ishtar or dominix these three ships are fine in as much as drone boats are considered UFFFDworking as intendedUFFFD in the current state of game mechanicsyes this is why you see fleets of drone boats rampaging the systems of eve yeah the myrmidon and dominix can be active tanking monsters but this is an extremely niche role this change could help move these ships out of this extremely limited niche and encourage their usage in larger fleet engagementsa major issue is that both the cruiser and battlecruiser hulls for drone boats require not only training into two different weapon systems guns and drones but these ships are the only ships of their kind that also require training into a battleship size weapon heaviessentries in order to maximize their potential in addition this potential is significantly below their counterparts when you consider all the issues and easy counters to dronesthe change included in this proposal is intended to help encourage new players into training into drone boats outside of the pve environment as well as improve the usage of gallente hulls in the pvp environment by making more ships competitive with their minmatar and amarr counterparts in both solo and fleet engagements
what a bunch of butthurt from supercarrier club pilots whining to selene oh but i cant use the fighterbombers anymore whaaaaaaabullshit you just cant use them to kill everything now you can still use them in much more limited roleno respecs not for noobs who want to dump mining skills that they usedno respecs not for petulent supercarrier pilots that used they drone skill for how many months to kill everything in sight and now can still use them but just not to kill everything in sightno respecs to use the meme cry more
this
oh where is your support for that  the bolded and underlined part simply stating something does not make it so you dont have any support for that statement it is your worry not mine and not that of almost all of the people who have responded to your proposalso you try refuting a statement that the majority are opposed to respecs by saying no a majority support respecs ok wheres your polling data your supposed majority is a liewe dont have polling data about what the majority of eve players would prefer regardless whatever the majority opinion might be this is not a political election where the majority opinion matters and will determine the course ccp follows it is a business and they have to calculate the depth of feling of whatever portion of customer base feels either way the important consideration is which way will the game lose subscribers will ccp lose tenuous new players who trained astrogeo 4 made some money mining for a while as noobs with their mining cruiser or retriever and then went pvp and wish they could have that sp allocated in medium ac spec will ccp lose a couple hundred butthurt supercarrier pilots who fotm chased when scs were ridiculously op and now want to dump fighterbomber sp for titan sp or will ccp lose many varied and longstanding players who resent the change in the core game mechanics that could only favor fotm chasing and pouting brats ccp will then ask how many players will we lose out of these groups with either pathone thing that is clear is ccp did the math after the shitstorm of protest with the incarna p2w fiasco ccp learned that it cant  up the game without provoking a response that will kill it poeple did walk with their account renewals until ccp apologized and refocused on the core game aspects so ask yourself does ccp have a stable sp mechanic going that may result in some minor petulent or spoiled quitting by fotm fickle customers or does ccp fear the shitstorm i think the last protest to radical redesign of the core game mechanics showed that ccp does fear the shitstorm and rightly sobtw also ask yourself why the vast majority of the responses to your proposal have been negative but you seem persistent so im sure even while you profess to not be in favor of the concept behind your proposal you will continue to argue for it have fun wasting your time and may the sisters of eve bow to the rp segment of the eve populace whould i run for something have mercy on your soul if by some chance you are right because you will be rather unhappy with the sorry game that would result
hey i am only replying to this thread when someone else does i am not bumping it needlessly it is obvious it is mostly hated by those that browse these forums you are more than welcome to not respond to this thread at all and let it die
1 then stop posting2 stop playing the last word gameyou wont readyou wont listenyou wont thinkyou just guessassumeand wildly speculatethat was the point of that wonderful wall of textwhile i may not completely agreeat least its rationaland it makes senseunlike the tripe you post all over hell half the time stop the evemailUFFFDspam
your proposal is broken if you unlearned stuff at half the rate of learning stuff and unlearned sp can go directly into skills youre basically doubling learning sp gain everyone would just start constantly unlearning those skills that they are mapped for to maximize sp amount returned and put new sp in what they want to actual have trained even if its the same skills as youre receiving twice as much sp for your time the only sp reallocation i could support is where you get a small amount of sp to move every year similar to a remap lets say 2 million sp you get a month of training back to allocate where you currently need it but 2 million a year isnt significant enough or frequent enough to allow fotm
i think you should rethink that for a minute if it takes more time to unlearn a skill and you cant train another skill in the meantimehow can you possibly double your sp i see what you are saying but you are thinking about it wrong if i have 1 million sp and it took me 1 year to attain that i can unlearn the skills and refund the entire 1 million sp in 6 months i still only have 1 million sp but if i had not unlearned anything to begin with and had just kept on training i would have 15 million sp the point isnew players that screwed up and want to keep playing but dont want to have to wait another 3 months just to train the skills they need that they already have the sp for can do it in less time but still be punished for screwing up older vets that have dedicated years to this game who really have nothing of value to train wont need this the people in the middle might invest a little time to get rid of a few skills they regret taking that they never use in favor of those they might use more while still being punished i doubt there is anybody out there that is going to get rid of all of their skills simply to respec entirely most people have at least a little direction and just dabbled in one or two other professions on the way up
armor sniping muninn rocks yo
ill keep this brief for all you tldrersthe problem for a lot of lp store items it is simply unprofitable even in some cases virtually impossible to acquire the tags required to purchase items due to really low drop rates of particular tags in addition the distribution of antifaction missions is really lopsided for example in gallente space the main antifaction missions are pot and kettle and in the midst of deadspacewhere the enemy is amarr nice going ccpthe solution split the distribution of missions so that either wholly antipirate or antifaction missions are offered when a capsuleer first approaches their agent for example a dialogue box would pop up asking hello name i can offer you a choice of either political or law and order missions which one would you like takeim sure there are problems somewhere with this but i dont have the time to intricately go through them now i will later thoughthanks for your commentsideassupportstrollsadding mxzfs suggestion see below
im not seeing much of an issue with this i would suggest putting another two buttons next to the request mission button for the agent and have them be request antipirate mission and request antifaction mission which would actually help both the missioners that care about their standings no more 4h waiting period and the missioners who want tags to sell no more pirate missions with no tags and there would still be the request mission giving out completely random missions for people who just dont carewith any luck and enough people running antifaction missions for the tags this could help to drive down tag prices which i would see as a very good thing as long as all three options remain a choice at all times and you dont lock yourself into a certain set when you first talk to the agent it sounds fine to me
nice idea the idea you proposed is essentially the same as mine  i meant to clarify in the op that the choice wouldnt be permanent  you could always back out of say choosing political missions and instead go with antipirate
yes looking back over the op i really meant to add that in lol  well done for bringing it out to the fore p
sounds perfectly fine to me then and yeah i was hoping thats what you meant i just wanted to make sure and i had what seems like a good idea for where the choice could be so i figured id toss that in too
thanks  your suggestion in your first post helps the old and senile to focus their thoughts 
this is a surprisingly well thought out simple idea and it is consistent with the removal of learning skills it also fixes a whole lot of issues regarding null pvp and jumpclones as mentioned
i dislike agreeing with testicles and goons but i like this idea
anonymous forum alt like an elected csm in public office making a comment for the removal of learning implants  and there is no name in the minutessounds to me like everything is working as intended you dont want to take the risk of expensive implants then you do not get the reward of accelerated learning the real risk isnt the loss of training rate itUFFFDs the cost of replacement in the pvp universe as so many recite includes the accumulation rate of skills a contest it pleases me to beat you in why should the game change based on your style of play what a disgusting concept if you want to win this contest the game already has given you the mechanism to level the playing field your request parallels hisec carebears crying over suicide ganks or incursion disruption not their style of play they say in the cold harsh eve i have no sympathy for either them or you yes learning are seeded via the loyal point system but they are also available readily on the market are you telling everybody you do not trade at all as an example outer ring excavation goodies are only available on loyal points  should these removed or seeded through another system and removing attribute bonuses UFFFD wouldnUFFFDt that make plus three implants with secondary bonus next to worthlessso the answer remains no welcome the skill point interdiction
ask and we shall receiveso 145 of kills in hisec result in a podding at least this is how it worked out in january over the course of a year then 1520 would be more than generous of an assumptionedit  so a 1 in 5 chance of losing your pod learning implants are fineedit 2  yes this is hisec only in no way am i implying that nullsec is anywhere as safe for your pod
nice and that is just highsec as you said low and nullsec especially nullsec probably have far more pod kills not to mention wh space honestly with all the pvp i have seen in wh space i have seen very few pods get awayespecially with bubblers either way you were right in that the number is lower than i thoughti dont think this is a question of would removing learning implants encourage more pvp i think it definately would the question is how would the isk from no longer losing those implants balance out in the game
i dont think lowsec would be much higher than highsec  still cant bubble  though on the other hand the pvp guys are probably better at the twitchlock that you need to nab a pod id be surprised if its above 33nullsecwspace is probably closer to 50 or even higher so the question of implants there is probably valid
following this logic all implants are pointless as someone who wants to be hyper optimized in x needs to have the implants for that and will then not want to play the game incase they lose themsoalthough they bug meill just stick to using what i can afford to lose
1 this change wont negatively affect botters in the long run and it might discourage new playersit might even help botters if a proportion of suicide gankers are lazy and couldnt be arsed scanning them down all dayunhindered bot mining here we com
mineral prices going down would not necessarily be a bad thingyou are correct about the net effect on botting it will be near zero people who think scanbots are really hard are naive or terrible at programming
this is a super suggestion it will make mining more fun as well as helping eliminate bots id really love to see this put in the gameit is a really strong suggestion i dont belive that the bots will easily learn how to play the probe game i dont think it will alienate the newer players id really love to see trhis happentotally 1 
hi aggressive nutmegi hear what you are saying but from my limited understanding the bot programs have to interface with the game via a simulated keyboard and mouse and by seeing and then interpreting the screen i think this could make scanning very hard for bot programs unless of course there is a surefire method that could become an algorithm that will always render a resolved site then i dont see it happening the bot program would have to see the little arrows on the probe squares as well as interpret the image past the spinning spheres  as well as seeing the sites and in 3 dimensions allign the probe formation over the target sites   i just see the probe mini game as the closest thing to a captcha eve hasi really thinkhope it would defeat the bots i hope you are wrong  but im not a programmer and you may see how to get past the above issues  so it could come to be that what you predict is what happensbut i still think this is the most elegant suggestion ive seen for ages it will add gameplay it will add fun to mining so even if it doesnt get rid of bots it still has merit if it can reduce botting then that is just a brilliant bonus
the idea isnt to change it to drop loot just to generate a record indicating who damaged the ship before it self destructed a subcap gang can certainly catch and kill a super thanks to the new logoff mechanics but at this time the intelligent super pilot will simply initiate self destruct when it becomes clear help is not coming and a supers ehp is such that it essentially requires another supercap fleet to kill it in that 2min windowits easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths abrazzar the risk of having your day ruined by other people is the cornerstone with which eve was built ccp solomon
i would support this only if a part of the killmail recorded it as a self destructthe other parts im in full support ofpods imo should take just a few seconds
id say thats fairits easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths abrazzar the risk of having your day ruined by other people is the cornerstone with which eve was built ccp solomon
generate kill mails if theyre aggressedcapitals should have a longer self destruct timerthatd do me
stay away from the dread seriously not even sure why its being lumped in with these titansrecently t2 siege modules just came out giving a much needed boost to the dreads but regardless a t2 siege  t1 siege module grants a 50 tracking speed penalty this penalty fairly well nullifies the dreads from being able to hit tiny stuff unlike there titan big brothers that can nail cruisers etc plus titans long range and ridiculous alpha means that a glancing blow will shred a cruiseri do agree that titans in theory should only be able to hit bc and bs ships effectively however the way the current gun formula is written this is nearly impossible to accomplishnow that titans cant dd subcaps i have a lot less complaints with log off timers gone dropping blobs of supers becomes a much more dangerous proposition 1 to more dead supers
my point is when you start trying to compared dreads to titans they cant be identical there has to be some justification for the titan cost and what point of the titan sacrificing its tank to be able to do this do you people not get when the titan is nothing but a giant tracking boat they are fairly easy to kill so man up and come up with a way to kill them this whole bitching about the titan tracking is getting old imo they got nerfed to much the first go around
its not just n00bs who are clueless about aggro mechanics i got an old post about my confusion with it all there are a few of us who when we see qq in local and see the player is 10 days old do try and offer some support rather than the usual lol nub  l2p comments that are so popularthe trouble is n00bs dont just stay in the starter systems the last issue above was an 11 day old player a gallante in gulfonodi of all places
wow ive seen plenty of arguments against this idea in my time in eve but that one takes the stupid cake by a fair marginthe world as we know it came about through an anomaly anomou the gospel of philip 15
you might as well advocate for everyone to have artificial lag to account for some people having poor connections and random deductions from our wallets to make the playing field level for those stupid enough to fall for scams and masks for the pretty avatarsdirect control isnt practical because of the scale of the game as has been discussed 1000 pilots trying to fly stick at the same time would result in a huge lagfesti would enjoy flying an interceptor through fleet battles and ice fields and other such placesbut its not going to happen
boho if some salvaged your wreck youll still get the loot if they havent taken it yet armor repping looting and whatever else gets you agression timer is fine but plz not salvaging its fun when people race for it and it be dumb when someone starts shooting over salvage yes i sound like a carebear but really come on
salvaging working as intended if i could downvote you i would
obviously everyone knows the drill here working as intended ccp wont be changing this because those wrecks arent yours to begin with blah blah blahbut if youre looking for the right to shoot someone for stealing your stuffwhere do you run missions i have a punisher for you to shoot at
yeahnot exactly the kind of csm representative we should want hell ccp shouldnt even want him
i spend time every day monitoring ah threads i only occasionally add my 002 isk however its often better to let discussions percolatemany members of the current csm are not big supporters of the oldstyle csm proposal system in fact theres been only one during csm6 which i raised however i think there is merit in it its just that given whats already in the csm backlog the bar is high when it comes to adding new stuff and the development realities are such that many proposals even ones with much merit will just moulder thereeven so the discussions here and in features  ideas are valuable because they are a reference resource that is available both to csm and ccp  in particular when ccp is looking for new story ideas
thinly veiled anti mittens thread becomes not so thinly veiled after 4 postsa new record
thanks for the reply its just nice to know that the csm members are still there and actively working with the rest of the populace of evei dont need to veil anything let alone thinly veil something if i want to call out mittani for being the smacktard he is i will do it despite my feelings for mittani i think he could actually do some real good for eve through the csm if he tried and really cared to as it is he comes off as very aloof and arrogant which makes the csm look rather bad all csm members should be able to separate themselves from their personal agenda in eve and represent the entire community for ccp not just their constituents do what is best for ccp and eve as a whole not yourself i rather like what trebor and even seleene try to accomplish and how they accomplish it i hope both of them run for csm and i hope both of them win again this year good luck to both of you
used for same grid maneuvers max 400 500km yesin system map veue no as this would facilitate the instant creation of deep safes that would otherwise be impossible to get bms forit would be abused to  and you know it
100 agree
i wish that you could just order the folks in local in some other way than alphabetical  how about by standing people with negative standing towards you are either at the top or bottom etc that way once you add wts you know if theyre in system immediately 1
i dont know if anybody out there is using medium shield transfers but id like to the only problem is the range of a med shield transfer is only 6km why whos using a strr if it only works within 6km except for logistics which have a range bonus but logis use large transfers so please just increase the range of medium strr up to 20km otherwise theyre as useless as 50mm armor plates
most ships using shield transfers are using larges and likely get a bonus to the range i think 20km is a bit muchi am not sure they really need a buff honestly
t2 logis only use largehowever you dont need to use the t2 logi ships
while youre at it fix factionded rrs to be better than meta4t2 ones too atm they have worse boostcap ratios across the board and the t1 logi ships have enough cap issues to begin with
i want the not button toohow do i support this wheres the button
just like other sites youtube reddit etc etc etca dislikedownvote button would be interestinggoodon the forum posts you could see replies views likes dislikesthis would also need to be tied to one likedislike per account to stop people burying ideas of boosting their own or some such thingultimately i think itd give a better idea of how ideas are percieved by the forum public ok i just saw the flaw in it but still usefull no
not the first time this has been suggestedmaybe its time to beat the dead horse again
but its the only part of eve im any good at
seems to be the source of several other topicshereand herei agree that the forums need some better feedback options but to dislike a person and not their idea will be abused to deaththe thread itself needs these buttons the playerbased like button needs to go imho
i know the tactics to use baits and how to get a cloaked ship on a campgate also im trained to avoid campgates while clacked i lived on a wh i fly protheus arazu on pvp and i can tell you the game goes on even if there are cloaked ships in the system or not at last for me i have 3 differents chars 1 at nullsec 2 at wh space so if the wh gets boring i go play in nullsec and if nullsec gets boring i go back to wh and if both gets borring i go do other thingslike thinking ways to make it less boring and posting herebut this game is not only rating and pvp there are all sorts of players on eve and you should respect their playstyle there are players that are industrials and what they do is to purchase and manufacture ships for pvppvethere are pilots that doesnt fly combat ships and hate pvp and also hate pve the like to mine these few players are responsible for most of the minerals that are available in the marketthese players when there are a nonblue player in the system just stays inside the force field or inside the outpost waiting for the storm to pass or for their allies make the system safe again for them they are not carebeers they are the ones that build your ship and there would be no eve without themso im proposing a way to increase the difficult for those who enters the system and stays cloaked for hours ruining the game of this guys and everyone say to me that im the noob and i dont have balls to live in nullsecdont you guys want more fun in the game less cost for ships more pvp a better game for small alliancesif you open the map pressing f10 and you look at sovereignt and then development indices you will notice that there are militar at lvl5 everywhere and there are almost no industrials this means that what you say is 100 correct people dont mine for isk becouse it just dont woth the risk they can make much more money killing npcswhat i ask if for a ballanced game where you could make a life being a pirate a miner an industrial a pve or a pvp or anything you wantim not doing this proposal before thinking but you guys are complaining about this proposal because you are thinking only on yourselves but of course im not asking for a way to make nullsec as secure as hisec just putting some difficult for cloakers wouldnt do this but this small fix would increase the gameplay for industrials and other defenseless sorts of players this would result on more ships and modules available on nullsec market and more players for eve and more fun for pvp players new pos system new sov system
as long as the godmode intel tool known as localchat still exists then cloaking is working exactly as it shouldnot least of all as a most delightfully potent psychologicalwarfare tool
there is whspace for this doesnt it also if you read the last csm meeting minutes ccp is working on something related to the local chat being used as an intel tooland i dont think that this psychologicalwarfare is a good thing it ends up pulling away people from eve i mean this kind of warefare works against industrials and miners on a cynojammed system but will not work against a hurrycane killing some rats since they would 1 voley any frigate that shows up so this means that everytime that a system reach lvl5 on industry someone will show up and cloack for 1 week inside the system untill it reaches 0 again and there is nothing that can be donei have a friend that played eve for about 5 years he was industrial he hated pvp but he had amost all bpos trained and he also had 3 tech2 bpo all this time he played on hisec he had lots of billions on his wallet but he was not the kind that want to lose a single isk well he tried to go to nullsec joining an alliance he took all the minners he had there about 7 acounts while the other 11 kept running his own things on hisec he is a business man in rl pays subscription for all his 18 acc but what happened to him he stayed 7 days in nullsec in this time there was some untouchable sb in the system for about 6 days so despite the fact that we told him to dont leave the forcefield the sb logged off for a couple of minutes he put all his miners on the gravimetric and then the sb logged back again and before someone realized he had lost a hulk and a 1bi pod  yes he is inexperienced in pvp as you guys are on industry after this day he hauled everything back to hisec played 2 more weeks and then stoped playing eve incursionthis means that ccp lost 18 subscriptions on this and there are 18 less characters producing ammo drones and stuff also some complains about some prices risinghe had right to have fun playing eve doesnt him furthermore this is the reason for a game to exists if we wore able to make harder for the sb to keep on the system that time probably he would still be playing and this is what ccp would want increase the fun of the game and increase the number of players new pos system new sov system
cloaked ships should also vanish from localproblem solvedtrue cloaking createdthen add in the hunt like a submarine thing
you may be right if the csm restricts certain thing then intervention by ccp is possible but a vote would be a good idea to players who do pay attention to the forums etc csm is as bad as ive been hearing lately ccp would have to do something
both this and the op are good suggestions rep bonuses on ships tend to be completely wasted in pvp
bumping for exposurei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
fair enough i can understand you wanting the functionality sooner rather than later but they are going to have to work on formations as some point when they do it would be unbelievable not to see tractor towed ships it is an ubiquitous scifi utilitytractor mods need some attention there is a whole host of stuff that should be legal to tow that isnt im suggesting that this class of ship would benefit from the development of the formations mech and an iteration of the tractor mechswhat would be even better in my opinion is an open skeletal ship model that showed the contents of its hull but that would open up a whole different can of worms
1 very good idea nothing to add
supported
not a bad idea not something i would use personally as i just sell all my stuff and move on so i dont have to move anythingi see the use though for some people
im always mystified by the suggestions for creating entire classes of ships simply to save money on rigs all that coding balancing art resources blueprints construction calculations etc just because people dont want to strip rigs off their ships being able to carry 3 rigged battleships is the equivalent of carrying 15million or more m3 which far exceeds the capacity of any other ship in eve including carriers you can move 2 rigged battleships in a freighter using courier contracts if the only purpose of the ship is to move rigged ships and all it can move are rigged ships then its pointless just strip the rigs off the bs already not supported
this read and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
just wanted to agree with the posterwh stabilizers would completely destroy any and all reason to live in a whyou could hop in at any time from a system with a blob which is why goon supports stabilizers fking blob warfare needs to stay in nullclear out all the sites and hop backthis would completely thrashdestroy the market for any and all wh goods probably another thing goon wantswhs are excellent in their design atm small gang pvp for the most part with the ability to siege and have take downs if properly planned rnk or aharm anyoneive lived in a wh for just shy of a year now and while they can be very profitable there is also a lot of risk and a lot of time investment constant scanning logistics for getting stuff inoutall in all i think whs are one of the most balanced aspects of eve and shouldnt really be bothered
i am not a wormhole dweller although i have considered moving into one several timesbut even i can see how damaging this would be to the wormhole way of life wspace is the only place in eve where you can pvp without the risk of getting blobbed or hotdropped and it needs to stay that wayi used to think that it would would be cool if cynos and jumpdrives worked in wspace with a mechanic to prevent cynos in c4 and lower of course systems linked by a worm hole would not necessarily be close to one another so it would take so time to find systems within jump distance of each other but even this would severely damage the current wormhole way of life the possibility of getting hotdropped would be equally damaging to the small scale as this idea of wormhole stabilizersleave wspace alone except maybe expanding it but the mechanics are close to perfect do not break them
is ccp changing these mechanics it would be nice if they would at least consider this change make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i do not agree that fleet boost should be limited to on grid actually with the number of systems in eve the argument could be made it should extend to the hole constellation i do believe though that you should not be able to leave the booster ship sitting safe inside a pos shield and it still contributes to the pvp fight with no risk to itselfeven the mining fleets generally leave the orca or roqual safe inside the pos shields while the fleet is out mining these ships were meant to be on grid with the mining fleet that is why they get the tractor beam bonusesif gang links could not be activated inside a pos shield then it would add a whole new level to the role of fleet boosting in game you could have it at a safe spot but there would be risk orca would be used in the belt with the miners or not at all roqual could be kept inside the shield and used for compression but if you want to benefit from the fleet boosts you need to take it out of the posjust my 002 isk and for the record i do run mining fleets and usually have my orca in belt with the other ships so much more efficient and a little risk reduces the boredom
this proposal makes allot of sense skimming through i didnt see any significant downsides either make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
hello eve as a newer player i really like this idea i recently have got more into pvp in general been mostly running missions i went on two roams and got a little lucky it dropped my sec status surprisingly fast all targets were other people roaming looking for pvp as well not an impossible barrier or anything but seemed slightly crazy how long it would take to raise the sec back up through even lvl4stldr 1 from a younginslten thousand years  recruiting chill dudes for exploration in game channel  10k lounge
1 i like this proposalit came up somewhere in the middle about sentries not having tracking  i think they should it might allow for limited frig engagements on gates where the aggressor will decide if they can make a kill fast enough and then gtfo go
1 supportedinitially on reading the subject and imagining what the proposal would be like i thought that it would be just one of those typically insane simple solutions to a perceived problem that would actually make things much worse i avoided readin
this is the first unquestionably good idea ive seen about fixing lowsec in years ill yoink it and dump it in front of ccp lowsec eves vegas but with more guns
wow this is an unexpected turn of events also inb4 shtstorm
i agree that ccp needs to rework what the minor plexes they should let af in minors and create a rookie plex that only lets t1 vanilla frigates in t3 cruisers are allowed in medium plexes but t2 cruisers are not i think they should just not allow t3 cruisers in mediums and the problem is fixedas far as cloaks not working in plexes or missions that does sort of cut both ways one of the best ways to catch stealth bomber mission runners is to put a cloak on your ship warp into the mission and immediatly cloak when the sb lands on top of you you will both uncloak and you can lock the sb its a pretty good trick that i actually had pulled on me make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
tags need to go
it would be very nice to have thismake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i have over 200 bookmarks in some systems and every one gets used i do not want all of that in my overview its fine where it is because ccps all or nothing programing means that i couldnt just have a few on my overview it would be all 200 or none at all
has anyone noticed how faulty the jaguarwolf turret positions are it has been so ever since the incarna expansion when the turrets were renovatedif you look at a jaguar1st turret slot places 2 turrets at the front and another turret on top at the back2nd turret slot places a turret an each wing at the sides of the shipbut the 3rd turret slot places 2 turrets underneath the hull it would have to shoot through its own hull to shoot above itever since that expansion you could put turrets in any order you liked that means you could just put a turret on the last turret slot of a jaguar if you did you would see that just those 2 turrets underneath the hull would have trouble shooting anything above it without trying shooting through its own hullthe wolf basically has the same problem it has the same turret layout as the jaguar except it also has the extra 2 turrets on top of the hull at the back because of the extra turret slot it has again these turrets would have to shoot through its own hull to shoot anything below it as well as above it for the 2 turrets underneath the hullthe rifter seems finebecause of the turret layout it has it wont have its turrets shooting throught its hull but lets be honest the turret on top on the right and the turret underneath on the left looks awfuli think the original turret layout for these ships were better and made more sense despite the lack of a turret to shoot above with the 2 turrets at the front i understand that this is only somewhat of a graphical issuebut its still kind of annoying
after watching 3 super carriers sd last week i am going to sign this 
hmm where do i start they deal dread dps without the need for a siege mode they can bridge fleets from the relative safety of pos shields they can run six ganglinks without any command processors in addition to the ability to fit six ganglinks the hulls themselves give insane bonuses to fleets  the erebus massive armor bonus the leviathans massive shield hp bonus and the avatars capacitor regen bonus are all extremely useful to capitals and subcapitals alike their doomsdays can put 3000000 racial damage on any capitalsized shipi think the cost is fairly justified its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i find it kinda funny that after motherships got nerfed into insignificance against subcaps as did ddds people are now up in arms against titans just shooting things at all while it may seem a bit silly that titans can alpha almost any ship it is simply the practical application of a well established tracking formula we all know that bit guns can hit small ships under the right circumstances its just the way the tracking formula is the truth about all the lolmails people is that the same as trying to fight an alphabs fleet with frigates people are discovering that it is near impossible to beat the tracking from all of the ships all of the time thats the key here people scream about how frigs should always be able to beat tracking and that is true but only against one ship there is no practical way to dodge all of their tracking unless you are orbiting very fast a very long way away and we have all known that this is true for a long time some people arent going to be happy until supercaps are totally useless except for pos bashing most likely because they dont have a superfleet but are likely to fight people who do theyll be complaining about jump portals soon enough and then about clone bays and then about capitals being able to carry other ships too what we need here is a little sanity if you are in the situation where you are being shot by titans my advice is to run at 90 degrees to the direction of fire
no the key here is that ccp grossly underestimated us and our ability to massproduce titans like they were frigs  the tracking formula is tried and true but since it was clearly not meant to balance the current situation where a double digit number of titans can kill any and all things something else must be introduced to plug the holewhy are supers still immune any way it made sense when they were born as they were intended to be few and far between but nowperhaps a revision of ewar could include a contest ala what is used for ecm to be calculated before effect is applied and supers could then be granted a highish base number whereas other ships have only a few points or 0  in other words make them susceptible to tdecmdamp spam and there will be a way to counter titan spameither that or removal of immunity through nerfbat specialized module or sov dependency
oh look another super thread where andski is crying his eyes out titans cant do dread dps and fit 6 gang links but spin your yarn how you like andski nobody can stop the flood of your crying anyway short of ccp outright removing supers something that theyve said they wont dothere is more wrong in this thread than any one person can addressyes your dread can hit sub caps just fineyes you can make caldari and minnie caps hit just fine with missiles and do tremendous damageyes you can make a bs hit a frigate with no problem at allits all in what you put on and in the ship90 of this thread needs to go back and try again except andski who just needs to stop its getting ridiculous for this poor dude
while ccp never thought that we would produce titans in the numbers that people have done they always knew that things with titan guns would be able to shoot smaller targets because its just an extension of the existing mechanics and it is in fact existing mechanics that are to blame for the current proliferation of titans into the battlefieldagressive use of titans is the only realistic way to even up the numbers in a fire fight they are a ridiculously expensive hard counter to alpha bs without which there would be no answer to whichever power block can bring the biggest bs fleet is there an answer to titan blobbing  not as of yet but then again titans being used agressively havent been arou d that longthe point im trying to make here is that the answer is in the metagame its not in nerfing the titans every fleet has a cou ter but similarly every idea has its time raging because titans have become cool again is exactly the same as all those people screeching about drakes being over poweredsuccessful does not mean overpowered soon enough there will be an answer to titans and someone will whelp twenty of them in a day and then everyone will complain about whatever is able to kill dozens of titans is overpowered its all cyclical and its all relative for the sake of perspective remember that alpha maelstroms one shot anything subcapital in game too but in theory they shouldnt because of tracking and gun sig but they work just fine this is the same asthat but each ship costs billions more and needs a bajillion sp to be honest im ok with thati think that any alliance that wants to win a fight bad enough to exert sixty titans on a single fight is going to win no matter what be it through titans or some otherway
just wanted point out the fights recently where pl and various others have gone toe to toe with the cfc hordes with half the men and held the field at the end of the daybs spam can be countered by strategy and skill by smaller numberscounter compositions people refer to them as titan blobs can only be countered by more titans that breaks the games fundamental rockpaperscissors balancepeople say that you have to sacrifice your tank to get the cruiser blapping abilities and this is true ignores the fact that you can refit off the capital next to you as soon as you get targeted so as to not lose the tank for all intents and purposestitans are balanced as long as no more than 12 are on the field its when you end up blobbing them that they are brokenperhaps a simple solution is to disallow refitting in space if you have an aggression timer even the invisible one we get in 00
while some of what you say is true i take issue with these 2 points1 enough bs become physically impossible to counter its just a fact theres just simply not enough people playing eve to counter them past a certain point the cfc currently contains the largest sum of warm bodies and has the loudest voice opposed to them the reason is 2 fold in that you currently cant be matched simply in ships alone but you can be matched in super numbers so you simply dont like titans in their current incarnation2 with enough caps in a pile it becomes impossible to refit you see i dont expect you to know but if you were in a gigantic cap ball youd have gotten that canned message you get any time more than 12 caps are close to you and you try to refit
i take it your opposed to the thought of forcing titans to be an fc of a large fleet in order to online any system other than jumpwarp then
ever since i started this game anything that counters a blob of t1 ships is always overpowered the problem here is that other than a few alliances nobody commits capitals to battle over fear of loosing them well tough crap put them out there to loose like the others do and you will kill some caps plnc have allot of cap pilots because they actually use their caps and have active cap replacement programs and therefore attracted allot of capital pilots start whining at your alliance leaders to promote cap fleets and cap replacement instead of hording the isk or rmting it or whatever the heck they do with it this omg he wtfpowned my drake army with capitals is getting real old get some balls and some skill and quit crying like little girlsand yes titans can be killed by bs blobs if you do it right
its past the point that a solution like that is viable think of my alliance we have over 100 active titans and were not the only one like this you essentially make the ship uselesstheres too many for such a simplistic solution as that ccp wont nerf the ship into uselessness no matter how much anybody wants it to be that way its just something they wont doso any actual change suggestion has to be something more realistic thats in the scope of something they might do and theyll never take the fun out of the ship its always been in it to one point or another titans will stay titanic even if everybody in game has one
i was chatting in the mining channel today and some folks were saying they played eve because they werent so hot at the basics of economics and eve being based on economics was a good and fun way to learn and get a better handle on the subjectbeing an individual who enjoys marketing and advertisement my immediate though was how is there no marketing or advertising skillbranch in evewith that i would suggest that a skillbranch be looked in to for those who enjoy marketing and advertising this would of course tie in with the trade skillsallow these skills to tie in to the billboards which arent really used to an extensive point currently depending on the skill level would effect the sizetime allotted per ad etc this would be awesome for folks who run salvage companies or hauling companies off my head though this could easily be taken much further itd promote more in game interaction instead of using the forums as much as they do currently and bring more attention to flying in game a salvagewrecker company that invested in the skills would be able to promote their company and mission junkies who are too lazy to salvage could see the service when going through to their next mission hub and spark to the idea of using such a service where they might have never had the ideathis is only the tip of what i had thought of and would like to create a discussion on it where it could be fleshed out more if the initial concept was something worth going further with
i believe what youre talking about is already ingame and is referred to as spamming local or posting it on the wts forumi dont think we need popups or any kind of advertising showing up ingame theres already enough of that to deal with irl and the billboard idea isnt bad but at the same time they are mostly ignored atm and i dont see this as really changing that there is marketing in eve but its more like rl where who you know is much more important than what you know if youre willing to go talk to strangers and get your product out there it will be recognized
the entire spamming of things is exactly what brought me to this idea as for the billboards not being used again another reason i came up with the idea as a starting point on using existing game content and making it more than just sceneryas for marketing being like it is in the real world i dont know how much marketing experience youve had but while knowing people certainly helps it never beats a good sale and display 
well my marketing experience comes from listening to my dad who is in marketing and is in the top dozen or so guys in his field worldwide and most of what he gets paid for is knowing people and knowing who to talk to good sale and display helps but nothing helps more than knowing who to show it to and how to do so so yes i do know a bit about the subject and im not saying that the spamming is a good solution but i dont think that trying to use the mostly ignored billboards in the game is the right solution and after thinking about it im not sure there is an artificial solution ingame that would ever work because its either forcing adds on people or will never be noticed
i think that for items the market already does a pretty good job of bringing together people that have something to offer with those that want something for services however there are much less effective ways to bring those people together ingame people have to get active on forums or already know the right peoplewhat is needed is something like yellow pages where you can find everything from freighter services to mercenariesas for ads im not a big fan just annoying visual pollution like in rl and if we go down that route well soon also have pay aurum to remove ads
i dont know if there is a disconnect or something all i have suggested was to use the current in game billboards to create ad space for in game characterscorpsservices nothing is being added to create forced viewing of ads why would you need to pay to get rid of them are you paying or asking to pay for something to get rid of the current billboards that are in game already displaying bounty values of people no youre not most ignore them as has already been stated people might pay more attention to them if they knew they might see something that they could catch a break on via service or suchall i am suggesting at this point is implementing new skills and using current in game mechanics i dislike using the forums id rather stay in game when i am playing the game not sure why folks are so pressed to continue the norm of using the forums for sales and services
i understand what you are saying the point is if you really want to make the billboards effective at informing people about offers theyd have to be much more prominent than currently which imo is not so good of a solution i agree that you shouldnt need to go to the forums to find offers therefor i proposed yellow pagesaurum for adfreeness was a sarcastic comment on where things would progress to if the marketing and pro aurum crowd would have their way
i once proposed on a different forum the idea that for aurum players could upload videos that would be updated and displayed on captains quarters for those who elect to subscibe to their video feed through advertisements andor solicitations and maybe a feebased system for isk plex is then bought which is turned into aurum and pays off the hosting fee the news tickers would be a full out rss feed run by and subscribed to by players as well
sorry but i think a thousand players posted threads like this one and the answer to every thread was nono because a capsuleer is controlling the whole ship  not only the engine and no because this would change the entire gameplay what would you tell ppl who have 2 or 3 or maybe up to 6 accounts how should they handle this and i say a third time no because i personally dont like the idea of manually flying
there is a game you might like if you like this idea called evochron mercenary
a better suggestion would be for wreaks to trigger agression if they are salvaged within say 1530 minutes of the ship dying on the basis most ships except marauders dont salvage and shoot at the same timethere is nothing more annoying than a salvager coming in and salvaging your wreaks without stealing and you cant do anything about itadd a timer after the timer expires the salvage is anyonesthe profession stays the same its still a valid profession but only if the wreaks are abandoned or not salvaged in a valid amount of timemakes more sense that way i think
a better suggestion would be to stop beating the dead horse and drop the subject read every reply in this thread and you will see that this has been beaten to a bloody pulp already and it isnt going to change
the isnurance loss is a pittance in terms of potential profits afforeded to this exercise and were predetermind not to have a n impact on the activityccp also added significant new additions to improve the suicide ganking profession at the same time dessie improvements and a new tier 3 bc with a large alpha platform much cheaper than bssome people are now reporting the capability of earning a plex in an afternoon as a result of the new bcthis whilst they can easily avoid conflict resulting from their criminal activity with a broken bounty system and activites such as corp hopping dropping from war mechanics or simply using npc corps as such there is little retribution to the act of criminal activities
devblog from 20080806 concord wasnt so powerful prior to that though personally i think they should be ramped down to 2005 levels or whenever it was that m0o locked down the trade lanes
currently you lose the full hull value of the ship you have about 510s to kill your target less if you are an outlaw and get the navy spawn it obliterates your sec status assuming they dont shoot back and they get kill rights on you how exactly do you propose making suicide gankers suffer more without completely deleting it from the gametbh suicide gankers have it pretty rough atm i suggest you stop making yourself such a juicy target since ccp cant nerf them any more than they already have without deleting that aspect of the game entirely
people whining about suicide ganking should get ganked more until they learn to enjoy it
im not involved with you in the way that you like but you didnt vote for me and actively whine about me regularly  so not only do i not care about what you think i actively enjoy seeing you express frustration and feelings of impotencetoodles
no but you see unless you make 50 posts every day saying hey guy this is a great idea i shall propose it to ccp immediately to every pants on head dumbass suggestion which has been made every week for the last 4 years youre not properly representing the community and you should be removed from the csm and executed irl
this is true and typicalthis is somewhere out in left field
its not small gang that ecm really breaks its soloproper solo you know the kind where you dont have a booster alt and a falcon alt and a scout
i am shocked that eve online a massively multiplayer online game would reward those who work in groups its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
tears about solo pvp are cute
if you cant beat them join them theres nothing in the carebear world for you chap youll wake up oneday with your billions of isk your fancy ships and faction mods and youll realise theres nothing more left for you that insatiable hunger for more isk will consume you like it has all the other miners  missioners youll develop a horrific drug addiction your wife will leave you your shiny ships will be blown up my narcistic pirates and terrorists then youll be back to square 1  alone broke and pissed off that the world is so best of luck to you
even though almost all those losses were your fault and you should probably find a corp where theres people who will teach you not to make the mistakes you made you are correct in that the current bounty system sucksedit see if you can join the pirates they seem to know whats up
this is the worst idea evernobody would ever have anybody but hostiles and neutrals showing in local taking an already broken omniscient intelligence gathering device and making it worse in a single move
my guardians often use some mediums depends on how much fitting i blow on the tankmobility  and mediums do an excellent job even in fairly large fights albeit not as well as large obviouslywhat id like to see is for some differentiation of the sizes all there is now is amount repped while cycles are exactly the same double capital rr cycle duration increase large rr to 68s keep mediums at 5s or lower to 4s and make smalls regular bunnies with a 2s cycle  adjust reppedcap to tastegives a reason for purposely downsizing rather than only if you cant fit a large when tending low ehp clientsps give the scytheaurogor the rr bonuses for goddess sake
the problem imo is that you cant use med strr on other ships than logistics sure logis are specialized ships but if you want to fly a rr bc gang youll soon get range problems these gangs are never as effective as logi support but it would open a few new ways to fly in a gang especially for small gangs just balance the logistics so that their range stays the same and increase the range of med rr other ships than logistics would have problems anyway cap  nothing to add
you cant expect every ship to get a bonus to rand on rr rr is specialized and therefor needs special ships to use it properly
thats not what i wanted i just wanted a bit more range logistics would get a little debuff on range so that the range of the med rr would be the same as it is now for logistics so you could try some other fittings but it seems my idea wasnt very thoughtout
i frequently run a drake with a large shield transfer in the utility high got to dump much of the tank to get it stable but it works for me running level 4 missions i run a maelstrom with a good buffer tank and 1400mm ii artties or 800mm autos depending on the mission a drake with a full rack of hml iis and a large shield transfer in the utility slot just in case the maelstrom gets into trouble works amazing 10 warrior iis5 from each deal with the frigates real fast  the drake takes out everything smaller than a bs quickly and the maelstrom eats the bss if the mission is bs heavy the hml iis on the drake do good dps against the bss too i follow them with a noctis on my third account one room behind for salvaging i complete level 4s very fast while completely looting and salvaging everything i can easily do 100m isk per hour with this set up when my fourth account gets up to a decent skill level i will probably add a logi into the mix making it even faster and safer
i support a review of the rr mechanics and modules as a whole 1 i do not think rr needs a buff if anything i think it needs a nerf 2 i think the fitting requirements and attributes of each class of module is somewhat out of balance i also think giving the exequror and osprey a role bonus to fitting the rr modules may be appropriate as well as a general review of the aug and scythe 3 changing the cycle times of rr modules can have significant effects on rr especially when comparing armor vs shield reps while this isnt a bad idea it needs to be done in a manner to maintain the shieldarmor balance
i know this idea had more support in other fw threads it seems not many people in fw come into assembly hall make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i have been calling for improvements to ass hall since forever then ccp made the new forums ignored all improvement suggestions and removed the little dedicated functionality there was insteadobviously supported
the idea behind it is not just to have it and fly it just because you can the idea is to save money and further immersion and flesh out ship roles a little more and to add another aspect to the gamei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
seleene also confirmed he was bringing it to ccp in his own thread a few days ago its great to see the idea picking up momentum even if ccp then does it in a completely different way just getting them to look at lowsec from the right angle is goodwhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
i think this is a terrible idea but am too lazy to argue the point
back when they had the agent revamp removing qualities and changing categories i suggested this and im still behind this this will benefit both those who are working up standings through missions and those who seek to build faction items supported
sounds like a new spin on the oh noes my precious standings argument clever ploy to use tags as the basis for it ill grant you thatwarning product may contain elements of rpremove all tags from highsec missions the idea that enemies are allowed to set up shop within the sovereignpoliced borders of an empires space is ludicrous i mean just how bad is the military command structure if they outsource eradication of such cells to lowly station agentstags in fw are plentiful were they to become a major export item wed have something to help keep afloat that the solobombers cant touch mainly plexers and proper mission runners who hoard tagstags ie antifaction missions in ls in general makes heaps more sense as navy patrols are few so it is reasonable that an enemy could haul in umpteen megatons of gear to set up a forward base would create a marketproduct dependency between high and othersec much closer to what was originally intended in regards to ore goo etc you could of course still have your button saying that you want to fight for the empire in question the mission would merely take place in nearby ls system and be concluded with agent suggesting you sign up for the militia proper hahahahaha
there is something in your proposal it just need a little more work and few improvmentin any case you have my support 1
no this has nothing to do with standings and everything to do with the brokeness of the lp store requirements
i support having bookmarks available for the overview not because id actually include them in my overview profile oh divinitys edge the clutter but because id include them in my bracket profile so that i could see them in space it would make aligning to distant bookmarks much easiersurvivor of teskanen fan of john rourke i have video tutorials for eve online on my youtube channel
my idea is dont mess overview because user could be copy those bookmarks to folder what he need to see on overviewthats why i wrote two overview named folder to personal and corporation locations and when a bookmark copied there thats would appear on overviewthis function maybe make it selectable overview bookmarks
id like the option to put corp and alliance tickers in chat user lists where target portraits and brackets in space have the range id also like to have the velocity and angular velocity id like it if a single chat tab could display multiple channels within it and you could color the chat according to which channel was involved this would make it easier to monitor multiple channels of interest at once implement dronerelated implants please being warp disruptedscrambledbubbled is a very important thing to know id like to have aura verbally announce when the warp drive becomes incapacitated or available precrucible you used to be able to get your current xyz coordinates whenever you clicked add bookmark for your current location this seems to now be missing so id like some form of knowing what my current coordinates are in the solar system new feature please this circle drawn on the background is centered on your current velocity you are warpaligned to any distant objects within the circle survivor of teskanen fan of john rourke i have video tutorials for eve online on my youtube channel
i wholeheartedly agree i mostly miss the sheer diversity of such interesting names take gremlin and thorn then compare those to cataclysm and devastator the bigger missiles always sounded so powerful and now that element has gonethis change was unnecessary  ccp could surely have simply added a damage type suffix if they wanted to simplify things
i never said that they can do both at once but feel free to keep putting words in my mouth its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
you can fit your dread to kill rifters too you know they do after all use the same weapons as a titan
you guys would know 
while i believe your idea has merit i think youre going about it in the wrong way thinking about the yellow pages idea that a previous poster had said i think this might pay off for the services departmentwhat i envision is something similar to the contracts system or the corp or agent finders people could pay a given amount to have their service whether forum signatures hauling or other services listed on the search optioni think this would be both noninvasive unlike the billboard idea and profitable other than this i support this idea
i only suggested the billboards being used because they were already in game and display the bounties of various pirates something like a yellow pages or service listings bookcomm would be just as acceptable in replacement of the billboards
hell no
thats not a suggestion try posting something constructive
the wrecks dont belong to you
your accounts not belongs to you that is ccp property like as idiotism of salvaging its a mini profession
if elected to the csm i promise to give my input on every thread in ahnot really lol its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i am not expecting a post in every thread and a reply to every post but i expect to see them from time to time providing input and posting ideas of their own and requesting feedback it should not be difficult to find posts by csm members especially in a forum dedicated to them
look guys if youre really angry at mittens you should just vote for nicolo davicenza for csm7 thatll show him
i like ass hall because it allows raising and discussing proposals in a public timeindependent and selfdocumenting fashion and it is currently the only formal venue we have to raise proposals to the csm imo it is the csms duty to give as much active input on those discussions as possibleif instead you boycott it like most csms are doing or want to kill it you need to replace it with something else it seems that once elected the csm doesnt actually want to interact with the community and the argument that backlog is full sounds like a lame excuseyou can do better than this
ah well then by your own criteria your very own dear leader should be the first one up against the wall shouldnt he
seems like youre in the same situation that nearly every eve player goes through i went through this myself and you have two choices1 decide this game is too difficult it does have a steep learning curve quit it and go back to whatever game you were playing before this or2 learn from your mistakes come back stronger and recoup your lossesi know this as i once lost 10b isk in a highsec gank i was in a hauler before the wtz days i could easily have quit and moved on but i resolved to rebuild my fortune i hope youre a fighter and learn the ins and outs of this magnificent game but the choice is in your handsone last thing to keep in mind when a player quits eve to return to wow the intelligence of both communities goes up a little
independent of whether it was the ops fault or not the bounty system does need an overhaul transferable killrights are the first step to realizing the great potential in the bounty system
even if you did place a bounty on them its no good because they can just pod themselves with an alt in a clean clone and youve basically just handed them a chunk of cashinsert plug for eve university here seriously you could learn somethingand yeah bounty mechanics could use some work
rectilinear oo err missus
please dont post anymore1 for idea
thats not a bad idea it would help to build fleet structure and get organized fastermaybe have some settings that allow you too designate available squads for corporation permissions too just to make that easier possibly something that could define a pilots role in the fleetbetter idea on accepting to fleet the fc can automatically assign wing command squad command or squad member as a role call feature from there the accepted pilot can then choose a squad or wing based on fleet structure and his or her abilities gives choice on both sidesalternatively the fc could set fleet configuaration to manage everything directly above squad member level and use the role call feature to directly place all squad and wing commanders possibly even another setting which allows himher to micromanage even at squad member levelall based on what the fc wants from each fleet configurationzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
the backbone of any warfighting operation is timely logistical support this would allow for additional vessels to be supplied to pilots in an expedient manneri am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
1 for me now bring me those ships black frog
the amount of feedback mostly positive and very little negative is astounding lets keep this idea moving in a forward directionif you must make negative feedback at least propose something that would be helpful as a tweakbut then again there hasnt been much in the terms of feedback that has been hollow and negativelets get some csm and dev input on this keep the ideas and support flowingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i like this idea hauling ships around is a pain shuttling back n forth takes a good deal of time time i rather spend shooting no slots no ejection option 1 from me
im not sure if security status will entice the carebears into coming to low secmight start first by not calling them carebearsalso how will this increase pvp because they dont have to grind sec you have to do a lot of shooting to get below 2 if youre not shooting pods and your suggestion does nothing for pods structures make a bit of sense i could see dipping below the mark over shooting a pos but then again does structure bashing require us to make a such a drastic alteration to the security status rules of low sechow about graduated war declarations instead such as this war declaration is only valid in 00 to 04 security status systems you still get what you want without the crazy if this then that scenario youre paintingprops to you for using your brain though will still give you a 1
how will it increase pvp did you read the post at all the idea is that they dont have to go below 2 if they dont want to podding will get it below 2 i think youre missing the intent of the idea
this is such a phenomenally good idea that im going to be disappointed if it doesnt happen though i honestly dont think the elimination of kill rights is necessary on the other hand i dont see concord handing a pass to kill a person in high if they have a negative sec
because there are an epic ton of people who avoid fighting in lowsec because they dont want or have the time to grind for sec im one of them i would have spent a lot more time in lowsec if i didnt think i had to put aside a bunch of time drudging through sec grind in the near future if you want isk for pvp and dont have time to grind you always have the passive isk or plex options
at 05 aggression penalty plus 15 kill penalty it takes just 11 ship kills to go from 0 sec to 2 you can get those kills easily in a couple gang fights if you are never primariedgetting those two points back by killing rats takes around 80 high bounty battleships if doing that in highsec missions where you cant switch systems after each rats thats a minimum of 20 hours of mission grindingstructure kills are not significantly more expensive in sec status unless you mean fights around a structurewhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
krs are well balanced in 1v1 scenarios but in gang vs gang they are giving out too easily in a fight between and gcc gang and a nongcc one the first person to die on the nongcc gang will get killrights on everyone on the other side except the primary he was shootingnot a problem now because killrights are redundant against flashies but if this proposal was implemented you would see lots of mission and mining ships dying to killrights from consensual gang fightswhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
has anyone here heard of npc 00  just a question maybe a rework of lowsec based on this might helpmaybe remove lowsec entirely and turn it into npc pirate claimed territory with npc pirate missions or standings gains with them through navy rats in belts  around gates n stations this would enable a whole new dynamic to evolve players choosing either empire npc affiliation or pirate npc affiliation i personally would love to add a guristas pirate tattoo to my toon in customisation like 00 with caps no supers without sov n bubbles and and pvp could reduce empire standings not sec and increase pirate standings now players can choose a full time pirate lifestyle with some benefits and incomecould also make the various navy rats drop the empire faction items thus putting some income to the pirates that choose this path and making the area more appealingjust a thought agree or flame the choice is yours
although i like most of the idea theres one thing i dont like i think you should still take a security hit when you attack someone with positive security status i dont care if pirates kill each other but lowsec isnt just about pvp it has asteroid belts complexes mission agents etc for a reason your proposal would make lowsec even more dangerous for carebears like me it would be a wasteland if you want consensual pvp put up a can in jita join rvb or whatever dont bother me with it
so everyone that attacks a carebear would still be kicked out of high sec basically that would mean lowsec would stay exactly the same as it is right nowi believe theres a huge playground for carebears  its called highsec if you want the additional income cope with the additional riskagain as mentioned before this change would invite many casualsmallscale pvpers who just dont want to be kicked out of highsec for lifeyay right in the face of every pvpergo beg for your fights in jita you dirty scumyou could as well ask for secure 00sec because ratting and mining there is more profitableanywaysi really like dants idea 1
1 though its not something i do i would like the option to do it in the future also i have found them in the past and put them up on contracts in the hopes of selling them to the victimkiller

i read the entire thread b4 posting this and wow half of you all are idiots no offence to the special edi do have to bring this to the tablecapital ships and their weapon systemsrevelation  lasers beam or pulsenaglaf  projectile autos or artillerymoros  hybrids blasters or railsphoenix  missiles cruise or torpsnow y would ccp make the caldari capitals ships and super capitals use a secondary weapon systems while the other races use their primarys simple they dontid personally love a naga with 8 t2 cruise launchers that thing would tear stuff up and at a greater range than any other tier 3 bc would and if you want to start yelling at me about how long i played this game and what my skills are and blah blah so it makes you think you look better but really just makes you look like an ass i have 40m sp i fly every battleship in the game some t2 and various other race t2 ships and some capitals im skilled in all weapons systems and iv played this game for a long time and i have friend who have played this game even longer caldari are missile basedyour friendly adhd and slightly psychotic sov space neighboreva
ah yes how can one disregard such great ships like the sacrilege vengeance and ham legion its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
doesnt the nag have two turret slows bonused and two launcher ones unbonused even without bonuses two capital launchers isnt something to just ignore i dont think other dreads use two weapon systems ah minmatar masters of the mixed racksits power stems from the revolutionary vertical design
i didnt bother reading your op im just gonna tell you what i told every other imbecile who whined about the naga being hybrid baseda missile naga would suck i mean really suck the rail naga is a great ship if you fit it right but giving it missiles would make it worthless compared to the other tier 3s and in generalwith cruise missiles  it would be an utter joke with torps itd have no viable targets below battleship size and battleships would rip it to shreds
you can say exactly this about every ship in game a blob of maelstroms does too much alpha a blob of logistics ships tanks too much a blob of drakes is too tough and too long ranged a blob of falcons can jam my whole fleet i recently pitched an idea to my corp about how to beat a 40ish man tornado blob which had recently beat our ass the answer i came up with other than just numbers was 20 armor tanked scorpions with guardians damnations and herodictors the plan being for everyone to pick 2 guys at random off the target list jam them and deal enough cruisemissile alpha to pop a tornado i still believe that this would work now if we had ever tried that and won would that mean ecm is overpowered  would that mean scorpions are over powered  no of course not it would mean that we brought something that would radically have changed the playing field beyond just gank and tank almost all fleets that are currently pvp standards are pretty damn terrible against a big number of titans thats why people are using their titan fleets to incredible effect as it stands right now we can either chose between two evils1 bs blobs that conquer all including conquering all capitals 2 titans that conquer allthe first one of these sucks for many many reasons bs are cheap and essentially unlimited and only need mediocre skills all that anyone needs to win is a comprehensive ship replacement policy and the stomach to win wars of attrition whoever can command the largest number of bodies will always win the second of these sucks but less so titans cannot be whelped with no ill effects they are limited and extremely labour intensive to build they require extreme amount of sp and even with all of that they need to be used with sanity and support from subcapital fleets titans are dangerous and powerful they allow smaller groups to stand against 1000 man fleets and carry the day but they are far more limited and far more precious i would rather see titans ripping everything apart than battleships because of the practical limitaions on them they cannot be logged in all the time nor be in more than one place at once they are not simply a question of manpower they are a complex and difficult ship to useif you dont believe me take a titan blob somewhere without subcaps and carriers and see how long you last
heh its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i see where youre going with this and i support itwould be nice if it was a corporate skill honestly you could give your corporation advertisement a  chance to be displayed with corresponding skills to affect the area of influencemy own thoughtsa skill to determine  of appearancea skill to determine area of influence hq system 1 jump within hq system 5 jumps within hq system entire hq system region etca skill to determine the cost of displaying the advertisementthe billboard advertisement should also differ from the regular corp adverts we have already something which can be noticed and read in less than 15 secondsnot only does this seem cool it also shows you who runs the local area if youre seeing a corporations billboard advert every 5 minutes or every other gate you start to get a feeling of who actually lives there and operates there will also give corps a reason to use the hq except for fake bases of operations which is what most people use them for now
would you like your mummy now
you know what change it go on ccp please change iti will be one of the first on here laughing my socks off at all the whining when you start losing your billions of isk faction fit shipsthen the next call will be pvp safe mission areas because its not fair muppetsdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
return back to the lottery does not sound like a bad idea but it must be a better solution fot this
a few things to consider however1 value of gank ship with the boost given to destroyers they have become even more efficient gank machines cost of these is pretty much nothing2 sec status with some support 10 sec status isnt that much of a penalty for those who understand how to do itim all for ganking but its a lot easier than you claim
they will become masochists though the power of repeated application of explosion to shipwho are we kidding it wont end until all ships in hisec with sec status 0 are simply invulnerable like a station in a system with sov
wrong sir the mechanic is broken and heres why any npc that i destroy in a mission site the wreck turns white both loot and salvage if a pilot enters my mission site and takes the loot from my white wrecks they are flagged to me as a criminal and i have the option to engage them if i desire several patches ago ccp gave pilots the option to release the wrecks from the mission owner which turned them the wreck salvage  loot blue at that point anyone could loot and salvage with no criminal flags being issued the implementation of this wreck ownership change is what broke the mechanic if releasing a wreck to the public by turning it blue constitutes no criminal action then a wreck that is white loot and salvage must belong to pilot that created that wreck in the first place in this current scenario ninja salvaging must be considered an exploit since there are no criminal repercussions for salvaging a white wreck that belongs to a pilot that created it in the first place ccp needs to fix this then again were talking ccp here dont hold your breathahs
nope turning the wreck blue only releases the contents of the wreck loot to the public salvaging the wreck has never been considered a criminal action and ccp has very clearly stated that salvage is considered to be publicly available on multiple occasionsits easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths abrazzar the risk of having your day ruined by other people is the cornerstone with which eve was built ccp solomon
as per my longstanding position in these matters i support this proposal missioners should not be restricted to watching mission looters go red flashy and then being too afraid to shoot them when they could also so easily be able to watch ninja savlagers go red flashy and ignore them too

guys and gals hes talking about the bounty system not his losses let him be mad thats the appropriate response hes asking for a way to deal with it and youre not giving him answersopi for one did not realise you couldnt place bounties on individuals having sec statuses higher than 1this seems odd and should be fixed if i want to place a bounty on someones head their security status should be irrelevant
every space vessel can possibly carry valuable goods i have seen rookie ships carrying cargo worth several hunded million iskiteron iii can possibly carry cargo which has value over 1 billionprice of ship hull does not matter at alltalking about security status whole system is pretty  being on negative side only gives you a lot of trouble and no real gain so almost everyone just gets it up just enough not to be under 20 only reason to stay below is roleplaying this is maybe a minor thing but nevertheless one of the things ccp and csm both fail to look at like many other things which makes low sec low sec they both just lack knowledge and vision about wtf people are actually doing or looking for in there aside silly faction warfareto the actual point sec status limit for bounties is fine it prevents you for placing illegal bounties on law abiding citizens harhar of course nothing stops you from creating 3rd party bounty service
still thank this is a great plan
i stopped reading right therei was laughing too hard to be able to read any further
there is no downside to this i think this is a fantastic idea and would be easy to implement 9001 opdo this ccp
thinking that people in low sec will not kill your pve ship because they do not want a security hit will just get you killed repeatedly you should give up on that idea right awayanyone who goes to low sec now with any frequency already understands this so this proposal will not deter anyone who already goes to low sec make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
this negatively impacts my gameplay ccp please restore corpse names
i feel the need tobumpbe sure to like the first post if you think space needs a cleanup
i think you mean wilson either way great idea and a 37 day timer would work fine maybe have it variable 3 to 7 days and that way it would be more like an actual hacking device could add a skillbook to speed it up to 3 days from the basic 7ah the possibilities are endlessjust give us a way to get rid of the damned offlined possmason
most hardwiring implants have an actual impact on your ship if you dont fly with them they bring you nothing learning implants dont work that way there is a similar issue with say industry implants but its a minor one as characters with these implants rarely undock to pvp anywaylearning implants affect everyone and make people less willing to risk in pvp sosupported
restore the white active circle around cloak modules much more useful and visible cue than the soft green pulsing we are left with
why did someone revive this long dead horse there was another thread about this recently as well on the test server before crucible was released there were people using nagas to flat out obliterate battleships using torps there are even a few vids on youtube of this it was far too overpowered and had to be neutered i would love a cruise naga thoughbut the naga is fine as is with rails honestly
sorry you see slightly confused as you just described the way they are actually supposed to work not the way they really dobs blobs can be easily countered usually by kiting or sigtanking neither tactic works against titans no tactic works against titans blobbed up except more titanstitans and superscarriers are fairly balanced alone its simply that they were designed with the assumption no one would ever be able to build a blob of themccp is no good at predicting their customer base i honestly dont want titans nerfed exactly but rather limited so you can only field them in fleet support rolesmy idea was to have their systems all locked other than movement unless they are giving fc bonuses to a certain critical mass of other pilots because they work fine when you have 23 on the field the problem is that with 2030 if you cant track that cruiser your buddy 30km from you in the blob certainly can because you will always be at 0 traversal to someone in a blob and a titan gets to one shot you when that happens bs fleets dont because you are not gonna be at 0 traversal against everyone
if that works the other way around as well then you have a like
i am suddently missing the aoe doomsdays againi remember all the complaints about those back in the day and it hardly compares to this issue
jumpin jesus on a pogo stick are you bears completely incapable of using a  search button its right there at the top leftcongratulations though im pretty sure youve started thread number 5000 crying bout ninja salvagers no really there was one on this very same page of the forums right herefeature working as intended deal with itbtw where do you mission i could use more salvage
i thought due to the rumour engine that a certain i will not mention as it is supposed to be an uproven nda disclosure to certain players csm council member declared that t2 bpos were going to be removed from the game in the near future
ive found at least 3 wh in the past week that have abandoned poss littering the moons with no sign of any inhabitants i find it very frustrating that i cant either one take ownership of the moon or just take down the pos all together so i would like to propose some sort of system that would allow for the claiming of the stations or some way of making it possible for new ppl to enjoy wh space im not good at coming up with balanced systems to allow this fairly im just proposing the idea so if there are more ppl in eve that are also annoyed at this situation plz post your ideas so that maybe we can put this up as a priority or even an idea in ccps headthank you
yea there were a lot threads about it
maybe the hacking skill could give one a chance to unanchor an offline pos a higher chance for smaller pos lower chance for faction that would be pretty neat i think
one of the many things that need to be handled in the pos overhaul that eve has needed for like 6 years
1 and then  10000 moreits very annoying to see 100s of dead poss everywhere a pos should not have to be destroyed or left to rot in space forever as a placeholderthere should be profit in taking a dead unfueled  abandoned pos
you mean like this
nerf pos theyre too difficult to destroyin all honestly i see no point why you can anchor deathstar just on top of stargate
umadbrodont get mad at the missionbears it makes them think theyve learned how to troll properlyits easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths abrazzar the risk of having your day ruined by other people is the cornerstone with which eve was built ccp solomon
this thread has come back to life over and over again since salvages were introduced in the game the only thing that needs to be nerfed here are expectations
thisi have a pilgrim gathering dust in the hanger because no one will engage when it goes disco ive gone so far as to loot and salvage entire missions as the ships are being shot in a noctis and still cant get anyone to take a shot at mehow about we make the act of targeting someone a hostile act which it is and therefore an actionable offense of course it would be a field day until bears learn to set auto targetback to 0
actually this could be solved easily if you are still on grid wrecks are yours when you fly away they become freeforallthen if you wanted to salvage in mass scale aka noctis you need to take risk of losing your wrecks in case you want to be safe you can do slowass salvaging in marauder without anyone spitting on your facean perfect example of risk vs reward imoedit ops ninja edit 
it could be solved even easier than that you wanna salvage your wrecks put a salvager on your ship and do it while you kill more rats that or get an alt either wayno more need for threads like this one since it has already had a final say from the devs on it working as intended not going to change
i dont think it should even count as stealing if they take loot from a wreck tbh doesnt make sense just because you blew up an npc it doesnt make its wreck yours in pvp the wreck and its content still belongs to the owner of the original ship if anythign you are stealing form the npc you exploded
looting a wreck should be an offence to prevent people taking high level drops without possible repercussionshowever ninja salvaging is good in my books it is a way of baiting people that you shouldnt react to like bumping in mining belts etcdont like people ninjaing you you are in hisec otherwise you would just pop themthen fit your ship to salvage as you go too far out switch to blasterspulseautocannon
so i am a little confused at this mechanicwhen you fit a infinity point on a hic using for low sec the cap drains so quickly its pretty unusablea little crazy dont you think for fitting a specialised modscript or a specialised purpose ship intended for that purposeproposal is to add more base cap and give a cap significant recharge
use cap boosters its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i was waiting for that you missed cap rechargers too but a valid point nonetheless if you using something like a shield hic you are probably going to have double sebo and the rest some tank doesnt really leave room for cap boosters so you mihgt say well its shield so fit cprs well yes but then with say the broadsword you need te and gyros to make any decent impact especially if you need to kill the ship before it get back to the gatethe cap drain from a dedicated mod that can be only used on this dedicated ship its crazy all other specialised ships get bonuses etc for using it as intended
train an rsb alt multiboxing has its benefits its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
not anymore mate not with the new changesbut meh maybe doesnt resolve the problem thought does it
i think the problem lies in what youre trying to do with the fittingyou want to hics to be gun boats as well as tackle only they cant do that they can do one or the other
i only really have issues with cap when trying to run two infi points for too longsounds like either your skills or fit are in need of workdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
psyduck
my phobos is cap stable running 5 medium electron blasters loaded will null ammo and one scripted infinipoint i have not one cap mod on my shippost your fit for review as i feel that is the problem
training time in minutes equalspoints needed for next level  points you have  primary attribute  secondary attribute2  skill multiplierfor examplei currently have leadership trained to level 4  45255 skill pointslevel 5 requires 256000 skill points so256000  45255  210745 points remainingthe primary attribute of leadership is charisma which i have at 31 pointsthe secondary attribute is willpower which i have at level 2531  25  2  435 points per minute  60  2610 points per hour210745 points  435 points per minute  4844 minutes  3 days 8 hours 44 minutesnotice how each of the two attributes involved in training leadership contribute their own pointscharisma will contribute 150185 points at a rate of 31 points per minute or 1861 points per hourwillpower will contribute 60560 points at a rate of 125 points per minute or 749 points per hourthese rates are based entirely on my attribute values base  implants  remap points the only condition is that i must have a skill in training in order to earn skill points but sometimes real life prevents us from always being at the keyboard its not that were irresponsible quite the opposite its just not a practical expectationto address this i introduce the generic skill this skill has no points no bonuses and never stops when the queue has no regular skill to train it defaults to this skill the way it works is that we can set any two unique attribute for the primary and secondary and it continuously generates skill points from those attributes at the same rate as training a regular skill however instead of generating universal skill points it generates attributespecific skill points each attribute has its own pool of skill points which can only be allocated to skills that depend on that attribute
1 how would it determin what caracter to asign the skill points to or do you expect them to be asigned to the account in the redeaming system what about implants and from what caracter on that account2 lets say a user buys an account and trains nothing for a year should user beable to come along 1 year later and alocate all those points to make whatever caracter they want
it would automatically apply to the character that is actively training skillsi dont understand what you mean by redeeming systemimplants would work as usualthey would only be able to allocate the points for the character that last trained a skillthey would not be able to create a new character and then transfer the skill points to itotherwise as long as theyve paid the bill absolutely
your idea was already shot to flaming bits in this thread please dont crosspost it it just makes you look bad you know that kid that goes and asks mommie for something because daddy said no but you know he hasnt told mommie yet thats how this post comes across
apparently you werent around before they introduced the skill queue i used to get up at 4 am some days just to make sure i get a new skill training the ability to add skills to the queue that run past the 24hr mark completely negate your proposal not gonna be on for a while throw in a looooong skill gonna be away from a computer even longer than that well thems the breaks its tough all over suck it up and move on ccp has already gone above and beyond to help out noobs with skills removal of learning skills anyone and shouldnt have to accommodate for every possible contingency in your life that may or may not prohibit you from putting a skill in the queue theres a quote i heard all the time in the army that i think fits this perfectly a lack of planning on your part does not constitute and emergency on mine
actually ive been around since long before they added the skill queue which i agree was a great idea but i vaguely remember the topic in the old forums where the idea was originally proposed many years ago and believe it or not it still got shot to flaming bits by characters like yourselfthis proposal does not mess with the skill queue it does not change or replace what is there now it just adds something that makes it better if you really believe it wont help your game fine you would have the option of not using it
going from fi to assembly hall should not be considered cross posting his other thread was hardly shot to hell but i would admit it was only there for a day before this one was made so it hasnt been given a chance to get any real feedbackpersonally i like the idea even as we speak my alt is not training because real life took me away for the weekend and i never had a chance to log on and change her queue now i am at work will i fret over a couple of days of lost training nahi run without implants half the time just because it isnt worth it for me would an alternative method for skill queuing be nice yeahbut at the same time there has to be some need for people to log on once in a while instead of just paying for their subs and never logging on however i also dont think that need should be to change their trainings there should be something more important to draw the player to log in on one hand you have the argument of eve is harsh forget to do your trainings and be punished and on the other hand you have eve is too harsh and causes most gamers especially the casual ones to not want to play which is more important eves success along with a higher player base or retaining the difficulty and individuality of the game that caters to the hardcore cant we have bothi am somewhat torn on whether or not this kind of idea should be or needs to be implemented i will reserve my judgement for now and wait to see how other players respond in this thread and the other
why the hell would we want thisthis is why a skill queue exsistswhy would you want to waste time stacking up time when it can be put to use on the skill you wantall this isis a exploit waiting to happenalts being trained for the express purpose of sp farmingfor someone who claims hes been around a whileobviously has very poor common sense stop the evemail spam
cross posting a bad idea is also a bad ideadestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
please do not create multiple threads about the same topic thank youthread lockedyou can continue discussions about this topic here
ecm works as it should  stop crying about it and fly with friendsyou have big guns and big tank the ecm specialist ship is usually paper thin and has no dps whos the one taking the risks heregrow up and stop being babies why dont you ask all the pvp foes to hang on a sec while you lock them up and shoot firstget your own drones on the ecm boat and kill it or scare it off
and i refuse to let this one quietly fade into obscuritylets get some support and input folksi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i find it laughable and rather insulting that ccp continue to market the idea of the bounty hunter when everyone in the game knows that the system is completely broken i liked the new website apart from that aspect bounty hunting is probably the coolist profession and certainly one that got me looking into eve so many years ago and the fact they are still pushing that as an actual feasible profession is borderline lying imoid say that perhaps the new website might actually lead to a fix to the bounty system but the fact weve all been waiting for years makes this highly unlikely please someone fix the bounty system  and no i dont live in highsec as if that would make your opinion any less wrong
this was always a feature of eve that i quite liked even though i was never that ghoulish to collect corpses myselfplease bring the names back ccp
yeah its true the gallente store is terrible with the tags always cheaper to buy them off of contracts then to redeem them kind of sad kind of like the idea but standings loss is still annoying and wouldnt do anti faction missions because of that at least not now always hoped of having a hi sp vindi or kronos then being able to handle the standing loss better
yes i like this idea gives you a choice whether to screw up your security status with a faction for the tags or to still be able to wander through all of eve if you preferas a gallente pilot that does use the lp stores i agree that the tag situation in gallente space is a bit crazy1
thank you for everyones support 
not sure theres any real need for this to be honestput your bookmarks in a folder for each system then double click the folder to create a popout window that has all your bookmarks in it makes life easier to align to and warp to bookmarks so much easier than having anything shown on the overview
found the problem
i wouldnt mind losing the learning implants but do like their uniqueness in the game not sure what to replace them with only think i can think of is like learning stones in cq not sure if that will be a hit though other then that can only think of learning skills again  make learning skills like rigging is designed cybernetics for the core skill then the attribute skill maybe it will be a 2x skill to train after cybernetics want the learning skill at 4 train cyber to 4 then that skill or want 5 train cyber to 5 then that skill maybe make the attribute skill a 1x one but thought that maybe too cheap only thing i can think of maybe better ideas
the opinion of a proincarna anticsm incursion running roleplayer alt is hardly relevant its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
think a lot of people are totally missing the point in this threadits not about riskless pvp in null sec anyone living in null for longer than 10 minutes will probably be using a jump clone if they dont want to lose implants or have so much isk that they dont care anywaythis is about removing an unnecessary barrier to new players that will not have jump clones nor the isk to replace implants if they get poddedall the things mentioned in this thread about people not participating in fleet is usually from newer players that cant afford the losses the bitter vets cananything that makes the game fun for new players can only ever be a good thingand before anyone says anything yes i do live in null and i have not had any implants in over 3 years so i dont run any risk in loosing pods anyway i couldnt care less about the 23 days i could save on learning something by having learning implants it isnt that important playing the game and killing things is
there used to be corps that allowed people to get free jump clones is this no longer the case cant null sec alliances let people know how to get free jump clones yeah people who learn about the game actually have advantages over people who remain ignorrant do we need to flatten that learning curve do we need to dumb down the game for everyone so we can get more noobs in null sec blobsmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
just like this
so why remove it why cant we find another solutioni do want to keep implants and learning implants they are part of evemake it easier to get your first jumpclone perhaps make it possible to switch without timer if you are on the same stationall problems are solved without deleting stuff out off the gameand one thing you should consider not everything that is fun for new players is good for eveit would be fun for new players to fight in a titan after a month but it wouldnt be good for eve
one possible solution could be to add insurance for implantsreduces but does not completley remove adverse risk associated with using themadds another potentially significant isk sink into the gamedual benefit without the need to simply delete content

supportedoh and all the dodos squawking risk vs reward where is the reward exactlylearning implants are a place where not taking risks is rewarded while taking risks is punished sit in high sec with 5 learnings gain faster training risk little fight in nullsec with no implants lose training speed while risking muchoh and in pvp its not a question of whether one is going to lose something rather than when its not a risk its costeven beyond the whole question of cost there is also the factor of availability personally i have no problem risking 4s 40 mil isnt all that much in the scheme of things but atm im stuck in a 3 clone not because i wasnt willing to pay for 4s for it but because there were none in the market when i made the clone in question so now when it comes to a simple question of whether to go that clone which is in our staging system i have to calculate the chances of something actually happening to make the loss of learning speed worth it at least until that clone is destroyedtraining speed is just to valuable a thing particularly to new players once one has a solid skill set its less so but when youre first starting out and you have all these required skills that are on opposing attribute sets its a bfd thats big ing deal to you civies  oh and faceless forum alt cowards your opinions are discarded because there is no way to check your bonifides no way to see if might actually have some experience to support your opinions and arguments as an experienced debater i know full well that its often very easy to support a bullshit argument if you toss out enough unfounded assertionsyou have no credibility and your arguments are worth exactly squatimplants are a significant isk sink got any actual cites on that because the reality is that most people just simply are not going to be risking expensive implants on a regular basis this is something that you rattle off because you think it must be true while the reality is that it just isnt learning implants particularly the expensive ones simply arent replaced that often most nullsec pvpers dont wear them so its not like theyre burning through them at a prodigious rate and high and low sec players arent losing many of them either not at the rate to make them a significant isk sinkno for the most part the expensive learning implants get stuck in a high sec clone and left kept in the safe confines of high sec so there is no risk there only reward to the risk averseif you are going to base your arguments on risk vs reward then you should damned well be sure that the reward scales proportionally with the risk rather than inversely implants are a place where all the rewards go to the nonrisk takers personally i agree with the general sentiment that attributes should be removed entirely they are a silly mechanic that really only act to limit peoples choices and no thats the same as suggesting that everyone gets all skills at 5 prioritizing skills based on need rather than some long term map plan is not the same as eliminating planning all together and to all the im willing to risk my implants anyone who doesnt is just a wuss good for you you wanna a cookie it remains a stupid mechanic that discourages risk taking by rewarding the risk averse1 support
1absolutely no need to encourage sitting in safety just to train optimally it defeats the entire premise of getting new players into the action from day one and getting them into competetive and useful positions as soon as possible furthermore it rewar
the reality is in the market order histories you can see for yourself someone posted data earlier in this thread too it was just ignored make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i propose free clones and module insurance as wellhell why not just respawn a player in his ship at the nearest station upon deaththatll be more friendly to new players never a bad thing all those week old players refusing to respond to a cta cause theyre running incursions in 5s shame
basically thisas it is the naga is a fantastic ship both in the blaster and railgun role and i dont think ccp are every going to change that now it even outblasters the talos but talos gets drones so thats ok get your corpies to train turret based skills and out of their ratting drakes
titans are supposed to do ridiculous damage to capital ships and stationary structures they have the dd for this so why do they need guns shouldnt be for self defence as thats what their subcap fleet is supposed to be for we have dreads for turret based damage but as it stands they are virtually never usedremove turrets from titans give dreads a role again and then there is no problem
a lot of people get around not appearing at the cyno when jumping in their super capital by timing the opening of the cyno with a self destruct of the ship players wait till just a few seconds before their throw away cyno ship is about to self destruct light the cyno and hit the jump with their super capital so before the super loads the system the cyno ship has exploded and they appear in some random safe spot in system totally 100 safe and they can simply cloak up immediatelysuper capital owners have been using this tactic to sneak into systems run level 5 missions among other things all to avoid possibly being caughti say that if you light a cyno any self destruct timer you have going is immediately cancelled
lining up a self destruct cyno activation broadcast and jump all within a 23 second window is that trivialdo you just make these things up its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
you dont need to broadcast and no i didnt make this up try it if you dont believe me
you do need to broadcast when you have a ton of cynogens in range  its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
im starting to think hesshesits cracked under the strain of space crack abuse stop the evemail spam
i guess i can take a moment to teach you two trolls how to do thisstep 1 add cyno throw away alt to watch liststep 2 wait till system is emptysafestep 3 move cyno alt to a safe spotstep 4 start self destruct timerstep 5 when there is about 3or 4 seconds left on the self destruct light the cynostep 6 move mouse over to the cyno alt on the watch list and right click select jumpstep 7 cyno ship explodes before you load system thus placing your capital at a random spot in systemstep 8 activate cloak on capital shipeven if someone was fast enough to activate warp to the cyno that was up for a couple seconds the most they could hope to do is pod your cyno alt hoping to prob down the ship you just cynoed in at some random spot in system faster than you can press the cloak is simply impossibleso there you have it step by step process on how to move any jump capable ship that can fit a cloak with 100 safety
honestly if its true what you said because honestly alot of the bs you post is just flat bs tbqh then you should petition thisnot post it here stop the evemail spam
petition its as much of an exploit as fitting a cloak to a capital ship to warp to a safe spot till you have enough cap to jump out its not an exploit the goal of my proposal is to add a degree of risk when moving super capitalsalso are you even capable of posting without sprinkling insults throughout it
i just did this with my mains chimera and it works have to admit i will be abusing the hell out of this due to the fact i am not limited to station systems now
learn to read your posts before you speakyour indicating an exploit when it comes to those who can cyno beacon and then die instanly after the ship arrivesi couldnt care less about your cloaking whinesmy problem is the fact a cyno beacon is supposed to trap the cynoship there for the lentgh of the cynoanything outside of that is normal game mechanicscyno beacons are braodcasted to everyone in the area as to their presencegives risk to the arriving shipsthis removes that riskwho gives a flying  that you can fit a cloaking device on any ship with high slots in the gamebulk of which cant warp away while cloaked if you want to  about claoks then make yet an another bloody thread about it somewhere elsemoar tears please i love im stop the evemail spam
this is a mute point anything that ends the cyno can cause this effect even waiting for the cyno to naturually end and hitting the jump button just as it does
drake draconis  you said marlona was making stuff up and she proved you wrong and even broke it down into simple steps i know this must be difficult for you to digest but all you are doing now is building a straw man your just embarrassing yourself really i suggest you close your pie hole and leave the thread beif you dont like how players have used this mechanic then please just give support to the change no need to troll or build straw men
this proposal is simple enough just like a cyno can not be activated in a pos shield self destruct should not be allowed to be activated and when entering will be cancelled in a pos force fieldthe main reason for this is unknown space invaders successfully defeat an inhabitant only to watch as one of the main reasons for the attack is just self destructed over and over leaving nothing to be looted a change like i said above would encourage more reasons to pew pew in unknown space
scorched earth is as old as warfare i see no reason to change it if you dont want them getting back to pos pod them
i see your point but i dont think it is a change that should be made denying your attacker of his prize is part of war and also part of the sandbox if anything i would say they need to change it to allow people inside a pos to target and attack each other including modules in the pos if you are gonna lose the poswhy not help out and get on the km
no self destructing in a pos shieldlay off the space crackalthough i love your tearsthats for sure stop the evemail spam
i see the point of denying prize but it is soon becoming so that any conventional pvp has no rewards at allcurrently if you want any decent prize for doing pvp you need to go to hi sec and suicide gank nubbinsin 00 everything is nullified cloaked jump bridged bubbled to hell and protected by 1000 man blob on titan bridge and even if you get past that they can just self destruct everythingsomeone might think there should be a little better options in general
so people in null sec have utilized the tools given to them to stay safe isnt that the point every kill shouldnt be a massive reward in pos bashes i have taken part in it isnt uncommon for us to buy the contents of the pos from the person we are attacking sometimes we buy the pos and everything in it and they just move out we let them live and they sell us their crap at a discount after they are allowed a certain leniency to get out of the wh its negotiation where does that players negotiation option go if this change were made
so the best way for you to make isk while pvping is to attack the people who have no isk that doesnt make any sense at all i put it in quotes because i dont believe its really pvp if the other party cant fight back or even pretend to fight backself destructing is a valid denial mechanic thats working as intended just because youve trapped someone in a pos doesnt mean you earned the right to all their stuff it just means that youve earned the right to do your best to keep them from getting away with their stuff
if i or anyone else for that matter wanted to play black prophecy i wouldve downloaded that instead of evei never understand why people want to remake eve into something its not its most definitely not a fps and i think everyone would like to keep it that waynot supported
oh dear lord this againsee all the posts above as to why this will never be changed also eve is called a mmo for a reason stop solo mission running bring a corpy or a friend and have them salvageloot for you and you will never need to concern yourself with ninja anything ever againsorry to all the hi sec mission baiters if they listen and you cant kill mission bears anymore 
sure why notaggression for everyonei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
wasnt there this thread yesterdayi will say again a wreck is not yours in pvp the wreck still belongs to the player who exploded npc wrecks should no belong to teh player who shot themalso can you imagine the tears when teh carebears realise this would actually be a massive benefit to griefers
i will say again the ships in your hangars is not yours because that is the ccp propertyforget this idiotism wreck is not yours
get rid of t2 bpos and make everyone do inventioni honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
this is so funny and truth at the same time
i remember ccp saying ages ago that things floating in space that hadnt been used in 30 days or more would be removed not sure if that was ever implemented or not but seems like it should apply to abandoned poss maybe move them to the corps hq that anchored it or have it impounded so that if someone wants it they can claim it latertrouble with whs is that the pos would probably still be used if the corp that anchored it could find it again and thats most likely the problem here people leave the wh and forgot to bm the exit or got podded out of the wh with no way of finding it again
still  a pos that is unfueled  should be ripe for the picking and should be able to be unanchored
hacking an offline pos replaces its authentication table and makes it yours at which point you can do whatever you want with it it doesnt matter when it ran out if its offline its hackable
make it so ccp
 this
me agrees and no i dont live in highsec as if that would make your opinion any less wrong
im broadly in favor of this and have been for quite some time ccp is quite aware of this issue in particular with respect to the pos graveyards in some whshowever i personally think there should be a short grace period after the pos goes offline before its hackableunanchorablewhatever
yes i agreedead poses should either be able to be salvaged or hacked and unanchored after a given amount of time i believe 90 days is fair many others in other threads about this same topic believe it should be much shorter90 days is long enough that anyone having an unexpected absence from the game should be able to get back by then if you are going to be gone for more than 90 days you should have known about it and planed ahead by either taking it down or arranging for a friend to put an alt in your corp to top up the fuel once in a whileany shorter than 90 days i belive would result in a lot of semi active players complaining i believe there are many offline poses in eve that have been there for far more than 90 days and not just in wspace but even in high sec start with 90 days and see how many disappear i expect the number of off line poses in eve that have been ofline for less than 90 days will be small if having a grace period would not work than just make off line poses easier to kill than online poses the argument has been made many times that a pos with no fuel should have no shield how is the shield powered if there is no fuel currently the bubble disapears but if you want to pop the tower you have to burn through the full amount of shield giving it the same hit points as an online pos minus any defensive modules such as shield hardeners that would be off linei believe off line poses are even protected by reinforce mode if they have stront in them not sure on this but that is what i have heard
yep i agree thats why i came up with the idea of a anchorable hacking modulethe idea is it has a given amount of time to hack the pos giving the owner time to respondany chance this is going to be added to the csms list of things to be done
i dont see the need to unanchor offline poss its hard to say something is abandoned or not i think the answer lies in the shields if a pos is offline then the shields should not be part of its hp however this comes down to the programming in the game and ccp has expressed it isnt easily fixed
fix the bounty systemgive the people effected by gankers the ability to do something about it and at the same time create the profession of bounty hunters that ccp claims exists but doesnt that was my favourate bit of the new website the blatant lie that the bounty hunter profession exists errrm it doesnt its broken whats more everyone has been screaming that its broken for years kinda underhanded of ccp claiming otherwise just to entice people to start playing eve i mean who doesnt want to be a bounty huntermake bounties like contracts i set bounty contract against pirate a assign contract to bounty hunter individualcorporation b resulting in exploding pirate shippod c giving nice big bounty payout d sortedor think of something else please anything has got to be better than putting a bounty on some guys head and them collecting it 5 minutes later with their friends helpthat way people getting ganked can stop moaning cause theyve no interest in pvp and gankers can get all exicted about more pvp coming their way best of all bounty hunters become a viable profession everyone wins and no i dont live in highsec as if that would make your opinion any less wrong
slight bump on this indeed a corp iconmaker rewamp would be nice current options are so 2003ill admit its a small thing but damn corp icon is displayed in cq and will soon hit our ships too more customization on this please 
didnt they redo all the corp icons like 12y ago i remember a fairly recent change to them and adding inchanging a bunch of options
manage a corp and there is one thing that you do not know about your corp memberswho no longer plays eve and who has their account expiredwhen an account expires  it would be cool if you can send an email to corp  admins or something to let them know
any api query to an expired account would return error code 211 login denied by account statusany serious corp would collect members apis its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
or a paranoid corp
except its trivial to change api keys especially with the new system
this to be quite honestanyone with half a brain employs serious api key checkingits kinda obvious when an account goes defuncti used eve hq to track members in my former corpit can be teidousbut it does a fine job and ccp has enough on their platenot supporting stop the evemailUFFFDspam
different thread same tired old salvage is mine hands off refrain expertly blown out of the water
its nice watching this guys guardian angels come in i like a happy ending to a thread
i can see vertisce soritenshi point in this but theres also the practicality of reading through some of these threads some go into to 10 pages or more mostly trolling and it is time consuming and laborious for the most parti also appreciate it gives the csm and to a lesser extent ccp an insight as to what a very small portion of the eve community is thinking but it is very small a lot of eve players probably dont even know these forums exist let alone voice an opinion on some of the things postedyou also have to take into consideration human nature i only look at the posts that have a direct interest for me and usually try and provide objective input as to why its a good or bad idea and the csm will very likely look at things in a similar fashion whilst trying to appease alla very very fine balancing act to be sure but it is nice to know that someone somewhere is reading these ideasproposals at least even if they cant or wont act on them may be just a copy  paste message to say its being looked at or notjust my thoughts anyway
i agree it is not fair to expect them to read every single thread but they did run for the position and did get elected so they should dedicate time to it i spend about 4 hours a day or more on these forums it is just that boring at my job i just wish to see more interaction and input on the better ideas

destroyer are now known for the extreme tanks and somewhat good speed sig radius rediction in keeping with that i wouldnt at all suggest that a new destroyer either it be t2 hull or a completely new destroyer hull i would never even suggest it have the horrible signarture it once had and the interdictor still does
interesting idea but that may kill people who make gay videos about super solo pvp where they are in pimped solo ship using bonuses from loki and tengu on a safe spot for killing crowds of retardsi like such videos so dislikebut talking about big fleets and other game mechanics perhaps youre right
i have to agree with the majority of people postingthis is one of the best suggestions i have seen for taking care of lowsec issues that keep a majority of people out the op has the right idea here on how to level out the warfare in lowsec so that more people will want to join in and this would certainly encourage more numbers to roam in lowsec than currently do1great idea
i think it should not be invulnerable but it should exist in the game abandoned poses in highs whs and other areas just keep the moon and make unnecessary line in your shipscanner result if you wanna occupy the moon by your pos  dont leave it without fuel then if you left the pos then somebody else should have a chance to hack and grab the fuelless pos not to kill it
quotedavaderi think it should not be invulnerable but it should exist in the game abandoned poses in highs whs and other areas just keep the moon and make unnecessary line in your shipscanner resultquotehaving the module invulnerable means they need to online the pos thus determining if it is abandoned or noti noticed there are varing opinions on what makes the pos abandoned1 the pos goes offline that makes it abandoned2 the corp that the pos belongs to is closed3 after a given time period variesso the question is what do you concider makes a pos abandoned
thats clearly a natural extension of this proposal dumbass its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
hey he probably has a very large one so if asses are anything like brains it would be a very smart oneits easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths abrazzar the risk of having your day ruined by other people is the cornerstone with which eve was built ccp solomon
i dont recall any data posted regarding this then again i only skimmed the last few pages reskimmed the whole damned thing and no actual citation of any sort to back up the claimtell you what though claiming that implants are a significant part of the eve economy do you have any idea how big the eve economy is  is a positive claim and as such the burden of proof is on the person making the claim so no im not going to go on a unicorn hunt trying to prove a negative if you are going to make that argument you provide the evidence to back it up otherwise im just going to assume you are going with roma data

there is an ability to award a medal to a member of your corporation as everybody know these medals can only be visible by other pilots if a pilot opens show info screen of some another pilot and goes to decorations tab in case of the person set public permissions to observe his medalsafter incarna we have all those dresses monocles captain quarters 3d model of the character walking around new avatars etcwhy isnt there an ability to show your welldeserved rewards to other people on your avatar or on your uniform when the captains quaters mode is on 3d modelthats very simple idea to have an ability to put one or several medals which you were awarded by on the chest of your 3d character model in the character recustomization screenyou can put a new shirt on why cant you fasten a new medal to your jacket and make a new photo with ittechnically im sure that this is very simple to implement cuz they can use the same texures of the medals as are used when we look at decorations tab and click on medals info linkthis is pure optional design stuff those who dont like medals or dont care wont be bothered at allthe topic is refered to this but the idea is not excatly the same
oh lovelynow we will have chars walking around with a crapton of medals just because they can and what notmaking them less meaningful medals dont mean much as it iswe dont need more clutterpassnot supporting stop the evemail spam
why not i like medals as well
of course there should be strict limitation of medals number lets say 10 medals or even 5 would be enough
support1st row for free and 2nd row for an aurum
just so long as we can choose which medals we display i say as if i had enough to need to choose not that theyd be visible in most portraits
why not supported
loli support this idea i think ccp should make achievements with medals you get for them to use on your avatar instead of the player created ones from your corpyeah yeahachievements suckwhatever i wouldnt mind having a system that tracked my kills and accomplishments through an award system 1 million pvp killsyay
ok so ask your ceo to make those kind of achievement medals
not the same since everybody else in eve isnt held to the same standard
um how about we quit worrying about bullshit stuff that doesnt affect gameplay and actually focus on the game here devs dont need to work on stupid  like medals we shouldnt have captains quarters in the first place but its too late for that lets not waste any more effort on that  though
supportedi have some medals and theyll look nice on my chesthere
im not sure if this is the right place to post this complaint or not but here goesfor many years now ive played this game and i have a long long list of petitions to go through and since about 2007 the general quality of gm service has been declining response time has gone from hours to weeks the quality of those responses has gone down the toilet spectacularly in the most recent few its clear the gm had not bothered to read the petition before posting a canned responsei had one weeks old get a response that they were unaware of any such bug despite it having been listed as fixed in the previous days patch notesim sorry but tldr is not an acceptable response in customer service are there any steps that csm can take or is this something that needs taken to someone else
i have to agree with you there especially when they repeat clear your cache as a mantra especially annoying since ccp hasnt gotten around to giving us a way to exportimport our window positions and settings yet
in before lock but at least this post is decentthey will likely lock this and ask you to petition a higher gmposting about it here will not affect muchi do have to agreequality has been dropping as of lately stop the evemail spam
whats above senior gm because one of them above was one
dev pretty much anyway unfortunately you quoted drake so i read his reply and he is right in this case likely this thread will be locked but escalate your issue until you cant go any higher or are happy with the response
the underlying issue is really quite straightforward turret weapons have no form of cap to their damage beyond base transversal the minute you stack on all the tracking enhancements target painters and webs that are avaialble it becomes possible for a turret titan to kill basically anything the fact that supercap fleets can currently shake off mwding interdictors  the very ships designed to tackle them  shows just how fundamentally broken tracking ismissiles on the other hand have had a much smarter balancing cap from day 1 oversized missiles simply cannot effectively damage undersized targets regardless of other modifiers a drake will tank citadel torps from now until the next downtime because missiles are properly designed to maintain the rockscissorspaper model of ship balance the leviathan is pretty much exactly what a balanced titan should be  a high damage platform that is only able to damage other large targets no need to remove supercap weapons no need to nerf their damage no need to take away more hp all we need is a hard cap that stops oversized turrets damaging inappropriate targets and encourages diverse fleets
its moot by the way not mutethat said the point is that a current mechanic is being used to keep super capitals and others 100 safe are you opposed to making super capital movement involve some risk
i believe his point was that you can use the same trick regardless of if they make it impossible to self destruct with a cyno going the only thing it would change would be to take 10 min to pull it off and save the person whos jumping from having to buy so many cyno ships and youre likely spending part of that time recharging cap in the system anyways
allow me to detail my points since you have a serious lack of comprehension and reading1 marlona is complaining about things with stupid reasnos that are obviously biasedpracticually every time marlona posts its just flat riduclous2 this post in particular is about being able to kick in self destruct timer and cyno within seconds before cyno collapsesfor oncea valid concern reread my post as to why that is3 marlona is bitching about cloaking up in a super cap and warping offirreleavant this is about cynosthe topic says thatwtf does cloaking devices have to do wtih itconclusion stop crying and file a petition for the cynoand make a thread for the restend of discussion stop the evemail spam
ten minutes of hoping no one destroys your cyno before you want it to go downdie anyways im done arguing with people who only want to disagree no matter what if you like the proposal fine if not fine
if it is getting attacked and is going to die then you just jump as if youd self destructed
seems to me that if someone is deliberatly selfdestructing their cyno ship so that when they jump their cap in it gets thrown to a random location in the system instead of at the cyno point then this is an exploit and should be looked intosupportedjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
tricks like this are exactly what make eve a sandbox game  players should be encouraged to think outside the box not be taped inside it plus if you try to stop it people would just blow up the cyno frig with a 3rd alt anywayjudging by your other threads you seem intent on banning players from doing anything unexpected that prevents you obtaining easy killsloot if only you put as much effort into hunting people as they put into evading youif its an exploit then that also applies to when the ship is blown up by someone causing the jumping ship to be thrown should people be banned if they blow up the cynoship with a friendly alt what if they use a neutral alt with no affiliation what if a hostile player blows up their cyno instead should someone be banned for thatplease tell me where you draw the line on this exploit
i would suggest that the mechanics of where the jumping ship is going to land should be changed obviously there is some timing issues between jimping into a cyno just before it closes and the point when the next system is loaded and the game tries to workout where to put your shipseems to me that its not an intended result by the game as the point at which your cap ships or whatever arrive is supposed to be known to the entire systembut i have to admit i dont use cynos so i am sure there are other players who know the ins and outs a lot better than i docynonet two my question to you is do you believe that manipulating the timing as described in the ops post is an ligitemate method or would you say that its an unintended result and therefore an exploitjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
to the op ignore the trolls seriouslyjust ignore them life on the forums will get better once you do drake has been on my ignore list for some time now because he simply never has anything constructive to say and rarely knows what he is talking about anyway just block him and watch how clean the threads start to look you are right i have used this tactic in the past many times i dont know if ccp has made an official statement on the issue or not but i fully agree with you i would almost say it is a glitch and using this tactic is exploiting the system if it wasnt for the fact that the mechanics that are in place is what makes this so blatantly easy to do i think it should change and fully support your proposal1
could always make self destruct do dmg to nearby ships obviously no where near uber dmg but given a fleet size youll think twice about it amongst your own  im sure there is alot of flak in regards to using in highsec apply criminal assuming they hit somethingone and no i wouldnt advocate dmg that one shots frigates but something that pops some pods possibly im sure this will get shot down but looking at it on a logical front this would be an roleplay perspective of why you wouldnt self destruct inside a pos or populated area for that matter any way two iskies
it would result in far more invasions if there was actual booty to be had i understand self destruct is a viable mechanic while i do like it as a scuttle feature denying your enemy of loot there is other things i do not like about it like no kill mail or the hard 2 minute timer on every ship no matter the size but that is besides the pointthe idea to encourage more aggressive behavior in worm holes it is relatively easy to build a fortress given enough time if someone was able to over time defeat the enemy there should be something to be had not hours upon hours of watching the enemy self destruct hundreds of ships i know you think this is enough of a reward and perhaps some witty smack on the forums is reward enough but i think there should be something more tangiblethis does not mean your version of the reward is wrong and this does not mean mine is either just different endings to the story of a fight
absolutely agree with the topic starter also for capital and supercapital ships there should be longer timers up to 1015 minutes
srsly this thread has made me lol several times alreadyplease keep arguing for this change the whining vs working as intended rage is feckin pricelessomfg edit can you imagine this change coupled with scannable wrecks mayhem
welcome to ccps new eve websitelets have a look at the careers avaliable to eve players oh lookccp wants salvaging as a careerplease close this thread now its officially deadjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move

that could work to although im not a fan of such solutions
while the no shields while offline make sense and should happen anyway i want the pos not a killmail or the moonit just criminal all those faction towers in wh space that are abandoned that no one can use

why if its offline its already been at least a few weeks since it was last tended to properly
making it possible to make an offline pos invulnerable by abusing the wardec mechanics as is done today vov
1 to every solution found as long as all the towers in wh space that are dead can be removed im all in favorps also something to unanchor towers when there are incapped mods attached please a selfdestruct on mods
giving poss a major upgrade is a high priority for everyone on csm and i would not be at all surprised if ccp decided to take this on for the winter 2012 expansion im certainly pushing for it remember that when you cast your votesthis kind of change would be the sort of thing that gets discussed when they decide to bite the bullet and give us a new systembestrps for avoidance of confusion my idea of a short grace period is perhaps a couple of days and apart from giving people the chance to recover from their own screwups it also gives ccp a chance to recover from theirs as well  such as what happened with the fuel block changeover
the grace period is the amount of spam a pos gives you that its about to run out of fuelif you dont have the ability to maintain it then you should be able to have one tbh
people get pos refuel notifications in their calendar now if they still cant refuel the pos on time based on that and they dont take the hint of halp halp im low on fuel every hour for 24 hours then im going to just go out on a limb and say emjust so this is said id assume the hacking of a pos would be something which would actually take a while to accomplish say an hour or so or whatever just to try to give the owner yet another hour to get there put fuel in and start it up thus protecting his investment i wasnt thinking it should be something which can be done within 30 seconds of a pos going offline
very good point zim jint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
exactly
and if the person does not log in for a couple days they will not see the pos fuel spam not everyone in eve can get on every single day i often go almost a week without getting online real life always comes first especially with two small children in my life i use eve gate to keep tabs on corp messages and such but many others do not bother there are also a lot of military personnel that play eve they can get a last minute deployment and not have time to arrange their assets in eve for an extended leave they can be often 3 months with no access to internet let alone a pc they can actually log into eve on this is why i believe it should be 90 days after a tower goes offline before it can be hacked and claimed by someone else i do believe though that when a pos goes off line it should have no shields or reinforcement immediately when it goes offline and i think high sec poses should go into an unanchor timer if they run out of starbase charters they take up very little room and are very cheap to buy there is not reason you can not have 6 months worth of starbase charters in fuel bay at all times if you lose your anchoring permitstarbase charter in high sec an automated unanchor timer of say 24 days would activate and could be cancelled by adding more charters this should be regardless of whether the pos is online or offline no permit no anchor rights if the unanchor timer reaches zero the pos unanchores and will disappear at next down time if someone comes by before than the pos and all its modules can be scoopedput a little risk into investing in a high sec pos if you do not maintain it you will lose it many corps my self included have offline poses anchored in high sec just5 incase they are needed it takes some logistics and coordination to get corp standings high enough to anchore a pos so if you think you might need more in the near future by them an anchor them before you let your standings drop for example i have a one man corp with my 4 accounts but only one of my characters has enough standings to be able to anchor a pos inhigh sec so i have to either start a new corp with that character or move all my characters without 00 standings out of the corp wait for standings to adjust then anchor the poses and reinvite the other characters it is much easier to just anchor a couple extra pos while my standings are up as long as they are offline they cost me nothing but the capital investment if i had to online them for at least one day per month and keep them stocked with starbase charters it would add some cost and risk to those poses rather than being able to claim the moon for free indefinitely if players ant to keep offline poses anchored just incase they need them then there should be some cost attached to it even if it is minimal
waitwhat
then they should keep their pos fuel topped off so that it doesnt run out another good way to do this is to prevent people from being able to dec scrape to save their pos if you cant defend it you shouldnt own itthe best solution ive seen is the anchorable hacking device linked earlier in this thread have it only affect offlined pos and put a three day timer on it and it becomes quite easy to quickly take ownership of abandoned pos anywhere
i like the idea behind the three day timer that sounds good without being op or such a pain in the ass noone bothersas for vets and others who get called away at a moments notice i do understand having been in the service for 105 years however in game assets do not necessarily have to reflect out of game issuesimho ymmv
more importantly dont operate a pos by yourself if your absence results in the loss of your station its because you tried to do something solo that wasnt really intended for solo play all you need is one other person you can trust to keep the pos operational while you are awayif you cant manage that dont have a pos ive never operated one and dont see why others think they need one to play eve much less that it should be protected from their inability to maintain it
3 days really thats even worse than the sbu timers etc
i have asked that there be a review please point out exactly where i have a directed specific action to restrict the action of suicide ganking in highsecthen i thought about this perhaps there is some truth here color me pariah players perception needs to be aligned to game i had an idea for a tutorial which should be done by new players in which they lose ship and pod by an ambush then the remainer of the tutorial explains about the games tools of dscan local chat intel map and statisics and any other tools which really should be ingrained knowledge within the first 10hrs of play get new player over the shock immediately the current series of tutoral merely foster carebear attitude by their designand see we havent nerfed current mechanics at all but this is not the place for this suggestion it should be raised when there is a forum of review  then all players can have feedback about improvement which is no different from what is currently happening with incursions
and even better the gankers start ganking each other for bounties lol
to be fair anytime someone says that suicide ganking needs review they are generally aiming to nerf it or make it harder in some fashion in the future you might want to consider including a goal or reason for bringing into reviewthere was an idea similar to this that was floated in the fi forum awhile ago basically it would be a mission and purely optional at that that would be available only to accounts that are less than 1 month old to prevent abuse this mission would essentially ask the newbie to get into a cheap frigate or be provided one and go out to a randomized system out in nullsec not too far out into it though nothing more just get to point a doesnt matter how you get backthe reward would be something that only a true newbie would covet im thinking a tier 3 cruiser or something but not necessarily need
really is it too easy i think its not removing the insurance by last big patch was a good act of balancing why do more there are many ways not to waste expensive stuff carrying from jita to your carebearing location if you fly afk on tankless ship  dont be offended please
in more than a year of carebearing i was never ganked in highsec whybecause i flew properlytanked ships and didnt autopilot
i think fixing the bounty system properly is the answer for this threadthis thread addresses this issue quite nicely
just add value to killrights allow the players to set the concordnpc navydocking rights response if that ganker is ever unfortunate enough to jump into the same system as the victim allow the players to set this reoccurring response for the duration of a standard killright or increase the duration of killrights
suicide ganking does not need reviewthe only times ive ever lost a ship to suicide gankers is because i wasnt paying attentionthere are already ingame mechanics for the prevention of this its called not being afk warping to 0 and tanking your ship if it has slow align timedoes not need review learn to play the game
maybe its my fail logo design skills but i fully agree the system would benefit from an overhalljint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
not to mention the missing faction logos letters numbers triangles hexagons circles animals colors and pirate faction logos could be a standing unlock on this one with character portrait background too
bump of the day to get more exposuresupport for the ideai am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
great ideai also like the idea of small tug class vessels with remote agility and align speed or other such modules for getting big ships into and out of stations fasteri would like to point out that the gank level of this ship needs to be somewhere about the 15 bil or so mark otherwise it will just be a large juicy target for any destroyer group if you can carry around battleships in warp you need to be massively large and consequently very tough target just based on size alone the ship in space also needs to dwarf all other ship models by a good margin because seriously it should be big enough to look like it can swallow other ships
i want to make sure i get this right as this proposal is getting a great deal of pressjoe blow the 3 week player gets tired of mining or lvl 1 missions and wants to try out some pvp hes getting pretty bored with empire so he fits up some cheap frigates and has a few fights but if he fights too much hes going to encounter a problem he drops to negative security statusas hes flying from dodixie in his brand new frigate to his favorite new fun spot amamake for some more o that pvp goodness he jumps into egghelende surprise i was waiting in a quick lock thrasher or t3 for even extra survivability on the gate at zero now that hes dropped below zero sec status very quick trip for him as he doesnt really care for missions i can pop his butt and the good news is im pretty safe i dont have to worry about sentry fire i can sit at zero on the gate  anything ugly comes at me i just jump to highsec and ill never lose sec status its a campers dreamjoe blow now has two options he can either go ratmission to return to zero or he can risk another frigate trying to enter lowsec personally i think joes going to pick option 3 hes going to become risk adverse and spend the rest of his life in empire bitching about the ebil piwates and their dirty gatecamps note this was a player who originally wanted to pvpthis is the problem i have with this proposal anything which restricts access past current standards will do more harm to the cause than good do not answer with he should get a scouting alt thats horseshit you and i both know it dont say der mmo isnt for solo thats a copout toojack dant i think your underlying premise is fantastic and honestly in spirit touches upon a real fix for lowsec but consider a more literal interpretation of what happens in lowsec stays in lowsec1 gates and stations with their sentries remain in their current form thus joe blow can still get his frigate through2 remove the sec status hit for combat which is initiated 1000km from gates or stations you can attack any ship in a belt and not take a security status hit in other words concord doesnt have the manpower to watch the belts planets or pocos if you get nailed there youre fair game3 pod kills anywhere in lowsec still apply as per current rules allowing the truly evil to become 10
thats an interesting point however currently joe blow would end up in a similar situation except he wouldnt even be able to enter highsec without being shot at by npcs most likely hed die to players trying to undock from dodixie moon 20 as such things get easier for him not harder the camping ship is nowhere near as effective or invulnerable as you think your fast locking thrasher will lack either web or prop and so be easy to escape from and not very good if mr blow decides to fight the t3 would be a tasty target and people would keep trying to bait you remember you cant jump for 1 minute after aggressing in the end people who like to do riskless camping will always try to find ways to do so if these ways are a problem we should fix them not make highlevel game design revolve about them personally i think stationgate games need some work finally joe blow has another option he take a small detour and jump into lowsec through a less transited gate about the counterproposal of no sec status away from gates and stations its a good one and it was mentioned in the same chats with my corpmates that sparked this thread my main problem with it is that most fights of all kinds happen on gates because thats where gangs meet each other excluding those fights from a sec status fix seems incompletewhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
thank you for your reply in our above scenario i believe joe blow the new player is actually put at a severe disadvantage compared to the existing mechanicsit currently takes a significant hardware investment to pull off a gate camp capable of snagging frigates the common villoreoms camp is a good example theyre able to hit frigates but only by risking a goodly deal of isk the changes as listed your original post would make it easier to camp dependent upon the camper keeping his sec status up and selecting targets with sec status below zero casual pvpers now have to worry about getting their frigate through the gatein effect dropping even 1100th of a point below ss zero now inflicts the full penalties of 5 on pilots seeking casual pvp were now punishing them even more than we do today i do not feel this is a change that will promote casual pvpas a pirate youve become used to operating this way and i respect that but i believe casual pvpers will be far less accepting of this new restriction already most empire residents fear the gatecamp boogeyman specter in lowsec its the main thing that keeps them away and i advise constantly that its really not that dangerous if you stick to small agile ships this would change were your proposal as currently written to go into effecti also rebel on a personal level against anyone making anyone else rat or mission to keep their ss up so that they may keep fighting while still having access to empire this is another barrier that casual pvpers have to cross which i feel is not really needed why are we punishing people for wanting to pvpas mentioned in my post above the simplest solution imo seems to be to remove ss hits from belts planets and pocos while keeping the entry routes to lowsec safeish but never ever completely safe the current mechanics in this small area seem fine to me let em get in safe and find a fight if you even bring up the chance of a gatecamp or suggest they must ratmission or suffer on the gates theyre going to stay awayim not trolling i am a solo casual pvper who has advised and taught the pleasures of casual lowsec pvp for years
theres a problem with your logic its much easier to keep your status above 000 when the lowest you can go is 2 as opposed to keeping it above 5 when you can go all the way to 10 by pvping its essentially the same system were using now with less penalties for casual pvp and thats not even considering the fact that it doesnt cut off your access to highsec at all if you want to keep positive security status and keep the protection of the gateguns it would be much easier to do therefore lowering the barrier to entry nullifying the conflict youre describing
scenario im flying my rifter around lowsec looking for targets i jump a gate and find a tarannis before me my sec status is 1 his is 74current mechanics i can decide to engage or not he cannot camp the gate against me unless ive dropped my ss all the way down to 5 note that i can still run around empireproposed changes he can engage without any danger of sentriesreplace the tarannis with a loki tengu hell just about anything how does this entice more people to try lowsec pvp youre raised the restrictions not dropped themill tell you what it does offer and holy crap i cant believe im actually saying this it would provide more targets for those below 5 they would not have to worry about gate guns half as much as they do now
youre completely and utterly missing my point current mechanics you have to keep your sec above 5 to get assistance from gateguns with the potential to go to 10 by ship killsproposed mechanics you have to keep your sec above 0 to get assistance from gateguns with the potential to go to 2 by ship killsits not the absolute number thats important its the differential for casual pvpers they wont have enough ship kills to get it down seriously and if they do it will be such a small amount that you can very easily get it back up right now that doesnt work because theres no floor to your sec status when killing shipsyes it means more targets for pirates but guess what were open targets for anyone and will remain so under the new rules also people will understand that negative sec means no gategun assistance so they wont go negative if they dont want to just like the 5 barrier works now its actually much more intuitive positive sec  gategun help negative sec  none bear in mind it will be very easy to maintain positive sec also bear in mind that aggressing pirates will still not result in a sec hit so you wouldnt have negative sec if you didnt want to it really is an elegant system if you think about it
vaurion thank you for your measured responses well probably have to agree to disagree on this oneif ccp is foolish enough to attempt to promote pvp by utilizing a system which further encourages any type of gatecamping they deserve to reap what they sowi am not antipirate hell not antianything and would be the very first to say lowsec needs some love but this imo is not the way the solution is to remove the ss penalty in select areas belts planets pocos not adjust it to one groups advantageagain thank you for the debate
gotta love people who respond in a polite diplomatic fashion without reading what has been written
plutonian i completely understand where you are coming from i did mention how sentries help keep lowsec sane by keeping intybomberfalcon gatecamps unfeasiblei dont think that would be affected by my proposal but i confess im not sure there is no way to be the pure camper loves kill numbers above all so i expect they would keep engaging positive sec people and podding everyone so they would still need heavier ships incidentally the increase in outlaws would probably be followed by an increase in nonoutlaws hunting themi proposed making negative sec players free targets because as an outlaw i welcome people who shoot first if im roaming solo in a fast ship i cannot engage anyone on gates sentries are just too much of a handicap so jumping into a gang that actually wants to shoot me is great well as long as their tackle is not very good i wanted that to extend to more people coming to lowsecraimos suggestion in the first page would actually fix your problem better cap sec loss but keep sentrygcc mechanics unchanged then us proper outlaws keep our chance to get fights without sentries while gates are safeish for everyone else my problem with that is that i foresee more standoffs on gates as two gangs dare each other into aggressing firstwhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
i agree on some points
there might be a solution for this issue by introducing a more gradual alteration in securitysentry mechanics1 lower the sentry aggression barrier to 15 sec status  that will give the newbie a little buffer to play around in lowsec before he looses protection on gates2 sentry aggression will always be triggered on jump gates which are connected with high sec as long as the player is above 5 sec status thus preventing solo camps on those gates on other gates the camper would still have to face the risk of being popped by a gang jumping inanother possibility is connecting the sentry aggression directly to the systems sec status  in 04 only attacking everything above 5 will trigger sentry attack  in 03 everything above 19  in 02 everything above 09 asojust an example  these numbers arent carved in stonethis would provide a safe entry into lowsec for everyone while with further advancement youd get vulnerable on gates to solo pvpers depending on your own sec rating
the rules need to be simple both the current ones and the ones i suggested are you see the target on overview you see the background color you know whether the sentries will open up if you shoot if it depends on where the gate leads the exact sec status of people involved or the system sec it will only cause confusion and frustration hell youd be surprised how many times ive jumped into highsec by accidentwhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
forums ate my post because i was lazy and didnt copy before posting short version followswhile i would personally be fine with raimos suggestion i felt that it was too harsh towards the current pirates those who wanted to be flashy red theyd probably not care but those who went pirate because there were a lot of targets that day or due to the fwaggressionrr mechanics would probably be pissed i understand your frustration over gangs meeting at gates and having to jockey to see who gets the guns on em ive never been outlaw but follow pirate blogs and i see the stuff you guys deal with it sucksim asking that any solution remember the little guys starting out in solo pvp it is imperative to keep the gatestravel lanes as open and free for them as possible when i lose a frig to a gatecamp its no big deal i have billions of isk not frigs when the same happens to them it can be the event that turns them away from solo pvp or even eve itself when i have to rat up my ss its pretty easy before it gets too bad i just do some l4s in a marauder i can fly them all with perfect skills and presto back to fighting in short order these new guys are generally on level one missionsugh they cannot repair their ss as fastwe need new blood in lowsec and we have to get those pilots from somewhere its probably not going to come from nullsec and if it does itd come with cap ships so i feel we need to reach out to empire and that means keeping things easy for the casual new players
i agree completely things must be kept as simple as possible
i guess im fine with this idea to an extent  i dont think the major issue of gate guns is going to be resolved with a low security cap of 2 all thatll happen is that some people will keep their sec status above 00 to get gate guns on their side i sure will as i live in low seci dont think negative sec status should go red it needs to stay at 50 make the low cap for low sec pvp 20 sec status no gcc for being negative until you hit negative 5 as it already is that alone makes pvp in low sec more appealing but with enough penalties and enough risk for certain thingsnow what i do like about this is that it stops me from going deep 10 for doing pvp in low sec and it will promote some fly by weekend high seccers to go into low sec pvp and not feel like theyll suffer severe penaltiesthat part of the proposal alone is solidgood ideas i think theyre a step in the right direction philosophically
i would very much like this immediately1
im a bit odd ive always been one of those strange fairfights type people but you know what even i have my limits do it push it through its going to be amazing i have a positive sec status so once the changes are in heres what im going to doi will select a ship with good tank and decent scan resolution i will sit on entry gates into lowsec i will sit right on the gate at zero i figure the jel gate in egghelende will work nicelywhen random joe the rifter pilot comes through if hes got a sec status below zero ill lock and pop him boom baby i camped and didnt even lose any sec status if im smart ill have an alt to warp in with a cheap probe wcargo expanders and scoop the loot ill keep my camping ship safe at zero on the gate cant lose much that way random joe can watch me loot his wreck as he slowboats back to the gate hes quite safe i wont pop his pod because im riding on the gravy train and have no intention of screwing something this nice upwhen bob the builder jumps in ill let him pass hes got a sec status of 23when the guy rum runner ss 004 jumps his transport in ill see if i can grab that guy thank goodness i dont have to worry about sentry guns im the golden boy as far as concord is concerned out doing the lords work amen and hallelujahnow youre a nasty ebil piwate lurking in the depths of egghelende system and you dont like me grabbing up all this choice loot so you jump in your jaguar fling yourself at the gate hoping you can get some shots in before i jump safely to empire where you cant touch me aaannnnddddd surprise i just sit there perhaps i mock you in local because you cannot attack me without the guns murdering your shiny jagso you say ok everyone get in some hurricanes and your group warps to the gate i simply press the jump button and im gone you cannot follow me ill either move to another entry gate easy i dont even require bookmarks as i sit at zero or go and sort all my loot until you get tired of waiting then ill be back at itill do the same when your alpha maelstrom shows up at 80k boop im back through the gate and safe cant get mehmmm you think this isnt working out maybe if you get some positive sec status people to engage me wrong if they attack me they have to be big enough to tank the guns which will be on my side and that means theyll be somewhat slow and i can escape at any point no one can hit me now ive become the perfect gate camper im making billions and hardly risking anythingand heres the neat thing so far ive just been doing it by myself or with an alt imagine what ill be able to accomplish with a couple of friends also with positive sec status my only concern is that after a while there wont be too many people jumping through with bad sec status eventually theyll seek out another gate which means their loot wont go to me but to someone else doing exactly what im doingbut hey that means theyll have plenty of time to hang out in empire and grind their ss upi cannot believe all the time ive wasted in eve running around looking for fights in belts what a fool ive beennote ive actually never camped a gate did i get the mechanics right for this scenario

speaking as a new player i agree that losing 45s i cant afford to replace is a significant deterrent to hazardous behavior assuming the appropriate mentality is risk vs reward the risk weight jumps way up any time i consider anything remotely dangerous still there seems to be an excessive amount of hyperbole presentit is to everyones benefit especially serious pvpers to encourage new and relatively unskilled players to enter the game play actively take risks and ideally to accumulate possessions worth taking from them a pool of sharks needs fresh fish conversely eve does not and is not intended to appeal to everyone catering to newbies just because they are newbies will not sustain or grow the population it will at best temporarily boost it with lacking a better term spoiled brats theyll leave for the next game quickly whether or not their demands are metwith that in mind i think the question isnt how can we protect newbies from risk which i dont think the op was asking anyway but instead how can we encourage newbies to take riskssome people have suggested lowering the timer on jump clones i actually support this but as a skill that branches off infomorph psych iii or iv it actually is a riskavoidance rather than riskmitigation strategy since at a short hour or less cooldown there is simply no reason to ever risk ones expensive implants i support it because it makes jump clones more interesting and would suggest a rank 3 to 5 skill with a 10 reduction per level if we really wanted to make experienced players truly galaxyhoppers a second rank 8 branching skill could be added that reduces cooldown by a flat two hours per level i would strongly discourage this because it would look attractive to new players creating another logical barrier to play still it would be fascinating if some way around this could be developedsomeone else suggested learning boosters i think this is fairly interesting it could actually be turned into a fairly robust system with the effectiveness of the booster decreasing the more total skill points the character has so a submillion sp character might get a 4 boost from a cheap booster but a 20mil one would need an expensive booster to have an effect it would be an option if learning implants were simply dropped from the game without adding to characters base attributes like all boosters these would be lost on death making this a riskmitigation since they would presumably be cheaper than implants currently are especially for lowsp characters rather than riskavoidance strategythe ops suggestion is actually fairly good by my metric if implant slots iv were replaced with career implants they could provide an immediate boost to newbies so they would still risk isk on them but would only be beneficial to players who were actively engaging in the game in particular i would find useful implants boosting mission rewards perhaps one for each category  sec dist and mining mining yield folded a bit in the above ship speed cargo space trade skill effects tackling an obvious choice for newbie implants really that would leave me much more free to focus on training core skillslastly is the idea of clone insurance allowing characters to insure their clones would encourage them to take more risks with those even a relatively small upper limit on insurance packages such as 1535 of market value of implants would dramatically encourage risktaking since the perceived loss is much less some compensation is infinitely more than no compensation i think the best option would be a flat value per level of package plus 15202530 of implants the cost per package level would be dependent on how frequently the character has recently died with a cap of 75 of the cost of the packages payout the payouts should be calibrated such that dying and repurchasing the appropriate level of medical clone is always a net loss

that should have been fixed long ago surpized why its still not changed amarr light and medium drones really need a boost of damage modifier
look by now sansha kuvakei has noticed that his plans are constantly foiled by this ragtag band of teenage capsuleers its about time he asks for help from the other evil space alliances in town force incursion runners to join the war on the side of concord in order to run incursions and give other players the ability to ally with sanshas nation each faction would be a valid war target to the other in incursion systems yes even in highsec anyone who shoots a sansha ship in an incursion system should be flagged as a valid target for the sansha allies who gain standings and lp for every enemy they killthis fixes incursions instantly without nuking the payout
supported it will completely destroy high sec incursions as an isk farming method but thats a good thing for the game overall imho
added thoughtif concord can adequately defend the highsec incursions from infinite capsuleer pirates why cant they wipe out the incursion themselves hence concord should not defend those who run incursions
if concord can adequately defend the highsec why not move them to defend 00 as well 80 or was that 90 percent of playerbase sits in empire doing pve why not to expand it to 00 think and be happy that ccp priorities doesnt make sense else 90 of systems would be hisec and you would be crying even more
boooooo thats blasphemy put him in irons hang him burn him at the stake booooo
do you think that would take too much effort i doubt however as the idea of interacting in stations wasnt rejected by ccp i mean the usage of 3d character models to interact while docked on same station medals change would increase the fun from it if it will have been implemented some time
why dont we have a ingame jukebox that could play audio songs in a file on you pc wouldnt that be awesome control ingame the songs you listen to when you play eve hemmo
waaaayyyyy down the list of priorities lets not confuse ccp now that they seem to have their priorities for development time somewhat sensible
ive been doing a lot of alliance contracts for ship replacement and to feed the demand i have to use multiple characters to have enough contract slots to put all ships out at oncethere are times when my whole stock is used in moments and im left with ships available that arent put out until i can next log insure im in a large alliance so it partly comes with the territory but i cant put contracts up for allies this way so my trading pool is still significantly limited also some corps eg goonwaffe are larger than many alliances by themselves and can make huge numbers of corp contracts for corp membersso to get to the point i propose that alliance contracts should not take up a public contract slot the same way corp contracts are currently exempt

i need to retest as its been years but i believe the the spot isnt random its one of 4 preset coordinates in the system as for the exploit this should be generally solved with spool up timersan easy enough equation to make spooling based off of mass and distancespool time10mass of ship1000000distance traveled in lybasically if you have a ship whose mass is 1 mil traveling 1 ly it would have to spool up for 10 seconds this would be simular to an align time to warping equation applies to bridging to so frigates jump through fast while bss jump through later
i can agree here but to be frank i would rather have it so that self destructing automatically pods you back to your death clone
wrong conan what is best in lifeto crush your enemies see them driven before you and to hear the lamentation of their womenif they are self destructing that is the equivalent of seeing them driven before you who needs killmails or loot when crushing your enemies is whats best in life
a homeworld 2 move system wouldnt be bad but a wasd based system with eves current collision envelopes being the size of small moons erm no even some sort of improvement to the existing double click move would be good especially for those of us who get stuck on space things
incompatible with game mechanics fundamentally flawed for balance purposesi can tell you dont have a practical mind or much knowledge about how computers work  games are designed
one huge con that most people seem to miss out when suggesting manual flight control there are soooo many is that it would require a complete change in the fundamental networking architecture of the gameeve is made to handle the key requirements of a single shard mmo which includelarge numbers of players can gather in one place players come from all around the world it takes much longer for their packets to reach the server and vice versa the implications are that network traffic between clients and the server need to be minimised both in terms of packet size and how often they are sent back and forward and there is an exponential increase in network requirements with each client in the same area one new client doesnt just add one more lot of data to be sent out it needs updates about its state changing being sent out to all other clientsmanual control which would not only make yawpitchroll facingorientation manually changeable but also significant to gameplay would require significant amounts of data to be sent over the network and would also require that data to be sent a lot more oftenthere are neat tricks that the network magicians programmers can do but the fundamental technical design considerations are still therehomeworld is not an mmo and therefore doesnt have the same design constraints so the comparison has no value
supportedwas going to make a proposal for having cargo loadout including ammo but also other stuff but will support this here insteadmy trade character cant fly all doctrine ships but i put up alliance contracts lots and lots of them so this would automate a long and tedious process
hell yeah supportedalso now that we know that the number of saved fitting is relatively easy to adjust could we get it increased again while 100 is better than 50 its still kind of low imo1
yeah but the rigs of each type look the same and the full name of the rig is cut off core defence field extender or is it a core defense field purger so its easy to fit the wrong rig im not saying i do that often but on occassion i looked at my kill mail and said wtf did i do that for i have even put a hybrid rig on a projectile ship before when you lose allot of ships fitting them and double checking can be tedius i would much rather go through everything and double check once to make sure its right then just save it and know its right as for cargo finding all the different missiles you may want to use say for a ham drake is a pia and i always forget the damn nanite paste same thing for ships like the vexor where i sometimes have to jam 1 small gun on there to make it fit that means i need allot of different types of ammo make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
1this essentially means people who frequently move things via jump freighter will always hesitate to push that button also you can search your cargo hold
it would be an option to have the cargo or the rigs checked you could have either or neither checked edit plus i didnt think you could actually fit a jump freighter but i am not suremake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
you lose your rigs when you package your ship often it is not worth it to use them on a deployment that only lasts a couple days
so then dont click yes when it asks if you are sure you want to include the rigs or have a with rigs and without rigs fitusually the rigs are integral to the overall fit though and surely any decent deployment will have carrier support for ship logistics for moving rigged ships
ill admit i am not sure what you concern is exactly but it used to to be that if you tried to fit a ship that already had different rigs fit you got another pop up saying are you sure or even cant do it because you have these slots filled it didnt automatically destroy the rigs you have fit but anyone you would just need to uncheck the cargo box or have it unchecked by default if that was an issue make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i have a better idea have a friend with in a noctis cleaning up while you pewpew npcs into slag or even barf up the green and two box with your shiney new account the salvage man even pimp him out for iskies to clean up for everyone in your corpalliancesocial network

just remove all the t2 bpos entirely the game mechanic that produced them is no longer with us so remove the items  benefits they give to players just like we removed everything other than the mining lasers from the remaining hisec caps or readd the mechanic that allows you to get them either works but doing nothing is a bit imbalanced
t2 bpos are moreless fineif anything the invention or whatever you want to rename it to process could use some tweaking i personally would like to see the decryptors add x of the original mepe levels to the invented bpc rather than fixed amounts like they currently do leave base stats for invented bpcs ie mepe  44circular logic  06 probability 9 max runs 0 me 5 pe formation layout  11 probability 0 max runs 15 me 15 pekeep the values conservative 15 is probably too much so the bpos are just better plus they wont ever need decryptors but with enough bonus that researched t1 bpcs provide a legup in the manufacturing process
so i was talking about this last night with some guys from work and it was brought up that skyrim had mods that made breasts bigger i stated it would irritate me that they are bigger but solid as marble they then directed me to a link which i will not post here due to questionable content that had a mod that made boobs move it was rather unrealistic but the point is they could take a game that didnt have this option even available and make it happen and it was done by an average joe modder not a developer of the game itself if that can be done for a game like skyrim then it should be possible to be done in eve and even made optional although i cant imagine why we would want it optional unless ccp just made it over the top rediculous instead of realistic
ha ha like the idea
you missed the part where you are easy to bait a rifter with 1 sec status jumps in you aggro inmediately his six friends in hurricanes who were waiting on the other side of the gate jump in and gank you before you can deaggro and jumpah but i will have a scout watching on the other side you say ok then instead of waiting on that side of the gate they will be on another gate a short warp distance from it and then you need another scout on that system so instead they wait at a safespot just outside scan range from the gate egghelende is a busy system so you wont notice they are therenow since your tanky ship got popped a few times you get a cloaky logistics ship t3 works best to help you deaggrobut by then you have 34 accounts involved probably in excess of 1b invested in ships and the only thing you can kill is t1 frigs industrials and if you are feeling brave cruisers while being a target for every pvper in the area who will spend nights figuring out ways to trap youthese people exist they are incredibly hard to catch but the feeling when you dowhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp

back to the top 
were not happy with the effectiveness of large groups of titans against subcapital ships so were making some adjustments to titans and to xl turretsthis is a quick surgical adjustment to solve a specific issue we have identified its not a general titan balance pass and we dont consider titans done after this change titans will require significant further changes and probably an overall adjustment in role before theyre in a place where were really happy with them this will require a reasonably significant amount of work which we unfortunately dont have the spare resources for right nowcopied from this thread

some additional thoughtsif ccp decided to set the price tag for a mothership somewhere between the cost of a jump freighter and a supercarrier it would put bridges into the hands of smaller alliances that couldnt afford a bridging ship titan currentlyi realize that the csm has stated that it doesnt want to see more supercapitals introduced however in this case there isnt anything really new its just that the existing capabilities of one ship would now be carried by 3 more focused platformsas suggested by zimmy zeta a viable alternative would be to give the titan subsystems which would allow it to perform some of its various roles at a time this would allow it to be balanced on a subsystem by subsystem basis however it would also preclude the possibility of a cheaper bridging ship being available unless ccp decided to add a separate bridging ship anywayan additional concept that has been brought up is removing ewar immunity for superstitans in return they should get something like 50 warp core strength and enough sensor strength to require 1520 subcaps to effect them in addition i think that regular capitals should get some love in this regard with perhaps 5 warp core strength and double their current sensor strength they are capitals they should require a team effort to effect them with something designed to effect subcaps there is a massive downside to this however removing their ewar immunity would make supers susceptible to tracking links which would put us back where we are now with the tracking problemsince a titan is currently worth roughly 50 bil you could make a case for breaking the price down since we are also breaking down its abilities if you make the mothership cost about 7 bil and the superdread 18 bil you could reduce the price on the titan mkii to around 25 bil i wouldnt reduce the time investment required but it would affect the amount of capital components required making construction jobs a bit easier on the logistics pilotsnew super weapon could be something along the lines of a focused beam weapon that ramps up the damage based on the time spent firing at a single target unable to fire at sub caps the amount of havoc that the doomsday causes on the target ship should also cause some kind of warp scrambling effect or energy neutralization as well possibly going so far as specializing the effect to what racial weapon it is amarr would neut caldari would ecm gallente would warp scram and minmatar would webineffective concepts already proposed in this thread1 make capitals into support for subcap fleets would destroy the subcaps  capitals  supercapitals balancethere are half a dozen other reasons that this idea wont work but for brevity i am only listing one here see post 512 remove titans from the game would dump over 50 trillion isk or minerals back into the market see post 76
interesting concept  effectively turning supercap proliferation against itselfnot sure if i support it but worth thinking about
i loledyeah no supers need a nerf we dont need even more of the buggers running all over especially not in the evenmoreop state that youve proposedgood lord i hope this is a troll post but ive seen too many serious posts like it to have any faith whatsoever in the posters on here
the mothership wouldnt be in the super category and as a non combat ship i will assume you arent referring to itwhile the superdread would be a new super class ship it could be balanced independently from the titan and given that it would be just a bigger tankier dreadnought i doubt there would be much issue balancing it its not like the titan doesnt already do thisthe new titan superweapon that ive proposed is more powerful but i am sure it could be balanced on a dedicated platform there needs to be a capital class heavy tackler somewhere in the capital lineup why not the doomsday on top of that by making the damage ramp up you force the titan to sit there and shoot 1 target for a while rather than the drivebydoomsdays you see nowwhat i have proposed is in fact a nerf to the titan by taking away over half of the capabilities of the ship as it exists todaywhile i appreciate the time you have taken to make a response please outline some solid reasons why you do or dont think the proposal will workthank you
how about making titans modular and customizable like tech 3 cruisers titans should be rare and unique ships like ww ii superbattleships yamato bismarck etc the builder of a titan should be able to emphazise certain aspects at the cost of others to make truely unique flagships that will go into historyso several of your above mentioned roles could be added to the titan without actually creating new ship classes id like to apologize for the poor quality of the post above and sincerely hope you didnt waste your time reading it yes i do feel bad about it
an interesting concept but it would rule out the possibility of a cheaper bridging ship it does sound like a viable alternative if ccp is willing to make titans effectively a tech 3 capital ship and then balance their subsystems separately i will add this to the additional thoughts section
i have said this a thousand times in a thousand other threads and still stand by it titans should stay in the game when the pilot logs off and is inaccessible to anybody but the pilot that logged off in it they should not be able to be stored in stations or pos structures just like now but only left floating in space inside pos shields you can eject from the titan before logging off of course making it accessible to other players should they need to move itthis will cause titans to be killed a lot more and a lot harder to maintain and protect titan proliferation issue resolvedbalancing is another issue
i dont see a problem with a ship with many roles it is after all a titan a captial of capitals flagship of the armada maybe tracking is too good for hitting subcaps but still what is wrong with multiple roles with a 50 billion ship
if we start bringing logic into this game theres no end to how boring it would get
i am certain that adding a pvp component to the highest paying activity in the game would make it boring
i think quite a lot of players thought incursions would be very much like what the oper suggests when we first heard about them instead we got crappy group pve raids for shinny loot content that belongs in a themepark game rudely inserted into eve its a travesty to everything eve ought to be
there is literally no good argument against this change
i want to shoot at isk pinatas risk free is not a good argument
i agree but i may be biased
nerf high sec incursion rewards
bumpingthe trolls here have not formed a decent argument as to why the name change doesnt matter it doesyous are all just trolling the older names were pure win not least because they gave eve online a certain flavour that the current names are not capable of emulating i for one will always associate the paradise class missile with the better days of eve gone by imo ccp need help understanding just what is  and what isnt
zomg i cant even say r3t4rd3d anymore
yespeople get offended by the word because they are ignorant to its meaning
the idea seems interesting so i support it
remove the option to selfdestruct while engaged in combat  as a member of small pvp corporation the tactics and effort we employ to tackle a capital ship in a small fleet is hugely diminished when the hostile capital pilot simply selfdestructs just to deny a killmail or perhaps save himself corp embarrassment
agreed almost every supercap kill ive been involved in was a self destruct also
yes agreedwhy should someone be able to deny an enemy a kill just because he has more ehp and can survive the selfdestruct countdown this definitely needs fixingcms were counting on you to save small gang pvp this is an easy fix and a step in the right directionthanks
i like this idea dont let the big boys have an easy out at least make the selfdestruct while agressed a 30 minute timer anything but an easy out give the small guys a chance to fill their killboardsthey have earned ityes yes yesdo this please
no idea why selfdestruct was put in the game in the first place as it serves no other purpose than to deny killmails or loot which depends on the loot fairy
what eve could have is a subsystem targetting system be able to destroy such subsystems asjumpdrives selfdestructs overheating subwarp engines warp engines weapon mounts pos shield password stuff drones bandwidththen the only way to repair these would be hull reppers and rr hull heppershe commenced selfdestruct every refocus and shoot his selfdestruct stuff like weapon mounts ought to be very hard to take out but jumpdrives should be so fragile that they fall apart near instantly
i do not like all the selfdestruct stuff going on either so i am supporting this plea
agreed at the very least self destructs should still generate killmails for those who are attacking the ship
ill chime in with support for this there shouldnt be a way for capital ships to escape getting a bad killmail agression mechanics and logoff timers were fixed this should be fixed as well
i think it should still be an option  but should still generate a km
yep  and the km should go to the highest nonnpc damage dealer at the time of destructionnot that bothered about loot though i suppose having the chance of survival slightly lower for a selfdestruct makes sense in a way
why our 4 manticores couldnt break carrier and he goes boom petition fix it csm hear me white tree
agree
either that either the km should have come after sd final blow may belong to the victim or to whom inflicted last hit
either remove the option to selfdestruct or generate a killmail regardless of whether its a selfdestruct or not highest damage from a player ongrid gets the killmaili can see an argument for denying people loot by selfdestructing but it shouldnt be a way to protect your killboard
bring more dps and nutes or cry some more for your deficiencies
self destructing is a valid game mechanic that has its place in the game i disagree with all these people calling for the total removal of the self destruct option however a killmail should be generated
aww sounds like youre the one crying seriously how about some constructive comments instead of this childish posti think the whole point of this thread was to get a killmail for small gangs that are incapable of brining more dps and nutes to have a ship tackled in particular a capital ship with hard work not a blob fight in the scenario described above the capital pilot is losing his ship one way or another so how about at a minimum generating a killmail for those responsible so they can decorate their board and show some accomplishmentyes obviously there is purpose for selfdestruct agree with you in generating a killmail for those selfdestructs during a fight
100 agreed
self destruct shoulddestroy all cargo and modules denying the aggressor lootgenerate a combat log entry the same as a concord killnot pay insurance or at least reduce insurance payout by 50that way victims can still thumb their noses if someone fails to bring the firepower to get loot out of their freighter but the aggressors get the killmail so they can prove they got the kill
theres some danger with removing self destruct entirely is that it would become a very effective griefing tool  tackle something but dont kill it and simply hold them there for as long as you wish less of a worry with ships themselves since the pilot can at least eject but with pods theres really nothing that they can do while i admit it would be pretty funny it probably wouldnt be good from a fun perspective that isnt to say that the idea wouldnt work but its probably something that should be consideredthat said i completely support the generation of killmails for combat involving a self destruct or any mechanic which prevents self destructing simply for the purpose of denying killmailsthe current state of affairs makes combat involving capitals less exciting and has a particularly large effect on newer players and smaller groups getting on a capital or even supercapital killmail is something that newer pvpers can get really excited about particularly for smaller groups where a capital kill is a real rarity getting a kill like this is a really big achievement for these guys and giving them something to show for it would in my opinion increase the quality of their experiencetusker small gang pvper and author of the altruist guides to pvp in eve formerly director of agony unleasheds pvpuni
no 1
this and only this denying me my sandbox choice of self destructing instead of letting you kill me is unacceptable self destructing should be like driving your car into the lake and getting caught no insurance for you self destructing is controlled and therefor should be a total destruction of all modules and possible loot with the exception of salvage a kill mail should still be generated for the last person to land a hit before the self destruct for those who even care for killmails but the killmail should clearly state that it was a self destruct
let them self destruct but there should be a killmail generated no insurance either  this is fraud at its highest level
i agree no self destruct while in combat i think it would be great for pirates among others pin down a ship and order them to eject it would be sort of like a new form of ransoming
wtfare you two the same person you look like twinsyou got the pissed off brother and the overly happy brother
im for this but the modules should still have a chance to drop once your in self destruct mode modules should not be removable you risk moving it in space you risk someone taking it away on your deathno insurance payout at allkillmail yes
wait  theres sound in eve seriously though whats wrong with just tossing up vlc or media player or something like that to play the music if you have a media keyboard you can even control the player from ingame i and most people i would assume just use standard media players rather than trying to learn a whole new one inside eve
unless they changed this in the last few patches you can actually add your own music files mp3 to the current jukebox and control them from ingame im not in the game right now but can post the instructions when i get online unless somebody beats me to it
you mean this jukebox

this is unironically a serious threadhere is exactly how tofix nullsecevery time someone is podded by a player in nullsec that player receives an isk bounty minimally equivalent to the characters medical clone cost this encourages war roaming pvp and generally playing eve instead of botting or not logging in very little money is gained from killing newbies tens of millions are made from killing 6 year vets there is no net isk generation so it is impossible to kill yourself with an alt to make profit every ship destroyed by a player adds 20 of its insurance value to the players bounty ships that are destroyed in nullsec shall have a 20 smaller insurance payout in order to avoid creating isk and because no insurance company would pay full insurance for war equipment destroyed in a war zone now go get revenge on that elite pvper that has been terrorizing your home system for weeks without dying it paysplayer bounties and bounty upgrades shall be spread equally to all participants on a killmailin the same fleet except those with blue standings or in fleet with the dead player fix cloakingmake cloaks have a nonzero capacitor use and a cycle time the capacitor use shall always put the ship in negative recharge though capacitor rigs and modules such as rechargers extenders and boosters will greatly enhance a ships ability to stay cloaked for long periods of time cap stability will be a hardcored impossibility there is no reason for a powerful module like a cloak to not use energy add a t3 cloak that is available for all ships it behaves almost exactly like a covops cloak full speed no targeting delay but it is impossible to warp cloaked and somewhat expensive 100m isk it has nonnegligible cpu use 80 or 100 teraflops and allows ships to take black ops bridges fix supercaps and capsmake pilots suffer horribly from dying after being entombed in their supercap for years supercap pilots may never eject of self destruct upon ship death the pilot dies too no pod ejects when a pilot dies while piloting a supercap the pilot suffers a temporary soft form of wetgravingread the chronicles and his relevant supercap skill is reset to level 1 for example losing a titan means that your titan skill is back to 1 this is quite like t3 ships but harsher supercap kills add no bounties to those who killed them since they cannot be insuredremove supercap ewar immunity replace it with arbitrarily high but finite numbers for example a titan should have 30 warp core strength and 100 sensor strength tracking disruptors and other ewar should have 5 of their normal effect titans are not as rare as they were intended to be so let us chip at them like whaling sailors let 20 falcons jam a titan let 30 tacklers prevent one from warping in exchange let remote assistance affect them at 5 of regular effectiveness supercap pilots you know this is only fair make the minmatar dreadnought a pure projectile ship remove its missile hardpoints and replace them with turretsfix the leviathan replace its missile hardpoints with turret slots for railguns alternatively just make citadels not suckfix certain subcapsadd one midslot to all ships who currently only have onefix bubblesit shall be made impossible to warp through a bubble even if the beginning point of the warp is not inside the bubble and the end point is outside of the grid the warping ship will stop at the bubbles edge fix snipingit shall be made impossible to warp directly at a target on the same grid through probing probes will only generate a signature that allows the prober and his fleet to warp to the targetUFFFDs grid at a random range there will be no effect if the target is on gridfix industry mining hacking etcrats shall drop no module loot upon salvaging a wreck it shall generate salvage as normal in addition to a new type of salvage scrambled datacores these datacores can then be decrypted using the hacking skill into meta 234 1run bpcs a hacking skill equivalent to the datacores meta level is required to decrypt itthese bpcs can be used to build named items when used in conjunction with relevant science and industry skills they are locked at me0 pe0 as a general rule of thumb meta 2 requires skills at 2 meta 4 requires skills at 4 so making a best named railgun would require electromagnetic physics 4 mechanical engineering 4 science 4 and industry 4 scrambled datacores may also be turned in to a research agent for a small amount of normal research points towards a regular t2 datacorerogue drones shall use the same new loot system as the normal rats with a bias for dronerelated modules they may also drop scrambled datacores that decrypt into limited run t2 drone bpcs with perfect me and pe the only mineral drops from rats are the tritanium from salvaged metal scraps corpses may be salvaged by someone with a sufficient biology and science skill they have a slight chance of dropping scrambled datacores that can be decrypted into implant bpcs for the implants who were in the corpsess head at the time of death creating the implants requires t2 components and relevant pi goods miniature electronics wetware mainframe boost module drop rates on player ship death let scrapmetal reprocessing remain somewhat relevant also lower scrapmetal reprocessings training speed multiplier and prerequisites refund the sp differencefix incursionsimplement my suggestion  players should be allowed to join sanshas nation in faction warfare anyone who shoots a sansha ship in an incursion system should be flagged as a valid target for the sansha allies who gain standings and lp for every enemy they kill
fix lagtidi it worksfix the marketjust let us sell officer and deadspace modules on the market thereUFFFDs no reason not toplease try to find ways in which these ideas are not perfect so that i might correct them
i agree with most of those things except the rats shall drop no module lootyoull make them drop bpcs and due towell ccp or something its awful to manage cant stack them you have to go through the pain that it is to put those 100s bpcs you just got from your lvl 4 in the oven and all thati dont really know how to fix thati would add one thing to this thofaction guns are expensive as fsck like really and it gives you a lower dps than t2 weapons they indeed have a lower cpu consumption but it doesnt make up for the costeither allow them to use t2 ammo and allow them to recieve the specialisation bonus or multiply their droprate for faction guns that drop from npcs but also for faction guns you can buy in lp stores by 4or go ahead and do both of these things no one uses faction weapons for a reason the only faction weapons i ever saw were on a officier fit golem a repfleet fitted machariel and a cn launcher on a 100mn tengu cause a t2 wouldnt fitthere is a reason to it its because the weapons have too many disavantages less dps and less usability due to not being able to use t2 ammunition also it cost a fsckton to fit those 678 guns you need and the only avantage you get is ridiculously small
updaded
there is still a net isk gain over the current model the amount gained would be so small that it is hardly a motivator in the words of testcursions my iskhour this is functionally useless an isk faucet and imposes arbitrary penalties on 00 also while you might enjoy roleplaying it shouldnt be grounds for balance or gameplay featuresfix cloaking i cant even begin to describe how dumb you are or how much i hate you because of it hopefully the copy of this thread you foolishly posted to gfcom gets populated with the appropriate insults im not even going to comment on the rest although im tempted to just quote it before you realize the error of your ways and edit your post to avoid ridiculemaybe next time post this  on an alt and save us the embarrassment and yourself the inevitable flaming
so it turns out that the op is an idiot good to know about the only thing that is worthwhile at all on there is the removal of ongrid warping to something your probes lock the rest of it is just random garbage
this has to be some kind of meta troll but he posted the same garbage on our forums stop trying to fix cloaking ugggghhhhhugggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
posting in a waaaa mummmy cry thread
youre all fools only goonswarm have the true answers to fix evevaurion infara hemorrhages and dies
1 for you for managing to use hemorrhages in a sentence lol
people do pvp and lose stuff if insurance was the barrier to pvp you would never see tech 2 or tech 3 being used or lost which is not truethe insurance idea could help with driving a reward for killing people other then just gloating and eating tears and the loss of a portion of a insurance payout is negligible to the cost of deployed a properly fitted ship and that most people worth salt have reimbursement programs or can pay for themselves the difference if they cant well time to stick to tech 1 frigsallot of the ideas are though pretty bad
look if i could make half of what i make looting belt rats by shooting irc in the face all day in a rifter i would never touch a rat ever again
that really is a decent solution to this issue even if it is 4 specific points in a system its still a bit much to expect people to figure out and bookmark them all for each system
wrecking your own installations while you are behind a shield seems perfectly ok to me receiving insurance for it maybe not so muchi could get behind something like this though wrecks from self destruct fail to despawn inside a pos forcefield until the shield goes down so that the attackers if they win may salvage them all or defenders may get some money back if they successfully defeat the attack after all
right now the new t3 battlecruisers and sniping battleships can lock and kill out to 250km this is wonderful and makes for some fantastic fightsbut there is a downside a critical and intensely annoying one you cant broadcast targets that fartargets can only be broadcast out to 150km and with combat in these sniping ships regularly going further targets have to be specifically called out by name something that is incredibly annoying in a large fleet fight extending the broadcast target range allows sniping ships to be more effective and fulfill the purpose they have been ostensibly designed forthis is a simple quality of life change that will have very positive consequences considering how range has now become an ever more important factor in multidoctrine 1000 man fleet fights
what is the problem with making it possible to broadcast everything on grid
being that ships in eve have turrets the only way first person freeform controls or gunning would work is if you could have multiple people commanding different parts of the same shipin the case of carriers you would need people being able to command fighters but i would say it could add allot to the game if it were possible eve has many good features and this could enhance it black prophocy is a example of a game that has that one feature but lacks many of the dynamics of eve player driven content supreme market and destructible ships add a wonder to the game that drive it forward so it would be great that eve could steal that one idea that makes black propocy interesting and take it themselvesone thought to give players some kind of ship for dogfighting is to have frigs be able to do it they may be large compared to earth based fighters but still could be relatively maneuverable they need to be large considering they are self sufficent vessels that can travel in space long distance have nonturreted weapons for them small chasis and manuverable they have one disadvantageif the lag issue exists then that kills the idea but still what if it wasnt a issuethough this idea would drastically limit the size of fleets if you had to have 9 people for every battleship that unless from one gun you could point it manually and all the other guns follow to aim at the same spot in that case could you autopilot the ship and manually aim the guns personally i would say firing guns is a bit funner then being space barge captain trying to maneuver something that has no maneuverability if free flight is allowed can the ship can still be autopiloted like normal or follow directions in fleet fleet formationsdoes this open up area damage on ships attacking one area and direction does more damage then othersalso would this revamp the skill system would your shots hit because you aimed right or because you motion tracking skill is high enough how would that interact how would targeting work would that be gone seeing that you could just point and shoot or would jamming remove crosshairs give staticthis could change the game
manual flight would be a pain for anything that goes less than 1 kmsUFFFD
supported dont see why it was removed tbh would be nice if it auto loaded scripts ammo and cap boosters etc too
thats would be create ninjasalvager killer mini profession so greatly like it
skyrim is a singleplayer game designed to be extended and altered by modifications theres a mod kit and an automatic extension loading mechanism you just have to drop files in the right locations and theyll be picked upeve is very different beast the devs would have to work this in
exactly leave wh to us  small gang pvpers keep you nullbearblobs hands from it as far away as possibleread and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
all wh residents and people that are active in wspace know that this is truethe wh mass stabilizer would only benefit large alliances as it would make their wspace take over much much much easier a alliance wich can bring together 60 fleet members cane easily take over a wh if they well plan and coordinate the attack but for that you need time and some effort wich some dont want to give they want it easier and therefore make it alot harder for the other side it is allready hard to defend a wh if you are a small corp or small alliance this would make it impossible 60 hostile bs fleet jumping at once into a wh where a 30 member corp lives come onmechanism to get rid of the invulnerability some groups enjoy in wormholes  huhif this was refering to c1c4 wormholes then that invulnerbility shuld be renamed to well planed pvp ships and coordinated team of players wich took alot of time to plan how to effectivly defend their wh even if that means that they collapse the wh to prevent the enemys forces to get in that also needs some effortc1c4 whs usally have a small amount of players in it as there are not that much people needed to do a site and because there is less isk to share therfore if you take some time you can find their weakness but that time is a bit to much time for some it seemsc5c6 are in my eyes allready dominated from large alliances as they have more people inside 1 wh and therefore more people to fly cap ships for now different alliances can hold their ground if they have alot of people and caps in theitr wh and that is the only thing that comes near invulnerbility in my eyes but even that can be taked if you plan well and are willing to take some risk if the wh stabilizer would come in game then the alliance with the largest fleet and largest number of caps would dominate all c5s and c6s wspace would become equal to nullsecfor now people can defend themselves and have a chance against larger corps and alliances wh mass stabilizer would make the possibility of defending the wh really small the large alliances would then really become invulnerable
think it was attually the rnk csm member who suggested it not any of the null sec csms
the people wanting to push this through are the ones eager to benefit from the feature themselfes the corpalliances they are in in my opinion those in the csm voting for this are corrupt and are abusing their voice and influencewormhole mechanics are just fine the way they are now do not mess with it
true but she well he is hard to be called wh representative  rnk have just one wh corp guilotine therapy  all other are just null sec corpsread and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
jack i have to disagree with your proposalin addition i created an alternate proposal in this same forum category the reason for this is i feel your proposal only moderates caps a ss punishment which should not occur in the first place it also allows pirates more targets on gates which i feel scares off the casual empire crowdfwiw since jan 2007 ive been fighting to get more pilots from empire to come out and fight solo in lowsec thats five years of this possibly hopeless battle it bothers me to see anything proposed which makes travel more dangerous for those pilots because i believe they are the salvation of lowsec new fresh blood your proposal has gathered a great deal of support most from 10 pirates i must note and a great deal of press due to our eve election period my posting of the alternate lowsec fix is simply my way to at least throw out a view from the side of the solo lowsec pvp pilot i would be remiss if i did not speak up against something i disagree with if it dies quietly i can say hey i tried no hard feelings at least on this side either way
i personally think offline towers should have no shields making it easier to killbut this is also good as well 3 days and you get a message warning that your pos is being hackedif you dont respond in 3 days well too bad your fault for not taking care of your tower
what you are proposing is a core game mechanic change which should be intuitive and straightforward to fit that the change needs to be applied to all ships or none if you could convince me that this is a change you want to propose to fix a problem with all ships then i might back up the idea however i cant get behind a core game mechanic change that would affect all ships just to fix a single broken onei dont really have a problem with a titan being able to perform in multiple roles but it shouldnt be able to do so all at the same time the real problem shows up when you are dealing with a group of 40 of these flagships even once ccp introduces a capital class heavy tackler a blob of titans as the ship exists today will still be nearly untouchable
easy way to balance titans is to remove their turretsdreads have turrets for capital and pos bashing and the titan will still have its dd for the near instapopping of other capitalswill solve the titan problem and make dreads useful again
err  noyou guys should really move on to another topic  titans and sc are fine atm
frankly the problem and the solution are very easythe problem is not that the titan needs nerfing some ongoing balancing might be in order but its not completely invulnerable the same goes for supercapsthe problem is simply this they are difficult to kill and relatively easy to make ergo many more titan and supercaps are being created than are being destroyed which if nothing changes will lead to ever increasing sizes of supercapital blobs basically the number of titans that can be simultaneously put in combat should be limited so that eve doesnt die a slow death to ever increasing proliferation of titan blobs this can be done in several ways but my favorite is to introduce a mechanic whereby the titan must log on to a corp tcu in order to activate its jump drive advantages to this approacha it allows for the creation of large numbers of titans for logistics or defense without the risk that nullsec will simply fill up with invulnerable titan blobs b it creates a new reason for large alliances to need to take and hold space if they want to develop their combat capability  more reason to make war c it creates a new way for alliances that dont have huge titan blobs to have an impact on the combat capability of corpsalliances that do ie by sbuing systems or destroying tcus in other words no more nearly automatic win because you can put more titans on the field with this mechanic the number of titans you can field on a given day will depend on more than the number of titans you haved it can create new drama in the form of stranded titans that are locked down in one system unable to jump out because their corp lost sovtldr titans may need fine tuning but the problem is that many more are being made than destroyed what needs balancing is how to ensure that the growth in numbers of titans that can be fielded in combat is limited a proposal for a mechanic to enable this was made in this post t
if i remember right in a regards to empire law and the stories in regards to titans specifically that next to planets they can actually change tides etcas off as that sounds wouldnt it mean a shitload of them on grid at the same time  up orbits  gravitational pull would be kidn fo funny if 80 on grid or so cling together and crashcrunch
exactly and bump
yeah we all thought incursions were going to be cooler than they actually arei originally thought they were going to be pvp trainers with npc pirates warping around with advanced ai that makes them behave like small roaming gangs i also thought that incursions would turn off concordso yeah the current raiding mechanic is better than just solo running l4 missions but it could be a lot more amazingi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
well the new system is just fine i really enjoyed the old system having each missile type with its own name just added some fluff something i sorta enjoyedhowever when ever i have to type mjolnir to find my em missiles i get little mad
is there any other type of missile except scourgeummmi mean trauma its just a name and no real hassle to remember after awhilei am sure ccp have better things to fix than missile names
yes this is true because many people do not know the word can also be used to describe a decelerating motion or a slowing energy force retardation which is where  derives
i want my scourge backand not only that but i want my cold gas thrusters back tooi personally think this falls in same category with removal of ship hangar
i wouldve put it a little more tactfully but i agree with the sentimentnot supported
thanks for being more eloquent than me smiling menace 
1 we have shortcuts for bcing targets why not tagging ditll make my life tagging in incs whs a whole lot easierwho said that noob ships suck
i dont agree with removing self destruct even in combat but if you are agressed by others then a killmail should list all involved in forcing the self destruct in the first placeas others have stated its only sensible to deny your enemies some nice shiny loot if you die and thats fine if you cant kill them before the timer is up bring more people
to be fair there should be module that renders self destruction impossibledont make it to easy for the wolf
i remember i sent a petition about an obvious macro i suicide ganked after i blew up his ship he warped back and forth from the field to the station in his pod at that point i podded him it took me over a month for me a receive a response from a gm telling me that they will investigate it the only petition that will receive a fast response is the stuck petition that is the only place where the gms are active in everywhere else is just an afterthought
clear your cache is my favorite response to petitons ive seen even better when clear our cache has no way of fixing the problembeing a full time help chat troll the question of whens my petiton going to be answered has long since beaten the whens hulkageddon
i was going to write one of these i am glad someone else did it for me the quality of responces from petitions and the increased wait times have become very annoying as well as when the gm basically laughs at your petition and closes it right away without you getting a chance to respond causing you to open a new petition to have yet again that same gm make fun of you and close the petition againyou know exactly who im talking about and to be honest this gms personal interaction with anyone of the petitions i have made are rather annoying i swear he sees my name and is like mine trollfaceccp really needs to retrain their gms hire new ones and make them less grumpy
only speaking from my experience but i have never had a problem with a slow gm reply or the quality of it

heart of the swarm is too starcraft
rats never utilize rifters although why i cannot fathomyoud think by now the angels at least would say you know thats a sturdy little ship maybe we should get some
youre an embarrassment even to the goons
lmao you guys just have no sense of humour as much fun and mayhem would ensue from such an expansion id have to say not supported
in other words devs should be able to provide their friends with enigmas and eidolons and stuff as occasional drops right
what thats not what i was saying and it was not what i was proposing your post does not relate in any way to what was being said to repeat the point if ccp plays on tranquility they should play with the same rules that affect us all its incredibly lame to delete a drop because you dont like what dropped unless all players on tq have this right t
to repeat the pointwhat if these guys werent just lucky but were in conspiracy with the dev to get this rare shipwhat if they were even this devs game characters yes devs play eve tooi just wonder what this guy was doing on tq on a spot in a lowsec with enigma in his cargo
well he clearly had no business being there in that ship but what youre accusing him of is pretty extreme frankly if he wanted to give his friends special favours there are a lot of other ways he could do it under the radar personally i think he was just being a fool and either panicked or got all egohurt about losing his ship and decided to cover it up but he cant cover it up completely because the killmail was registered either way i find what happened distasteful and i hope it doesnt happen again t
its not like something new for eve
i dont think it was his own decision as i seriously doubt any eve dev can give away plexes left and right
yeah thats the only case ive ever heard about do you have anything more recent iirc the bob bpo debacle took place in early 2006 that was 6 years ago do you have any evidence that anything like that has taken place since t
i think thats the only case that went to the publicand of course i dont accuse ccp as it is of anything i just find suspicious the actions of a particular ccp employee and think ccp made the right decision and removed the ship from the game
i dont think the dev had a choice about removing the enigmaits simple at this time players are not allowed to have such ships
posting in a thread full of tinfoil hatterythats a bughunter dev ship and is normally supposed to be invisible to players most likely heshe was monitoringlooking for an issue on tq and forgot to fit a cloak dunno what that enigma was doing in the cargo but we it was a lucky kill on someone whom people shouldnt have been able to kill nothing more

i applaud the initiative behind any proposal which seeks to fix lowsec like many others it is my belief that lowsec should exist as a place for casual pvpcurrent mechanics make that difficult the penalty for fighting in lowsec is the loss of security status eventually locking the player out of empire a player is forced to either painfully rat their sec status up or create logistic alts to bring equipment in these restrictions imo are the problem eve may be a sandbox but the engine which drives it has always been about combatplayers should be able without significant restriction to find casual combat if they desire there are many pilots located in empire who would enjoy casual combat in lowsec if 1 the security status punishment was fixed and 2 if they feel they have a chance to get through gatecampsmy proposal is this1 remove the security status hits for initiating combat against ships in all areas of lowsec except for gates and stations in other words if you fire upon a frigate in a belt planet poco complex or safespot you suffer no loss of security status at all what concord doesnt know wont hurt them2 combat wrongfully initiated upon any grid which contains sentry guns ie gates and stations will bring about sentry gun response and security status loss gatecamp mechanics as they exist today would remain unchanged3 podding anywhere in lowsec still incurs security status loss as it does today this allows pilots who seek the 10 badge of honor the ability to go full piratei believe this proposal offers the most simple solution which will allow players old and young alike to try out casual lowsec combat without suffering penalty
i see you got tired of posting in jack dents thread so you made your own little tweaked version sticking to the topic at hand your version changes nothing about how lowsec currently operates 8090 of combat in lowsec happens on gates or stations and you completely failed to address the problem of casual pvpers losing sec and highsec access if youre going to copy someones ideas at least copy the good parts
lets face it you stopped listening jacks proposal favors pirates too heavily and youre a pirate this is kinda like a nullsec group promoting playstyles that favor their game play while taking from othersas a solo frigate pilot i have not fought on a gate or station in the last four years perhaps your pvp happens there mine does not as a matter of fact the only pvp i see at gates are gatecamps or gangs engaging gatecampsnegative security status restrictions under my plan would be removed unless on a station or gate under jacks plan the solo frigate pilot who goes to lowsec and engages in a belt still suffers a loss in security status shall we look at some of those good partsjacks plan puts a cap on security status punishments which still occur even when two opponents meet in a belt and both choose to fight my plan removes that dont fight on gates or stations youll never suffer a ss punishmentjacks plan which did not remove these ss punishments then says to compensate make anyone with negative sec status a valid target while in lowsec with no gcc or sentry repercussions lets be really clear on this one if two pilots want to fight ones going to head to a nonsenty location and the others going to follow the only thing jacks concession does is open up more targets for roving gangs as it stands now id have to get to 5 ss to start worrying about getting my frig nailed on a gate in lowsec under jacks plan i have to worry about it much much sooner jacks items on highsec ganks and pod restrictions i have no issue withjacks plan says optionally rework killrights to either remove them or make them only usable in lowsec what killrights are awarded to a ship which was destroyed and did not defend itself right id say in lowsec the most general application is i catch your hauler kill it but then i have to watch my back for a bit you want to remove thisitems not mentioned is the new type of gatecamp jacks proposal allows but ive written enough about that in pages 910 of jacks thread and given your posts i doubt youd listen if i took the time to restate them herein short jacks proposal starts with a damn fine premise but becomes far too propirate when it begins threatening solo play i must disagree
ive been in lowsec almost exclusively since the first week i started playing i hate gatecamps station games and the like i certainly prefer a willing fight to a gank the problem here is what you see as a solo frigate pilot who has 50 kills and what i see as a career lowsec pvper is completely different ive been in your shoes and many other shoes during my time here hypothetically if i were a solo nonoutlaw frigate pilot and i knew gateguns would assist me if i kept my sec above insert arbitrary number here i would keep it above that number the whole premise of your argument as far as i can tell is that you really dont like gatecamps especially gatecamps where the campers can operate with impunity right now everyone knows that below 5 makes you an outlaw who will never have gateguns on their side if that number was moved up it would be exactly the same as it is now only people would keep their sec higher what youre doing is applying the security status that people currently have to a hypothetical situation where that wouldnt be the case this is the point youre either not understanding or ignoring gatecampers wouldnt have free reign in lowsec because people would understand the rules of lowsec no one accidentally goes pirate and no one would accidentally get security status low enough that gates wouldnt help themplease refute me because im not sure that this is sinking in
by removing sec hits from belts planets etc they wont ever have to grind ss back up you will never lose sec status if you fight in belts planets ect so you dont have to worry about unwanted combat on a gate except in the superboosted oms gatecamp thing which i believe is acceptablewould this in your opinion bring in more casual pvpers from empire
ugh please read this before thinking of a retort bear in mind that shooting someone with negative sec wouldnt even lower your sec so your argument about not having to grind goes out the window youre really wearing me out dude removing sec hits on planetsbelts solves the problem of the highsec warrior who wants to solo in a frig yay what youre not accounting for are fleet fights which happen almost exclusively on gates and its not something that can be negotiated to a belt i would love nothing more than for solo pvp to become viable again but thats not the only thing that goes on in lowsec
you would sound more mature if youd drop the insults you simply come across as a rude adolescent no one has a reading problem around here your points are being heard read and understood that a dissimilar opinion exists does not mean people are simply too fail to understand your position i have attempted to deal with you fairly and politely are you capable of the sameyou keep trying to moderate a symptom i believe it is best to address the causeyouve not answered my question from the last post
this is going in circles i think its best to agree to disagree at this point i will respectfully disagree with your proposal and move on
i also disagree with this proposal the reason is easy if you are in gang than you will fight with a 90 chance at the gatewhy because you have to pass through the gatedont think that if you find a fleet with even numbers and same shiptypes ect on a gate that if you ask them to warp to a planet to fight that many people will say yes this time is far away we had it years ago you can still find it but you wont find it oftenso you have to decide if you want to fight these guys and ruin your sec status or to leave them if they dont want tothis idea wont change low secand allow killing people if they are in belts on planets etc you are still able to kill haulers or people who want to kill npcssorry but i cannot see a difference between belts and stargates or stationsand yes you can always create a fast log ship you can do this also at the moment pirates use also scoutsso if someone warps to the gate pirates may warp to the gate too and kill the guy concerning your post in jackss threadof course it will be easier for people who have only one account but it will be also easier to create a trap for themand i dont say that i disagree just because i am a pirate i also had to think alot about being a pirate you have to pay attention on your wallet you have to search for other ways to reimburse your ships and just because you want to do some small size pvpi think many people think about it too
not at all i appreciate the feedback
i am necroeing this thread some of my chars though their combined efforts  and yes we also need to fix copying bookmarks 5 at a time really are heading there sometime this summer i may delete 3 or so thousand safespot construction bookmarks well parking them in containers as i didnt bookmark farm those incursions for nothing but that will only delay the inevetible to give ccp devs enough time to raise the limit shoo
maybe you dont get the picture most valuable loot is moving in hi sec especially when you count the dividends afterwards if you loot 10bil with 10 pilots its only 1bil each its not really much even then its pvp because youre shooting someone if you want some kind of fair fights you should probably go play guild wars at pvp arena or something then you realize how pointless fair fights are oh and i am not even going into exploting orca for hauling valuable  yet thats so  i cannot comprehendand then poss if you somehow manage to figure out these dudes have maybe 10bil worth of ships in large deathstar pos you need first a lot of people to attack it if they can just pull out self destruct bullshit even after somehow getting trapped after reinforcement timers and all that crap it seems pretty funny all that work went to nothing you say you need to work out your best to keep them from getting away witth their stuff but thats not even possible unless they just dont log in which is not valid argument
it does seem strange that with the range of some ships that you cant broadcast targets that far outsupported
if this  feature were implemented wormholes would become nothing more than nullsec with sleeper rats and no local
as a longterm wh dweller  nearly 2 years now  i have to say the mechanics whilst needing a few subtle changes are fineno 2 whstabsa few pipedreams are allow a sov style structure to be anchored in a wh this gives improved functionality this structure can be attacked and when reenforced will take away the functionality provided this gives you access to the current static exits marketplace or in the case of deep whs the closest static exit through a whthis could of course be easily argued against as making wh life a little too easy as we would be able to check the markets without sticking our noses out and could probably be abused to know what area the exit is in before its scanned so is less than ideal this is more of a major pipedream than serious idea an anchorable cloning facilty in wh space so when we die you are back in your pos this cannot be used outside wspace so cant be anchored in null low or highsec when killed if you are in kspace  you go to your kspace medclone if you die in wspace you go to the wspace medclonethis has again advantages and disadvantages for attackers its more of a gamble as when we kill at the moment we know that we have removed that player from the field for at least the next 30 minutes or more depending whereif the residents know where their exit is with this mechanic in play the aggressors can come back into the fight potentially within minutes the disadvantage is of course the fact that fights on wh could simply become meatgrinders throwing clone and ship after clone and ship into a fray and of course it makes life more difficult for any aggressors prehaps a cooldown of 24 hours before another wspace clone can be made available to limit the tactical advantagesjust a few brainfarts to throw into the mix im sure there are a lot more than that out there
1 booster alts are so overpowered and prevalent these days in lowsec that you have to match them to even compete screw that pvp is expensive enough as it is
1especially since it would fix the issue with multiganglink t3 outperforming fleet cs as opposed to what someone said before they wouldnt be useless  they can field a nice combination of resistances with decent buffer sig and speed  if they fit on
confrimign i am like idea ver muchi am thinkign when i am get on csm we am needign to talk to get these idea into widre frameworks for reveiws of all dec  sec  bounty systims these may becomign part of mine platform move forwardskeep up good thinkign 
well done jack this accounts perfectly for 99 of peoples problems with lowsec pvp  the sec status and travel restrictions would love to see this implemented hope ccp is listening
terrible idea only people with agendas would want to do this
makes sense1
what agenda if i may ask its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
null and whs have greater risk attached to them and thus greater rewards if youre not risk averse i dont believe you are and youre not ok with further nerfs to null  wh incomes im assuming you arent then how can you justify calling for something that would make nullwhs less of a financial risk aka saferwhich brings me to your second point that the 24hr cooldown on clone jumping prevents people from playing the game this part i agree with the cooldown is too cumbersome provides little in the way of emergent gameplay and seriously what the hell is the point of a jump clone cooldown and to your third point wait i thought you said you werent risk averse now im confusedin summation the solution to real problem is not to remove learning implants and remove the inherent risk they add to null and whs but to reduce the cooldown on clone jumping so that nullbears can stop using that as an excuse not to show up for ctas
the issue that i see with removing jump clone timers is that a large alliance like goonswarm would be able to have its members place jump clones strategically and have at least one combat ship at each of those stations allowing us to quickly form up wherever we want  thatd be overpoweredi dont consider implant loss a risk in nullsec its a certainty  for example i have two 3s and a couple of hardwirings plugged in their combined cost is less than 3040m  i need the hardwirings for my scimitar and the 3s are nice for the long skill im training if i get popped and heh aname in a scimitar ask me about getting primaried dont get podded im probably selfdestructing my pod to quickly reship and get back on a titanremoving bubbles or making cynojammers block covert cynos would make nullsec safer taking away learning implants from the game would take away something that i personally view as a vestige of the days of learning skills its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
there is nothing wrong with titans as they are  the problem is that the majority of people are too stupid to counter themthis is a worse idea than the op
having 40 dd in a blob is basically having 80 million damage you can instantly apply to a singlemultiple capital targets which is enough damage to take out several supers all at once or a whole fleet of enemy dreads the capital weapon portion of the titan is actually the least op in my opinion assuming the tracking issue is fixedan interesting concept perhaps you should put up a proposal of your own for people to respond to however sov mechanics are getting changed up sometime in the near future so i would suggest you think of some way to manage the idea without linking it to sov control since we dont know how the new system will work
make the color customizable like all other colortags not just gray omgwtf neutrals in the fleetlook how dumb you are
on a related note ive been waiting to join the blood raider convent for 2 years now mmm delicious purified capsuleer blood
the issue with selfdestruct boils down to no killmail being generated make selfdestructs generate a killmail but do not provide insurance or loot drops problem solved
keep all selfdestruct mechanics the same just make it generate a killmail give the killmail to the last person who got the last shot off on the victim before he explodes
boost sdmake it take out all the attacking ships within range
pretty much this insurance should go to zero same as concord kills since self destructing your ship would be frowned at by any sensible insurance companyshould generate killmails yesshould destroy all loot as this is a way to stick it to the aggressors but since you will alos lose your insurance this must be weighed up by the pilotbut most of all it should create a killmail probably to the last shot before the explosion but highest damage would also work
i support this initiative selfdestruct should void insurance destroy all loot and generate a killmail id like to propose a small change the killmail should be earned by the selfdestructor because they just killed themselves everyone else involved would show up via damage done or ewar modulesthen the kill would show up on both the loss and the kill side of the selfdestructor preserving the holy killboard stats of their corp and on the kill side of the tackling corps killboard adding to the tacklers iskdestroyed generating epeen lols and more interest in small gang pvp
sd should either take much longer for capitals or generate a km if theyre aggressed or both
repost with improvements from the old forums features  ideas discussionas we know an instant wow style respec is bad and generally unwanted here in eve heres where i come with much more balanced ideaan skills unlearning queue similar to normal train over time feature but working backwardshow it worksyou set the skill you dont want to see anymore and then it goes from max to the zero over time lvl5lvl4lvl3 giving all unlearned sp to your sp redistribution pool the same sp pool as from missing learning skillswhats the point thenit would have to be able to work along with normal skills training dual queue one skill learning and one unlearning at timeskillbooks wouldnt be given back they are all lost riskreward wait wheres my punishment everything in eve should have punishment and consequences lets see what we can do heresp unlearning speed would be based on 1717171717 attributes or your lowest attributesome would say its still unfair to unlearn an unnecessary skills at the lowest possible speed for a whole yearhere it comes another harsh penalty eve players loves them nountrainable total sp would be capped on 13m sp adjustablesaid cap would reset annually like neural remapan unlearned sp pool would be capped on 1 million or less to prevent sp stockpiling proswith untraining being based on time we wouldnt be able to respec to the new fotm instantly with untraining limited to 23m sp per year we wouldnt be able to respec to new fotms at allwe wouldnt be able to instantly respec our alts then flood character market with themwe would be able to correct our mistakes and clean out our skill sheet a littleenough penalties to satisfy every masochistic eve playermy respec idea is well thought out and better than others consfind one
absolutely not any skill training should be permanent short of being podded in an insufficient clone skill respecs in any form would take away from that even with a hard limit of a few million sp per year thats a substantial amount of reversible skill training its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
sorry but no trained skills have to be removed by ccp only still sad that they removed learning skillslosing sp due an insufficient clone is the only normal wayto remove sp but you cannot control it this should not be changedif you dont like a skill dont train it if you realize years later that you trained crap than live with it we all do iti also have skills i do not need but hell i would never remove them it is part of your eve history

by that reasoning wouldnt it be more sensible and easier to keep the current skill system as it is also based on time and has a proven record for preventing intafotmone million sp is still a bit i could use it to get racial frigates 5 and max out most of the weapon skills needed for it two to three million sp can get you two racial battleship skills to 5 people would keep the sp pools in limbo until a new fotm comes out no such thing as a mistake when it comes to skills the skills you trained before were relevant at the time you trained them otherwise would wouldnt have trained them at allfor disclosure i trained my character here as a minerindustrialist when i first started playing the game and have well over 1 million sp in all the skills related to those areas i have not used those skills in over 2 years i refocused my efforts on pvp but you never know one day i might want to use a battlehulk or i find myself in the position of having to manually movecollect bargesindustrials from a pos because no one has a carrierorca nearby or maybe i stumble upon a grav site that contains something worthwhile to mine dark ochre ftw etcnot really no your sp pool is too large and still allows for instatraining
well finally some constructive criticism an answers like no because no really makes me lose hope in humanity retrainable sp cap could ofcourse be adjusted accordingly i said 23m it can either be 1m if it sounds more fair to you or can be adjusted on fly basing on lets say total sp the more sp you have the less you can relocate newbie friendlyalso dont say these 23m or even 1m is much compared to racial carrier which is x14 multiplier that gives 36m sp at level 5 its the bright side of this idea you and especially new players can respec their x1 skills and other little mistakes while fotm roller carrier pilot cant remove his high sp skills for next few yearsan size of such storage pool could be also capped and adjusted so players cant store unlimited amount of sp good catchabout mistakes yeah for some people it doesnt make much of problem but some players cant simply stand having mining iv or industry v on their sheets it would only help one group of players without hurting the other winwin no
you successfully salvage from the goonswarm shiptoast wreckmissions where the completion requirement is an exhumer killmail would be both fun and hilariousroaming sleeperai rats that dont show up in local would just be funny
eve is one of the few games that punishes customers for being longtime subscribers thanks to its unflexible jumpclone systemit discourages higher sp characters to take part in eg nullsec t1 frigate roams because depending on clone requirements losing the implantless clone alone costs 3040 times as much as losing the entire shipso heres the proposal  players get to chose a main medical clone that retains all current skills plus the one that was in training whn he was podded in a different jumpclone if they decide to pvp in their main medical clone and its not fully upgraded people lose their sp just as they used to when installing a jumpclone a player can chose any clone type from alpha to omega and the move the desired skills including their prerequisites into that clone up to the chosen limit or beyond that  but sp exceeding thetype of jumpclone wont be retained when getting podded once a player gets podded the jumpclone is destroyed and players need to create a new one in that slot players get to chose which clone they get transferred to once a jumpclone is destroyed so it doesnt necessarily have to be the main medical cloneyou know morons
your own reluctance to get podded is what discourages you embrace your own firey death and its all fineand just fly an assault frig or something instead a wolf is just a bigger rifter after all or an eaf if you dont want to overshadow rifter newbies
the opposite is the case  i have no issue with getting podded  as a matter of fact i actually wait around in my pod with my lower sp alts if the enemy gang doesnt immediately go for my pod or self destruct the pod to travel home fasteri just dont see why i have to pay more for being a longtime subscriber just because back in 2003 ccp thought that high sp  richyou know morons
could this issue not be solved by creating a specific weapon system for each class of titan that can do significant damage to large objects but do nearly no damage or perhaps none at all to sub capitals something that does not take tracking into account in the fashion of turrets but instead in a way similar to missiles this could be a nice idea although it would mean more work for the art department what it would do is even out the damage profiles of titans making the levi not useless in combat and also if it was done in this way would maybe have a skill based damage multiplier that cannot be modified by damage mods but rather have its own unique damage and maybe specific fuelammo type than can be changed to select ranged ammo or shorter ranged ammo etc like other weapons just an idea that the above post made me brainstorm on
i like the fuel bay idea betteri could see a skill loss like blowing up in a t3 but no ejecting from the ship is too brutal yes yesthis sounds annoyingi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
yesalso let me put more than 5 quotes in a forum commenti honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
fix eve ban goonswarm
tinfoil and greed thread only hilmar should feel so sad over not getting everything he wanted
quite simple this many other websites have such a feature it doesnt make much sense to not have it here all you really have at the moment is likes only which can be misrepresentative if in reality the poster in question supplies a lot of comments that deserve the negative slap on the wrist that comes with it were not just talking csm elections here it can also apply to fitting advice for newbies lame attempts to troll the community the list is endless to only focus on the positive aspects of a reputation system given the nature of the game itself is a massive tragedy that needs to be put rightan example of a dislike button in actioni await your thoughts if any
there is a dislike button if you feel that a post violates the rules of the forums feel free to flag it its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
thats for crybabies and actual rules being broken im talking about a properly representative social status system and the more i see a lack of dislike button the more i think facebook
pvp corps run out of locations real quick would boosting this number really present a massive server load would be nice to not be limited so much having say 500 or 1000 limit nearer to the characters limit iirc i think would be better
i have noticed that for those who have corps using the markets with various people that you cant see what the market totals are in the corp wallet information in the way that a chracter can if they are looking at their own wallet so im sugessting here the addition of a section in that tab which displays the same market totals total isk in escrow buyorders value total sellorders total etc for the selected wallet divisionopinions
all your terrible idea would do is make it take two people to do this  one guy lights the cyno the other one blaps him
can we get some more love for this idea i think we canis there a dev or csm member in the housei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
bump this needs some more support
i support this idea 1
wh stabilizers are the worst idea ever i live in a wh for more than 2 years now all wh people that i know and that ive talked to agree thatwh stabs will destroy wormhole game play we dont want oo space without local there are many ways to improve whs the wh stabs one is a fail cmss that suggested that i hope your idea wont get any support
you know youve arrived when mintrolio shows up
 this is why i made an alt to pvp in losec its a pain but its working as intended ccp please listen to op who said that noob ships suck
friendly bump to the name changing cause
takeshi yamato wroteaggressive nutmeg wrotei would implement name changes like this name changes cost 10000000 isk or some appropriate fee name changes can only be done once every 12 months like an attributes remap history of name changes remains in player info like corporation history a players name history can be searched by other players for 10000000 isk via the current ingame search agents players applying to a corporation would be asked to give the corporation 10 mil isk for the background check that wouldnt be good for the gamethe rest is reasonable some extra isk sinks as small as they may be are goodwhy exactly wouldnt that be good for the game this already exists as it is a lot of nullsec alliances require an up front payment in isk to deter spiesi would actually set the name change cost a lot higher to prevent people from changing names all the time seriouslya billion isk and no i am not kidding name changing would be a nice option but it should not be easy to do daily besidesif you were on crack when you made your character and dont like the nameit should cost for a name change

it should be made clear that katalci was unable to make an argument of his own without deliberately misquoting the content of another i object to being maliciously misquoted and distance myself from any association with the assertions being made by katalcit
i dont like this however i do support plex for sp reallocation the question then would be whether if the sp reallocation provides any significant ingame advantage rather than convenience can the vets comment on that who said that noob ships suck
i support this no plex for remapedit i am also against plex for sp reallocation you trained the skills for a reason once so you had your benefit you made a decission that you want themand now please live with it we all have to and i am proud of every single sp i have yes also for exhumer 5 which i havent used for years
goddamn your inability to read wtf cant people see that this is suggested over and over it will be no every single time no plex for sp for remaps for reallocations of sp for sp catchup any of that bullshit
while i think that the current tutorial is working fine  it still needs a lot of work to help facilitate the npe one section that i love about the tutorial is the tutorial is now done now go join a player corp the section that i hate is that it stops at showing the newbie where to get into a suitable newbie corp perhaps an idea worth talking about is allowing large player corps opt into a corps you should join list at the end of the tutorial page granted we can control and regulate the quality of the corp opted into this list by having likedislike button that the player base uses next to the corp info all ccp has to do is limit the slots allowed into the newbie corp list and provide a platform for player corps to applyresign from their position a programmable script should be able to do that playerbase regulates the quality and when the corp hits a certain ratio of dislikes its automatically dropped from the newbie corp list i havent been long enough to be able to come up with a concept based on vetstatus experience just thinking out loud without much reconsidering could be a bad idea for all i know gotta go to work soon after this what do you guys think who said that noob ships suck
this right here says a lot if the effort youre willing to put into something stops below finding the correct spelling of unparalleled then youre going to struggle with a game like eve that gives you freedom to do so much and all it requires is taking a little bit of time to find stuff outim the first to agree that the npe is harsh ive even compared it to the rugby match in the meaning of life but if youre not going to put in any effort to engage with the content then changing the game to suit you will remove a lot of the charm that eve has  losing established existing players to attract new imaginary ones
im afraid the fault is yours for telling him all that he can do is mission and mine i agree that he should complete all the tutorial missions including knowing how to mineuse a buddy invite to start a new account and get yourself a 51 day free alt train up a new character alongside him and do stuff with him on his level of course he feels like a fifth wheel if hes sitting in a kestrel watching you blap stuff with your tengu within a few days a week at the absolute most he can be flying a useful t1 frigate going out and having some fun buy a couple of dozen t1fit frigates for the pair of you and try a few consensual pvp frigate fights within corp if there are some other very new players who can join in so much the better so he gets an idea of the basics then graduate to messing about in losec or even maybe a bit of suicide ganking it sounds like your friend is keen to play but he just needs letting off the leash youve with the best of intentions put around his neckedit i started off with 60k sp and no learning skills your friend starts off with 60k sp and the equivalent of all learning skills to v hes skilling at double speed compared to what i was at that stage actually more than double when you take remaps into account hell make it if he wants to if he doesnt it wont be skill training that makes him fail but people telling him the skills hes trained are meaningless
hoping to draw some csm input to a thread i made in features  ideas i will paste some of the content here for a quick referencethread
i see the point in this but if you are gone that long to make a difference why not simply leave the corp ask the fleet boss to make a fleet advert for corp mate and rejoin when you are done eating or doing other stuff
um join the afk squad or just type afk in fleet chat problem solved
why not the idea is quite simple in implementation
i disagree on making it fun for the fc i believe it should be a necessity for the fc to have those tools available to him maybe even a tactical overlay star chart with real time showing of red and blues 1 support
thanks to all for wonderful responses some really great ideas have been brought forth in this discussion and it is apparent that all are in agreement that at a minimum a ship that selfdestructs during combat should generate a killmail to those responsible for his cowardly actioni never thought about the loot or the area of effect damage from the selfdestruct so thanks for bringing that up would love to see some more discussion on those
self destruct sequence should immediately offline all modules crew complements are gtfoing and they were running all the modules so it makes a lot of sense imo any aggression either way before the sequence was initiated should mean it is posted as a killmail as wella ship that succesfully completes the sd sequence before it is otherwise destroyed should maybe drop no loot perhaps with increased salvage otherwise with the killmail change noone is going to do it without some little bonus grief element to doing itlittle crew escape pods coming out would be sweet as well
now that ive pondered the loot dropping some more a pilot selfdestructing his ship would mean his attempt to deny loot for his opponent however this attempt should not be 100 effective a small chance of some module drops is more realistictake for instance the reallife use of incendiary devices to deny enemy equipment intelligence or technology when the us navy seal team vi executed its raid on osama bin laden in pakistan a stealth helicopter crashed before extracting the seal team used incendiary explosives to destroy the remaining parts of the helicopter however the tail section remained in tact thereby providing the opportunity for reverse engineering of parts of that stealth helicopterso its seems to me that loot denial ingame should be chance based although less chance than normal kills
no dual traininguntraining and no sp pool  skills are just untrained and thats it  gone  no refunds then id be fine with ityou know morons
no
yeahi already proposed pretty much this exact same idea and got flamed to hell for it i still think ccp is going to do an sp respec of some sort and this idea is better than no idea and letting them  it up if there were to be an sp respec then this is how i would want to see it done preferably i dont want any respec at all but i recognize that i am the minority in this desire and the average player being the majority wants something like this ccp wants to make the barrier to entry to eve a little less daunting to increase subs and retain more new subs that being said i would not rage quit like a little girl on the rag if they did implement something like this
you people dont know how to read seriouslygo back to schooland learn to read nofor the millionth billionth timestop being dense for onceif you cant learn to live with your choicesthen please quit the game and biomass your toon because we dont care about your tearful whines anymore stop the evemail spam
this stop  posting about sp reallocations purchasing remaps or sp sp catchup for not being active for a while its all bullshit and wont happen as it would be gamewrecking in eve get the  over the bad decisions you made learn that actionschoices have consequences and stfu
you got that op you are not allowed to have your own opinions or desire to make changes that dont fall directly in line with what everybody else wants because drake and tidurious said so there have been a few other threads on this already all of which the same people have gone ape  crazy in because they refuse to accept that other people want things they dont approve of dont worrythey will be the ones eating crow when ccp eventually makes a change with sp refunds
maybe if you turned your brain on long enough to comprehend youd understandyour entitled to your opinion allrightyour also entitled to get called out for your stupidity as wellyou knew that the moment you started spouting half the crap you poststart doing your research on these subjects and stop spitballing crap for once peoplesome of us have seen the same damn idea every damn week every bloody time and they are given the same damn answer every bloody timemaybe if you bothered to listen first and speak later youd get itccp can do what they want they wantbut they will certainly not be listening to you thats for sureor the opthey listen to the majority of the people who paly this gameand anyone who thinks they can make these stupid ideas based on threats of subscription base quitting maybe you should actually talk to these said subscribers for once never assume everyone is just gonna die with glee and complete joy over your ideasstart acceptnig the fact that maybe 1 in 1001 in a 1000 will workand just maybe youll get somewherei have little mercy or paitence for reposted ideasi expect the same treatment of myself if i did soand already have recevied such treatment stop the evemail spam
in eve a single player can sell an item on the market it is only required for him to have the following item and to make a sell order now image your corporation most corp in eve are small but some good corporation can have a medium of 100 to 200 players and some even goes up to thousands now what is the main goal of a corporation on my personnal opinion it is a group of individual sharing a similar opinion and that wishes to help each other you can ask much veterans they will tell you a good corp need good trust between the playersnow that i have made an introduction to the subject lets head onwhat if eve would allow any given role or rank player to place items into a specific corp hangar slot and give each item a pricea skill book that you would buy on market at 1000000 isk could be processed by your corp for half the price and then sold on that sub market at 500000 isk a cruiser that could cost around 20000000 isk can be processed by the corporation for much less and then resold to 7000000 iskof course theses prices are false i do not know the exact pricesusing this tool it can allow the corp to sell their manufactured product at a cheaper price inside their very own corporationnow come of you might think it is up to the corporation to make a system and distribute theses items throught out their members first on a corporation that as over 100 members it becomes difficult for the directors to coordonate everything and make it a fair price second if a corp is realy small then it becomes even harder for the director to distribute their items as many players wont be connected at the same time for the same amount of timean other scenario would be a corp mate to buy everything at a cheaper price and then resell it on the market for a bigger price of course it is up to the corporation to controle their members and as i said above trust is the most imporant part of a corporationalso other might think corporation will stop selling their items on the general market and only place the loots into their corp submarket as it will benefict their corp and them at the same time first i believe that it is not true the main way of making profit into eve is my trading items for isk it is the base of the system if an american buys something at is local shop lets say he buys for 20 how much does the us make profit 0 but if an european goes to the us for vacation and buy for 20 the country make 20 profit as this money was not shared between them but brought from an other sourcethe way i see it the only way of making corp profit is by taking players item and selling it to other members of other corpi hope you didnt falled at sleep while reading this and i give you my apologies for my bad english as french is my first languagetell me what you think
lol only if i can have goon agents in my hisec npc stations that direct me to destroy the evil mackinaws ice mining in abudban and give me a 30m payout for each km 
if you are using tech 1 frigs use a low sp altor no implants
besides this proposal having nothing to do with implants at all thats what i do just started my fourth pvp alt because they end up with too many sp sold my main 4 years ago because of it well  you know first mains  they end up too unfocused and now the other two are 20 and 30 millpod without implants againanyway  thats not the point  the point is that other companies tend to reward longtime subscribers whereas ccp decided to punish them insteadkeeping a mainmedclone as a kind of skill library and tayloring some clones for specific needs by picking from that library would resolve that issueyou know morons
you of all people should know betterif you cant afford to fly what your flyingyou have no business flying it in the first placeits so easy to get that kind of isk these days if your not getting ityour doing it wrong stop the evemail spam
with this communitys attitude this game is gonna sit with its poor subscription numbers for another 10 years i dont get it why the same few people keeps spamming and criticizing every single idea posted on the forums while not contributing anything themselves whats the fking pointback on topic i like this idea i for one wouldnt ever pvp with my high sp main purely because of clone size its pointless mechanics that doesnt add anything to the game
yupeverybody in this thread except you and sephiroth is in my block list and for good reason obviously it isnt a bad idea though lco is correct in that high sp players are less likely to take out smaller ships simply for the fact that they are killed easier which means being podded easier which means paying a crapton of money for a new clone because you flew a cheap ass ship i kind of agree with the op on this one i am just not sure this is the correct approach
poor subscription numbers where the hell do you people get this crap stop the evemail spam
why not just lower the cost
it would reduce the isk sink that clones create which is why i am kind of hesitant to say a change should be made on one hand it would encourage more pvp in a larger variety of shipson the other hand we dont have enough isk sinks as it is and to lessen one that already exists and is working correctly may be a bad idea
like losing ships mods if its not enough than add another oneiteration imo removing barriers like this without unneeded complexity attribute implants etc are a good thing
um jump clones really arent that expensive if you have so many sp that you cant afford to lose the jumpclone than you need to do something to make isk once in a while someone with that many skills shouldnt have a problem making plenty of isk if you are too lazy to run a missionplexincursion once in a while or dont want to because its boring that is your own fault and you need to deal with the consequences sorry but jumpclones are working as intended and you need to change what youre doing a little if you cant afford the clone i mean cmon  the jumpclone that holds 264 million skillpoints only costs 90 million isk to keep 120m sp is about 30m isk youre trying to tell me that your 100m sp toon cant afford 30m when hes podded i call bullshit andor youre lazy y
you dont get it the point is that if theres 264m sp player that fly frigates only he doesnt touch any other ship class but he keept trainining for many years because who wouldnt and there is another 5m sp frigate pilot they fight 5m sp pilot loses and gets podded  he has to pay for new 200k isk ship 264m sp player loses and gets podded  he has to pay for new 200k isk ship  ninety million isk it doesnt make sense
what tekashi saidthe problem isnt that i wouldnt be able to afford jumpclones i dont have that many sp on my pvp alts  sigma and tau clones as denoted earlier making money isnt a problem either yet skills for most money making activities are maxed out at 25 mill sp max maybe except for production  never did that whereas jc cost continues to increase so no matter if someone plays the markets  does pve  mining  a 25 mill sp pilot will do these activities just as efficient as a 100 mill character  yet the 20 mill jc costs 2 mill isk whereas the 100 mill sp clone costs 30 millits more about ccps business conduct rather than about the actual cost all companies i know of reward their longtime customers with premium offers gifts payback points and whatnot whereas ccp punishes them now im not asking for a free limited edition ship for every year of continued subscription or anything i just dont want to be punished for being a longtime subscriber call it a matter of principleand yes  losing an xx million isk clone in a 1 mill isk ship just feels wrongmy proposal may sound unnecessrily complicated but its just to prevent players from  around in cheap clones and then quickly hopping in carriersyou know morons
they could do what they did with fightbombers and make xl turrets just a redressed missile not sure how this would apply with turret support skills though
what they did with fighterbombers is actually the reverse of what im suggesting here dreadnought guns imho can stay as they are but changed to only be fittable to dreadnoughts and battleships for those lol times in abaddons w citadel torpswhat im thinking is something like this1 weapon uses same physycal mechanic that missiles use2 weapon has a graphic of its own eg the ragnarok could maybe fire a small group of missiles and the avatar some kind of laser weapon etc3 weapon has its own required skill and a change to the titans turret bonus to the new weapon would affect its damage etc4 weapon would require its own unique charges enabling the pilot to choose a short range danage ammo or a long range lower damage ammo enabling the pilot versatility in damage selection etc5 weapon would not be affected by damage mods it would be its own type with its damage modified by the above propetiesthats sorta what im thinking might be an idea to solve it titans wouldnt be able to omgwtfbbq subcaps as much as now because they totally ignore tracking entierly but they would be able to deal damage against their true intended target types also if this change is also paired with a change to supers to achieve a similar effect they also would need to have a support fleet this would possibly be a soloution to the supercap blob vs everything issue
do what you want with titans just leave dreads alone dreads are disadvantaged against titans in they are required to be in siege module to do any significant damagebeing in siegenerfs tracking by 50cant move jump or warp for 5 minutescant receive rr or other assistance for 5 minutesmust rely on active tanking to stay alive which scales horribly as numbers increasecan only lock 23 targetshas a 7075 reduction to scan res which makes it so that it takes 40 seconds to lock a battleships 2 minutes to lock a cruisers frigates take an eternity has trouble hitting orbiting capitals and supercapitals supercapitals cannot be webbed or painted very vulnerable to neutingcan be one shot by doomsdayspenalizing xl guns will hurt dreads even moreproblem with supercapsa great problem with the supercapitals is their ewar immunity that does not require crippling penalties of not being able to receive rr or being stuck and committed to the fight like the capital ships are another problem is that they have the ehp of pos towers combined with the ability to receive rr while retaining great firepowersolutioneither make titans unable to lock subcaps or make all supercapital ships vulnerable to ewar in order to be invulnerable they must use a siege type modules that gives them immunity to ewar at the cost of not being able to receive any rr or remote assistance and also being unable to warp jump or move for 510 minutes
well if they behave physically like missiles then the avatar is going to have to shoot those star wars lasers that are 2 feet long and travel at 30mph terrible ideabetter ideai honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
let me get this straight so you propose tin foil hats i dont understand the op
lol ok ok lets see ive been accused of tinfoilhattery greed and being incomprehensible its no wonder the devs never read these threads they always seem to degenerate into chestthumping forum pvp boringthe only point being made here is this if devs decide to play on tranquility they should play by the same rules as the rest of us its that simple it didnt happen in this case and i dont think thats rightt
yes they do play by the same rules when they go on tq with their player characters everything in the game every ship everything in your hangars is considered ccps property by the eula and as such they can take away things like enigmas that drop from dev ships its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i know a lot of people dont read any rules but let me highlight the part of the rule people agree to when playing eve which can easy be usedccp may find it necessary on occasion to make changes to or reset certain parameters of the persistent game world mechanics interface or features of eve online in order to maintain game balance and enhance playability or performance for its subscribers these changes may affect or cause setbacks for the characters youUFFFDve created to take it even further i could petition several people who replied in this thread under tos rule 1you may not abuse harass or threaten another player or authorized representative of ccp including customer service personnel and volunteers this includes but is not limited to petitioning with false information in an attempt to gain from it or have someone else suffer from it sending excessive emails evemails or petitions obstructing ccp employees from doing their jobs refusal to follow the instructions of a ccp employee or implying favoritism by a ccp employee i am fairly sure i can make a case in regards to the underlined parts of that rule
its no wonder people are actually stupiddense enough to post this  on the forums expecting the csm to do anything about it when they know for a fact they wontoh wat stop the evemail spam
i dont think its unreasonable to expect the player reprsentatitive to  er repsensent the players interests if they cant  or wont then the whole concept of the csm is at issue here if pl raiden or shadow were able unlike all other players to delete undesireable losses because they didnt like what dropped then people would object my only point here is that ccp should play according to the same rules as everyone else if they decide to play on tq thats all t
except that that particular dev was in a ship that is commonly known as the bughuntercockroach ship and was most likely looking for andor monitoring a problem on tq no one is supposed to see this ship much less kill it
i dont support a dislike button on the forums themselves as a whole i think that it would just lead to flames and trolls however what i would support would be a supported and a not supported button for the op in every features and ideas discussion and assembly hall thread that would show a better representation of the community support and it would reduce forum clutter with people saying 1 or 1 in each post
i believe dronemining is the issue here search it up on forums i dont nearly know enough to elaborate on the matter who said that noob ships suck
what youre still not getting is that doubling the drops from drones wouldnt do anything at all because pouring the extra minerals from those drops into the market would hurt the mineral market so even though youd be getting twice as much m3 out of it you wouldnt be getting much more if any iskthe core issue here is that drones drop minerals as their primary reward once thats fixed the issue will go away until then though as salazar said either shut up or move somewhere else
all rats drop minerals stop the evemail spam
not all rats drop nothing but minerals though most have bounties and only drop minerals in the form of modules maybe it wasnt as clear as it could have been but my point is that rats dropping minerals as their only form of payout is the issue
well most inc runners dont realize is that if mommy manages to withdraw successfully we all get zero lp which is imo worth more than the iskies well carebears will do what carebears do see iskies and turn into  retards i prefer a nerfing in payout instead of despawning sites when mommy shows fyi mommy shows up in like about 4 hours of running vgswho said that noob ships suck
 this something like corp recruitment ads we see in the corp button who said that noob ships suck
im not a freighter pilot but its still a great idea definitely to get someone else to haul my bss across space for meoh and the tears that would fall if it was ganked d
that would work only when ship maintenance bay will participate in the drop now ships from ship maintenance bay are not dropping into a wreck as well as corporate hangars content when this will be fixed for all ships  carrier orca etc then its time to introduce such thug ships imho
agreed getting smas and corp hangars to drop loot really needs to be done
i think a ship like this should be tier 3 or 4 make it require racial freighter 5it would fill the gap in capital ships between the regular freighters and jump freighters much like the covetor is a step between the retriever and hulk but needs level 5 skillsif it was to be an ore ship it would be cool to have it a tech 2 version of the orca drop it to 1 utility high slot no gang link modules no ore hold minimal cargo hold leave the corp hanger drastically increase the ship maintenance hanger so it can hold 23 battleships no jump drive as there would be no room for it with the expanded ship maintenance hanger and you could customize the tank passive buffer tank or active tank how ever you see fit
for added depth it would be cool if itemsships in the corp hanger or ship maintenance arrays dropped in locked containers that needed to be hacked before being looted it would add some differentiation between regular cargo and give the owner a chance to retrieve the stuff before it gets lootedships though might have to drop as a whole ship as in sitting in space with no pilot as the only ship capable of looting an assembled battleship would be a carrier then the tugfreighter pilot could try to jump into one of the ships that dropped when they get ganked
1i agree with op 100
just getting into lowsec pvp lately and i have to say its real fun but the whole standings hit system really curtails my blood thirst since i live in high sec 1
if it was to be locked at 20 you are essentially making ls pew a 100 consequence free activity which goes against everything real and virtual  drop it to 35 attacked in 07 systems and it would still make rp sense still allow people access to highsec but bar them from polite society read hubs trade laneswould personally want to see concordnavy autoresponse to negatives replaced with killrights transferrals and rat type bounties paid for killing them  the only mechanic limits on negatives in highsec should be inability to use links cloaks and other advanced tactics
my biggest problem with low sec pvp is the use of a vast amount of alts to scout and gather intel risk free toss in the local chat and cloaky t3s and you have a stage set for by far the most risk adverse players that have ever played any game always running at the first sign that one of them might take a round of antimatteranother example of what happens when far too much information is available with no risk for players to use wait what you mean it wont be a 100 risk free gank  that  everyone warp out and get safe now  99 of eve online players
then explain to me how highsec mission griefing or trade channel scamming would be tolerated in polite society
do you think null sec is better if so do you think there is a mechanic that null sec has that makes it betterif you think wormholes are better for pvp i can only say the actual facts the of amount of pvp per player in wormholes versus low sec proves that is not truemake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i dont think null is better the issue comes down to the fact there is no more unknown when it comes to pvp i am not saying the ops idea is bad i think it has a lot of merit but it will not be enough to get more players to want to come out of high sec movement in this game is by far too easily tracked which forces anyone to join a large entity to have a chance
i dont know who is right overall but in my experience the opposite is true when you have no idea what your up against you bring what you can expecting the worst if you have an idea of what the other guy has you will bring something similar to get a fight moreover i think if people end up leeroying gangs into overwhelming odds because the intel is more difficult to come by they will be less likely to pvp  or even play eve  in the future if people dont know what they are getting into the fights will tend to be more lopsided not less my experience is in faction war so ymmv i think because faction wars main draw is the good fights there are more people who are of that mindset of course if your running up against pirates who are actually trying to make isk from pvp they wont have this same mindset make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
there is a rather big difference between tricking money from gullible people scam throwing banana peels in front of people mission grief and then premeditated murder pew while the two former are frowned upon causes some raised eyebrows or a slap on the wrist depending on severity the latter will normally be against the law and involves severe sanctions
we are immortal in eve so there is no murder pew is basically criminal damage to property and arguably there was consent to it when you pressed undock make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
doesnt answer my question why would lowsec combat be frowned upon when highsec combat isnt
ok try can flipping wardec exploiting any form of highsec combat even from a rp prospective lol it doesnt make sense
as a new player that has chosen not to spend my first 6 months or something training skills in highsec i think this is a good idea risk aversion it may be but being new and having stepped into nullsec already put me at a disadvantage UFFFD with which iUFFFDm fine iUFFFDd have quite if i had to play in highsec but i would certainly do more pvp if the free set of 3 i got wasnUFFFDt at risk while isk making with a new char is doable in nullsec its still limited and with the exception of pi dependent on the goodwill of higher sp characters so unless youUFFFDre stupid a certain amount of risk aversion is forced on you which luckily for me do not apply to loosing ships as the alliance provides these for free the way implants enter the game currently also seem a bit opposed to the idea of eve most other things are player produced i like the idea of making learning boosters much like combat boosters theyUFFFDll then be produced by players and drugs seem not too widely used so this would boost a seemingly underused industry aspect of eve if one wants to keep the link to the loyalty points to not deprive mission runners of a ready offset of points make the necessary bpcs available from loyalty stores there is also a whole range of possibilities here for different combinations 3 booster for 7 days 5 for 24h etc
bad ideai always have minimal 3s in have 2 clones one with perc and will and other with int and mem depending on what i train i switch jcgoonies are always yapping howmuch isk they havemake if they cant afford to lose 3s this game isnt for themjust like the saying goesdont fly what you cant afford to losesame applies for implants by heading null sec you also accepted the fact you will get into battle and run the risk to lose your implants now all of a sudden the goons dont want to lose their precious implants anymore
goonies its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
that last quote is a positive claim that you are making do you have a proof that it is true or is what you say self defeatinganyway you can look up the historys of these items yourself i did and there are allot of them sold for allot of isk or you can refuse to see if what you say about reality is true and continue to try to talk out of the wrong hole its your call make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
this part at least i agree withplease do not make a broad assumption about me based on nothing other than the alliance i am in check my alliance history if you would likei have been tossing this idea around among friends and corp mates for more than a year in various similar incarnations i was considering proposing this change long long before we apped to testlike i have stated before if you are going to make a negative post in this thread please give me some valid reasons for your disapproval that focus on the topic
eve is a social game no matter what profession you choose if your not a very social person than your newbie experience wont probably be the best its all about putting yourself out there and taking whatever the game and community serves you as well as being a little patient too
one of the best learning experiences i had was corp combat competitions in all t1 frig fits i would recommend it to everybody who is trying to get people into the actual game as opposed to the games introduction that is pvealso theres nothing wrong with missioning in a tengu while theyre in a frigate so long as theyre doing something useful like webbingkilling frigates etc it gives an introduction to the various roles required in any fleet that often get forgotten when people have skilled up to fly something bigger
enjoying eve is all about being able to set yourself achievable goals in a game like wow the developer provides these for you win an arena season clear the current raid etc in eve you have to no only pick a long term goal but plan every step of the way yourself joining a corporation or alliance can help with a lot of this because now you have someone else setting goals and mapping out how to get there for you im not sure this is something ccp can change without a drastic shift away from the nonlinearity that makes eve unique and i personally dont think they should at the end of the day some people need their hand holding almost completely or they want a game where they dont have to think very hard and thats ok its just eve isnt and shouldnt be that gamegoonwaffe has a 60 day newbie training guide that lets new players mostly ignore skill training while learing how to fulfill various roles in the alliance both personal eg pi and fleet tackling ecm dps however developing it was not trivial and its very strongly tailored to how we operate as an alliance on top of that for some people building their own skill plan is important to them its not really something that ccp can realistically create and keep up to date for every new player so really were back to making it easier for people to find an in game community that can help
theres plenty of stuff newbie can do if they just figure out howother than that those other forum posts were obviously by guys who just simply dont like games like eve99 of time you spin ship in station or do some other trivial stuff or just simply do something else than eve while waiting for something to happen unless youre person who likes to make things happen of course theres very little anyone can do about peoples preferences and mindsetive been dealing a lot with these types who log in go like is anything happening and after 3 seconds they log out i can figure eve is very difficult place for these guys
just imagined how i would break into guristas stations bar with a pack of golden medals on my jacket and a bottle of rum in my hand and take surrounding chicks attention when will ccp implement stations walking pocker games and drunken brawls in a bar anyway im supporting the idea
i do not want to see self destruct removed from the game howeveri do like and support this idea
fully agreeno insurance you broke it you buy iti also think that larget ships should have a longer sd timer jint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
1 eliminate self destruct for ships engaged in combator extend self destruct timer to give time for small gangs to kill them
i would also like to see no self destructstill need to be able to keep the kill yourself as a pod  on a large timer so nobody can scram you and hold you in space for hours with nowhere to go that would be funny however1 support either way though
hmm no self destruct in combat ehfit an interceptor with some nice light weaponry tackle a battleship and get a nice tight orbit going put a single gun on him intermittently until you are sure hes spent all his dronesput a light laser on him and go out to dinner
my petition is getting to the point of absurdity they admit now that i did have a bug but because the bug is at my end and not the server and as a player i obviously used my evil player psychic powers to see into the programmers minds that the bug existed to file a petition about it before it was announced because players are all scheming liars
the gms are not gods they can not just snap their fingers and fix every little thing they need to be skeptical as there are far more petitions from players looking to get something for free than actual valid complaints i have successfully filed and had solved several petitions i have found that if you include as much detail as possible making it easier for them to verify the issue is valid they will respond very quickly if they can not verify that you actually experienced a bug they will be very reluctant in compensating you for it many player here about bugs from friends and file petitions for bugs they never even experienced just trying to a free hand out if the issue cost me something in game i am very reasonable in the compensation i ask for and always stay calm and respectful i have rarely had a petition go for more than a few hours without being resolved if you are having problems i would say it is because you are either not giving them the info they need to confirm the issue or you are being an ass hat and getting your self bumped to the bottom of the list just for your attitudethe system works if you know how to use it and if you use it as intended
this is true but when it takes weeks to get any response whatsoever to something as simple as the entire server crashed and i lost probes because of it id appreciate them back with three paragraphs of details about the situation its a bit out of hand i understand they do get busy but a clearly worded and detailed petition about an obvious issue shouldnt take more than a week to get answered
a friend of mine got a warning from a gm last night concerning can baiting new players because he was doing pvp in a rookie system the thing is he wasnt shooting anyone less than 34 months old one of the guys he fought undocked in a machariel and the gm couldnt tell he wasnt fighting noobs in fact he was shooting all the guys who routinely do can bait noobs
abstractcloning vats are not used frequently and i believe that with a few small changes more people would find them useful and utilize themat presentcurrently there are two shiptypes that can use cloning vats rorquals and titansboth of these ships are sometimes used to install jump clones more so the rorqual however the main issue is that the characters whom jump in will have no implants currently these ships are more used as a method when a character needs another jumpclone not when they are deploying to a new sitethe proposalallow the users to instal either a fresh jumpclone like current or move one of there current jumpclones into the cloning vat from another locationthis can be done two ways one way is to allow an offsite one that you are not currently in to be loaded into the vatoryour current clone gets loaded into the vat forcing you to jumpclone to one of your other clones upon loading the vatexample i have 3 jumpclones a nonimplant pvp cloneb mining implant and 3 setsc 5 empire setoption 1i am currently in jumpclone a my corp wants to deploy in way off npc 00 to do a mining op for the weekend we rendezvous with the rorquals in lowsec after getting an invite to instal a clone i select from a drop down box which clone of all of my clones to select to install i then select b as the installed clonerorquals move to target system and all of us minershaulers jump to rorquals in our mining implant setoption 2i am currently in jumpclone b my corp wants to deploy in way off npc 00 to do a mining op for the weekend we rendezvous with the rorquals in lowsec after getting an invite to instal a clone it asks me if i would like to instal a new clone or current clone i select current clone current clone gets loaded into rorqual and i jumpclone to a or bwe wait 24 hours rorquals move to target system and all of us minershaulers jump to rorquals in our mining implant sethypothetical outcomes of changemore small corps will use this for weekend operationsmore corps will assume the riskrewards of null lowsecpvpers will have more targetsconclusionit would be nice to see more versatility and usefulness out of cloning vats one of these small changes may help pave the way for more corp ops as well as corp bondinganyone have any thoughts of feedbackice

according to stats ccp diagoras recently shared with the community the number of both titans and supercarriers nearly doubled during 2011 whether or not you agree that there are already too many of these ships in game it would be hard for anyone to deny that this kind of growth is not good for the game in the long term 24 years many ideas on how to fix the problem have been tossed around most of them involving rebalancing of hp dps force projection etc while tweaking the numbers could certainly get the job done no one used motherships predominion it would be at the expense of all the current supercap pilots and producers all of whom have a lot invested with that in mind i propose something elseaddendum a brief explanation of the problem as i see itthere are many different ways to look at the current supercap situation and depending on how you do it you will find different problems and in turn propose different solutions in this proposal im not suggesting that the balance of the ships be altered because even though that might solve some problems it also creates a host of new problems player dissatisfaction ship  skill reimbursement etcso assuming current game balance this is the problem as i see it long termsupercap numbers will continue to grow based on current trends as will the size of supercap fleets fielded this eventually leads to a point where the fleet itself represents so much isk that there is nothing in the game worth risking it for you may not think that point has been reached but assuming supercap numbers continue to grow that point will be reached eventually the situation you have then is that whoever can field more supercaps wins this is fine but they will do so without a proper fight whoever has less supercaps would be a fool to committ them to a fight especially with new logoffski mechanics and tidiless fights  less fun you wont see anything like the cap fight in 3ii think there are signs that weve already reached this point several entities folding rather than committing their supers but even if you disagree its only a matter of time if nothing is done there will eventually be fleets of 1000 supercaps if you dont believe me you dont know what eve players are like at that point you can be sure that there wont be any super vs super fights only ganksproposalremove all titan and supercarrier bpos from the gamerefund current bpo owners with the npc priceintroduce extremely limited bpc drops from fw complexesinfiction justificationsupercaps are weapons of mass destruction and the empires do not want individual capsuleers to wield such power therefore the blueprints can only be obtained through theft from military complexesintended consequencessupercaps will start dying at a rate higher than the rate at which they can be replaced over time this will lead to more reasonable supercap numbers alternatively supercaps will be used much less in which case their presence in the game is less of a problemside effects1 prices of supercaps on the market will increase significantly2 nullsec entities without a supercap fleet will no longer be able to build one that can rival existing entities fleets3 its artificially limiting the sandboxi dont have a problem with 1 but i could see a lot of people being concerned with 2 however entities that dont have supercaps today wont be worse off if this change were implemented over night in the long term i think they would be better off with this change as the supercap fleets in the game will diminish in size currently its almost impossible for a supercap thin entity to catch up in the arms race anyway with this change they would be able to whittle away at enemy supercap numbersas for 3 it is but we as players are ruining our own fun and need some reining in
the idea is not to remove them but to prevent limitless growthccp would set the bpc drop rates not i
it must be a really good idea if you cant attack the idea and have to attack the player instead
the problem is that there isnt really much of any idea to attack it boils down to i hear this is badi dont like this so it should be made extremely rare its lacking most of the basic parts of a proposal namelywhat is the issue that needs to be fixed how would this fix the issue and why is this the best possible solutionand all of those points require strong backing not just tossing it out there for instance the backing for the ops description of the problem is it would be hard for anyone to deny that this kind of growth is not good for the game in the long term with no supporting evidence at all if you cant find a strong reason for a change then you shouldnt post it in the first place
the only part missing is the explanation of why supercaps proliferation is a problemapart from that the op shouldnt need to defend themselves from pointless arguments such as you are in an npc corp therefore your argument is invalid bringing in supercaps pilots to explain why this proposal wont work is like bringing in some nano pilots to explain why nerfing ship speeds would be a bad ideathis proposal only needs to explain why supercaps proliferation is bad what is the problem why does it need to be fixedin the meantime the adhominem attack are helping keep this proposal in the public eye
mate my jf didnt get hotdropped i just said it wasnt relevant fyi i used to fly with probably the most infamous jf hotdropper ever and ive helped kill a couple still you just dont get it this is not about me its not about you either with your 0 kills on evekill id say you and me seem to be on pretty even footing
lets flame out every single poster from this forums section so there will be just full blown retards left like drake draconis talking to themselvesthoughtssupercaps are obvious problem if you dont see it or you still need explaination you must be blind or you are just plainly trolling
added an addendum
what is the issue to be fixedtitans can be produced easily enough to field fleets of them beyond the original design considerationshow to fix the issueadd a step to the production process that involves different content than nullsec sovereignty holdingwhy is this the best possible solutiondoes it need to be the absolute best it was obviously the best that the op could come up with and it does provide a nice tie in to bring more interest in what many people consider underutilised fleet wars contentthere was plenty of idea there to discuss but since it pisses in the nullsec sov holders wheaties the poster gets attacked instead
1 ignore drake it makes life easier and cleans up just about every thread you will ever look at frankly i cant tell what he is flaming you about and dont care just block him2 i like the idea limiting how many titans can be produced is a fantastic idea might end up with one powerblock having all of them butthats what guys like pandemic legion are for3 i still think titans should not log off with the pilot make them highly visible at all times so they are a massive risk and very difficult to own and keep alivei support your idea 1

perhaps make clone contracts a durationbased system charge the current amount once a week2weeksmonth for unlimited clone services at the level purchased encourages pvp because theres no additional loss passively discourages passiveness because youre already paying for the clones so might as well use themit does take out any disadvantage to getting podded of course unless you charge the base clone amount for a fresh bodyyeah that you pay for a plain clone every time with the advanced level of skill support as a rolling monthly fee
engjin is right lowering costs of clones is like lowering taxes in real life it seems counterintuitive but the reality is it stimulates more growth in the market area affected lower cost clones mean more people will use original characters to pvp and thus buy even more cloneseven better newer guys wont be so afraid to go out and pew abit themselves making the isk sink even bigger
what would be good is if sec status was tied to the activity of the system if security status went up in over populated areas and went down in areas that arent so much used if something like this happenedit would open up more lownull systems in empire splitting up different parts of highsec and give more pvp opportunitiesplayers that do highsec missioningpvemining would need to keep the highsec systems active to prevent it from changing to lownull also in null sec sov space the same should apply with activity in pvemining bring the sec status up higher to that of lowsec that way players would profit better to spread out more or manage their space better which in turn would cause more conflicts due to the need to move about morethere should be a few constellations set aside for new players that have static sov to let them get to grips with the game however the sov system as a whole should reflect a living breathing universe where the actions of the eve player base should be able to change at the minute everything related to sovereignty is static and dead
bwahahahahahaha ahahah ahahnothe sheer chaos and trolling were putting up on this forum and community is what makes me want to go ahead and cause even more chaos and tears
this the game is turning into a cesspool of asshats and they all seem to congeal in one spot not really all that suprising there are some in every gamejust seem to be a metrick  ton more in eve
the only fix i can see actually working to stop afk cloakers would be to make the modules so they do not auto repeat cycle for this to work cycle times would need to be drastically increased to say 2030 minutes you need to click it to activate and when the cycle is done click again to reactivate  or turn it off and back on when you know you are safe to prevent it from ending a cycle at a bad time increases the logistics of using ships with covert ops cloak and makes it so you can not leave a cloaked alt sitting in a system to disrupt activity without being at least semi atk i agree there should be a large penalty for dieing in a super but this is a little to extremeespecially with the recent super cap nerf and i do not support the no eject idea in fact i support the idea of allowing supers to dock at least in station within there own sovereignty space maybe this should require a super capital docking ring upgrade platform set reducing the other abilities of the outpost in exchange for allowing supers to dock i agree with this idea i would take this one step further in that you can not warp to any point on grid even without a probe lock all you need is a single wreck or space junk near the target which does not take long to appear in any battle this would of course mess up the current mechanics for avoiding gate campsbubbles as you would not be able to warp to a bookmark 250300 off the gate and then warp to the gate if clear these warp bubble avoidance bookmarks would now have to be off grid adding some depth to the logistics of avoiding gate camps and increasing the ability for alliances to defend there sov spacethe only change to loot drops i want to see other than some continued balancing of rare drops that have been inadvertently nerfed with recent changes is the elimination of drone poo mineral drops when a mission runner can bring in more minerals per hour than a miner by just looting the drone drops no wonder why miners have so much trouble making decent isk

i have a lot of sympathy with this last commentgenerally although jack isnt guilty of this because ive come across him and his crew more than once in molden heath the boost low sec threads are written by altspamming gank bears who get a little bored when a gate dries up and decide that l4s need to be moved to lowsec so they can resume the haulermission slaughter they assume will follow jacks proposal is reasonable and wellpresented and so im not surprised hes getting supportmolden heath was always fine in my experience as is placidgenesis and a few other places ive been sure it has its downtimes but theres action there if youre willing to leave bosostigondantem and actually try and do something other than camp 247 the sitesratsmissions in lowsec are okay but if were going to get more commercial traffic from the braver indy player id suggest better oresfor me outlaws yes like myself but ive been on both sides of the pirate divide and will no doubt move once again into  sec at some point need to adopt a more longterm view of lowsec a business plan if you like that comes to regard extortion and protection money as viable activities farm the bears rather than murder them indiscriminately the population goes up other outlaws come to murder your bears you beat them off with a  stick and large neutrons rinse and repeatwhen molden heath had 5thcnmtzem and infod mh was as busy as hisec at times with several wardecs and some great fightsso its as much how we play it as much as ccp make itjacks proposal has some merit but id take the sec hit as low as 5 and make it impossible to pod through hisec after 5
eve needs more frequent quality small scale pvp its not a question of whether low sec is more exciting than null sec they likely both need more pvp its a question of whether eve is more exciting than many other things someone can do with a couple hours of time when the chances are very high that you will spend those couple of hours roaming around with out a single decent fight eve needs work im not sure what the statistics say but it seems like low sec really took a hit when ccp decided to abandon spaceships for a year or so but i dont really know if the population went down overall where i hang out it seems it did make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
all i have to say us duh 1i am a relatively new player 4 mos active 2 mos training before i even playedthe first time i discovered i could not go into lowsec and try and fight some pirates less than 0 sec status without incurring a security status hit i was like huhthat made no sensethis is the only thing keeping me from getting my feet wet in pvp immediatelyi have no desire to be involved in large corps thus most of 00 is out for me i have a small group of rl friends i play with and we are all just biding our time training skills and making the isk we need to get on with the things we really want to doi simply could not believe that a game that had piracy as an entire subculture did not have bounty hunter as wellhaving to get a pod kill to get a bounty is stupid loosing security status for killing pirates is stupid if they want to fix lowsec this is at least a good starti really like the idea though of pirates having bountys on them that you get just for killing their ship and people that hunt pirates get bountys from npc corps both from killing rats and from killing player pirates in their spacei dont consider myself a huge roleplayer but i try and play games similarly to how i live my rl gate camping seems like the lamest activity i could possibly think of doing i want to crash the partys of those that like to crash other peoples partys and it seems like lowsec doesnt want me to play that way therefore i carebare away for now
i had thought that one potential objection to this change would be that the prices of lp store items would fall quite dramatically hurting professional contract traders such as myself however i would be willing to take this hit so that the true splendour of the lp store can be attainedany thoughts
this may fly in the face of most peoples assumptions but a few rl friends and i who play eve came to the conclusion that eve just gives people too many choices and apparently most people hate choice and would rather be strung along like in wow
supportedsuch little things make game better
the reasons that you are complaining about sd is its intended purpose  to deny lootkm self destruct is working as intended the guy who dies is still out a bigass expensive ship for christs sake thats the reason that it is working no reason to change what isnt broken im sorry you lost the kill but you lost it through a tactic that is completely valid and there for that purpose alone
1 to the idea of at least making it more difficult something sort of time depending on the ship size whatever that will actually give the attackers a chance to pop the target before the timer
hmmm disagree with this motion for several reasonsfist this is suppose to be as real as possible to spaceplanet life in the future in every movie show attribute of history that deals with a captain a ship has always had a self destruct application this attribute is meant to do just that give the aggressor no ability to have the kill or the loot i say one should be lucky you dont get hit by the shock wave of a ships explosion in eve online to call something an exploit as i see some of you do is not only false but not factual captains of past history scuttle their ships rather then have the vessel or its cargo fall into enemy hands i say if you dont want a self destruct then we do the below attribute as a simple compromise the captain must push the self destruct button before heshe ship goes into 55 hull if at 50 hull the destruct sequence is deactivated due to the ships computer being shut down you need 5 seconds to activate and go through the motions weapons and other attributes are still working the other side of this coin of getting this feature is an explosion radius ships that explode now can do dps damage the percentage of this damage should be based upon several factors the size of the ship what type of power output it has as well as rigs and modules it is using this to my understanding would be a compromise to the many who wish to have self destruct not working in a combat situation and those who see it as apart of space life and should always be working even though it is apart facts and apart of human history
not supported to fully remove infact its a viable tactic ever watched star trek when old kirk picard and even janeway self destructs rather than let the enemy destroy them well same thing here just because you cant kill it quick enough well thats your problem you havent brought a bigger fleet however there lies your solutionmake the destruction timer longer say 10 minutes instead of 2 voila
indeed the ship is still dead so whats the problem with generating a mail for it all the current mechanic does is obscure history to avoid pilot embarrassment and what is eve but the history the players generate the game is pretty contentfree otherwisealso consider this with self destruct in the game as it is if an enemy engages you they think they have enough force to crush you in less than 120 seconds if self destruct generated a record theyd be much more willing to engage with more even odds and you might actually save that big expensive ship more often
supposedly the gms cant tell the cooridinates of a ship in game but then again i was told my corp mates should have seen the war dec even if i was having a mail bug im in a one person corp
its pretty odd that the one instance in which clone vat bays would legitimately be useful in  wormholes is also the instance theyre specifically banned forthat said i think the best way to make clone vats useful is to have a mechanic for remotely installed clones as above either by installing a new clone to an active clone vat in a fleet or a system to move clones from an outpost perhaps with some suitable outpost upgrade there also has to be a system to jump back again afterward from the clone vat ship to a stationit should also be possible to change medical clone settings at a nearby clone vat even if you cant actually respawn there there are plenty of characters that spend days or weeks away from stations so the ability to remotely upgrade or move their clones would be very useful indeed
i agree that the tier system should be updated a bit they have already changed the ships so tiers doesnt match muchbest example is the cruisers each tier of cruiser has a role but role should be enough define the cruiseramarr cruisers maller the tank ships omen the glass cannon arbitrator the ewar ship augorere the support shipfrigs follow this a bit aswell with a prober ship and an interceptor ship i would like for ccp to primarily define the ships on their roles an augorere doesnt have to have bad slot layoutshpspeed and so forth because its a tier below omen its slot layout should match its role i think it would be perfect for the augorer to have bad sensor strength so easy to jam and adding a weakness instead it should have cpugridcap enough to fit and run 3 or 4 medium cap transfers specifics is not the idea here just conceptfrigs could fulfill these roles scout a probe ship interceptor for tackling dps frig dps is goodbattleships sniper the apoc fits this role nicely cannon armageddon could fill this role brick abbadon should fill this role if its damage bonus was change to a cap bonus no not a suggestion just an ilustrationdestroyers remain antifrigate but battlecruiser i dont really have interresting roles for could be just a tank and a spank kinda like they are nowtanks could also be speed tanks so minmatar remain speedy but with lower hp the phoon would be the minmatar brick in it has a lot of staying power through speedthen ccp could introduce tiers within each role so you could have a 2 apocs one slightly better than the other but also more expensive not the best example but you get the ideahope i got the concept through i know it would require a lot of work but ccp are already halfway there
who wn in branch i guess but who else died without fielding a super even once
im confused as to why these proposals are in assembly hall and not starting in features and ideas where they belong originally assembly hall is for well thought out ideas that have already had a positive reaction in fi
really as any attempt for ccp to limit supply for supers will be met with vehement protests by current super pilotsblocs that require supers to project its power i doubt any changes to limit supply of supers by a significant margin will go through unless ccp suddenly gets a massive pair of balls and just flips super pilots off which would prolly be a bad if amusing move what is more likely is getting a hard counter to supers be it ewar ships that can effect supers or a new t2 subcap with capital guns
fair point
what isk sink thanks to insurance ship losses are one of the worst isk faucetsbut yeah  the overvaluation of sp and the subjective feeling of having to be stuck in a 5 learning clone alienates newbs from pvp however i think that could be solved with limiting clone jump timers to 4 hours instead of 24 otoh training skills was made so easy and quick that removing any learning implants without any replacement would even be betteryou know morons
ok why this problem or i would call exploit hasnt been fixed i have no clue its been a problem for a long time nowbut allowing gcc or aggression pilots to dock up into an orca to completely avoid the gcc or aggression is completely ridiculous people gate camping in alt orcas in low sec with gcc can just dock up in the orca and jump out into highsecpeople can can flip or attack some one if a frig jump in a orca be safe jump back out in a legion or somethingi mean really this should be fixed that if any pilot with gcc or aggression docks up in an orca then the orca should get the same aggression or gcc  i mean jumping in an orca is pretty much the same as aiding like alt repping alt rsb isnt itif a pirate gets alt reppedsebod etc then the person also gets gcc so why dont orcas its completely wrong and to me is a blantant exploit

1 this topic was never intended to discuss whether people should be banned for can baiting in noob systems 8 people out of 20 who posted here are too stupid to read the op that clearly states my only concern was that it should be in the toseula not if it should be bannable so much for eve players being smarter than your average rock 2 almost all games out there put things that you can be banned for in the toseula requiring me to also search for every ccp employees post of which the only realistic method is to use evesearch not a ccp maintained search utility or every page in the wiki at least the eula has an order to it the wiki doesnt even have a site map for me to make sure ive read the entire thing is unrealistic no other game i know of lists bannable offenses in the wiki like ccp does so any player isnt going to expect them to here all that is required is 1 sentence in the tos and a link added that points to the wiki page with a more detailed explanationthe quote above is literally all that is required and puts a pointer to related detailed wiki page
heck granted ive been playing for ages and i never done the tutorial agents so i decided to do so just so i can say i have done it this was less than a week ago some people there warn griefers flippers and everything these certain people just dont care theyd hang around this system with a apocalypse hell i saw someone there with a nightmare once in jouvthey would can flip grief pod kill and sucker newbie players in and when the threats came they would laugh i reckon ccp should make it impossible for pvp item theft or otherwise in these systems but its them that choose how eve works not me of courseone thing that is highly annoying though is the people in rookie systems are one of four categoriesnewbiesgrieferscan flippers baiters pod killers etcpeople who are there solely to do training agentstutorial missionspeople who are there solely to moan at griefers and threaten to place a petition against them
what i really find amuzing is that nobody understood the irony in the ops proposal to begin witheverything else is simply irrelevant
bump for more supporti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i think this is a really good idea although personally id like to see the tug being able to pull any ship that existseither way ive liked the posti know this is cheeky but what the hellat the moment im standing for the csm id be very be happy to raise this idea if i get voted in obviously this is a big if the first stage of this is making the shortlist at the moment im quite a few likes short of the 100 that i need to get onto the ballotif you wanted to help me on my way with a like for my election post id really appreciate the support obviously if other support that you send my way would also be very gratefully receivedive seen things you people wouldnt believe attack ships on fire off the shoulder of orion i watched cbeams glitter in the dark near the tannhauser gate when i die all those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain
i dont think eve is so different that the devs couldnt easily work it in especially with what we have seen from videos of what the carbon engine is designed to do from what i understand what we see with our avatars is only a portion of what the carbon engine can really do

if you just smash the hull you merely smash the hull youre not terminating the player which presumably is what who places the bounty is after i agree that antipiratesvigilantes losing sec in the process of offing some horrible scoundrel sounds daft but the issue you have is defining in way the game can recognise in its coding exactly who is the pirate and who is the victimvigilante in a fight half the time when i was wearing my vigilante boots i had a lower secstat than the pirates i was having a go at and equally when i was a pirate i often had a better secstat than some of the guys in em and others who came to kill meas an antipirate id often fire first so its not as simple as aggression eitherjacks suggestion is a simple one although we can argue about the details of when outlaw status kicks in and exactly how much sec you should lose in lowsec when hullpopping its worth ccp having a look at and finessing a little i think
supportedsomething must be done with bounty hunting op idea is not bad at all
well its kinda fixed now i can see the names for the ones i have already as long as i am in that stationbut contracts and assets still just read as genericsclose but no cigar
i would also like to see more done with the lp redemption
hm such as i admit im new to the game but it very much seems that i can make considerably more isk by highsec missioning or mining veldspar than by taking a long flight out to nullsec and well losing ships of course thats partly a function of low skill i suppose as my sps rise and i become a more combatcapable pilot ill be able to look for a much more rewarding activity carrying with it commensurately increased risk its a shame that incursions dont spawn in highseci dont understand if the cooldown on jump clones is nerfed that low when will i ever risk my implants it sounds like youre also saying you want to remove all risk of losing them
implants have never been a problem for me when it comes to pvp but i see the point youre making in the thread and i support their removal i think this could lead to more mayhem and thats all that matters to me
the problem with that solution is that reality doesnt work the way you think it works its noob unfriedly and doesnt solve the issues why noob unfriendly skill is seen by new players as mandatory before doing pvp so it has to be trained if you want to pvp youre putting up new barriers to get people to pvp when your goal is to bring them down it takes a little under a week at best case just to be of real use thats a week of valuable training time thrown down a pointless time sink during a critical time in a new players career when he is unsure if he wants to sub to the game and just wants to be able to train skills to fly more ships and pew pew why is teleporting or galaxy hopping bad well it makes logistics and world travel increasingly pointless diminishing the dynamics of the game and it makes force projection easier its the one feature this game doesnt need more of and im opposed to any changes that make teleporting around any more convenient or fastermore importantly your solution doesnt address the actual issue and your objection to addressing it is misguided you want to say its risk avoidance instead of mititagtion and therefore it shouldnt be encouraged thats just stupid but i see what youre getting at youre saying they would never risk those expensive implants when there is a high risk of losing them so if given the option they would never fly them to pvp youre right which is why your idea sucks balls they are never going to risk them in pvp you either allow them to choose an acceptable risk level and go pew pew or they wont pew pew at all if your solution doesnt allow them to change to a clone with less expensive implants they arent going to play either way those implants arent going to be put at risk and you cant force this issue all you have to and can decide is which system is better a system where people wanting to pvp dont because youre preventing them to lowermanage the risks they have take based on an arbitrary timer or a system where they have the same exact options to manage it but without unnecessary timers to interfere and could pvp every time they wanted tomy view is simply that the limits to the teleportation needs to stay but in all other cases the clone jump timer is a detriment to the gameplay and needs to go away also the more conveneint access people would have to jump clones the better that is why i would prefer them to be some kind of market items instead of hidden behind a standings grind barierim not a fan of this idea it just changes one mandatory thing for another and doesnt solve the same issue that pops up with hardwirings learning implants cost less on my clone than the hardwire implants ive got so it doenst do anything for me it just makes the system more annoying since ive got to keep popping drugs constantly so pointless busywork and isk grind to keep up your training speeds and again doesnt really address the issue of expensive implant losses
and it doesnt address the issue with other slots which can be much more expensive to lose the fundamental point remains if the cost of loss is too high for my wallet im not taking the risk its the first rule in eve dont risk what you cant afford to lose its a good rule in place for a good reason replace learning implants with job implants is pointless what does it change youre going to need them to be competative so every noob doing that profession will be encouraged to get them making them feel mandatory again so everyone will get them leading to a situation where people dont want to go out and fight because they dont want to risk their mandatory implants that in most cases are useless in pvp anyway hello point where we started from glad to see you againwhile this would get slightly more people to pvp it misses the point once again and introduces a massive isk faucet to the game already suffering from too many of them insurance is a massive isk faucet in this game implants dont cost nearly as much isk often non at all as you would get from losing them their market prices can be counted in the hundreds of millions per implant so losing your pod would turn from a minor isk sink to a huge isk fauset and for what knocking of the top few bricks of the walli can only answer this from my perspective but i wouldnt be any more willing to risk my expensive clones in combat even with insurance it simply doesnt cover the loss in any meaningful way and i wouldnt want it to try because of the isk faucet it would cause the simple fact remains im the one who chooses what kind of risk im taking and that isnt going to change no matter what either you change the mechanic so that i can easily do that when there is pvp action about or you accept the fact im not participating if im in a nonpvp clone at the time i would like to participate even during those times but with how things are now i cant afford to chance it and consequently wont chance it
one could just as readily use all the arguments for the removal of the learning implants from the game as reason to instead make them indestructible so that you retain them even after poddingi say leave it as it is if folks want to shy away from a roam because their implants mean more to them than actually playing the game then thats their loss or is this just an emo whine thread because no one likes andski enough to come out and play with him
im not sure what you are saying wastes a week training infomorph psychology assuming the worstcase scenario that every new player suddenly sees ip as mandatory to iv to train a cooldown reduction skill it takes around a day to get it to level iv w base stats i dont think that this will happen as infomorph psychology is useless to new uncorpd players no reps at 8 or above as i said this idea wasnt really intended to benefit new playerssure you can if the only available implants are only useful while undocked players will either a not buy them or b be forced to risk them by undocking some players will choose not to buy them thats neither a flaw with the suggestion nor a fault on their part the problem is that learning implants are predominately useful while docked im sorry what what is the distinction between the two thingsagain im sorry but what people risk actually mandatory equipment all the time  namely their ships i think you are under a mistaken impression here i did not suggest that profession implants would get people into pvp i suggested that they would get them to engage in risk eve is not a tournament game like dust probably will be or like league of legends or team fortress are pvp happens opportunistically not necessarilyperhaps what you mean to say is that the benefits of such implants should encourage players to explore low and null sec systems rather than staying exclusively in highsec  for instance by offering them benefits to mining lowsec minerals or making it faster to get to and easier to handle lowsec missions yeah thats fine although to be honest i think the first goal is really just to get players to move between systems at all rather than camping in a single 10 or 09 somewhere
i would add to motherships that they do not have drones fighters or fighter bombers but have a huge ship maintenance array that can hold a large number of sub caps including battleship hulls like a super super carrier only without the drones the drones would be the other pilots ships docking in the maintenance arraythis could even be expanded where players can actually dock inside the mothership and sit in a pilots lounge while the mothership jumps to the staging area so they go with there ship for the ride rather than the current mechanics of docking your ship and being left outside in your pod
i think one issue is the shortness of the free trials i think it takes more than 14 or 21 days for most people to get into eve enough to want to stay unless perhaps you have a good mentor its certainly too short a time to be able to finance yourself by paying with plex how about a noob plex which allows a single 30day extension for say 25 or 50m isk but still leaves you in trial status
one could always leave fleet until they return
a suggestion would be have the km always generated and obviously assigned to the highest damage dealer excluding the pilot of the selfdestructed ship itselfno insurance obviouslyprobability of destroying all fittings with the probability being proportional to the remaining hp of the ship so at 100 health youre guaranteed complete destruction at 10 only 10 chance of each module being destroyed in the blast think of it as damaged charges failing to blow if the rpers need a reasonhave a smartbomb style albeit untyped damage since its an entire ship going up blast with the radius based upon the ship size and the damage based upon total remaining hpi like the idea of flyingsuffering a fleet of overtanked ships whose only action in combat is to swarm the opposing fleets most valuable ships and destroy them using self destruct blastsi would worry about the impact of such upon the usefulness of short rangehigh damage weapons though
i totally understand where you are coming from but the problem with the scenario you describe is the server crash this is not your fault and your claim is totally valid but the problem is every time there is a server crash the gms get hundreds of petitions to restore lost stuff this should not be a problem except for the fact that only maybe one in ten of the claims are valid so they have to individually verify each one this takes a lot of time they generally do the easiest ones first if there were not so many asshats in the game putting in false claims the gms could be a lot more efficient in getting to the valid claims
putting in a verifiably false claim should result in an automatic ban
i do understand that after a major event like that it can take a bit of time to handle everything but two full weeks 127 to 1221 to get any response at all is a bit much especially with a report that was fairly simple like that im not trying to rage against the gms i know they are busy with stuff but at the very least a blanket were sorry its taking so long were backlogged because of x event that happened well be with you as soon as we can would be better than nothing at all i understand they get busy at times but i still believe that anything over 1 week for customer service to get back to someone is simply unacceptable if your support staff cant clear the backlog by then you should either hire more support people or pay them overtime to get the job done im not trying to come across as demanding or insensitive but they shouldnt be willing to let support tickets sit there for but so long
okay so  where should the money for the extra support staff or the overime pay come from should ccp cut their development budget skimp on ofice maintenance kill off someone elses job cancel another projectthe money has to come from somewherei also have an anecdote about my time in customer service several actually but this one is the most releventi was midlevel tech support tech 2  i had the training to handle most things but really serious issues had to go to tech 3 they were the bug hunters of our company and if i couldnt fix it with basic troubleshooting steps i had to send it up to themsending a support ticket to tech 3 was a very timeintensive procedure we had to fill out two pages of technical information sim card imei make and model location and range of error among other even more obscure information as well as posting our worklog if tech 3 saw something that i hadnt done properly theyd bounce my ticket and the problem would come back into my handsi dealt with those tickets one at a time now imagine twenty to twentyfive thousand people submitting tickets with no way to know whos legit and whos yanking your chain until you actually read themi cant get rid of my darn signature oh wait
ive thought for a long time that it would be great to have individual filters xml loadable for example have a directory into which namexml files could be dropped and they appear in your load overview settings list optionally these files could contain column info bracket settings andor tab name such files could easiliy be distributed and used without screwing up all your existing tabsthe filedirectory paradigm is well understood and would be far easier to understand than the existing arcane way of doing things once they were aware of the directory visible when a setting is savedas it would be obvious to players how to add new filters update existing filters by overwriting files delete unneeded filters or move them to a backup directory etc etc another win would be that all accounts on a machine would share the same set of available filterseven better would be to allow subdirectories so that an extra layer of the load menu is created allowing divisions such as pvp corp or character acording to taste
already exists take a look at the import and export options in your overviewedit its not as granular as your proposal but its there the extra layers would make the 1020 different overviews nullsec alliances want us to have a little easier to manage
no thats not the same at all the import and export take the stuff and hide it internally i want individual filters clearly visible in the filing system you cant even save a filter as opposed to save as at the moment and when you do export or import its all or nothing unless youre an xml warrior and can cut and paste bits from different exports  which is hard ive tried it an it wasnt fun so much easier to drag and drop a file of course in a perfect world you should be able to drop the file from your filing system into the eve overview window too
tallian is right it already exists in the game no its not exactly what you suggested but the current system has far less overhead since it doesnt have to watch a directory on your pc constantly it can simply keep the data in memorywhat youre probably not understanding is the overhead to a program that disc io takes up i cant remember the exact numbers but its something like 2040x slower than reading from memory theres a reason its the way that it is
you are already proposing a perfect world solution as stated disc io for monitoring like that is insanetry something open your resource monitor go to the disk tab and then start a program that monitors and reads real time and look at the performance hit you take i run raided ssds and i can see the performance hit from apps like that and even just my virus scannerwhich only reads when a call is made for the file
of course but you dont have to do that at all you only scan the directory when you are about to open the load filter setting menu item if even that is too much you might be in a hurry at the time you want to change filters then scan the directory only at session change startup or when a file is dropped onto the overview
oh just you know not break a system that already worksits fine as it is im not saying there is no room for improvement but i can think of hundreds of things in eve that dont even work so this falls under if it aint broke dont fix itplease dont distract ccp from the things that actually need fixed plox
hmm ive obviously got one guy who has a real bee in his bonnet about this suggestion actually i think it is broken in that it is yet another reason why people dont get into pvp your carefuly crafted mining or missioning overview gets totally messed up when you try to set up for pvp edit and then theres the total mystification of noobs who arrive at a tutorial site and see nothing relevent on the overview but thats mostly a separate fixmaybe im not typical but i have four accounts working on three computers with alts and ive never got my overviews even halfway sane i nearly did once back when i just had one pc but then i lost a hard disk
the overview system in game is admittedly confusing however you didnt address that your issue was to be able to do imports in an automagical way and the import system works just fine you can export import share whatever you need i have 20 different definitions because i pvp in nullsec and there is a standard that set of overviews that cfc fcs use and expect people to have if this is to hard for you im sorry but eve may not be for youi will agree that the configuration of the overview to make those xml files in the first place is one of the worst systems i have ever seen but once again that wasnt even really mentioned in the opthis simple matter is making an autoimport function that fires any more often than at game launchwhich would be annoying as hell if you wanted to import in game is unnecessary and puts a huge strain on alot of peoples systemespecially running more than one client in that matterwhich was the stated point of your thread when you created it you are flat wrongif you wanna  about the overview creation system start a thread about that or better yet post in one of the hundreds that already exist on the issue pointless tho since ccp already said they are aware its an issue and its in the mile long list of fixes and improvements they already have
i guess the main point of my proposal is to bypass the issues of it being hard to create filters by allowing you trivially to create your own collection from a selection of other peoples work which is what id mostly like to doand i totally refute your mumblings about the load it puts on the computer if you care lets say it is only refreshed when you undock or drop a new file into the eve window then there is zero extra load in normal operation but pilots can trigger a refresh whenever they want ok special case of nodocking play styles i guess they have to relog if they edit rather than drop files but they can always create a copy somewhere else with the same name and drop that to overwrite and anyway the existing editing mode will still be there so no loss of functionalityseems to me im being trolled youre attacking a minor and irrelevent aspect of the proposal just cos you personally dont like the overal idea lets see if we can canvass any other opinions
a minor and irrelevant aspectreread thisthat is your whole proposal dude if you had proposed changes to the overview creation system i would have been all about it its borked and no sane person can argue thatyou want to to increase system load in a game that already strains some players systems to automate a task that most people do once or twice ever you can already import other peoples overviews there are already plenty of good premade ones available for download if you bother lookingthe only part of your proposal that has any merit is a folder system to sort the various overview types into and this can be worked around with a consistent naming systemstop fighting for something pointless if you must fight for a reform to our overviews make it something simpleoh and if i was trolling you i would have been done with it hours ago and called you mean names the worst i have said here is that you are wrong and you are demonstrably wrongsuffer with a couple extra click once a year at mostunless you are foolish enough to wipe all your appdata and docs folders more often than thatuntil after the truly painful click fests are resolvedseriously your complaining about this when you have pi to give you rsiim not trying to attack you you seem like a good guy you just dont seem to realize what you are actually asking for
the extra load is a simple fix all existing settings are loaded at client start and a manual import function for modifications while the client is runningi am not aware of any external overview editor care to point me to one anyway having separate files for each tab or filter setup would be great so one can share just parts and not need to rely on editing that can mess things up
it doesnt exist any more sadly it used to live a balssindustriescom but the domain got bought by a flooring company or something i wish i had the webdev skills to replicate it but i will have to leave that to someone with talents in that directionas far as loading everything at start up dear god no before i crashed and lost the past 4 years of backups i had in the area of 200 different profiles in a variety of files loading all that at startup woulda crashed the client every time for most people tho that would be the perfect balanceand having separate files for each tab would be awesome as long as they changed the entire system so that it read the files instead of keeping settings in cache catch the ear of one of the csm with iti suggest a well worked out single post detailing it and linking it in the various discussion threads the good csm keep running like the mittanis chill place and this idea fully fleshed out has a good chance of going somewhere since ccp has said the overview is the next project in the ui not that the neocom is updatedif you do this evemail me with the thread and i will come support it with you
i support this ideait should be pushed by the csm all of them i heard that a formal writeup is underway not a single one can get credit for a good implementation since the ideas have been around sincelikeforever i always like to remind everyone of dierdra vaals good writeup of 2008 nil mortifi sine lucreone particular idea by malcanis merrits addition  being able but not required to limit who collects that bounty based on standings that not only is an additional measure effective against exploitation but is also an important rp factor imho in other proposals the bounty issuer is designed to being able to approve of any aspiring hunter also good but more cumbersome and might delay the action due to tz and response time
agreed i have always dreamed of an eve where some of concords function is taken over by the players just as production has been moved away from npcs the bounty system is key to this therefore i propose an extension to this bounty fix allow the bounty setter to specify which alliances are allowed to collect his bountythis makes it more complicated but not impossible for people to collect their own bounties but more importantly encourages the creation of a quasipolice alliance to whom bounties could popularly be allocatedif anyone cares i have thought out how to calculate what happens when there are multiple bounties with different alliance allocations and when some of the killmail toons are in different alliances a bit of a pain but trivial compared to some of the stuff that gets computed every time a ship flies round new eden
not sure if i understand your proposal completely if someone could fill me in hereso if bob has 1bil bounty on his head and lets say he only has 900k skillpoints and he has no implants of value i basically get nothing for podding him
for podding him right you would still collect on his ship value for blowing up his ship if bob somehow managed to get a 1b bounty while being under 900k sp with no implants he could just pod himself over and over for free and collect moneyit is a loophole but a minor one as a 900k sp character who manages to get himself to low sec status and bountied would pretty much be a super low sp suicide ganking alt who made people spacemad such a character is doing it for the lulz anyway its probably better not to pay him extra on top of it
my version of this is to allow you at the time when you post the bounty to select which alliances can collect similar control less interaction
i remember that one someone tried do that not that far ago and it ended bad for him
after reading this i must say its a really good idea
i actually think this is a great ideaand dont give me any crap about kill board and corp stats very few players actually post with their active characters this is one of several markets alts i havethere is currently a big problem with large scale null sec fleet battlesccp has added the time dilation which has greatly improved the performance of these large battleshowever it is getting more and more rare to see these battlesif the other side drops more supers than a retreat is called and alliances with massive assets and incomes continue building supers getting stronger and stronger and nobody bothers to attack them as they can not hope to defeat such a huge fleetif super bpos were eliminated as the op suggests than cap fleet battles would change very much for the greater good with even the largest alliance not being capable of rapidlty replacing losses of supers there will be a lot more planing and thought put in before risking those shipsthey will save them for when they are really neededor can really change the course of a battle i would even go to the point of putting a hard cap on the number of supers permitted in the game once that hardcap is reached no new bpcs will be seeded until a super is destroyed super were intended to be rare not the current state of having super cap blobsthis would allow smaller alliances to keep poking away at larger alliances and gradually dwindling their super cap fleets regardless of whether they win or lose the battle if they pop a super they are one step closer to eventually wining a battlethe idea of titans and motherships was that they would be rare even a massive empire would only field a few for there to be hundreds was never the intentionfor this to be fair though the super cap pilots will also need something big in return if super cap blobs became a thing of the past many super cap pilots would sufer as they can not dock the super and jump into another ship they would be stuck in a ship they rarely used they can leave it sitting in a pos but that is very riskyi propose a new outpost platform mod with a fully upgraded docking ring an outpost could be capable of docking supers this would be at the expense of not being able to use those platforms for other outpost mods basically limiting it to being a super cap staging station even adding the ability of docking them at capital ship maintenance arraysthis would make the outpost a huge strategic target once the enemy determine what outpost you are using which could add more espionage type activity to the gamesupers are an amazing idea and a great addition to the game but the super cap blobs seem very game breaking to me by controlling the numbers and allowing them to dock in appropriately upgraded outposts i think two of the biggest issues with super caps would be greatly reduce in addition if super caps were actually rare as they were meant to be they could be much more powerful without being game breaking not only would they not have needed a nerf but they could even be boosted so that if you did risk losing them the boost it would give to the fleet would be worth it
this hardcap for number of super caps in no for suredocking in outpost not to good those ships are huge
i think this is a brilliant idea a couple of thoughts 1 bpo reimbursement i think just giving back the base isk of the bpo is probably too little especially since most bpo holders already have an entire production line setup i would recommend reimbursing the base cost of the bpo providing them with a single bpc and then giving them 1 additional bpc per me or pe level this will allow current bpo holders to maintain their current production while your npc sources start to get farmed 2 im not convinced the bpc drops should be tied to fw plexes part of my apprehension comes from a limited understanding of fw but i think such fancy drops should be tied to the final room of a new series of escalated plexes it makes complete sense that the npcs you shoot are empire npcs complete with tags empire standing losses rp and the like but i would imagine the series of complexes would typically be a nullsec feature whatever the means for the npc drop its important the sources are ubiquitous enough to prevent bpc hording
quotebugsy vanhalenfor this to be fair though the super cap pilots will also need something big in return if super cap blobs became a thing of the past many super cap pilots would sufer as they can not dock the super and jump into another ship they would be stuck in a ship they rarely used they can leave it sitting in a pos but that is very riskyquotewhen the supply of supercap bpcs dwindle the value of supercap bpcs and hence supercap ships will increase current supercap pilots will be inherently compensated so they dont need anything else in return if they feel their ship isnt used enough they can sell it for an excellent price or join a new alliance that will use their assets
i think the op was mainly looking for a place outside sovereign nullsec to put the bpcs so that supercap production has dependencies other than holding spacethis gets more people with more interests involved and adds another potential market layer with fw players selling bpcs to nullsec buildersthere is probably a better way to do it but i cant think of one right off
the op is a npc alt who refuses to point out the problems specifically in great detalonly that he wants supercaps goneremovednerfed to hell and backand furthermorea question a i asked that was ignoredhow long does it take to build titanfrom the ground upfrom scratchthese are one of many things that points to the sheer ignorance of the op stop the evemail spam
i think the bpcs would need to be a rare drop from something like incursions that is how it is now with the revanantwhy not do it the same way with titans and supers either way it should be something that takes teamwork to acheive shouldnt be a soloable l4 mission or anything like that
it takes a little under 2 months to build the actual titan but the titan itself is built from a large number of components that also require signficant investment and build times additionally titans must be built in sov space making titan production fairly risky this is true for all supercaps by my conservative estimates i dont have exact numbers there are 7001000 titans in the game there are probably 34k supercarriers im missing the post with your questions and where you attack him for being in an npc corp alt  which is irrelevant btw why is the big supercap arms race bad one of the fundamental attributes of eve that really perpetuates a dynamic and entertaining environment comes from the inherent rochambeau combat game by getting in a bigger ship you gain more tank more dps and other benefits but you also gain weaknesses poorer tracking slower etc as such bigger is not better and no ship or fleet is the best that is until supercap fleets supercap fleets do not currently have an effective counter additionally the current sov and pos mechanics create ideal immobile targets that cannot be pragmatically attacked nor defended when your opponent fields the larger supercap fleet why arent supercaps vulnerable to nonsupercap fleets supercap fleets with titans and scs scale extraordinarily well because they have enourmous tanks ewar immunity mobility and uitilty rr scs currently the only effective counter to a sizeable supercap fleet is a bigger supercap fleet the recent changes to the supercarrier drone bay the dd and aggression logoff mechanics represent an enormous step in creating a vulernability beyond more supercaps by essentially limiting their ability to  subcap fleets andor logoff to escape destruction however titan turret mechanics and fighters are still effective tools to combat subcaps with the current in game resources supercaps will continue to proliferate throughout new eden unless something changes this has already been evidenced by the enormous proliferation in supercaps over the last two years there are few options to resolve the potential pitfalls limit the number of supercaps in the game ie this proposal which does so in probably the only equitable manner nerf supercaps to be ineffective against subcaps incarna changes to the sc drone bays dd and remote assistance has gone a long way in changing this but titan tracking and fighter damage is still very effective against subcap fleets what really needs to change here is a fundamental alteration of the capital ship weapons mechanics to be more like missiles such that they are weak against small sig ships create a new shipmodulemechanic specifically to counter supercaps alter the sov and pos mechanics so supercaps are ineffective in engaging these all of these options have pros and cons im personally a fan of just changing the capital turret weapon mechanics to make them truly ineffective at engaging subbs sized ships current game mechanics allow a titan fleet to effectively engage even cruiser fleets truthfully changing the titans turrets tracking is not an easy fix the change has to limit the ability of a supercapital to apply its enormous dps to smallsig sized ships but not nerf its ability to apply dps to capital ships pos and sov structures imo the ops proposal is one of the few fix supers that doesnt involve nerfing them to hell and back so why dont you explain your issues with the proposal ps i realize that you have a deleted post which i never got to read and the op has gone through a few revisions in his post however unprivied to the original discussion i can only go by what i see now
unlike the opyou strike me as someone who knows his stuff and actually has a rational explination to itand i can udnerstand thati seriously doubt there are that many titans in this gameotehrwise wed be seeing them more often than nothes wanting to put a population cap on them and effect the manufactureing abiliteisthis is incredabily shortsightedhe has no concept of manufactureing or deploymentobviuosly this is something he will not see come to fruitition for 6 months to even an yearhe will continue to  and complain about this to no end because he didnt get what he wantted sooner rather than lateras you know and i knowthese things take time to build2 months at best is generous at bestfrom what i heard it could take as much as 3 to 4 monthsand thats assuming you dont have a crapton of resoruces backing you to keep things at full tiltit takes alot of effort to build super capsand while peopel are whining about how hard they are to killkeep in mind to build them is just as difficultits not like were popping them out like crazy left and rightgranted only the most well endowed alliances are capable of production to such numbersbut this is entirely short sighted at besti can understandbut his lack of meat and just blah we shouold limit supercaps blah blah is short sighted at bestit is one thing to say you wantto expain why and outline the detaisl and the ramfiications of those desires is entirely something else stop the evemail spam
anyone as anything to say about it
i believe you meant intra corp ie within the corp market rather than intercorp ie between corpsanyway you can already do this  its just more outside of the game mechanics to be setting the prices and such corp im in actually runs services to this effect for the people via contract yeah it costs us 10k isk per contract  but its a pittance really
i like the idea but it would be a lot of work for the developers for such a small feature besides there kind of already is a mechanic for having a market only accessible to corpalliance members at least for large null sec alliancesevery outpost has a market and you can control who can dock at the outposts you own basically controlling who has access to the market in that outpostalliances with several outposts can setup one of the outposts well inside there space perhaps a factory outpost with restricted access and then have alliance members place items for sale there at reduced cost anyone in the region could browse the market but only someone with access could actually pick up products from that outpost it would involve a lot of logistics but it is possiblethe other option is to simply sell stuff using contracts only available to your corpeither way would work
being part of  the source of nearly all playermade content  note the quotes wont allow special treatment from ccp as there is no inssurence that tomorrow it will be still standing puting together your big ego and lack of general vision i do believe this is a bad idea
blanket decrease to 4 hours would alter game play because it would allow troops to move across new eden much more freely than at present but allowing two jumps every 48 hours would be a good solution you could pvp just for an hour on a weekend if you wanted to without significant damage to your training schedule and you wouldnt have to be sure that you would be available to come back after 24 hours to jump back into your training clone
this system seems old and outdatedwhy if i am in a 1 man corporation am i voting on anythingyou dont have to vote if it is an alliance deccing shouldnt corporations within an alliance get a say if not then why should corporation have a voteeven if there are people in the corp and shares arent distributed members do not get to vote only the ceo does so the ceo proposes vote it is mailed to everyone in corp they get no say in the matter then the ceo has to decide whether he is going to vote yes or no hmmmmmmmmmmm i just proposed the vote i wonder i know actually ill vote no thank god for that voting system
actually you do have the vote in an alliance  its just kept to within the executor corporation
i have never had to vote as an alliance i have wardecced dozens of alliances with my alliance and never once had to voteedit i just realised i think i missread your message i didnt realise the option was available as an allianceeither way i was just adding it to emphasize the main point about mandatory votes for corp
your complaining about a system you dont useyeahmakes perfect sensego away pleasecome back when you have common sense to talk about this subject again with rationalityps and incase your nooblet brains didnt figure it outsome alliances do use the systemjust because you dontdoesnt mean it needs to be removed derp derp stop the evemail spam
um lol i do use it i have to use it all the time i have probably initaited over a hundred decs since i started empire wars i do it as an alliance sometimes when deccing shadow of blueprints and solar blueprints etc but if i want to dec say some randoms or a botting corp i do it as a corpand yes youre right in that it doesnt have to be removed all together but making it mandatory to vote is just silly the whole implement sanctionable action thing is broken too if i have no active decs and hit apply first dec goes through fine and moves to the in effect section hit apply on the second action and i get message saying too many wars active please remove one you can only have a maximum of three dec still goes through two wars are active second dec stays in the in effect section forever even after it becomes invalidretractedand thats just part of it seems to me the whole system has been quite forgotten by ccp if it has had those glitches for quite awhile now im sure im not the only one getting it since i cant effect the games mechanics obviously or maybe its just broken for my corp since there are so many votes piled up
your not making any senseyou said you never had to votenow your saying youve had to do it every timewhich is itand for the recordi was an executor of an alliacne and a vote was never necessary whilst i was leading a good sized alliancebut i never used shares or any of that crap stop the evemail spam
wardec voting should be something that could be disabled either by the ceo or by its own vote having to run a oneman vote for every wardec is annoying
it is pointless having a one man corp and being forced to vote on war decs i have an alt as my ceo so i can come and go as i please i transferred all the corp shares to her just to see if it made a differenceit didnt still have to go through the whole vote bs ccp please fix this crap with the next expansion there are a lot of high sec war dec corps keeping the empire economy strong we deserve a little love for all we do to keep the isk flowingthe isk must flow
the main problem with titan and mother is the officier items  drug  implantsperhaps the best way will be to remove the medium and low slot on titansame hp on all titan same dps racial resistance raganarok and erebus mix and shield and armor tanking resistanceleviathan shield  without shield regenerationavatar armorguns same then now but without the officer items the tracking will be more worst then nowfor ccp its easy because its more easy to balance titan versus sub cap or cap without all low and medium item
this again really titans should be able to hit subcaps in particular the permamicrowarpdrivingdrakes that are starting to appear titans have been nerfed to hell already enough is enoughplease stop brining this subject up its getting very old
wow that this is the most stupid idea i have read everi wonder how many of the whining cry babys here know how the titans are even set upwhat the next whine nerf the mael with its alpha damage is to powerfull my logistic ship cant save an other battleship it can insta pop cruisers
the fix is pretty easy imporemove gunship signature radius from the hit chance formula and scale overall damage done by the ratio of ship sig  gun sigwallah even if the titan gets a perfect hit on your 90sig scimitar its only going to do around 9100 of the titans max damage to it

i agree with pinksupers should be anticapital platformsantisuper platformsremove their ability to target sub caps but in the same breath make them immune to sub caps and sub cap ewarbubblesboost cap hulls and abilities to compensatei will repeat this until it sinks in
that could work it would force supers to rely on support fleets to defend against sub caps a sub cap blob could take down a titan but the titan could not effectively hit backagain supers could no longer be used for ratting the only use for them when not at war a big deal considering the pilot can not dock to change ships

you nailed it right there but rather than trying to adjust mechanics to make titan ineffective in blobs i would rather just see them put a cap on the number of titans permitted to exist there are a few ways of achieving this without pissing off all the titan pilots i am taking a lot of this from other threads but the ideas would work if implemented in the right waysorry for the threadnought but i think this is a good ideathere should be a cap of say 100 titans and maybe 300 super carriers in the entire universe existing ships should not get destroyed or nerfed but remove all the bpos for all super caps from the game the bpo owner would need to be compensated for not only the bpo but any mepe research invested into it as well eventually the numbers would drop down to the cap level as loses could not be replaced until the numbers reached a point where new bpcs would get seeded what ever the caped number for each ship would be it would apply to both the ships and the bpcs seeded in game no bpcs would be seeded unless the number of existing bpcs plus the number of ships in existence dropped below the cap the cap could be adjusted as needed to achieve the right balance or if the game population grows or shrinks  eventually a new bpc would only be seeded when a super was destroyed possibly add a mechanic where the alliance who lost the super was not eligible to receive the seeded bpc to prevent large alliances from holding the largest fleet of supers when they use them and lose one someone else gets the opportunity to acquire one or maybe the bpc auction or better yet a lottery is only available to pilots who have the skills to pilot the ship but do not own one the higher your skill level for that ship the higher chance you have of winning the bpc this would even allow former super cap pilots that no longer wish to fly them to benefit as they could win the lottery and sell the bpcif you want to fly a super you would have a few options train up all the skills and wait to win a bpc so you can build it or have it built by your alliance buy a bpc from someone else who won it and does not want to fly one any more buy the ship from someone who no longer wants it limited bpcs would be seeded in game through a special lotery where all pilots with the skills to fly the ship would have a chance at winning a bpcif this was done supers would return to the rare battle changing super asset they were meant to be if you risk it and lose it you may not get it back for some time regardless of how large and powerful your alliance is regardless of whether you can afford to replacing it quickly or not they would become far more strategic and guarded assets this would allow smaller alliances to compete with larger ones as the ability to field super caps would have very little to do with the size of the alliance although larger alliances with more super pilots would have a higher chance of having a pilot win a bpc lotteryif the number of super caps was limited to a small number there would not only be no need to nerf them but they could be made even more powerful not being able to readily replace a lost super cap increases the risk and should offer more reward in the way of a more powerful ship a single super should be able to jump into a battle and turn the tide this is what they were meant to do oh no a titan just jumped in we are in trouble nowan idea i have also had to give something back to the super cap pilots as i posted in other threads is to address the complaint many super pilots have of being stuck in their ship unable to dock i think it would be game breaking to allow them to dock anywhere but they could add a docking ring outpost platform upgrade that would allow for super caps to dock at that station this would allow alliances to build up specific stations for super cap staging without allowing them to dock any wherepossibly they could also allow super caps to dock at capital ship maintenance arrays just like regular caps can dock at regular ship maintenance arrays you can dock a dread in a regular ship maintenance arrayat least i have seen it done in the past it just takes up a large amount of the total storage do the same with supers in a large ship maintenance array maybe it can hold only one titan or two moms but at least they could be docked
this postnaught is filled with noto even allow super cap pilots from remotely entertaining the notion of rational debate of that without emotional outbursts and outright rejection you should revise this post with the following facets taken into considerationdont touch super cap bpos do not physically limit s rather attach a penalty to all ships in system using the s fielded per fleetgridausystemlydo not increase building cost you will whine about more titan tax in a month or 2 demanding further increases to the pricetag because of the proliferationdo not nerf supers by boosting sub capsdocking super carriers is a kewl idea that will count in your favor but unless super capital docking arrays are introduced into upgradeable and or bigger stations this will be a wet dream for ship owners
immunities are the grossest hack of game design and are a sign of structural failure in the design when they appearmoving the signature radius penalty from to hit to damage is better design especially since it can be consistent across all ship classes and not a special case for titansa sig radius penalty on damage should probably be a bit more than linear maybe a power factor of 1315 so that a titan really just cant be effective against frigates without pulling out medium drones
this actually sounds like it would achieve a similar if not identical effect to what i suggested earlier and would be alot easier to impliment it would mean titans can no longer wtfbbq subcaps add this to a removal of fighters and rr mods from supercarriers and you solve alot of the balancing problems supercapitals should require carriers as support as thats what carriers are designed to donot to mention far better idea involving the ships ewar immunity changing supercaps so they had sensor strenghs and warp strengh properties say 15 for a sc and 30 for a titan would mean that any pilot moronic enough to drop a solo super on a sub capital gang will pay for doing what he should never be able to do anyway while also maintaining their excellent anti capital andi structure fleet boosting and bridging roles perfectly fine
the orca thing realy should have been fixed by now1

with how easy this is to pull off i am surprised it is not used more often especially with the new tier 3 bcs you got the alfa of a battleship for ganking in high sec then dump the ship into a friendly orca before concord shows up concord will not attack a pod so you lose nothing in the gank any interaction with a aggressed pilot should result in shared aggression whether it is remote repping or allowing them access to the ship maintenance array and corp hanger of an orcait might seem game breaking but if they really wanted to put an end to ganking in high sec they should make concord aggress the entire corpfleet of the ganker you are harboring a fugitive you are as guilty as they arenot saying this should happen but the ganker tears would be epic
avoiding concord is a bannable offense if someone commits a criminal act and then stores their ship in an orca to avoid losing it to concord report them they can get banned for this as it is considered an exploit ccp does not want to put an end to ganking in highsec quite the contrary suicide ganking is a healthy and intentional part of this game what ccp strives is to balance highsec ganking by1 creating a cost to the gankers this comes in the form of sec status ship loss and killrights the insurance nullification was only done to increase the cost of ganking 2 providing all players the tools needed to mitigate the risks of being suicide ganked this comes in the form of criminal flags reasonable concord response times tanking modules different ship types cloakers ewar capital haulers courier contracts etc etc etc really people have many many many options to mitigate the risks of getting suicide ganked however most people foresake those options in the name of yield time efficiency andor isk lol the ganker tears would be thoroughly drowned in the ocean of carebear tears your suggestion would provide awoxers would join target fleets get gccd and laugh as concord nukes the everyone  op you cant board a ship when its targetted if they could extend this mechanic so you cant store a ship into a smb when it is targeted most of the  shipswapping could be prevented it would also prevent scooping aggressed bss into a carrier rorqual etc etc your suggestion allows you to shoot the the orcacarrier but those ships can still instantly dock activate a gate or jump to escape with the ships additionally they could potentially bypass the assistanceaggression by having the pilot eject from the ship before they scoop it 1 to fixing the store your ship into a ship maintenance bay during combat
nice shameless plug sorry mate i already know what candidate im supporting and lets stay on topic pleasei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
stop beeing lazy no a carrier can already move 12 battleships in its ship maintanance array we dont need duplicate ships especially ships which requires 0 risk
not sure if ive missed a discussion but will the ship bay be scannable and if so to what level of information doesnt really matter unless ships can drop but my personal view is that it makes gameplay more interesting if it can be scanned preferably including modules in the ships  and this also slightly protects newer players who like shipping their cheap t1 fleet aroundcan one of these beasts scoop a ship parked in space like freighters can scoop gfcs
me supports this excellent idea because its neededalso would this ship bay be restricted to only assembled ships or packaged ones too restricted to ships only and so no mineralslootcans whateverbecause if i agree with the first one assembled id completely disagree with the later there are already frighters for this purpose and jump capable freighters can also bring package shipssomething different and nasty to train for and something individuals as megacorps would want in thier assetsmy humble opinion would be that this ship had a single version of it and since its a very exposed ship hello cargo scanners it would be capable of jumps directly in high sec only 05 but at very high fuel cost high sec blahblah stuff increase 500 fuel consumption etcnormal jump abilities in low sec and increase by 25 jump range in null sec  not because of risk because youll take hundred more time risk undocking at jita than in null secthe idea is to give alliances and corps an expensive and capable logistics ship to move stuff at far distances without being spoted and open new tactics of invasion or evasion
you guys are forgetting that there have been large strides made in brazier technology in the eve universe
im getting really depressed that eve null sec is either completely empty  has too man ships for a solo pirate to do didly against and when you get a system with 12 players in one is a booster i like the idea of ongrid boosters but how about a compromisemake pos shields negate any and all boosting effects while on grid with them so if the boosters want to boost thats fine but they have to be away from a pos  if they get worried about dying they can warp to a pos but their boosts become negated simply set the activation so if your within say 300km from a pos they wont turn onso u can scan down the booster and do something to them instead of scan them down and watch them laugh at you thru a shield
uh at 300km with istabs he would still be perfectly safe and with a bm 350km out he can bounce back out as soon as you leave the pos area and resume boosting his other toonplus at 300km even its a slight swerve to get you to chase him into pos tackledweb range300km based on having landed on the most annoying version of a death star ever and you are screwed anyway
have someone probe down and kill the bonus link no support here
if you have ever tried probing one of the damn things down you wouldnt be so cavalier about it  true that it is no longer impossible but if it is mobile ie ab in random direction then the 45 probe cycles  repositioning needed to nail one has him way off wherever you land  they are for all intents and purposes still unprobableeither way it is besides the point no ship except maybe titans should be able to affect anything whatsoever without being there  imagine the i was there crappola video if the pilot used as example was a link pilot  hilarity
i was in the system somewhere
this is true while the offgrid command ship is handy it is often an alt anyway and getting a scan down on it was quite easy 1 for this proposal quit whining that eve is hard combat in the game is about knowing how your opponent fights if you cant do that then you cant prepare for their strike  which means you deserve to die in a firegrow up or go play wow
suggest you learn the finer aspects of instaprobing1 cycle or 2 at max for the love of pvp would you all quit asking ccp to make this game dumber for youseems like all you want in warfare is to line everyone up opposite each other and shoot reminds me of the way we did things before the american revolution where we invented guerrilla warfareif you really need game mechanics that dumb go to 00 get your noobie level pvp done there we lowsec dwellers thrive on the more skilled combat and yes that entails the offgrid command shipof course you want it on field so you can blob it to death morons
this might need some tweakingbut at the moment i like this idea the notion of having sechits only apply to fights on the same grid as sentry guns has some appeal as well
this idea has my approval 1 jack and may we meet on a gate somewhere gfs all around
make it so titans cant bridge into lowsec or use their bridges inlowsec fixed
this would be lovely but it wouldnt fix lowsec it would just remove a bit of gayness
i used to pvp as antipirate there is this one fc who roleplays and i pretty much knew every lowsec roam with him would trash my security statuswhich caused some major issues when it came to wardec time in highsecso yes i supportgood idea
suggestion to embelsih the current proposal is to extend the existing contract system we have to accomodate bounty hunter contacts as a result you could use a combination of private and public mediums even alliance contracts to afford a sensible selection in this sense using the contracts mechanics for bh the i guess when used with a forum for services or otherwise for people who have established reputations seems to give flexibility to contracts rather than restirciting to corps alliances or public as a selection the most important part is being able to optionally avoid the person who a kill right is about of an affiliate simply lifting the contract for personal motivationsalso from a previous discussion regarding transferable kill rights tippia had some interesting ideas also
i had suggested that when you place a bounty you can specify which alliances are allowed to collect but i like the idea of tying it to the standings system betteryou do have to think out how to calculate payouts when multiple bounties are placed with differing rules and you have a kill mail with players with different relationships to those rules but an evening with a towel round our heads should be able to work out the right algorithmsupported
people dont get killrights when killed by wartargets
people already have killrights on wartargets by definition as mentioned earlier in theory this could allow warring corps to place bounties on wartargets depending on how far we wanted to take this that would give us two possibilities1 we could limit collection of those bounties to the issuing corp basically they would simply be a method for a corp member to incentivise and reward the members of his corp to prosecute the war2 as a further possibility we could consider allowing letters of marque where corps could offer open bounty contracts on wartargets i like this concept because it would introduce a badly needed element of risk into declaring war but i am also cautious of the possibility of abusenote that bounty contracts on war targets would expire when the war does
i dont see why it shouldnt be possible to assign a bounty contract directly to a specific third party corpalliance but there may be a limitation in the contract code that prevents this it should certainly be possible to limit collection of a bounty to ones own corpalliance in a way analogous to any other corp or alliance contract we can make nowpersonally i find the idea of a mixed fleet of bounty hunters stalking their prey whilst discussing amongst them selves exactly who will have to kill whom in order to optimise bounty collection rather intricate  amusing
firstly supported the player bounty system is terrible and needs iterationthis proposal is effectively a transferable killright in the form of a contract i wonder whether instead of limiting who may accept a contract the preferred method of providing that killright could be to make a private contract that is a person has legitimate grievance from being ganked finds the forum post of a bounty hunter group then discusses terms with them or just makes the contract this would be along side an openish contract system as you proposethis way the injured party could find a reputable group and give them the rights to kill the bad guy reputation would be gainedlost in similar ways to 3rd party services are nowalso the focus of your proposal is on highsec so one addition i would like to suggest is the ability to add nullsec only because everybody effectively has killrights on everybody else in nullsec open contracts for aliance membersallies based on standings to collect it would be useful in wartime to have a system where an alliance can put bounties on all members of an enemy corpalliance to encourage their membersallies to engage those enemies if it were paid out as a portion of ship insurance or pod value in the same way as has already been suggested with a player defined pool and cap per kill it would allow a direct ingame method to take alliance level income and distribute it to members for their activityi think in the case of marketing the bounty hunter profession theyre meaning ratting hunting npc pirates for concord bounties
im kind of uncertain about bounties and 00 the whole point of bounty hunting is to avenge crimes which are an oxymoron in 00 where the only law is lex talonisstill i cant think of any good reason to oppose the idea of alliance a granting all its members an effective bonus for killing members of alliance b perhaps it would be best to require that a wardec b in order for a bounty contract to be created
i love the idea of the bountypayer stipulating who can collect on the bounty this is sound and cool in every way the one concern i have is that there is still a loophole whenever you involve the player economy lets say theres a 500mil bounty on player x open to everyone player x manipulates the market for small t2 sentry drone rigs or any rarely used module that you like up to 1 billion isk player x puts this 200k module on a 200k imicus has alt blow it up and wham he gets the whole payout if this devious mastermind player x wants the bounty gone because its just annoying he can do the same thing and just fly around a hub in his 1 billion isk imicus  sure someone will actually get the 500mil but at negligible loss to player xi agree this system is better than the current one but the current one is a dated piece of trash maybe the fix is simple  calculate payoffs based on mass of the ship and techlevel that is to say killing a bigger ship would entitle the players into bigger portion of the payout and a t2 frigate is more valuable than a t1 cruiser and a t3 cruiser is more valuable than a t1 bs et cetera when adding a bounty perhaps allowing the bountypayer the ability to stipulate how many times he wants the target killed up to a certain cap could be a cool tweaki see a lot of people saying now that we have implants on pod mails yada yada yada the bounty system ideally would be a lowsec thing this is lowsec a competent lowsec pilot only gets podded going through rancer or your favorite smartbombing pipe system or when he wants to we shouldnt base a new system on the foundations of the broken one
small t2 sentry drone rigs dont have any npc price that im aware of
i was wondering about your crazy faction repair chit thing  insane p
ccp will never make adjustment to items beacuse of their market value and i have always supported that of my 7 years of playingtbh in im for nerfing missions a lot
what are you serious if you really have been playing for seven years  or at the very least paying attention to things  then you cant fail to have noticed how for instance they nerfed the market value of meta 4 prop mods by vastly increasing the drop ratethis proposal is only to increase the tag supply to make the lp storesyou knowviableplease understand the proposal before posting
bump
an excellent suggestion i will add it to additional thoughts rather than expanding the original postedit i added it but after thinking about it some more it occurs to me that this is kind of redundant for a ship with bridging capabilities were you suggesting this instead of the capability to bridge
failthere is a best path and ships minmatar and mining with guns you can do everything in the game from thisthe only tools you have as noob is free noobships just capable to kill belt rats in noob systemson the other hand vet have the abilitypossibilityimunity of gankscamsteal assets whatever to noobs and they are proud of it this tells a lot about eve community maturity like it or not theres a good point in what you just mentioned there as blizzard having millions of players that of course you place as being uninteresting players but im sure their money is as good as yours when it comes to subs specially if those dont use ratingmining bots to pay sub with plex oupsho humans had hard time living a few thousand years before but as you see i hope some of them evolved in to intelligent humain beings speaking several languages that travel around their planet and can see far than the botom of their noseyou obvilously donteve is still noob unfriendly corporations and players still have two engines to move on farm kms no matter what you have to do to get those and paranoia its a big  if youre unemployed a student being at home more often than at school or retired might help too
thisdont forget the interaction of selfdestruct and skill loss for t3 ships removing the pilots choice to selfdestuct to save his skills would be sad
noesself destruction should get improvements and not just be the laugh it is i want my ship to blow and make dmg aroundwhat are you afraid of if someone chooses to self destruct and get some of your 10 friends with it yes because youll never engage without at least 23 jamers and double neutral reps rightyou want to talk about fairness ehonourself destruction should provide the ultimate dmg source for every pilot this would bring new tactics more intelligent people and less pawn just good to hit f1what a joke guys playing pussie games talking about ehonourim stil laughing
the problem is that according to the gms they cant verify the complaints are false either apparently qa is so bad on patches to the ui and graphics engine that real but rare graphics and ui bugs such as apparently mine happen regularly but cant be verified by in game logs meaning god help you if you get one and it costs you because they now because this was not the case back in my day cannot issue a refund based on issues with the game that happen on your computer unless the devs tell them its realor by you know looking since its increasingly clear from gm responses that they fail to do the bare minimum of research into problems at all my most recent constantly referred back to a previous petitions out of the five gms that played hot potato with it only one had bothered to read the previous petition in question without prompting and only because he had been the one to close it erroneously
i posted this idea to my blog 
intriguing idea and how about having a captcha type human interface to the special module to make it hard for macro miners
no goddamnit captcha has no business in eve ever
tell you whatyou use itand tell us how it works out for youfor 5 months straightas to the op  i like the ideabut your likely to cause the market to end off worse than it did before stop the evemail spam
id hope that ccp would consider market effects  adjust drops accordingly the concept is to promote  reward those players that are at their keyboard you could even use the system to simply increase mining yields of the same oremin typethanks for the feedback
hii would like to propose some following changes so that eve is more dynamic and the different aspects and areas reflect better on how different areas nullsec lowsec highsec  wormholespacereflect properly on risk vs reward when it comes on the income sidei feel this is needed when 66 of the population lives in highsecthis should prove enough of a reason to the population of eve that highsec is way to profitable to ever bother going to explore lowsecnullsecwormhole spaceim not saying this to force people to move to another area for us evil piratesgankersblobbers from huge alliances so we have more targetsbut as i see it t oday showing on each devblog on how the population is spread i feel this is a neccesary step so that people properly explore the riches around eve i know that low sec already dosent have too many things that draws people to it atm and ccp is addressing this and eve is a sandbox game where you do what you want but as it is today risk vs reward is not properly setspecially is this to level 4 missionswhat i want donereadjust the loyaltypoint income of level 4 missions by 2540 so that it comes in line with the risk vs reward of the other aspects of the gameand other highsec activities highsec incursions done properly and etcsome reasoning to thisi am a 7 year veteran bittervet of this gamenot famous of any kind just enjoy this game but as i see theres plenty of territory for those who are willing to risk to get rewardwhen i after 4months of playing back in the old days i was tired of highsec already  yes i did live in highsec after my first couple of nullsec lives i took the chance of going to 00 to join the big alliances and the riches that would come to me for taking that risktoday i feel its another storyyou have so much income from level 4 missions through loyalty points all agents today has no quality level anymore which means you can spread out evenly and lower the risk even more for highsec ganksplays i feel that through this there is no risk except for dieing in a mission bring a logistics alt and there you go totally risk free incomei would like some of the csm candidates to view this and take a position on this though alter my proposal as you see fitcya on fanfest guys
i approve

i think the only thing they need to adjust is the mining sectorthese days mining isnt that safe at it was there are too many gankers these days and you can easily pop a hulk with boosts and an orca supporting it with just 2 or maybe 3 low sp destroyers so the risk has gone up but the reward hasnt therefor i think there needs to be something new for miners also you can only mine for 6millhour with a decent hulk this is just way too lowincursions and missions shouldnt get any asjustments simply because they are already good at the moment you can make around 4060milhour doing lvl 4 missions  salvaging them this is easily doable without any high risksincursion require communication skills a group of people and still has a high risk of losing your ship also you need to have a good ship  good skills to run them good enough to be able to contest other fleets therefor the reward is higher and is at a steady 70120millexploration in highsec still has a high reward but requires the skills to scan sites so really if you compare it all the only thing that needs to be adjust is the mining sector the rest is balanced join jxt public for more information
4060mill isk a hour for lvl4 missions is way to high in a space where you cant really be ganked unless your stupidfor running anomalies in 00 you get also 5080mill isk a hour where anyone can kill you which i belivie it is a little to low comparison to lvl4 missions when you factor in the riskwhen it comes to mining thats based out of the market price for tritanium and etc though for highsec ganking it would maybe be on time for a buff of the hulk for this matter
i agree with dipluz there is not enough people in lowsec and nullsec doing what they do in highsec making money for themselves yes there are lots of alliances but you just dont see the kind of economy and traffic that highsec has created missions have been drastically nooberized so that everyone can do them this has made it impossible for new players to want anything other than easy iskchanging something must be done dont force people to move but make it encouraging theres gold in them tharrrrr hills
good now adjust nullsec to reflect the near risk less lifestyle for huge rewards removing local is a good start there then either cutting factiondedofficer item drop rates and rat bountys by at least 30 while reducing the number of faction spawns too andor making plexs harder to do so no more solo tengusthat should help with the risk free nullsec isk printing machine ps before you start whining and crying that nullsec had risk remember about those intel channels and the risk free intel local provides at least this way you will have to risk something for your rewardlet the nullsec carebear tears flow
whilst i am prepared to accept that reward rebalancing may be needed i dont actually think this will get more people into lower sec space in fact by making stuff more expensive to reequip it might have the opposite effectpeople chose to live in hisec because they are that sort of person avid pvpers may find it hard to accept that spoiling someone elses day is not something that everyone gets off on i know that thats not what pvp is really about but it is what hisec folk perceive it to be about after all the only experience of pvp that most of them have is when some ganker spoils their day
removing local is a dumb thing go to wormhoel space if you want 00 without local its needed for corporationalliance organsational use like intel channels fleet ops etcif you really think that intel channels and local really helps too much you give up before youve even properly tried catching people in anomalies belts etc dont be lazy use directonal scanner etcwe are a small corp in a 160man alliance and we have very large amount of kills even with local so removing that has no proper purpose factiondedofficer spawns is the only thing holding 00 people in 00 if you limit that you will have a huge spike in people just living in highsec beacuse its risk freenot all systems is upgraded with super lvl5 ded complex upgrades beacuse of politics and etc maybe you should live more in 00 before you posted this you seem very unexperienced with 00 ive lived in 00 for properly around 56 years time on and off
arr theres the whining i was looking for trying to wriggle out of the fact your nothing more than a mad emo raging little carebear how pathetic please cry more i will enjoy the day your isk printing press is nerfed
making stuff more expensive dosent help anyone the rebalance of isk income is the thing beacuse people will take risks if they can earn more money other places but it has to be a risk that is rewardring to overcome
tbh i couldnt care much abou isk printing im trying to find a way to encourage the people who makes enough isk doing lvl4s to even bother taking a couple of chances to go out to 00 and join alliancescorporations who live out t here take part in bigger communities than sitting in their 40man highsec corp do nothing more than do lvl4 missions till they either gets ganked by people like me beacuse hey theres no more targets in nullsec or they quit the game beacuse they grow tired of lvl4 missions beacuse wtf is the point of having billions of isk if you have nothing more to buy beacuse hey bigger ships cant be flown in highsec or hey now i own all pirate battleships my goal in this game is fufilled
ofcourse people we cannot force people to move to lowsec or nullsecwh space and i dont see buffing anomaly hunting in 00 a solution but reducing the lucrative lvl4 mission income is a way for people to look elsewhere beacuse the income in a game like eve is important dont fly anything you cannot afford to loose
shut up idiot its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
the isk vs reward does need to be tweaked a bit i do agree  for me i live in null sec  i cant get into a carrier and short of teamin up with other characters ratting is a first come to belt first get reward situation with me and my ratting bsbut something that bugs me is that null sec is far too safe a place to be unless you come thru into a gate camp or get caught by a fleet there really isnt anything about here that can kill you  and half the time its more dangerous in high sec due to the ganking i think making the reward a little less is the wrong way to do it simply make it a bit harder  more scrambling rats more dps and more randomisation of rat sets so a simple cookie cutter fit no longer is the be all end all in missions even more distance between sites would reduce the isk per hour on travel aloneas for working on mining the reward isnt as obvious as scrape a rock sell the dust  mining is only less profitable for people in high sec becuase there is no risk at all from the game itself and its very time consuming what with all the bots etc available with a google search the only way to increase your income is to move to null like me and mine here where you can make a lot more isk just out of oresor go full industry and manufacture things out here with the ore you mine risk vs rewards  mining here is risky so its also good for iskiesi can manufacture shuttles out of ore gained by reprocessing other peoples loot they leave with a nocits then that shuttle sells for 30000000 isk  that profit is insane from 20 mins harvesting 1 site giving me enough ore to make 50 with no bothera couple mil investment like im doing get a pos up in a system and start manufacturing ammunitionin a fleet people pay insane ammounts for ammunition out here  ur 3m trit might get you 9m isk in high sec manufacture some ammo out of that and you can get 90m in a day or two from the same ammount of effortwhat i want to see is null sec stations offering missions in local space  a lvl3 in null would be reidulously rewarding compared to a lvl3 in high
wont this just increase the value of lp
ill agree with you the day where null sec will be free o absolutely all the null sec rating bots hundreds and even thousands of those but seems ccp cant do a crap about itbecause a single rating bot in null sec in his drake is completely intouchable and does for about 700m to over 1b a day wheres your risk when you know ccp cant do a  about it and that your perfect bot dockskiss the poss if some neutral appearscmon intelligent guy im sure you have an answer al made for thisnow there are hundreds of those in tengus and carriers what is your proposal about thisso your ols rabble about high sec income not only is flawded but its once again to previlege those already crawling on billions of isk the same ones buying characters on toons bazaar very often most of those have lots of alts since its easy to pay their sub rightidiot ideas are idiot
its as if youve totally glossed over l4 bots because of course nobody bots in highsec its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
no hes just running his level 4s very enthusiastically thats why he doesnt respond to convos and why hes out for 18 hours a day its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
slap sleeperincursion ai into all npcs should shake things up a bit
i have just one questionhow does the one make any freaking money if not whs or incursionsincursion lp has apparently inflated also normal level 4 lp stores to nearly bull value doing level 4s in low or null seems pretty pointless go figure it seems botting level 4s in hi secnull sec is still profitable thoughor titan rattingwait there might be hidden bonus questions
shameless bump
thank you for the complements i based my estimate of titans and supercaps from the q4 qen report in there they discuss supercap proliferation at the end of 2010 there were 472 titans and 1782 scs in game with 94 and 595 built in the last quarter of 2010 respectively assuming similar production during the four quarters of 2011 i think my estimates are very reasonable although the fall of the nc in the north and the wars in the south might have hindered production and increased supercap death more than i realizethe current situation has supercaps entering the game far more quickly than they die in an ideal situation their destruction would be on par with their production this would be a very economically healthy scenario filled with lots of tears to boot however they still aught to be powerful enough to represent the significant investment they represent imo balancing them is very difficult
i loledi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
1 because need supcap changesi totally agreed with first point need increasing supcap pricesbut i think need other changes too over 4k supercap in the game thats horrible and ruined the fights bring more supercaps tactic is a bullsht no chanches
ive mentioned in the past that i think the easiest and best way to limit titans is to tied them the the fc position in a fleet titans are supposed to be the centerpiece of a grand armada so no matter how many you have requiring a critical mass of fleet members getting fleet boosts from them should be required to power up more than just their ability to move around i personally think around 200 people should be required but that slants things in favor of huge groups possibly too much a more realistic number would be 100 since if you cant field 100 pilots you have no business fielding a titanif you do this any given side could field no more than 34 titans in a given fight and 34 titans while definitely a strong battlefield presence are not unbeatable without more titanssuper carrier blobs arent a real issue ever since they lost their drones they are still pretty hard to kill and thats all right but they can no longer dominate every battlefield just by being there if you enemy brings a hac fleet or bc fleet or similar small sized hull then you can just start eating the supers for lunch one at a time and all they can do is rr each otherhence being hard as hell to kill
apologies velicitia my english is not very good but yes i did ment within the corpi have though of contracts but there is a problem for them  they cost isk to be done  you cannot make an infinite amountas for the outpost system i like the idea and the concept but it cannot be applied to all corporations and also to the corporation that does more lowmedhigh sec stuff and i do not believe it would be much work to be done as far as my knowledge in programmation brings me ccp would have to do a simple category or group within the current market this group would only be shown using a certain feature separated from the regular market pretty much like a shortcut on your desktop but that shortcut is the only way to acces one file from the market folderthen the corporation could have to spend fees to have a hold into the market pretty much the same as getting an office for the corp who gets the market it is then created a space for them into the corporation category a price could even be fixed by ccp or even concord taxes that would be applied on the items since no taxes can be applied from the corp this would add a little more to the rp of eve in general there are realy many ways to modify and adapt this concept but the only main purpose is to simplify large and small marketing into ones corporation
i just had a great reading of this and lols still laughing now thinking about rats spaming localjust because its really funny 1
eve has like 500k subscribers and was only 360k a year agowow has like 13millionrift had 1million prelaunchswtor had 17million active subscribers at launchas far as the mmo world is concerned eve has poor subscription numbers however what sets it apart from the others is that it has been growing continuously since its inception whereas fail games like wow that are just designed at luring and trapping weak soles is losing subscribers now
i didnt think to try that yet thankyou for saving me the time
squinty eyes cant tell if trolling or really really stupid
also drake quick english lesson for you the difference between your and youre with pictures
try reading your own postsdo i need to underline your own words stop the evemail spam
ok well for the sake of assuming youre not a troll i will underline your words and answer them for youyoure getting two separate things mixed up ill make it very simple for youi have never had to vote as an alliancei have always had to vote as a corpsee the difference yetalso it is youre not your as in you are not making any sense not the not making of any sense is belong to you
how does this beast interact with courier contracts can you make a contract for moving a ship or ships which this hauler can fulfil and if so how is it clear which contracts can be done with this haulerim thinking that corps may well want to offer the service of moving missioneers from one agent to another for example
i dont thank you get the idea this support tug ship is designed to be a ship to move around your other big ships so you not have to repackage them and loseing your rigs yes a carrier can haul 12 battleships bit they cant be used in high sec space before you say drop the care bear act no that im not a care bear and do enjoy pvp and low sec but i also enjoy running missions also i have different battleships that i like to use to make it more interesting to run missions for that i dont want to jump 20 jumps then go back and get my other ships 23 times this support tug ship is perfect for this plus it could be a good idea for null as well not sure however
for someone like me that is not willing to train capitals with my character to get stuck in some nyx and believe me i really love that ship this tug would be the perfect shipim not willing neither to put 5b in a crappy jump freighter that cant hold my fitted ships and cargo hello nanite paste ccpi do have to train for a carrier just for my own logistics because the price is acceptable i can load 2 fitted bs or several other ships have a corp hangar etc so if i dont have the choice but to move ill be free to do it by my ownthis is where the tug ship idea is awsome just fill the ships cargo with your stuff put your ships in the tug undock jump to cyno and dock 2min logistics  more time to play aroundcould also be a new service for corps and help a lot of players with stuff stuck in null stations
it will also create a new opportunity for freight corporationsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
courier missions for other ships would be an interesting subject as courier packages are a pain in the  but seeing as how a fitted ship would be in the courier container i dont see why it wouldnt work out with courier contracts but if there was anything other than an assembled ship in the courier container the ship would not be able to haul iti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
ah never had your wormhole pos camped 247 by a major invader huhmost wormhole corps are small size the current wormhole mechanic is a good thingyou want to stabilize my wormhole so you can shove endless amounts of t3s through it would you consider letting me moon mine in my wormhole now that would make you 00 carebears really cryoh and for crying out loud you wanted the 5000 members in your alliance so you could own 00 whats the problem having a hard time supporting all of themcry harder ill send some tissues i suggest you figure out how to make 00 profitableotherwise it seems like youre a failure at 00 and just want to mooch off the pros who specialize in making team work happen in wormholes certainly seems that way with lowsec incursions pathetic really pathetic
cant be arsed with changing account you need to have combat probes at highest strength meaning minimum size to find the t3s that were unprobable before  so the instaprobe does not exist unless the booster is dumb enough to hang around the celestial from which the prober drops his loadif you can do it in one or two cycles against a t3 that is not dumb then you are using a hack but as i have said previously by all means lets keep the links nice and cozy but then i want to be able use my logis from anywhere in system as well  the effect is infinitesimal in power and doesnt scale at all by comparison so that should be fine rightit is just plain wrong that one can project the amount of power that links provide without needing to be anywhere near the action  makes for bad gameplay were it to be balanced then a semiafk client should be able to find the linkship just as it can be semiafk  and that is just silly  right
i like this idea but i think theres some compromise needed people pay for alt accounts just to run booster on them they invested billions in them either in plex or char bazaar you cant just take it away from themi would make it like that leave boosters as they are eventually nerf a little if needed  debatable but increase their effectiveness by 100 if on grid
i think removing off grid boosting will hurt more than it will help and puts too much advantage in the fleet that is already on grid i know that an off grid booster upsets people but its the only way to insure level playing field if hes sitting in a pos oh well take the pos down if hes in space scan him down and find him even if you dont point him he must warp and as command mods turn off in warp so the boosters are off also so task organize your attack and neutralize his boosters bring your own boosters to help too whatever everyone has the same ability to boost in a system but having to be on grid gives ridiculous advantage to the first on grid defense and especially to the already too prevalent kiting fleetsexample my fleet is trying to catch one or multiple targets in system perhaps baiting perhaps utilizing a warp in from a cloaky once the scan is achieved the tackler goes in i have interdiction manuevers and rapid deployment on when the tackler arrives we might get the point and lock him down but only if and only if hes not already aligned if he stays and is kiting still the rapid deployment and interdiction maneuvers might give the extra boost needed to get the scram and web in what would otherwise fail to reach as they burn out of range i cannot accompany him into the fight until the target is locked because i cannot boost while in warp if i have to wait until i pop on grid target is probably gone as my warp speed is slower if we fleet warp then its the slowest warp speed ship to the fleet and that negates the warp in to a large extent due to the target having already moved too far already part of the power of the interceptor isnt just mwd speed but warp speed to if hes tied to my warp speed that scan lock is now worthless as the targets now too far if we do it right once the target is locked down then i bring my mrym in and help with the kill and turn boosts back on but i only do this once i know the target targets are fully locked downif i couldnt do this then even more targets would just endlessly warp offburn away and get awaywin often a target will stay on grid and not warp away thinking he can win with just some little tackler on grid with him what do you think will happen if i bring in my bc or a t3 or a command ship instant running like 90 of people do already plus often we are trying to do multiple things in the system like block more than one gate at a time now i cant boost system wide why bother flying it then instead of seeing more command shipscommand modules etc youll see lessin other applications the fleet already on grid will have their boosts running and when the attacking fleet arrives they may not show up all at once sure preferred but when warping in at optimals different ships will arrive due to different warp speeds youll have to wait for boosting ships to arrive and then some of the key boosts such as info and skirmish might already be too late  as certain ships have already been jammed or escaped due to boostslack there offinally on grid is too squishy i mean you can play grid fu all day long and exploit the grid to your favor to isolate boosters from the combat fleet if your clever again favoring the defensethe best way to keep it relatively fair is system wide sure they can have a pos but you know what you rate some advantage for having a pos burn it down bring your own boosts whatever them being in a pos doesnt negate you bringing your boosts being on grid only denies the attacker too many options
not quite the whole point of bounties is to avenge a grievance whether that was from a crime or otherwise law only comes into the picture when its a legal autority placing the bounty underworld crimelords put bounties on peoples heads regardless of the legality of said bounty think jabbas bounty on han solohence a wardec being a requirement would simply be a nuisance outside of empireif there is a rebel group operating in npc nullsec raiding sovereign space then the sov holding alliance would benefit from having the ability to provide incentives through an ingame mechanism that works to their members or allies to hunt down said group if a wardec is a requirement then allies wishing to cash in on the bounty would also have to wardec the other alliance to claim payment even though theyre fighting in 00 anywayagain tying it to a portion of the ships value would avoid exploitation although exploiting it in this case may require burning a spy too
true enough i must have misread fromi assumed you were gathering destroyed module value from somewhere if you simply go by insurance payouts how do you deal with t2t3 tengus for instance are a fairly common lowsec ship and have a 5 million premium for an 18 million payout so in this proposed system a 600mil fit tengu pays out 12 million maybe i active tank my tengu and the price jumps up to 2 bil does the bounty hunter still only get 12 milbasically do you make a distinction between fits and at what point do you bring the player market into things and how do you prevent abuse if you do
fair enough it seems like a pretty marginal hole to me anyway  manipulating the market across the entire game in order to reduce the cost of clearing off a bounty seems like a hell of a lot of effort to me unless its a truly massive bounty if someone has the expertise and is prepared to go to all the trouble  expense of doing that then maybe theyre entitled to scrape off their bountyit occurrs to me that we could also further mitigate that hole by basing the bounty value of a ship or module on a 30day rolling average sale price of the components of that module that way controlling the small sentry rig market isnt enough you need to control the drone transceiver tripped power circuit and burned logic circuit market too much harder to doit would be more developmentally expensive than using the insurance price but this method would also solve the issue of realistic bounty values for t3 and t2 shipsit fails on assigning proper values for factionofficer mods  ships though unless you wanted to count them as their own component and just take the rolling average price theoretically this allows for manipulation but i think not in any practical way
im still waiting for a skill that allows corpses to be repackaged allowing us to have a chance at recovering their implants
unfortunately thats the harsh reality of eves current npe back in the day before ccp nerfed newbie sp new characters were able to jump into most activities on their first day nowadays new characters cant really do anything except mission run and mine believe me ive checked the starting skills are a joke and dont allow a newbie to do anything my main wrote a blog about this in response to the new dev blog the ease of eve at
my experience with the gms has generally been positive what sort of petitions do you make
hmm mostly mission bugs since 09 ive made 2 refund requests 3 if you count republic standing loss instead of reward from completing a faction mission successfully including the most recent both nonstanding refunds were refused one because the gm informed me that they could not tell where i was in space that the issue happened and the other because ui bugs are unprovable without a dev reporting that the bug was real
all my experience with gms has been negative tbh on the rare occasion i have had to ask for reimbursement for a loss that is due to serever side lag or issues has always been refused this wouldnt annoy me so much if it wasnt for teh fact i know several people who have had very similar losses reimbursed by the same gmsi love eve but the gm system is far to open to easy abuse ie if the gm likes you or if you are prepared to become such a nuisance that they will give you what you want to shut you up
you cant really expect to have a positive result when your most common answer to any issue is a prescripted sucks to be you answer i have lost a lot of ships to server crashes that were never reimbursed because the logs didnt show anything i lost a tengu in maze back when the jump gates were all arranged in a big circle got trapped dead center of it on warp in and couldnt get out i was killed by rats i got nothing on reimbursement because the logs didnt show anything but a week later ccp conveniently made a change to maze that separated out all the jump gates and fixed the issueso yeahccps track record on gm responses is pretty much  and due to the nature of the game it will likely never change
that does sound a lot like one of my petitions i was stuck on an invisible object petitioned while i was stuck waited for three hours no response finally died no refund either because the log didnt show where i was or what i was stuck on
this will never work as has been explained on a million other thread about this you will never get the risk adverse players in hi sec to play in lownull i have no idea why you even want to force them tosome people are happy to mine all day some like building ships others like to dabble in the markets a big chunk in hi sec like to run missions more power to them whatever it takes for them to log in and enjoy eve their waymissions are boring as sin once youve run them for the millionth time and eventually people will get bored and will want to try new things theres no need to nerf it just stop adding content to it so it becomes boring so quickly that anything else in lownull will seem really entertaining in comparisonthis way you dont annoy a large portion of the players hi sec people outnumber lownull by a huge margin dont forget this that want to continue running missionsi would also take issue with the people in this thread stating theres risk in lownull for ratting and plexingonce you are in a system theres virtually no way in hell you can die to anything unless you are stupid and dont watch intel channels or local i personally have sat for a day running plexes in branch with not another soul in the system in all the time i was there wheres the risk there time to nerf null judging by the ops logicthe only real risk is travelling through the gates but jump bridges reduce a lot of that as it stands i think hi sec is actually more dangerous as theres an awful lot of neutrals around that may or may not gankpod you for lulz mission runners have risks as well from griefers and ninjashi sec is safer but not totally safe as you will see if you bother to check stats on the map for kills in the last hour and 24 hours most of the big red blobs are in hi sectldr dont encourage ccp to nerf anything else just dont add anymore content for missions in hi sec
yet its by far more dangerous to undock in high sec than in null sec believe me i dont play this game seriously for a long time 15 year at better and few try before but ive spent more time playing missions in high sec than any activity in null sec and you can believe when i tell you null sec is 0 risk if you learn the simple basics that are bms and watch localbms and watch local standings something its impossible in high sec you dont even know if its a guy in your own corp that is going to gank you npc corps you never know if the smalest ship in the belt next to you is there to try to can flip you or just the warp in for the gank gang and what about jita and all the other big trade hubsthose are no mans land and where you can figure easily how concord reactioncoding is a jokethere are far hundreds more factionofficer fitted bstengus rating safely in null sec than you will ever see in the greatest mission hubs in high sec all together then add all the carriersuper carriertitan factionofficer fit rating dudes and cry me a river about high sec income that needs to be nerfedwhat needs to be nerfed in high sec is how easy it is for some risk averse pubbies to gank for max profit with 0 effort and dont start talking about ss because the one trying to will look like another stupid pawn incapable to understand that in a single couple of hours if you kill 1bs rat per system and move on in nulllow your ss raises at ridiculous speedsgank is a valid tactic but should not be the stupid mongoloid gameplay that is today and ss farming should be a real pain for months on a daily farming basis to get back to normalwhat needs to be nerfed is how easy it is to high sec risk averse pubbies that call them selves pirates to keep their free risk activity whilist destroying the game for a lot of players and also kicking ccp right in the balls because those customers gone will hardly return kick them from high sec make them get instantly ganked by concord and local police if they ever undock with something else than their pod make those risk averse pubbies really play the game and lets see then how much high sec income needs to be nerfedi cant wait to see those elite pvp pubbies come to null and have a taste of my auto canons but you know what they will probably leave the game because they are risk averse and everything they like is to fap in front of their kb full of mission faction fited bs ganked freighters at the undocks and awesome pvp stuff alike with the obvious neutral alts for jams and reps let them leave hope they get their ass kicked by the door closingmissions are boring in your personal opinion by the way theyre so boring as you say that the richest players in eve did a lot of those gazillions isk they swim in all day long by selling omega implants they got with lps and guess what those are null sec pirate missions awesome its really boring 1b the implant actually in jita hehits the oposite that must be done lvl5 in nulllow no one does them bring them to high sec crush the lps market people will eventually get bored and start using a lot more faction shipsfit for pvp isnt that niceactually who wins something with lpsincursion runners that are the sames all the time in high sec and the sames in null sec they get gazillions of lps they transform later in whatever empire lps and so on plus see their wallet blink like you could only dream ofthe issue is that incursions are not for the common player you need to have a lot of spare time and play with the same dudes a lot try to join an high sec incursion just like that and see what happens if youre not all 5s with the pubbie vindicators fit he wishes and same for whatever ship you can always sit ther and wait its wow on steroids but worstexactly but not no matter how just nerf tech moon and all moon minerals to the ground and bring those to all players instead of some in the alliance alliance and corporations wealth should come from the number of rich players in and willing to put their isk on the table to controlkeep something not from afkpassivewhatever stuff any idiot with an iteron quafe plus can suck up just by installing a pos in 10minutes and threat everyone because he can drop hundred titansscssome are already working on pocos taxes and increasing the taxes to their own alliance mates at 15 saw this lately in goon space seems their alliance mates are getting 15 butt hugs and some other regions in other alliances at 5ccp nerf this if its not npc pocos then tax should not be possible to raise above 10 by alliances and im quite sure that even at 10 tax rate the monthly income per poco starts at least at 1billion profitwhat needs to be nerfed is how easy it is for some megacorp or alliance to sit there and get gazillions of isk out of no where with rents taxes pi taxes bounty tax moon goo and a lot of more funky stuff actually high sec and null sec mechanics are so flawded by players driven content but mostly ability to exploit basic rules that ccp will not have the choice at some point but to make high sec totaly safe and increase significantly wars in null sec
the reason why highsec can be dangerous is that you do missions all at the same place its a reason why ccp removed the quality level is beacuse a lot of missioners in highsec is stacked in 1 system highsec isnt risk free you will still get concord unless your stupid and play the bait of the griefers when i did missions in highsec i was smart to not take their bait even though this is some time ago if more people moved to nullsec it wouldnt be so risk free that is the reason i want more people to come to 00 that is why i made this proposal and jumpbridges is not as safe as it used to be just run around and camp the stargets between the jb systems which me and my corp has done for a year in drone russian space and this has fruited around 1700 kills in about 9months time
agreed in principle basically the flow should go like thislowest income  highest safety  hiseclowsec is very dangerous income should be substantially higher than hisec in every aspectnullsec is very dangerous but can be made safer by utilising huge amounts of isk and man hours to do so so should have the highest incomewormhole space should be roughly in line with nullsec in income as the dangers and so on are similar in elevel but different in natureyou should never be able to make the most isk in the safest environment which currently you can and dont be a  and tell me how hisec is dangerous its only dangerous if you are stupid
you think nullsec is very dangerous lol pathetic highsec carebears dont have a clue
heres the essential problem i see and its easily observable prices on everything has been going through the roof and its because of isk inflation as it stands with incursions fw missions plexing etc there is too much isk being poured onto the market with no actual products being added for the most part prices go up and mining becomes less attractive because people see how much money you can make on incursions and the like mining just doesnt compete anymore as a way to make isk so less items are being built making prices go up again
i have to agree with tallian on this one the importexport of the overview settings works fine for the vast majority of eve players who will probably only import their corpalliancefc preferred overview settings oncethis aint broken so no need to fix it
hmmm you all are still trying to limit a game that is not supposed to have limitationsif you want to do something about the supercap problem i suggest you train up some nice dreadnought skills find about 50 other friends and do just thatif this is really a problem for you go shoot them man up and be a hero instead of whining out of gameand please dont argue with me until youve done the damage projections on how quickly 50 dreads take down a titan psoh and yes you will probably lose your dread maybe thats too much of a risk for you id risk it for taking out his titan but maybe heres the real issue risk averse players who dont want to teamwork with others to drop titansgood luck with your proposal 1
fly a combat cap ship into highsec thenjust because its a sandbox doesnt mean there arent limitations it just means that the limitations should be applied with as delicate a hand as the designers can manage
hey if ccp will remove these stupid cyno restrictions i will gladly fly some pew pew caps into hisec
2012 jan 14 plraidenncevoke fleet with 100 titans and 400 supercarriers
i think the easiest solution to this problem is remove turrets from titans seriously why do they even have them in the first place turret damage should come from dreads only as the titans have their dd for capitals and structures no need for the ridiculous situation we have now with titans instapopping rifterscarriers and super carriers as so ubiquitous that anyone dropping them will be hotdropped in return and as much as fighters do some damage to subcapital fleets they are a lot less effective and just like any other drone they can be destroyedcarriers and super carriers without drones are pretty useless as an offensive weapon even though they can still provide rri really do think the problem is not capital ships themselves just the stupid situation with titans
wowyou linked me a photo big whoop not impressed unless you get me a pic of the titan pilots tears when his titan goes poof in under 30 seconds ever had 50 dreads siege on your titan the tactic is sound its not a matter of whether the dreads will survive they wont and isk wise you may spend more to kill one titan however a titan is much harder to acquire than a dreadnought so yes man up oh and you wont have any triage carriers on field for that titan 
this is a simple and easy way to do this yes teh titan should have to be fleet command position if its in fleet the fleet should haev a critical mass 100 is reasonable to be able to even put the titan in it you coul do similar with supercarriers too say only allow 1 supercarrier in a fleet for every 50 pilots so a max of 5 supercarriers in a max size fleetthe only thing that i can see happening is that in peopels home systems youd get titans and supercarriers flying along with you fleetless and therefore disabling teh limiting factors so possibly limit that by removing the ability to rep in any way including cap any ship that isnt in fleet with you this would allow people to field their massive ships in home defence in huge numbers if they wanted to but suffer some drastic limitation most importantly a travelling fleet would be limited to 1 titan and 5 supercarriers and only this at a max size fleet
again just for youwe realized you dont know what happen in the game you think it about 30 sec a titan with 50 dread where is 500 supercaps and support fleet  i realy dont like retards who know nothing from something but talk idiot things you cant kill anything there the tactic is sound oh my man today the tactic against supercaps is bring more supercaps no one using dreads again supercap blob because they are so useless most of supercap pilots went to the alliances such as raiden or pandemic legion which have the most supercaps and those alliances made blueblobfestthe biggest alliance is the goon in the game they have over 6000pilot but they dont want to bring their dread fleets there because dread so useless against massive supercap fleets and they dont want to lost themdo you think they or any big alliances cant bring 300 dreads against supercap blobs  they can but dont want to losing them and wasting resources over and overand yes i linked you a photo because you i guess you live in high sec and we know you never see 500 supercaps and i show you what happen in the present days in 00
carriers still have drones fyi its just super carriers that lost them carriers are effectively unchanged other than t2 triagewhich is much happy times
not many folks here may know of future crew or skaven however they were one of the first wellknown demoscene groups skaven is the name of one of the group members who produced a lot of music for future crew and he still continues to create music today for computer games i think that if ccp could hire this guy to create some tunes for eve and perhaps make the music more adaptive to whatever the player is doing this could liven up the game a bit for those of you not familiar with future crew you can check them out at the following website
bump for more exposure and support i would like to see this idea taking on a role in new edeni am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
1this petition needs to stay on the first page
i saw a great warp effect that was from a scifi game modtech demo light and fabric of space around planet warped and stretched in direction the ship travelled off in  anyone got a linkedit thinking about it  i remember it was a fan effort it basically showed a ship entering warp as observed from nearby ships and looked very very cool
o boy what a joke guys guys why is the price on items that are very easy to gain so high  o you mean half the npc space will shoot me if i gather those items o i dont want to do them why is there no supplies  why are the prices so high i want my lp rewards my lp i need my lp guys guys tags are broken btw what you propose would make it worst since none in their right mind would run any faction missions
whoops my bad
supported
wow youre one of those folks who completely lost connection with reality youre so damn stuck in eve world that you see freedom of others speech as your own right what you say is sacred if ccp will ever add respec im sure youll still be stuck in eve anyway or maybe a bit more on forums trolling about it but then others will not give a damn about itif people were not so insisting on ideas reopening old topics there would have been very little changes in eve as they would just disappear with pointless answers like yours if youre against something state your opinion and shut up and dont try to shut up others also get a life

tradiotionally eve has been a harsh world where live with your mistakes is the standard mantra in such a world perhaps retraining skills does not fit well it also doesnt fit with the rp aspect  you cant respec your training in the real world after allon the other hand if ccp see reskilling as an important way to up subscriptions then this proposal seems a less unreasonable approach than many you could even imagine a rp scenario to explain for example how neural wiping whilst you sleep creates space for new skills to be injected unusually rapidlyim not sure ccp would be right to imagine that this will increase subs  maybe people buy new subs to train extra toons the way they wanted them as i did for an ubersalvagereprocessing toon whereas in the new world they would just respec their existing toon
in the interest of prosperity and no pink penis coloured ships ive created a survey on ship customisation to submit to ccp while there have been many topics on this subject there has been little data gathered from pilots this survey is light in nature and doesnt go into too much detail and will take you less than 2 minutes a more specific survey will be created if enough participants take part to make the results meaningful and my final proposal will be based of these resultsdiscourse comments and suggestions are most welcome and your opinion matters regardless of whether you are for or against please do so in this thread or stimulate discourse in your corp and get them to take part too p

they should modify all payouts regardless of location with output from an algorithm containing residents visitors and deaths read base it on actual risk rather than theoretical riskbut of course that would mean lowsec gets the best income as it has the most risk with null a distant second so doubtful that such a thing makes it by the null censors
id like to propose a different way of looking at hisec incomes
i fail to understand why so many miss the pointin the balance between risk and reward perhaps it is not the reward that needs balancing but the risk things stay in high sec because so many players are risk averse ccp has tried many times at the whims of folks like the op to adjust this but far too often they miss the markyou could move all level 4 missions ice datacore production and the like to low sec or 00 and it would have a far less profound affect than adjusting riskcase in pointt3 interdiction nullification and sensor amplification modules the rewards did not change yet far more people were are willing to risk sneaking into lower security since there was the perceived chance they might survive more than a few secondsjust a few ideas make npc pirates more likely to attack new people that enter a complex or deadspace allow modules that can burst confuse probes allowing for a speedy get away create tanky industrials and exhumers that can actually defend themselves or at least survive the most trivial attacks changing rewards will not affect behavior other than cancelled subscriptions instead adjust mechanics that make it more possible to evade and survive in lawless space in a pve ship no matter how much you adjust rewards a large number of people will find it more profitable to simply do more volume of the activity that is safer than less volume of an activity they perceive guarantees lossmy 2 isksbe careful what you think for your thoughts become your words be careful what you say for your words become your actions be careful what you do for your actions become your character and character is everything  author unknown

you cant and as far as i know have never been able to dd structures removing the turrets makes titans into mobile jbs and little else nerf the tracking and maybe the damage
i dont see anybody crying over the battlecruiserbattleship blobbing issue
thats because a bcbs blob can be countered fairly easy with proper fleet comp for instance t3 gangs are a handy counter to alphafleet the only countercomp to beat the super blob is more of the samethis has been explained so many time only the willfully ignorant can still fail to understand it
midlong term supercaps should be reconfigured to roles other than direct combat to disincentivise supercap blobbing and onedimensional arms races
the skill advanced drone interfacing has always been one which confused many players it the past dcus which the skill allowed the use of could be fit on any capitol ship making the old drone moros op then it became a carrier only skill but now carriers can only use fighters the name which never did what people thought it should is now completely outdated and wrong it has nothing to do with drones anymore it needs to be changed to reflect what it actually does it give you more fighters i believe that the name fighter coordination would be more self explanatory and prevent confusionnaturally the description would have to be changed additionally the name and description of drone control units would need similar updates i think fighter coordination unit would make sense but im partial to fighter coordination link for storyroleplay reasons if we wanted to keep the acronym dcu the same dogfight coordination unit could work but im not crazy about the name besides often players just keep old acronyms regardless of what the item is called eg cnrwith luck this will reduce confusion the ambiguity between fighters and drones and requests to put the module on a dominix sadly we will get requests for an extra drone module from those who want more drones rather than moar drones oh wait we already get those links for reference
yeah a better name would definitely be a good thing i have a friend who trained it to 5 after training drone interfacing 5 but i doubt hell ever actually make it into a carrier and i havent had the heart to tell him how worthless that skill is for him a name which properly describes it would definitely be a good idea
thats supercarriers regular old carriers can use drones just fine
thanks for the correction i must have misread the patch notes i do read them but its been a months since the change still i think the name change would prevent confusion a note that a dcufcu lets carriers use extra drones would say what the unit really does
i propose mxzf for csm candidacy based on his well developed ideas and in depth analysis on the forums i believe he would be one of the most eligible people for the csm
probably one of the few people id bother to vote for but are you mxsf as far as im aware you cant randomly nominate people they have to step forward lol
no im not mxzf and if we cant randomly nominate people then that just blows big salty ones
lol i appreciate the offer however i have enough stuff going on in real life that i dont feel like i could do the position justice i really do appreciate it but i feel i must decline the suggestion maybe someday but not this particular csm

an easier fix is simply to make it so that you can set standings to the bounty a setting when placing the bounty that says only people with a certain standing level or greater can collect that way any of your friends can collect or you can find an actual bounty hunter and set him to positive standings so he can collectusing this system you could even set it so that you could set bounties on entire corporationsalliances at once i envision a bring me the heads of all insert your most hated alliance here scenario easy peasy lemon squeezy1 to the op for a good suggestion that i support wholeheartedlywhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it

i think one key improvement can be madeprovide a way for newbies to reward corps for recruiting them and have the tutorial explain that they should hang on to that reward long enough to for them to be sure they are not being scammed because the 1 thing you need in eve especially when you first start is a good corp to fly with
i think it is an excellent ideait will increase the immersion a lot also giving many opportunities for gameplayill put some ideas here haulers going from station to station in high sec manymanymany of them immersion needs them hauling expeditions in low sec the size of the expedition will depend on the collateral deposited by the player large to huge the player will decide the escorts and the haulers strategy for the journey the haulers must have lots of hp so as for the trip to have a chance of success the payout must be also big other possible awards are corporation standingslp or escorting ratingperhaps a new type of agent for hauling missions or rather a hauling office npc factional fleets fighting battles in the border systems seems a great idea the battles should last for a very long time with npc reinforcements rallying to both sides as to fill the losses and players taking place should have lots of fw rewards also factional police should join in the battle the final outcome will be decided by which side had the most losses but after hours  or maybe days  of fightingto make it more fun perhaps a warp scrambling field with a range of a few hundred km should be in effect npc miners in belts new kind of ships travelling like ambassadorial flagships or solar sail ships having solar flare races taxi shuttles and of course space liners huge space farmingspace industryspace recreation etc ships traffic between planets or moons and stations with special reentry vehicles also stratoplanes for planetary trafficthe players should be able to interact with some of these with some notwhenever npc ships are destroyed in high sec the concord dealing with the attacker will also collect the loot to make spacelane disrupting nonprofitable in high sec perhaps also for many of these npc in low sec there should be concord responsein general the space should be much less empty than it is right now take a look outside at the street and imagine that only hitmen outlaws and police should pass that would be much less than the traffic you see is it not

good god please yes a big resounding yes ive been a serial entrepreneur in eve and have started many corporations since i started playing back in 2005 many of which recruited exclusively new players the easier we can make things on ceos and the more smoothly we can get corporations to run and the sooner we can get new players into good smoothly running corporations that have ceos that arent suffering from severe burnout the better eve will bethis more than anything is what eve needs powah to the peoplewhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it

i agree with you on most of your post thing is the vast majority of gamers are casual and cant afford a second toon or biomassing and starting over i dont think ccp would lose a lot of subs with a respec option just from the lack of needing a second toon most if not all of us have a second toon out of necessity capital cynos warfare links etc we might see a lot of people ragequit because they simply cannot handle change and think they are losing some sort of advantage if a respec option was made availablebut i think that would be the limit of lost subs would ccp gain more subs with a respec option i doubt it would increase the rate at which new players try the gamea free to play option would do that but it would help with retaining more players that would otherwise leave due to the lack of a respec option once they realized they screwed their toon and it would take another several months to catch up to where they want to bewhat if the respec option was limited to the skill category the skills are in in other wordsmissile launcher sp stays in the missile category engineer sp stays in the engineering category navigation sp stays in the navigation category and so on granted this would still allow a player to go from being a full caldari toon to a full gallente toon or whatever but at least you couldnt go from being a miner or trade toon to a full combat toon
ffs this topic shows up every other mondayno respec ever stop kicking a dead horse we dont need and dont want respec
oh look at thati do believe hes mad bro stop the evemail spam
obviously if it comes up every other monday then there must be people that want a respec option if ccp has proven anything it is that you have to kick the dead horse for quite a while before it gets done
so if i keep scraeming like a little 3 year old saying i should get paid 1 billion isk a week for playing eve online every other day then ill get itoh wat stop the evemail spam
gms dont exists in eve nowdays i think its one of devs getting bonus payment for answering petitions once per two weeks that it
imho capchas are simplistic visual puzzles that are very limited in scope and although in their more recognisable forms arent really implementable into eve without breaking the feel of rp the idea of puzzles can be used but has to be created and tested against botsmining has always been a semiafk profession but i think that needs to change and along with it the rewards need to increase along with it else people wont be tempted to explore it as a source of incomemining needs to become a skilled profession not an afk activity so much like mining gas clouds now there should be real risks to all mining but the deeper you drill the higher the chance of a catastrophic explosion or temporary immobilisationthere should be tell tale signs both visuallyaudiably and a combination of both and other more abstract forms offlining moduleschange in local modebehaviour etc that are warning signs to change the type depth speed duration and intensity of the mining cycle to stave off disasterthese signs should be easily noticable in shallow mining where the profits are minimal and less obviousmore obscure the deeper you mine for higher and faster profitsnow i dont claim to know exactly what form this should appear as to be as difficult as possible for botting programs to pick up upon but the above does correlate to what may be seen as puzzlescapchasyou could also include warning signs not possible to be noticed by a single player on high end high yield mining to encourage cooperation to get the best resultssolow end low yield  obvious signs varying wildly but of low intensitylow threat  low threat penalties if signs are ignoredlow end high yield  increasingly obscureless noticable signs including hudmodule oddities etc  moderate penaltieshigh end low yield  increasingly obscure less noticable signs etc  moderate to high penaltieshigh end high yield  least noticable signs becoming not noticable to lone miners  extreme penaltiesthats how i see it anyways
one idea to work against bots why not make all the ore have to be looted from the rock and not directly drop into the cargo holdi am all in favor to any idea that make those at the keyboard gain an advantage from those that simply afk mine
wont workbots are not as restarined or dumb as you think they are stop the evemail spam
bots can easily identify colours  use keyboard shortcuts click various aspects of the screen and react to things that occur on screen the advanced ones even sniff out data coming to the client from ccps servers that even us as human players dont see one of the main reasons why i want ccp to stop sending clients all the data and then having the client filter the data from what clients should see to what they shouldntits horrendous tbh

ahuhso when are you not so ignorant gentlemen going to realize the only way to do that is to expand the range of capital ships to allow thisim all for bringing in more super cap hulls that would be earmarked as antisuper cap dps only but that is just compounding the problem by allowing us a wider selection of super cap hulls to counter super caps witha better solution would be to expand the capital base with t2 items and a wider variety of t1 hulls that could be used effectively in groups of 23 to neutralize a single sctitan as opposed to the current mechanics of requiring 100s of sub caps and a gang of caps to take down the supers antisupercap hulls will still be vulnerable to sub caps as most caps are now since they will be based on their hulls and attributes so a solution like that will not force alliances to double the amount of sub caps they bring to a fight preventing more sub cap blobbing it will encourage more capital blobs that will even out the playing field and counter the super blobdemanding that sub caps be able to counter the supers without allowing supers to wtfown sub caps is one way pvp and not very sandboxy or rock paper scissors at all for people who are demanding proper fleet comp mechanics
lemme guess best way to deal with a mouse problem is to turn a bunch of snakes loose in your housethe answer to imbalanced supercaps is not more supercaps
imho yes supercaps are imbalanced this is due to 2 things that i can see1 the amount of endgame ship types are being determined by an ever increasing userbase meaning these shiptypes will only increase when titan and supercap bpos are in circulation basically the point the op had2 immunity and infinite variables youve seen this in the aoe dd u see it in the current supercap ewar immunity u see it in the current titan dd as far as trackings concerned u see it in the infinite amount of moongoo moons have you see it in some respects in asteroid belts when they instantly respawn after dowtimeproblem 2 is a biiig issue because not only in an economic form its equivalent to hyperinflation the more stuff is about the cheaper it becomes but in a militaristic form the infinite variable has been seen in wormholes with the supergun and devs picked up on it and nerfed it rightly so supercaps have issues because theyve been treated as the exception to the rule of ship balancing ewar immunity i fear is only an attribute because devs have not truely fixed all ewar mods so opening up supers to being eward will mean theyll get eward far to effectively ie supers with near 0 targetting range lock times that take till downtime or more to lock another supercapconcerning titans their old school aoe dd caused serious lag from killmails one of the major reasons for the nerf but the root cause was never tackled just made obsolete the aoe affected the entire grid it was an infinite variable affectall when it never should have been and now titans dont have it they still have a dd with an infinite variable  trackingonly ccp instead of tackling the root cause of the issue precrucible they sidestep it and change dds only to be used on caps and supers effectively sweeping the problem under the carpetimho we need to put pressure on ccp to remove these infinite variables because theyre the ones that are forcing our combat into a mould that we all find both distastefull and uncomfortable

hi alla simple suggestion made by a friend of mine who simply doesnt use forums enoughthe broadcast settings should be grouped and toggled like the various tabssettingsfilters of overviewthe idea is to eliminate the need to reconfigure the broadcasts you receivesendsee by role a logistic pilot only needs a subset of the bcasts so does a main fleet damage dealer and they are different from traveling filterslet us configure tabs for broadcast settings let us save and restore and pass to friends tofrom xmls like the overviewanother ui papercutthanks
1 ive got maxed trade skills keeping track of all my orders can get very difficultwhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
1i second that idea and i believe its pretty straightforward right now i try to keep track of my orders more easily by using typical numbers in my orders a scheme that feels like stone ageactually i would go even further than this in your order
anyone find this interesting at all
i am definitely in favor of this itd be great at the very least ccp could add a new column in the market interface to tell you who youre buying from before you buy it it really sucks when you go to buy that nice expensive battleship only to discover that you just made a rival that much wealthier1whether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it

i think this is the main reason why we wont see the change ccp is very happy that people are obligated to create these alt accounts to be competitive in this game i think they probably see all the alts that have been created for this purpose what they miss is number of people who tend to lose interest in eve because they think dual boxing alts sucks and yet increasingly you must have these alts to be competitive eveagain i think if they gave us crews that we could fill our ships with that would give us the same boosts as the boosters give no they wouldnt combine with boosters i think we would have a solution you could either pay isk for the crew in your ship or you could carry around your booster alt make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
that runs into the problem of the perp just not logging on
firstly i support this idea its pretty much awesomesecondly i think it should be based on market value using 3090 day adjusted averages of the real markets using some clever economic stats to eliminate outliers is something ccp knows how to doanyone who can control an entire market for multiple months is putting enough effort in to permit them to game the system a littlealso given the only way to manipulate the market like this is to throw lots of money at it this would actually more likely cost the bounty target more than they could gain and would also generate activity on these niche markets making further attempts to game the system harderso in effect gaming the marketbased bounty system would be very hard expensive and limited in how many people could pull it offi think you need to be able to put your bounty contract out to be visible to these kinds of people standing above x sec status abovebelow x whitelist of corps so you can choose known goodrep bounty hunters my corpalliance anyone private to specific person requestacceptance of bounty hunting rights so you can individually vet potential hunters only useful for extremely highvalue targetsi think that an active kill right should be an option not a requirement it should be searchable though so a bounty hunter can choose to only search for highsec targetswe should be looking to place bounties on as many of the piratesplayers in lowsec as possible to encourage lowsec pvp people who get ganked slap a ransom on the person who killed them and then other people go hunting for those playersit may also be worthwhile to be able to place a kill rightfree bounty on an entire corporation for example  if someone wanted to harass the bards in rancer they could place bounties on clearing out the dirty pirates in effect pvp missionsthe more people in lowsec with bounties on their heads the better and more fun lowsec will bei also think that the 1 sec status requirement might hinder more than help although i could be convinced otherwise
this is not really possible as we would effectively removing a ship that some people have invested a lot of time and money to train into we need to find a way to adjust change and rebalance them without making them not worth flying otherwise we might as well just remove them from the game at which point we would still have a lot of upset titan pilots
supercarriers  giant corp hangars capable of replacing losses on the fly ships only so that they dont step on jump freighters toes im thinking a couple fleets worth of losses combined with a megatank to keep all of those expensive ships safe you get popped you pod over to the nearest supercarrier and hop in a new ship already fitted and ready to rock need to change from your t3 fleet to your bs fleet on the fly great easy remove the drones your fleet is your drones still does logi make the clone vat bay worthwhile requires subcaps to be usefultitans  jump bridges and doomsdays buff the doomsdays up to be a reasonable counter to the new style of supercarrier remove the turretsand get rid of the ewar immunity on bothwhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
supercarriers are pretty well balanced at the moment and i dont think they need to be changed up again this quickly however speaking directly to your idea i dont see how this would be any better than getting podded to your station grabbing a new ship and taking a mothership bridge back into the freythis goes beyond the scope of my proposal as it would affect fights between subcap fleets more than capitalseither way i am not sure i like the implications of this ideasuperweapons are one of the biggest problems with titans at the moment and making it capable of popping a supercarrier really bad idea my suggestion included a damage buff for the superweapon via a tradeoff that turned it into a damage over time ability that slowly increased as you continued to fire at a single targeti would not be opposed to supers losing their ewar immunity but in exchange they should get fairly impressive stats to replace them 50 warp core strength and enough sensor strength to require at least 20 subcaps to affect them would probably sufficeedit if this were to happen i also think that regular capitals should also get some love say 5 warp core strength and double their current sensor strength
evelopedia was probably not around when you were first starting but it is an excellent resource these days i wish i had access to it when i started 4 years agothe new player experience category includes topics such asthe agent findercan flippingcareer agentsrookie lowsec survival guidepiracy guidefitting shipsakita ts golden rulesjoining a corporationand a lot more and thats just in the npe category the guide category has 191 pages in it right now the evelopedia has tons of great information in it and additional references to outside materials as wellwe only need to point new players to it
this would be a great idea shouldnt be hard at all and would easily fit into the thousand papercuts categoryi doubt it would make an fcs job any more enjoyableperhaps easier though1
start the threadi will support you
i dont understand the concept of removing skills there really would be no benefit that i can see other than you can wave at people going hey i got mining level 5 removedit takes like 5 days for anyone to train mining to level 5 if you have been playing eve for 1 year or so that training time is insignificant just spend 5 days training the skill you want trained it seems like it would take just as long as it would take for these untraining queues
this is agreat idea but it will be burned by botters yeah for sure maybe a bot will be able to do the game but maybe not and it will involve a lot of programming if ccp wants to make it hard for a bot to mine there in lies the problem ccp dont want to make it hard for botsccp wins from bots through subscriptions but hey up rmt is a win for players and a loss for ccp both stem from the bots so its a double edge sword for ccp that is why they have only ever targeted rmt and bots ahve only ever been a colleteral casuilty such as in unholy rage
i like the ideaif anything it will bring a little more balance to mining rewarding those in riskier areas of eve as for the capcha issuewhy not just make mining more interactive in general i keep thinking of something from mass effect 2 where when in your little hover car you can extract minerals from sites but as you hold the button down to do so the site starts pushing your hover car around more aggressively until it either pushes you off the site or you successfully extract the mineral this would work for mining lazers if done right as well granted bots will in time find a way around it they always do there is quite litterally nothing you can do to stop a bot developer from finding a way but that isnt the point the harder we make it for them the betterwithin reason it has to be fun for the player too
other than the fact you think mercoxit is a moon mineral it happens to be the asteroid type that you get morphite from  the idea isnt terriblechance based is a no no though make it need modulated deep core strip miners to actually be able to mine
thanks for the catch i have changed it to reflect technetium i should add that my actual blog post starts with me telling folks that i am industrially inept in game
while more interactive would be great the downside is that if you force people to be focused on that more than on localdscanetc they just become easier targetswith that said reworking things this way would throw a huge monkey wrench into the mineral market yay for the people who can stay alive  this is bullshit for everyone buying minerals it might even go so far as to help draw miners into lowsec since their defence guys can actually violence the bad guys without concord stepping in
exactly something like this could be the carrot to draw miners out of highsec you could actually make lowsec rewards be equal to or greater than nullsec imho the lowsec rewards should be a bit higher than nullsec in this system i see the risk being much higher in lowsec than null you cant bubble up gates nor control the traffic thru it as easily as big alliances do in 00im thinking the lowsec pirates wouldnt mind hunting for miners or their haulers either
i hadnt even thought of that but i think thats a great idea i dont live in a hole so im not sure if being able to use a cloning vat in a wormhole is game braking but from what i know about whs it doesnt sound game braking mainly because its only a way in not a way of moving items out it sounds like it would help with new recruits greatly and if you get people in there is still the logistics of them needing a ship
problem with the implant idea is the ships owner has the ability to destroy your jump clone or the ship could be destroyed all togetherim sure everyone would appreciate getting their jump clone with billion isk implants destroyed just for kicks the option to upgrade a medical clone would be nice though
as a two week old player i think i possess a unique insight into both the successes and the shortcomings of this game more so than people have become used to the way it is as such this is what i would like the csm to bring to the ccp and anyone who says they are willing to champion this will have my vote for csm regardless of other platforms edit unless you think hi sec war deccing isnt broken p thats how important i think this is and how much i believe an interface overhaul is neededbookmarks viewable in overview not the first time this has been brought up but this still remains a gaping flaw in the current systemhotkeys coming from starcraft 2 i cannot believe how lacking customizable hotkeys are in eve i cant even make a hotkey to enter a wormhole wtf i would like to see a total overhaul of the hotkey system allowing players to modify almost any command you make in the game into a hotkey would this be overwhelming to a new player maybe but as they learn the game and they see what actions they perform frequently this would be a huge asset examples add contact bookmark location as is i have to open people and places select the correct tab then click add location 2 uneeded clicksother stuff why is the member count of a given corporation under the attributes tab but that of an alliance is under members i have to constatnyl switch between tabs when viewing these stats  unecessary and cumbersome imoim sure there are many more but i have run out of time please add your own suggestions to this thread its time for eve to enter the modern user friendly era of pc gamingadditional editsopen cargo why is there not a hotkey for thiscloseminimize windows rather than having to click to find a window then manuever to the miniscule top right corner to minimizeclose why cant i simply click somewhere on the window and hit backspace to close it for examplewhen hitting tab to minimize all windows if i then maximize 1 window hitting tab again does nothing i have to manually close the window i opened then hit tab and all windows then re open this seems broken and counter intuitive if i want to view a particular tab i should be able to open it then hit tab again to reopen all windows
because you didnt set one option is in the escape menu  cant get in game right now to give you the absolute location though  because backspace is used to remove unwanted characters you should be able to use any other key combination though see the first point iirc its ctrl  tab as default
i have been looking for the open cargo button for weeks if it is in fact there i will feel like an idiot but as is ive poured over those settings for the last 2 weeks and have never seen it additionally if the hotkey does in fact exist why is it not displayed under the selected item tabthank you for clarifying these several issues but again the fact that i needed to come here to have them clarified is a detractor of the current system i have played pc games for 10 years and i think i know my way around a settings menu to have to come here to find this information rather than having it easily and obviously displayed ingame is a good reason to change these things
as velicitia pointed out there are many many hotkeys in the game which are not bound by default this is better than having them all bound by default imo because it lets you choose what you want bound and how rather than every key combination being already bound for instance i know that when i set up a new client i have to rebind about a dozen commands just to get the altdre and a couple other keys freed for the commands i want to bind to them its a pain lol
you guessed wrongand poor analogy runs of fantasizing about ships bigger than titansadding more super caps will just add variety to your problem i say your problem because i have no problem adding more supers to eve but i digresswhat we need is antisupercap t2 capitals so it would be like releasing mutant elephant eating jaguars with laser beams attached to their headsbeats the crap out of releasing a swarm of termites more sub caps to do a jaguars hob
wow just wowyou changing than animals doesnt make my point less valid this isnt wow there should not be end game gear and i am sorry for those pilots who think that eve works that way but it doesntone of the things that keeps people from starting this is the belief they will never catch up to vets this is true til you start adding more and more capships those create a gap that alters the fundamental aspects of eve one of the selling points is that a noobie in a rifter can change the course of any battle except that supercaps are completely invulnerable to them at least a carrier or dread that noob rifter can tackle and hold for his friends to catch up to a titan or super will laugh and jump outeve is not supposed to work this way and you want to make it worsewhy because vets are entitled to being brokenly op does your ego need that much pampering
no what we need is balance across the ship classes as a whole not a bring capitals or dont bother showing up attitudepredominion we more or less had that because supercaps were generally not suitable for front line direct combat roles so there was a place in the game for combined operations where subcaps and regular caps to carry out particular important roles alongside each other carriers killed bss dreads killed carriers and bss killed dreads the only fly in the ointment was the aoe doomsday marginalising any subcap which didnt have 70000 ehp post dominion the idea of combined ops became more marginalised because the solution to all available problems became throw all your supercaps at it leading to a onedimensional arms race to acquire more of them than your opponents thats where we are todaytake away the direct combat abilities of supercaps get them off the front lines and into supporting roles and youll see a much healthier game
do you know what is the rockpaperscissors game you can fights against bcbs fleets with nice tactics ahacbc fleett3 fleetsb fleet other bs fleet etc can kill bs fleets or vicaversa every fleet has chances against the other one with good setup and tactics and at least 10 tactics working against thembut trying to fight against 500 supercaps with subcaps or common capitals you have no chance against them and the most important things all other ship is unuseable too i have no problem with supercaps  thats part of the game but their numbers is ridiculous highso many pilots have over 100m sp just like me but no matter if the pilots can fly with 250 ships because all useless against supercap blobs if they cant fly with supercap blobs too wasted sps if enemy just blobing with supercapsfurthermore no tactics working against supercaps just one bring more supercaps than your enemieswe saw what happened with atlas they had hundreds and hundreds cap pilots they used before 400 dreads in fleets but they could nothing against 500600 supercap blob and they losing their spaces within 2 weeks500600 supercapital such a drake fleet lol its shame for this gameover 4000 supercaps  thats really rare ships lol500 titan  ccp really read their own eve chronicles from rare titans need to change this supercap idiotism need increasing their value over at least 4050 billions or more supercarrier over 200 billionstitan the alliance incomes changed dramaticaly in the past years in the game and ccp did not take this into consideration thats was a big mistake from ccp and thats why their number grew so muchneed increasing their building times at least 3 months long period thats slowing down supercaps increasing numbers and give chances to killing them in the csaaneed change rare moon mineral rules permanent moon mining materials give advantages for big alliances without fightsand i almost forgot the other problem is the supercaps pilots dont want to be lost their ships because of this they moving to the biggest alliances where is the most supercaps are somehow need to change their numbers in a fleet
based off of first replynewer alliance or new players are put at a disadvantage and it becomes a war of the haves and the have notsi would rather be please by limiting the number of ships allowed in a systemtitian not produce an anti titan attraction field prevents more than 1 titan from being on the field at any one time or on the same grid or they may both blow upthis way 1 side as an advantage and but not an overwhelming advantage as 30 titanslimiting super carriers to 3 solar systembut i like the idea of a capital tackling ships or a tackling module for super caps
if this means what i think it meansnot entirely sure looks like a bad machine translation then putting a hard cap on pilots in system is a terrible idea you do that and we will put that many pilots in the system and in all the neighboring systems any time we want to take anythingyou dont seem to understand the numbers that the large coalitions can fieldyou have to provide a reason not to do that and hard capsay kind of hard limit actually are just begging to be abusededit you are in the cfc were you not there when we launched our branch invasion and had over 2000 people in fleets
the traditional solution is to let cats loose in your housemoar supercaps and more caps that are bonused to deal with supercaps
delete all super caps from gameproblem solved
guys they brought a bigger fleet than us damn blobbers
at this point i would almost entirely agree with this
expanding the number of capitals in the game isnt inherently a bad idea like many are suggesting however its not a magical solution like youre suggesting eve works well because it maintains a rochambeau atmosphere when you ship up to a bigger ship you gain many advantages but you also gain many disadvantages this forced fleets to operate in diverse fleets bc fleets die to bs fleets which die to cruiser fleets which die to bc fleets subcap fleets die to carriers which die to dreads which die to subcap fleets with the change to supercaps in dominion dreads were replaced with supercaps hence capitals die to supercaps which should die to subcaps which die to capitals however supercaps just dont have that vulnerability they effectively kill both capitals and subcapitals making them only vulnerable to bigger supercaps your suggestion of adding a capital ship to neutralize supercaps seems incredibly uninformed as supercapitals are designed to obliterate capitals a role that they are exceptionally good at the problem with supercaps is compounded by their huge ehp and enormous number of utility highs on supercarriers essentially they scale extremely well such that they are impossible to alpha and their turtle tank becomes extremely overwhelming when in numbers there are two big problems with supercaps at the moment 1 the turret formula doesnt scale well to the capital level essentially there is no damage modifier when shooting a small target with really big guns so glancing blows from a titan alpha smaller ships 2 capital rr scales endlessly with their base ehp alphaing capitals is unrealistic without dds and their officerlevel resists allow them to turtle tank large fleets removing the rr bonus on supercarriers would force them to hurdle making them much more vulnerable to separation from the fleet i think introducing a new capital ship weapon mechanics and probably skills too so that all capital weapons dont work well against moving subbs targets is in order this would include fighters so they dont hit bcs and smaller very well i would change the role of a sieged dread to actually be an antibs platform when sieged but pisspoor against subcaps otherwise siege dreads should still have poor and very poor performance against bcs and cruisers respectively this would leave carriers with its wide array of drones as an ideal antisubcap platform and the dread a decent antibspoorman structure shooting platform is this ideal i dont know but ill tell you what i do know
ya this is just a cosmetic change fact is extra drone control is the exception now fighter control is what works on both ship classes
so we have evemail calendar chat mailing lists and bulletins i think it would be an easy and extreme boon to have these exported to imapsmtp vcal xmpp and rssatom simple and concise
you can do that theyre all in the api just write a program that parses the api and lets you import it into your program of choice
you may be able to write a program for it but the common player doesnt have access to this type stuff aura is getting close but i still cant reply to evemail or checkedit bulletins without being in game or on evegate
lets add more fuel to this fire bumping for exposurei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
indeed jack would be nice to see this class of vessel in game
not supported as is i think its a better idea to transform supercarriers for this role essentially theyd be like ship hangar arrays in poses but mobile and with the typical supercarrier tank you can change strategies on the fly with them and replace losses very quickly itd also be even more of a pain to losethen you could remove the turrets from titans and tweak the way doomsdays work to be a solid counter two birds one stone supercap problem solved supercarriers function more like carriers ought to and titans are no longer wtfbbqpwnmobiles to anything but cap shipswhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
emptyquoting dread and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
please dont sully the thread with ideas about crews when i first started playing capsuleers flew all of their ships solo at some point this changed and its not a change for the better it belongs in a different threadleadership boosts on grid only pleasewhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
crews were always there in some form or another i have been playing since launch and i recall from the beginning asking if there were crews in the ships and having an answer of yes from multiple sources either waywhile i agree that the crew discussion is for another thread i do think he is on to something with his idea although if crews were introduced and the buff of a crew and fleet booster didnt stackwhat would be the point of having a fleet booster at all
why not have gang links work while in warp the commander boosts whoever is on the same grid that hes on even in warp if youre not on the same grid as your commander you dont get boostedwhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
to respond to that why not use a recon for that sort of job an azaru gets nice bonus to point rangeas for the opwhilst i am interested in this change i would prefer see that the bonus between cs and sc be switched which i feel is more the more important necessary update then allow this change to have some impact on the game first to see if offgrid boosting continues to require addressing
i like the idea pretty much some random thoughtsmitigating the impact of a bounty placed on me by manipulating the market  i see no problem it is hard to next to impossible to do and will be not 100 effective anyway if a hunted person wants and is able to do that  props for him harming a global mafia boss is a harder task than hitting back some street gang schmuckhowever this highlights most serious problem in this idea how to measure a value of a kill there are no official price indices accepted by ccp and permanently monitored or rather there are but completely formal and unrealistic the only more or less realistic system exists for t1 hulls insurance but they will be of a rather small importancemaybe it is a time to officialy embrace the fact that jita price is a best benchmark but then again what with deadspace or officer modules etc or imagine i kill my bounty target in a supercap there is no jita price for it second multiple copies of a bounty contracts i should be able to hire a few independent mercs to kill the same person thus defensive strategy like accepting a contract with an alt of a hunted or his friend will not work it will also create competition amongst hunters it should induce additional costs howevertheorising further a hunted may have an ability to get some info about status of his hunt  are the bounty contracts accepted or something something in the line of using locator agents sure some standings and payments must be involvedthird further granularity of a bounties kill right gives you an ability to declare a bounty on anyone but you also are able to declare bounty without it  but only if hunted has negative status if it is small you need to bribe a concord like a small criminal deserves only a warning not a capital punishment but a bribe may change the attitude if it is 5 or something you are bounty hunted at will  law enforcement system should encourage a personal initiative numbers are arbitrary of courseinsert some waste of screen space here
my point is that supercaps all caps really ought to be there to provide extremely heavy duty support to a much larger subcap fleet when they become wrecking balls in and of themselves we wind up like we are today the design should be such that it is seldom a good idea to blob capital ships without a much much larger blob of subcaps in towwhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
i always thought the objective should be more about fleet synergy versus 1k bss vs 300 caps 500hacs vs 100 titans or some other random as number  fleet combo shouldnt the objective be giving every ship a role to fit the perfect fleet utilizing different race techniques to give variations and changes of instead of moar deeps or moar ehp speed etc etc shouldnt we be encouraging flanking with say gallente ships holding the line with amarr ships coming around and firing cars up their asses with minmatar while providing ewar ranged support via caldari i would honestly like to see some kind of diminishing return for having a shitload of the same exact ship in a fleet engagement instead of giving bss  caps or whatever ship a myriad of roles draw it down a bit hell a rock paper scissors balance should be in order i kind of hope that weird random general discussion thread about diminishing returns on focus firing is added give some ship list give a job description institute officers change channel priority and turn this into all those awsome fleet fights we see on the videos hell that empyrean banner on the website was a nice rendition of what i would love to see can we work this way
ill second this imo it can all be done with a proper balancing of hulls no need to enforce weird things like diminishing returns on focus fire or weird stacking penalties for having multiple identical hulls in the same fleet just get the ships themselves right and the rest will followwhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
oh reallythe only counter at the moment to titans and super carrier blobs is more titans and super carriersyou are right in that the only alliances that will bring their cap fleets to fights in any significant numbers are pl and raiden so noone else is countering them at the momentat the moment super carriers and titans are an iwin button for these alliances however that will change as the other alliances catch up with their own capital fleets and can out blob themlets see who whines about them needing nerfed theni do think titans are fine as they are with exception to the turrets they really shouldnt have them
problem with diminishing returns in eve is that people will abuse it ship can only have x incoming locks everyone lock all but one of your max targets with a friendly diminishing returns based on how many people are shooting at that ship everyone lock up the enemy primary and use your one small arty on him to drive those returns to 0any restriction based on pure numbers can be abused and in eve we are supposed to be abusing the systems for our advantage so any system has to be set up to avoid that
what would make sense for titans is to have a massive number of small fof missile launchers if you are piloting a ship that big individual subcaps should be beneath your notice and should be dealt with my automated systemsautomated systems are always pretty incompetent 
titans are not broken a alliancecorporation spend that much timea few weeks and isk about 60bill  the buildingtime i really think that the titan platform should be more then a mobile outpost or oversized jumpbridge they are titans for christ sake they are tha largest ships and most expencive to by ingame naturally they should be awsome ships titan neft proposals we see after the last change is only an attempt to make them useless like the old motherships seems like some super haters is set on getting them nerfed so badly that none wants fo flybuild them the whole idea behind the titans was to be a giant in the playground look at the current war you have a large coalition cfc against the smaller tech team 41 ration nornallywhat we see is only way for the smaller coalition to win is to field as many supers are they can we also see the large coalition thinks this is unfair cause they feel they should win since they got more numbers by nerfing titans we would see that the only way to win a war is to have twise the numbers then the other and violUFFFD then we have the argumant that a good fc can counter a larger fleet and win this is true if the fleet is a little bigger thent the other this is not the truth if one side has 800 and other has 350 dosent matter hos you counter the other fleet you will loose unless you have something to even out the odds the much debated titan tracking nerf would mean titans wold not hit anything smaller then a cap or possibly a bs sitting still yay that would be great then we have two super cap classes that only can dish out there proper damage on capitals what a huge waste of isk thouse ships will be then i say the titan are just fine as they are now only need a sliglty larger dronebay on scs for bombers and fighters then we are golden
fyi some of them beat us on multiple occasions without their supers while heavily out numbered and for that we cheer them on the pilots they have who are not in supers do have considerable skill and their fcs know how to use ships effectively and the right fleet comps will eat our standard doctrines with no problemsthe problem is some of those alliances dont do anything but drop supers because no one can beat that the problem isnt with losing its with not being able to field a counter fleet other than more superstitans are supposed to be the giants in the playground you are right but there should not be that many of them on the field did you know that raiden can easily field enough titans to alpha several enemy titans in one shot that should not be possibletitans are balanced around being rare with any given entity only able to field a couple at a time but we have a situation where entire feels are made up of nothing but titanseither nerf titans or restrict them in some way so that only a few can be fielded at a timeoh and super carriers yeah they probably got nerfed enough they are largely ineffective against subcap fleets and competitive against cap fleets in the same way bses are effective against cruiserbc fleets
since your idea is not about nerf nerf nerf but structured idea so that superstitans are diversified enough to counters to themselves i think its a good ideaits always better to evolve than nerf just for the sake of nerfing except ridiculous dreadtitan tracking that should be reworked so they cant hit sub caps by any mean other than static targets1 good idea for a start
id vote for thisincursionsleeper ai in all rats would be awesome to be honest get rid of solo mission running for good its a mmo goddamnit i am not sure about all of the things proposed as npcs shouldnt be the focus in eve however as the main empire powers are not exactly friendly to each other it would be nice to see some empire fleet clashes in the border areas that players can join in on should they so choose with the usual sec hit etc
oh yes please 1though just fixing the menu system so you can cut corners without the submenu closing as most modern windowing systems have implemented would be a huge win too
i had recently been thinking about the lack of a dedicated rigged ship haulerthen i thought why do we need a dedicated hauleras much as it is useful it probably isnt the most popular activity performed so why waste the time making a whole ship just for thatthat is what this post has proposed
thanks for the free exposure pretty much my idea was a classic takeon of an existing idea as it would be the tier 2 version of the freighter with an eventual tech 2 counterpart jumpcapableanyway thanks againi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
id rather turn supercarriers into giant ship hangars for their corpalliance then tweak titans until their major purpose is to counter the supercarriers likely meaning removing the turrets and tweaking the way doomsdays workit shouldnt be a freighter it should be a smaller mobile outpost you can use this proposal to also balance cap shipswhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
rigs for freightersjump freighters would be one way to go but i still feel jacks proposal that youve linked would be the superior choicemore ships  more variety and this is a good thing in eve
this topic yet againok ill bitethis is a fantastic idea it will help me no end with rebalancing the 65mil sp i have so i can fly only the best ships and use all the best mods i will become epic overnight when i get rid of all of my useless industry trade and science skills that i never usei will be able to fly all races dreads and carriers with the sp i will get back all of a sudden there will be tons of cap capable pilots in my corp without having to train for the skills woot sign me up nowand there you see the problem with respec it will not help new players in the slightest as their skills will not be measured in weeks only a few days how does this proposal help the new guy thats been playing for 9 weeks how does it bridge the gap between new players and older playersthis proposal will only help older players who will get the most sp back in any respec suggestions it will do nothing to improve subscriptions to eveyet again a proposal that is very one sided and does not take into account other sections of the eve communitycome on guys stop thinking of yourselves and at least try and benefit as many people as you can if you cant benefit alli dont support this proposal
and now you explain us how you will do all of this with just 3m spdont make yourself look any more  and go read the first post not just topics title
id just like to give my credit card number to ccp and pay for sp limited per yearccp would win more money instead of those selling ccps property on the internet like 65100m sp toons for 1500UFFFD and look at my right hand ccp im playing with my cc and it has lots of moneys in do you want me to give you somenow lets read all those nerds whatever blahblahblah about instant gratification blahblahblah because paying them via paypal real money for their toon is not instant gratification its due money for their hard work training the toonthat belongs to ccp
not supported you made the choice to train the skills you have same as anyone else live with it
this nooblet isnt very bright is heallow me to highlight your foolishness tekashia 65 mil sp toon with 3 mil sp to play with is a dangerous thingbut then you didnt think that far did you stop the evemail spam
id use it if it were there but dont care if its never implemented theres the obvious problem of potential abuse that would require it be very limited in scope if it existed at all thats for certaini could probably free up 23 months of useless skills with a system such as this the thing for bittervets to remember is that not everyone has the luxury of having all the basics down it has taken me months of training to get into the proteus that ill be able to fly tonight but still need another months worth of skills to fly welland thats after flying a legion for more than half a yeardevils advocatelets say you started as minmatar and have been training long enough to fly most t2 cruisers t3s and battleships with t2 guns you decide you want to add amarr ships to your hangar it takes roughly 50 days to train from small energy turret i to large pulse laser specialization i an additional 7 days for t2 beam lasers of all sizes 35 days for frigate 5 cruiser 5 and battleship 3so it takes 90 days to switch ships and guns to a new race and thats not counting what it might take for you to train for a new kind of tank its quite easy for a players first crosstraining to require 46 months for someone like myself that represents 25 of total playtime in eveits for this reason that i wouldnt object to having some method for freeing up skill points allowing rookie mistakes and aborted career paths to be repurposed so that players can get on to enjoying the game rather than regretting permanent mistakes losing a ship getting podded all those other mistakes are temporary i can replace it all through grinding waste skill points theyre gone foreveredit this could also be made into a tremendous isk sink if it cost per sp and the cost went up for every sp you had removed

wait  are you talking about your cargo or a wreck that changes things anyway assuming i can get a chance to log in tonight ill check through the hotkeys sometimes theyre in weird places
when i read interface overhaul i thought it was more about those pesky windows everywhere than key binds etcwell at least has something related to the title ccp why cant i have an interface looking like your trailers rather than this thing looking like a mix of paint and excellwas an ingenious work 10 years back by the way but its about time to do things differently 
i read that and thought what the  is this guy on but figured i would read a little further for the sake of giving the new guy a chancegot to that and just stopped i mean come onreally really we are gonna go there nono we are not going there
why wouldnt we go there starcraft 2 is an immensely successful game friendly to newbs but challenging for the most hardcore to be clear i am not talking about default hotkeys im talking about custumizable hotkeys for all commands open wreck cargo is exactly what im talking about its crazy theres not a command for this
not sure thats true it may be for players whose playstyle is to be part of corp action most of the time but for people who like to dabble in different areas of the game a standard setting file is rarely adequate and if all ones careful tweaks and additions are overwritten every time your corpalliancefc upgrades the release version well it ends in tears
excellent game design here
a long time ago dreads used to kill supercapitalslol dominion its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
with aoe dds you didnt need 50 titans to wipe out a subcap fleet and before the dominion supercap changes 400 dreads was considered a signficant military assets as opposed to the signficant liablity they have become
once apon a time hardly anyone had this thing called a battleshipit was mighty and everyone wanted onecatch my driftallow supercarriers the ability to carry 20 bombers and 20 fightersyou nerfed their hp and removed subcap drone useageto muchits just ridiculous that supercarrier cannot even carry a full load of dronesvote 1 drone bay expansion
giving supers more fighter bay wouldnt be bad i dont think as long as they dont get normal drones backi do think that fighters should have a skirmish setting where they engage other fighters and fighter bombers without direct commands from the pilot after all they are not drones they supposedly have a person inside flying them
this is a supercaps alliance answer no way remove their ew immunity increase their value to atleast 50 billionsiege for fighter bombers etcetcetc keep nerf them or the supercapital blobs will ruin the whole game to crap
super carriers were nerfed effectively enough that they no longer pose a significant threat to a subcap fleet titans are the problem at this point since with a group of then one of them almost always has you at 0 traversal and thats all they need to alpha most subcapsor at least sub battleships not sure about bs themselves
just delete the damn things and give back the spthey were a mistake since day one
thisand bring back bs  carrier  dread  bs balance the simplier the better
the issue comes from several points titans and super caps are mostly in null sec right so lets seewho can afford those and whats their income resourcewho builds those how many per month and how do they get the materials needed to build thosehow are those used and what players complain aboutwell i guess we have some questions that clearly need data for serious answers but everyone living in null for enough time can give some answernow ccp if theres something they should clearly do is not to take thse away from the game but increase by 500 required materials for start then make sort those titansdreadnaughts cant hit a single battleship mwds if hes not in his straight line or static its ridiculous how those capital ships can one shot cruisersbcsbs in full movementjust go to evekill and look at the number of titansdreads involved in bccruiser kills by applying some dps or the number of those where titansdreads are the only dps if youre not willing to increase the materials needed to build those then get rid of their stupid immunity get rid of the possibility for those to get remote linkswhy a simple t1 frigate should be able to pin t3s and t2 battleships that should be the most electronics sophisticated ships and cant pin a giant dildo that can even one shot them with enough remote bonussuper caps titans shouldnt be able to hit one battle ship in movement they should be defenceless to battleships as battleships are to assault frigs you can get them but its a very tricky business
ummm come againthink youve posted this in the wrong forumsthis is purely for suggestions and proposals for changes to the game
well ccp is making these kind of cosmetic changes of late to make things a little more understandableshouldnt take much to change this so supported
yeah this is total horseshit one of mittanis stupid ideas so his goons can ruin more peoples gametimeccp needs to step on this  if they wish to retain players
ftfy
more stuff to blow up less f4ggy tacticssigned
crews would cost isk and possibly be destroyed just like any other mod an off grid fleet booster typically wont be destroyedit doesnt have to be crews it could be some other form of mods so its not sidetracking to crews in particular its just that crews seem an obvious choice since they can be racial just like the bonuses the thing is i agree that fleet boosters are nice in that they do give you more complexity in how you fit your ships the big problem from my perspective is that i have to now start dual boxing an alt if i want to be competitive doing that would make the game allot less fun if there were some way to buy some mod or crew with these same bonuses so i didnt have to drag an alt in a loki everywhere i would do that make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i still really dont think that selfbuffs are the answer here leadership boosts are special precisely because they require cooperation and teamwork allowing just anyone to have the same bonuses without having to team up with someone else is pretty much the same problem as offgrid boosting in an alt only tweaked a littlesquadwingfleet command needs to be brought back into perspective and the best way to do this is via ongrid boosting preferably in something thats quite survivable this was the original intention of command ships and they need to be brought back into that line of thoughtallowing the module to work while in warp solves the problem of giving the defending fleet the advantage people crying about now useless alts should consider that leadership in battle wasnt meant to be something you could do while semiafk the alts are still useful just no longer ridiculous what other problems were people having with thiswhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
this will never happen with regular capitals as easy to get and field as they are supers are there to supply heavy support to fleets of carriers and dreadsthisthank you how would you go about improving on the concept
ive yet to understand how anyone can say fleets of capital ships  or capfleet  without realizing how stupid that sounds sure maybe it works with the current game mechanics but it sounds dumb as  i really dont think that having entire fleets of them is a good idea and that they should be changed accordinglywhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
currently a capfleetignoring supers is set up as a separate fleet to cut down on spies and other logistical purposes i usually see 50100 in a fleet jumping in to support 300man subcap fleets while its a bit top heavy with this distribution it still falls in the range of reasonable because a 100 man strong fleet of carriersdreads alone is gonna get eaten by a well built subcap fleet each normal cap has the battlefield footprint of 23 similar subcaps tho carriers are alot more versatile than their subcap counterpartslogistics cruisers because of the drone bay amazing how smartbombs make carrier pilots cry tho
well actully my experience with those is limited to observations on the field and when im a victim in my cruiserbc hull with enough transversal no battleship would hit me even mwd on but the dam thing canthat was the first wrong thing the second one is the versatility of those ships and being able to logoff somewhere without being spotted dont need a pos and once on line in that system you know big stuff is about to happen then you see a thousand guys show up on your overview in a few secondsthen pouf theyre gone titan is gone system clear this is a problem imho how to improve itwell take the bridge ability away seems like a nerf so maybe keep it but change this logofski mechanic pilot will be logfofski the ship unavailable for whoever try to board it but the dam thing should stay there at the pos and visible this would prevent such easy force projection that titans providetracking anyonelast but non least the speeds at witch titans are being buildsold and the whole economics behind needed to achieve this that are obviously in need of deep changes and better controlthose are imho some points that deserve to be discussed but has i stated from the beginning i dont fly one i dont own one and my conclusions are the result of in field observationsexperience as neutral to everyone who shoots everything on the overview ergh sometimes bues too zzp  overview bug omfgpwnlolz
snipe
like i have already stated this will never happen capital ships and fleets are as much a part of eve as the subcap blobs you are so fond of even if the 00 mechanics change so much that they eliminate structure shoots which they wont at least not entirely there will still be a place for capitals1 tracking is an issue which they need to fix without also nerfing dreads the siege module includes a tracking penalty as well i think that careful tuning of the superdread or a retune of the titans core tracking stats would solve this issue2 this is the point that my proposal focuses on fixing and in doing so provides an opportunity to get the balancing right on the rest of it3 logoff mechanics is a stickier issue if a titan never disappeared when its pilot logged out you would have nowhere to keep it but a pos since it cant dock then all you would need is a single spy to bump it out for his friends to shoot it to top it all off you probably wouldnt even catch the spy because he could bump it out of the pos and leave system before anyone realized what was going on as a result noone would ever fly a titan because it wouldnt be worth the 50 billion when someone could bump it out and kill it with almost no effort at all if noone was willing to fly a titan whats the point of having them in the game however since they already exist in game we cant just nerf them into uselessness therefore titans need to have a safe method of insuring that noone can touch them while logged out titan pilots have to sleep too you could add abilities that make the titan unbumpable but i see no reason to make the logoff mechanics even more complex to do something that current game mechanics already do ccp also just changed how midcombat logoffski works so i dont think we need to change it up again just yet i think the real reason you bring this point up is more related to titan proliferation4 titan bridges jump bridges covert bridges and the jump drive all contribute to force projection this issue is a simple matter of the speed with which you can cross distances fleets with access to a bridge of one type or another can move much faster than a fleet without if everyone had access to bridges and could move from place to place just as easily i believe that force projection wouldnt be much of an issue as the playing field would be fairly level if you look at the additional thoughts section post 2 you will see that part of my proposal the mothership paves the way for putting titan bridges into the hands of smaller alliances by making the cost of the ship less than a supercarrier more people able to get to more places  more fights which is something ccp is leaning heavily towards atm5 titan proliferation is a problem but there isnt a simple solution for it titans are already hard enough to build considering the time and logistics involved so making it harderlonger isnt really an option i dont really like the idea of getting rid of the bpos and making bpcs a drop somewhere think about how much raw isk would get dumped back into the system buying back all the titan bpos at 50 bil each as i pointed out in 3 we cant really make it easy to reduce their numbers outside of a fleet either which realistically leaves us with finding a way to limit the number of titans that can be fielded in a single systemfleet or finding a way to make sure more titans are dieing when they do fleet up based on the csm notes i expect ccp to probably release a new capital ship for dedicated heavy tackle or at the very least an infinite point for supercarriers however i dont believe that will be enough since titans are currently balanced around being a scarce commodityit looks as if my proposal would solve most of the issues you presented but if i missed something let me know
doesnt change the idea that entire fleets of capital ships is a ridiculous notion titans are indeed the biggest problem at the moment although theyre all pretty wonky imo cap ships in general need to be tied down more to a role of heavy fleet support the change that needs to happen is that they need to become excellent support vessels that are more or less useless without a large and ideally well balanced  but thats another issue entirely subcap fleet to back themwe cant really control the rate at which people build them beyond making them ludicrously expensive with long build times both of which are already true and it hasnt helped much in the long run what we can do is make them less desirable to field enmasse without detracting from how vital they are in small numbers to nullsec logistics structure shooting and blowing up other capsbasically make having multiple cap ships redundant like a stacking penalty but not as blatantly obvious as something like for every titan on the same grid effectiveness is reduced via forced game mechanics more like  how many jump bridging ship hangar arrays and doomsday devices does a fleet really need before it becomes a waste of isk currently the answer is that its almost never an obvious waste of isk thats what needs to changewhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
you should check out on basilisk station by david weber its the first book of the honor harrington series more commonly referred to as the honorverse that book doesnt cover much capital ship combat quite the opposite but the series works up to it as a side note its entirely possible that parts of eve were based on some of the technology in the series the similarities between the impeller drive and our warp drives is strikingeven before the advent of current sov mechanics there was the pos you needed a fleet of dreads to siege one in a reasonable amount of time if we could do away with all structure shoots you could make a case for not needing a capital fleet however given the fact that poss exist and can be destroyed you will need a dread fleet you will need a carrier fleet for repairing a friendly pos after some nasty dread fleet shoots it supers are there to support your capital fleets come up with an idea that removes all structure shoots from the game and then we can talk about making capitals into support for subcap fleets until then its just a pipe dream and a boring pipe dream at that imhoedit anyway this has gotten way off topic so i am done discussing regular capitals lets get back to more thoughts and ideas for titan balancing
i for one was extremely happy with corporation bookmarks being introduced however since its introduction a glaring security hole has been recognized with recruiting an ongoing process a corporation assets including wormhole operations deepsafes ect should be viewable to only those with assigned clearance preferably via corporation roles and not to every 1 day in character to your corporation id like to make the simple request that grantable roles be added allowing access to bookmark folders 
i wholeheartedly agree with this request it would greatly reduce security issues within corporations due to spies or disgruntled excorpmates 1 for the request
yay for security now make it happen ccp
shrug i see no issue with adding this besides the fact that the roles system is already screwy as heck anyways 1
excellent idea1dont mind me just touching your stuff
simple usefull perfecttotally for it1
amazing idea 1 indeed
i dont see any reason why not 1 if only to make the corp roles that much more of a pain in the ass
omgi never knew you could be this useful how about stepping up and doing something in corp everyonce and awhile your idea is awsome and a big 1black
no reason why not 1 stop the evemail spam
i hate you more and more everyday
hi alli have been reading a lot of threads about people talking about the problem with super capsone thing i have noticed though is that very few people are defining exactly what that problem is so what is the problem with super capsit cant be their numbers why would there be many of them and it be a problem in this particular aspect it would be similar to planets there are many planets in eve but since they are open to everyone that is not a problemcould it be the cost of scs the sc is such a useful ship for many purposes that it should cost a lot so the problem cant be with the costcould it be the inbuild abilities of the super capital that is the problemcould it be play styles that could be the problem the way people use themif the answer is yes to the two above questions then ask yourself why are these people using their scs like thispossible answers may be  hot dropping juicy kills in low sec space attack targets of opportunity in nul sec space sov warfareare just a few reasons i thought of so lets break them down a jf jumps through a gate starts aligning to a station his scout has reported one neut in local with no one on the gate suddenly a ship decloaks 20km away and lights a cyno 1 second later a titan is there and its goodbye jf  cargo  you have a super carrier warping to a safe pos after a neutred comes into system you have been ratting in it the system is not cyno jammed so u need the pos for protection the neut hangs around for a while you go afk with the sc still logged on the neut comes up to the pos and enters it with the password obtained elsewhere and bumps the sc out the pilot has not told to approach keep distance or orbit the pos just stopped the sc is bumped out the offending ship lights a cyno and blam several scs appear and the afk pilot is back in a station in a new clone sov warfare is perhaps the easiest problem to define a group uses scs in their majority to counter superior numbers of sub capital ships the smaller group just cant fight head to head with the other group as the number of ships attacking is the predominant tactic in eve that workslet me say that again he who brings the most troops wins now this works when all other factors are equal similar ships guns tactics etc but eve has not been an all equal game that is why there are various ships guns and tactics some tactics and ship combinationsnumbers work better than others ala scs so what is the problem with scsas i see it there are two problems1 titans and super carriers have enormous tanks and cant be alphad benifit from rr very well and only die when separated from others2 the pilots flying scs are very experienced in their use and rarely make mistakesso the problem appears to be an experienced group of pilots combined with epic shipsand people want to fix this problem by nerfing titan trackinghow long will it be before people whinge and cry about the nerf not being hard enough to fix this problemthe problem is with experienced players using epic ships not gun tracking on titansgo look at why said ships are used and who faces themaustralian fanfest event
or you could just use some common sense and package all your crap you need moved into a corp contract accept it and move it yourself fyi rigged ships can be send via courier contract im only stating this because obviously you werent aware of the fact otherwise you wouldnt be wasting time asking ccp to spend a metric crapton of time coding in your little fix that only affect those who arent aware of the aforementioned snipit about contracts
no for reasons as stated above by others this could only end badly
youll have a point and a clue when the game is completely static and nothing is updated
not really sure what youre trying to say there voith anyways this idea is overlysuggested would be gamebreaking in eve and people who suggest this should biomass themselves both out of shame for not knowing how to use the search function on the forums and for failing so miserably at understanding the core concepts of eve
actually an good idea maybe too harsh in some cases but isk sinks are badly needed will add it to the first post eventually firstly none here is talking about buying an sp secondly even tho characters trading is legalized in eve it doesnt change its rmt feeling its cheating guys and its not any different of buying level capped chars in other mmos if we could use an real game mechanics to fix our characters ourselves without involving an real money here that would feel much better from pure gaming perspectiveso sorry but for somemost of us buying character just doesnt cut itmaybe for a few sociopaths like you and drake draconis seriously guys just get a life and stop spamming this forums wtih your antieverything crappy posts if you dont contribute your posts are unwated here
it is amazing how its always the same naysayers screaming no for no logical reason at all just no stoming your feet yelling no i originally suggested the unlearning skill point option in another thread and a few people turned it into a massive flame war of ignorance it is not a bad idea adding a cost to it is an even better idea since it would provide an excellent isk sink as floppie already stated there is no reason this couldnt be properly implemented it would not be a game breaking change as i stated in a previous thread which also sent drake into a frenzy of crazyi dont particularly want an sp refund option in the game as it would not benifit me specifically i do recognize however that many other people want the option and it may be better for ccp in the end to have one to appease the majority of average players that could benefit from such an option
ok it looks like essentially you double a persons training speed for somewhere between 1648 days a year depending on the capone queue that trains one that untrainsthis means that while a person is training for 1648 days of sp they will be able to instantly train a skill that normally would have taken 1648 days to trainmost skills dont take long at all to get to at least level 4 even if its a skill you never use the time you took to train is not that significantunless you have like amarr titan 5 you want to untrainbut usually when you go to level 5 on skills you are specializing and arent intending to screw up your characterif you are not liking your skills it isnt a long journey to train what you want to at least level 4
you need to learn how to do math you wouldnt be able to train while untraining only one or the other if untraining takes longer or even half the time it takes to train the skill then you are still losing time that could be spent towards training you will never gain sp at a faster rateyou will always lose sp that you could have had if you had just trained instead
neither of which you haveand if you dont like itquit stop the evemail spam
learn to readyour assumption that screaming about something often enough getting you something is a waste of timeyour no more right or wrong than the guy your criticising stop the evemail spam
first off legally rl money can only buy you isk you use isk to buy a character which is not the same as rl money because billions of isk can easily be earned through other ingame means since rl begets isk which begets a character i very much understand why buying a character feels like rmting but its very different essentially buying a character is not cheating comparing it to other mmos its on par with buying a fancy weapon or armor set with ingame currency second what exactly do you need to fix with your character you somehow have this flawed notion that your character is broken because you trained some skill that you no longer use guess what that doesnt make your character broken nothing needs to be fixed training the skills you previously trained allows you to explore a certain aspect of the game just becuase you decide it isnt something you want to do anymore doesnt mean you should be able to undo your sps and reapply them to another area of the game can you undo the experiences those skills enabled of course not so why should you be able to undo those skill points and seriously either you need to undo an enormous amount of skillpoints or youre just a really lazy player you should be earning 2k sphr or 333k per week or 1m sp every 3 weeks 25 more if you spec your attributes i already pointed out 13 m skillpoints earns you any cruiser v and another 1m skillpoints earns you any t2 medium weapons wtf do you want to swap your skills to that you cant wait 7 weeks to do and by the way thats not 7 weeks of sitting on your ass and waiting as it takes only 7 days to train medium guns iv and cruisers iv if youre trying to swap from armor t2 bss to shield t2 bss then you need to swap so many skillpoints that youre essentially asking for a complete character redo the way i see it the only reason to push for sp redistribution is because you are really freaking lazy or so anal you cant fly a ship until its t2 fit with perfect skills shifting your eve playstyle so radically that only a huge redistribution will satisfy you at which point you need to htfu and go to the character bazaar a powergaming fotm player that cant stand waiting 2 months to fly the next fotm remember sp redistribution does not fix your character so now please try again why do you want and deserve sp redistribution
so you are saying right here that since you wont be able to train skills while untraining then you may as well just train the skills you want to train as it will either be as fast if not faster to train up than wait for a skill to untrain
well actually vertisces soritenshi respec idea he posted in other topic was a little bit different than mine difference being that here you can actually double train to some extent while in the idea he suggested it should be either one or the anotherunfortunately not as long as clonepod system exists your character actually can be broken in many ways any unnecessary skills increases your pods cost up to 90m while not giving basically any advantage thus gimping you totally some may say its too little while for others it can be very annoying still it makes one group of players happier while not touching the ones that dont care so whats the problemthat was just an example theres also an perfectionist type players that would simply love to have their skills sheet cleared out a bit  then many others potential players wanting to adjust their skills for several reasons aesthetic being one of them with fotm rerollers exluded as they basically couldnt benefit from it btw you mention these 3m refundable sp for a second time and what you could get for it read the first post once again then see that i said one to three millions which means that it was just an example keep in mind that this idea is not about numbers numbers are adjustable its more about new game mechanics that could be implemented when we got working mechanics then we can balance it freely
using the same assets as tcu logos the only ship customisation i want is corpalliance logos on the hull or suspended holographically in the shields i dont care about anything else i dont think anything else makes sense within the gameplease make this distinction an option within your next questionnaire while colouring ships could be simple as allowing players to tweak a few specific colour channels in the new textures and this could be a poor interaction choice but very easy to code i think alliance logos should be applied to hulls by default whether or not the player wants them and this should be treated as a seperate issue from ship customisation as you see itmore importantly default alliance logo attachment could become a game feature long before colour customization as many ships are still having textures redone
this is what happens when companies outsource to india
well its what happens too when your gms are given a policy that no matter how reasonable it sounds the players are all untrustworthy to the point that if caught telling the truth would lie about it just to keep a hand in which is more or less what the gms told me the refund policy is now even known bugs are not to be refunded if its at the users end
the ability to tap into and disrupt secure lines of communication is a key element of warfare and intelligence gathering but this seems to have been overlooked in eve with a few thoughtthrough innovations this method of ewar could be a viable asset for fleets and intel gatherers in the eve universebrainstorm 1 ships and modules  for sov holders a communications disruption platform could be introduced serving alongside the cynosural system jammer this platform would function by garbling the fleet comms of players marked as red to the alliance  for intel gatherers a new covops ship or ship module could be introduced that lets the pilot see the fleet comms of any fleet within a certain aubrainstorm 2 voice comms  an update to the existing voice comms available in eve is needed  anomalies in wh systems could make voice comms in eve noisy  similarly the aforementioned communications disruption platform could make voice comms noisier the closer a fleet marked as red to the alliance gets to the structurebrainstorm 3 garbling noise  by garbling fleet chat i mean randomly altering a  of the content as it is posted correct me if im wrong but all chat is stored locally on a clients computer in txt files for those of you with the knowhow do you think this is a possibility  by making voice comms noisy i mean imposing a new level of electronic interference or static above the active voice channel according to the level the player has set their mike at ingame again for those of you with more wisdom than me would this have a dire impact on performancebrainstorm 4 channels  leave secure inviteonly alliance and intel channels alone they remain asisvery rough ideas but hopefully interesting to think how clean communications channels currently are fly safe 07
your ideas are cool they wont workno one uses evevoice because its already vulnerable to being lagged out if the client lags since its tied to client server communications if you were to start garbling text everyone would just start using their jabber servers for intel channels as well as alerts it is already used for alot of sensitive communications in most major alliances since it is more secure than in game channelsneed an api to access it cant claim to be an altwe already have systems to beat that in place and it would give a sizable disadvantage to those entities who dont have these resources at the disposalbtw say hi to bnai for me twisted
thanks for the education its a shame that so many features in eve have been written off it detracts from the game imo ill pass on your greetings to bnai if you were once a victim of one of his ganks then my condolences p o7
the many many people who use external voice comms will be unaffectedx and wwwwwww still get the point across when scrambledi like the idea it just doesnt work when out of game bypasses exist are in widespread use already
hehe i know him from when gima was a secret alliance instead of actually a real one ganked a corpies orca wardecced us and discovered tecmo was a pvp corp when we chased him from ylandoki to itamo silly boy let me troll him into siccing 7 corps on us the same day our app to spacemonkeys was approvedhe kinda was wondering what we were doing before that that was more important than fighting him when all our stuff was packed into carriers to move out to nullsecsure hope the past year and half have mellowed him a bit he had potential if he could just keep his mouth from running off
i think this would be awesome butventrillo teamspeak jabber and everything else make it pointless
the problem with eve voice comms is that theyre inflexible on teamspeak we can move in and out of subchannels as needed without messing with our eve chats
as well as being obsolete due to reasons outlined above it doesnt work from a lore point of view either ie eve comms dont use radio waves or anything like that they use entangled particles possible exception being local which you cant jamintresting idea though
it sounds like a risk for a reward to merisk could loose implants reward moving andor deploymentevery time you fleet up you run the risk of corp members killing you hell in null everyone can kill youever run a lvl4 mission with a corp member you ran the risk of loosing that ship if it was a cnr or other faction ship you could have lost billions of iskis there any other counter points to my proposal or would it just overall help the gameplay in eve
you might also want to propose the idea of unloading the clone into a station cause there is a limit to the number of clones that can be in a clone vat and i am sure the pilot wont want to have to choose which billion isk clone to destroy to allow someone else in the corp or alliance to create a jump clone
you completely missed the point the op was making i dont really care so much about the highsec miners to me mining in highsec completely defeats the purpose of mining in the first placeas for missions ive been running them on  off for the past yearish taking a break from 00  such even i agree that the ammount of isk im earning in highsec with little risk is too high i wont even start on incursionsop i agree with you completely1
nullsec is boringquit complaining about overbuffed highsec payouts and make nullsec worth playing in then look at whether highsec payouts are too high
itUFFFDs really the entire reward system and not just highsec income that needs tweaking the system should reward people for 1 dynamic risks based on the likelihood of losing your shippod to npcs andor players2 investment risks be it raw isk time andor structures in space3 social risks reward working as a group especially if violating the social trust results in losses most of the time the risks from npcs are much less than the risks from players and this needs to be heavily accounted for on the surface our system attempts the above but has enough skewed areas to throw the current system out of balanceimo highsec incursions do provide too much reward for their risk when compared to most lowsecnullsec opportunities they essentially break the risk vs reward paradigm that encourages players to venture into lowsec and nullsec for bigger rewards however they also provide an extremely beneficial service to eve by creating an environment for teamwork and lets be frank learning to play in a team is pretty much at the core of living in lowsec and nullsec and i fully support game mechanics that encourage teamplay meaning there should be definite advantages and rewards for doing so personally i think the primary nerf highsec incursions need involve truly randomizing the spawn triggers make it so people blitzing them in the minimumsized groups have serious risks to earn their dough alternatively they could run them in much larger groups maintain their safety but sacrifice their rewards in doing so mission running is very much a solo activity its also the standard pathway for characters to earn money and gain mock combat experience while they grow pubic hairs and venture into the more pvp oriented regions of eve it is also an important transition activity where players can build up isk reserves while they transition from one area or corp of the game to another again actually randomizing mission spawns and probably revamping the mission tiers so the difficulty levels of missions better reflect the combat and tanking ability of todays combat vessels would be appropriate unfortunately given todays classes of ships most missions really have very little risks i have very little experience in lowsec and dont feel qualified to accurately depict how things should change from how they currently are i think that lowsec rewards should probably be just as profitable as nullsec rewards albeit in a different manner meaning i dont think lowsec should have the crazy anomspawning income of null but they should have very goodpaying missions instead true nullsec rewards should involve significant investment risks as well as dynamic risks currently the sov upgrade system allows for a nice investment risk but the ability to capture any system anytime is somewhat out of line the dynamic risks in nullsec also need review specifically afk cloakers and hotdrops nullbears are typically whiny morons that make highsec carebears look like hardcore bittervets just look at all the wah wah afk cloaker in system prevents me from ratting wah wah wah threads i live in nullsec i dont have blues and a hostile in system doesnt prevent me from ratting dealing with a few nuets in system should be something every nullsec capsuleer overcomes by grouping up andor flying smart altering hotdrop mechanics so locals can better assess the danger a neut represents is reasonable but either leave afk cloakers alone or replace local with an intel tool that leaves some pilot ambiguity before nerfing cloaks then and only then should nullsec anoms pay out better than lvl 4 missions the point im trying to make with all these jabs at different game aspects is that the risk paradigm in nullsec is should be a highpaying but highrisk the truth is most nullbears want the pay but dont want any real risk and they dont want to work in groups
dude this is a ridiculous proposal and i dont even live in high sec usuallyone of the biggest reasons that highsec is full of carebears is because alliances dont need or want themask goons or pl if they will accept your medium sized mining corp into their ranks see what the response isi have said this many timesif you move t2 production away from moons and into the 00 belts only not high sec belts at all then people must therefore mine those belts for any t2 production to go on anywhere at allit would fix a great many things i feel from the 00 culture of pvpers only to the highsec carebear zone to the inability of many of those industrialists to get into the t2 market because the moons and moongoo is all owned by very fewtheres heaps of reasons to do it im yet to find a reason not to do it
when was the last time you saw a heap of hyperions in a fleetnow when was the last time you saw a heap of domis or megathrons in a fleetmy guess is youre having trouble with the first one whilst realising its a tier 3 bsedit when i really think hard i cant find a reason why a silly tier system would cripple another ship its really just a state of mind
youre wrongtier matters take a look at pgcpu even the number of total slots can differ
would be interesting to hear your idea as to how a super carrier would be allowed into hi sec or do people only move ships in nulllow sec
10
i think it would be good to have both currently carriers and super carriers have a good size ship maintenance bay mother ship would seem to me to be a super super carrier and have an even bigger maintenance array although the jump portal would cover most of the needs of a fleet to move ships and pilots it would add the benefit of taking ships and pilots that logged off inside the mothership with the fleet so that if they do not get on in time they will still be with the fleet when they do log on simply undock and join the fight this would really make the mothership like a portable outpost the alliance would have to choose between taking the mom to the staging area bringing all ships and pilots inside with it or hold it back in safe territory and portal the active fleet from there bringing the whole mothership would give the added benefit of extra ships in the maintenance array for when pilots lose there ships this would also have the down side of any ships and pilots docked inside a mothership when it gets destroyed would also be destroyed dock in the mothership log off and log back in to a fresh clone
to carry that many ships and pilots would require the mothership to be almost as big as a titan in terms of mass which would make it cost a ton realistically speaking it would also be classified as another super this would make it hard for small alliances and nonsov holders to buildbuy one of their own in my proposal i was actually trying to limit the size and capabilities of the mothership to where it could be built like a regular capital aka not requiring sov and a csaa and being somewhere between a jump freighter and a supercarrier in price by making the mothership available to pretty much anyone we would be leveling the force projection playing field what i think would be a better idea in fact would be to add this concept to the titan making it a fleet transport in addition to its fleet bonuses and doomsday it would no longer have the ability to bridge but could take its own fleet with it when it jumps what do you think of this alteration to your idea
just turn the bloody carriers into this mothership idea itd be more like real carriers that way anyway youd have the regular carrier that functions like a smaller supercarrier get rid of the fighter nonsense theyre just artificial players anyway store real ships in carriers and have them function as force projection ships just like they do in real lifetitans and dreads should remain and be rebalanced towards killing other cap ships that are in siegetriage mode and structuresthats all that really needs to happenwhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
did you even read my proposal please stick to the topic
of course i read the proposal and i nearly fell out of my chair at how ridiculous it is it doesnt really solve anything it just shuffles problems around and makes it more diverse without actually fixing anything the way things are today in a short time youd still have the problem of entire fleets of capital ships that are by and large unstoppable except with an even larger fleet of capital ships theres no balance in thisi remember when the first titan was built and when the first titan was destroyed most of us back then were pretty starstruck by the idea even perhaps especially ccp itself over time though and predictably the ships have become a major problem and a game ruinerthat said i do like one thing about your proposal and its something ive said from the very beginning myself remove the immunity in favor of greater resistance to ewaredit even the newest of players should have a viable role to fill in a fleet beyond mere cannon fodder how many of us outright laughed at the i was there marketing scheme about the noob interceptor pilot thats what its really about roles and counterbalances over the years ccp has gotten farther and farther away from the cyclic mindset of frigates  destroyers  cruisers  battlecruisers  battleships  frigates again cap ships of any size should not be able to hit moving subcaps with the possible exception of dreads landing glancing blows to battleships which would still be pretty devastating much like when a battleship lands a glancing blow on a cruiser in short  the game has been getting more and more out of whack as the years have rolled by i really hope that this new direction ccp is taking will once again bring balance to the fleetwhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
its a real pain  when mining you can have say 10 or more rocks at the same distance and youre trying to work out which one youre mining in the survey scan results when using a survey scanner is  just stick a little icon on it please one of the csms  just poke ccp on this one its a small tiny change that would bring huge hurrahs from the boring bunchill post up what yinzer haverford wrote  again lost in the features and ideas forumtldr  just get this fixed its crazyalso increse the survey scanner ii range while youre there an orca boosted hulk can shoot out to 26km but the scanners range is only 225km

firstly numbers is a real issue it is at the point where people can field enough supers to destroy any non super cap fleet with impunitysecondly this is eve not wow or any other generic mmo there should be no best ship no ship that will beat everything else right now the only way to beat a super cap blob is with an even bigger super cap blob sub caps are pretty irrelevant once supers show up as it is most big fights end the same way sup caps and normal caps fight for a little while then one or both sides bring in the supers maybe doomsday a couple of things and then everyone goes home because there is no point fighting anymorethirdly and this is similar to the second titans can currently track and pretty much insta pop battlecruisers and up and therefore they have no real counter as they can kill off all the dps of a fleet very quickly which is wrong everything should have some counter that is not just a bigger blob this is why people are screaming for ccp to nerf titans tracking
sovereignty is required to build supercaps supercaps reinforce sovereignty this is a bad synergy for game purposes because it eventually makes sov holders untouchable by anyone who doesnt already hold sovereignty themselves closing the clubsimply doing away with the sovereignty requirement to build them would fix that without any other changeshowever they also have that pesky ewar immunity immunities are bad game design because there is no counter for the players to use adjusting the ewar immunity to a very high resist would allow players to counter all the other bad things people see in supercaps without any further nerf needed
 this is pretty much it but i will elaborate with my 002 isk worth one of the best aspects of eve is bigger does not mean better when you get into bigger ships you often gain some dps some tank some range but you also limit your ability to apply your dps to smaller targets you lose mobility etc essentially every ship has pros and cons to kill a battlecruiser you can ship up and just outclass it or you could ship down and take advantages of its weaknesses ive solod vagas drakes and ravens in a frigate because those bigger ships have weaknesses i can exploit using a smaller ship in most cases the pros and cons of entire fleets scale up a fleet of abbadons has the range superior dps and superior tank to annihilate a similar fleet of drakes but those abbadons will get dessimated by a fleet of afterburning zealots and guardians becuase the bss cant hit the ahacs for much damage the drakes shred a fleet of ahacs because they can outrun the zealots and their medium weapons hit zealots for lots of damage this is makes eve a hightec rockpaperscissors game also known as rochambeau the rochambeau game keeps gang and fleet warfare very interesting because winning often doesnt revolve around a best fleet so much as a counter fleet even carriers dreads and supercapitals fit nicely into the rochambeau game unil the release of dominion in dominion scs and titans were buffed from fleet support ships into frontline fleet dps ships with their ewar immunity their ability to destroy any class of ship be it frigates cruisers bcs bss or other capitals their amazing tanks and their ability to rr each other a group of supercaps hard to beat their rr abilities tank and ewar immunity also mean they scale extremely well so with the release of dominion the superpowers started producing supercaps en mass by the release of cruicible the number of supercaps in the game grew from a few hundered predominion to over four thousand suddenly 100man supercap fleets are not the dream of some super alliance but the standard sovfight escallation force a 50 supercap fleet used to have the power to obliterate any fleet on the field and there was no counter beyond more supercaps essentially the rockpaperscissors game devolved into rockpaperscissorsthermonuclearsupercapbomb essentially the delicate game balances within eve was ruined and so ccp stepped in during the cruicible release to tone down the overwhelming domination supercaps were playing in the game while they made leaps forward they overlooked titan tracking such that titans with their enormous guns can still decimate any fleet thrown at them the reason you see these threads is people feel the game needs to be balanced its totally reasonable for supercaps to represent a potent option to the rochambeau game but they need to have a weakness so they can be countered if the only counter is more supercaps then the rock paper scissors supercap game really breaks down and becomes the whohasmoresupercaps game this is not acceptable noone really gives a  about small groups of supers being hotdropped on people what they care about is the impenetrable assault force they represent when dropped in large groups especially during sov fights
pretty much thissuper carriers are fine as they are sure they have awesome tank and everything else but their dps comes from drones that can be countered and dont instapop everything in sighttitans on the other hand are near impossible to counter unless you bring more
ill say it again  give electronic attack frigates the ability to apply their ewar to supers makes them more useful than just filling out an alliance torny fleets numbers gives a counter to titan lockingtracking etc and can themselves be countered with dronessmaller weapons etc whilst not being counterable by supers themselves supers with support can counter them supers without support can be pwned by a fleet containing eafsadd in a cool down timer on supers jump engines to stop them crossing the galaxy in  5 minutes no bat phone pl from anywhere to anywhere as long as u pick up the fuel tab and you are in businessgive super carriers the ability to also have a flight of bombers and fighters still no drones so they can also engage larger subcaps
all good ways to fix scsaustralian fanfest event
the problem with super carriers is that we have too many sub cap pilots who cant afford them and then proceed to cry about their awesomeness until they get nerfed into a flying tombstone with the focus on being pure eye and easy pray candy for km jewing cane gangs running around the ghetto looking for good fights without asking for a fair fightban sub capsgive us capital interdictors and t2 ewar capitals
titan tracking and numbers
some good points heresome answers i can put forward even though i may get some heat from my alliance1 to limit the numbers you first have to look at who has how many titans what region is making the most and why i am fairly sure that the drone lands would be one area where sc production is very high it has the end to end resources to make scs at a very fast rate other areas are limited to either mining or buying minerals especially in the tech rich regionsnow do you think its a good idea for ccp to limit numbers artificially or to increase the difficulty of making them maybe the csaas could cost a lot more pi to make introduce a super rare planet like tech moons limited to high sec only that csaas need artificially limit the number of csaas that can be deployed in a region operated by an alliance increase the production cost and you will see less scs on the field2 in regards to warfare what battles are the scs being deployed at sov warfare would be the majority of cases deploy 20 super carriers and a few titans and that ihub is toast in 5 minutes flat sov warfare needs to change at the moment the concept is way better than pos spams but having a few big fat targets sitting in space is a target perfectly matched to a scmaybe a counter to this is to a introduce a way for the defender to expend fuel for resistances b automatically ajust resistances of sov equipment based on the types and numbers of weapons attacking it3 you have to wonder why anypone would attack a titan with bcs its stupid to nerf pretty much the last weapon of a titan to make it no more than a bridgingboosting ship is a waste people want titans they want them to shoot people easily i personally think that limiting the availability of titans would be more than enough to limit their effectiveness in large battlesaustralian fanfest event
i personly think a small change to the way jumping works could help a little as one of the main problems is that you could find a sc ontop of your ship within 14 sec after a sb decloaks and points you  basicly leaving you unable to defend yourself most of the timei think they are fine in large fleet vs large fleet but they have a huge advantage vs people they hotdrop onso a spool up time on jumping for capitals could be one way to even the field a little how long should this take i do not know but i would say 510 sec would be a start that means if you can kill the ship that opened the cyno before the sc or other capital before it can jump it will be canceled or if you can kill it just as it jumped but before it loads it will not land directly on you but somewhere random in the system it does that alreadyalso another idea when talking about titans and capital weapons currently the signature of the guns also affect the tracking vs smaller ships 
 sounds like a good planit reminds me when fbs were introduced ccp changed their torps to guns in order for them to miss sub caps i think a similar rework could be the go thereaustralian fanfest event
i wrote beforedo you know what is the rockpaperscissors game you can fights against bcbs fleets with nice tactics ahacbc fleett3 fleetsb fleet other bs fleet etc can kill bs fleets or vicaversa every fleet has chances against the other one with good setup and tactics and at least 10 tactics working against thembut trying to fight against 500 supercaps with subcaps or common capitals you have no chance against them and the most important things all other ship is unuseable too i have no problem with supercaps  thats part of the game but their numbers is ridiculous highso many pilots have over 100m sp just like me but no matter if the pilots can fly with 250 ships because all useless against supercap blobs if they cant fly with supercap blobs too wasted sps if enemy just blobing with supercapsfurthermore no tactics working against supercaps just one bring more supercaps than your enemieswe saw what happened with atlas they had hundreds and hundreds cap pilots they used before 400 dreads in fleets but they could nothing against 500600 supercap blob and they losing their spaces within 2 weeks500600 supercapital such a drake fleet lol its shame for this gameover 4000 supercaps  thats really rare ships lol500 titan  ccp really read their own eve chronicles from rare titans need to change this supercap idiotism need increasing their value over at least 4050 billions or more supercarrier over 200 billionstitan the alliance incomes changed dramaticaly in the past years in the game and ccp did not take this into consideration thats was a big mistake from ccp and thats why their number grew so muchneed increasing their building times at least 3 months long period thats slowing down supercaps increasing numbers and give chances to killing them in the csaaneed change rare moon mineral rules permanent moon mining materials give advantages for big alliances without fightsand i almost forgot the other problem is the supercaps pilots dont want to be lost their ships because of this they moving to the biggest alliances where is the most supercaps are somehow need to change their numbers in a fleet
the ultimate solution to the supercapital problem would be the need of a siege moduleits pretty simple thats why dreadnoughts and carriers dont scale well when the dreads are in siege it doesnt require more than whats required to take down a dread to kill all the dreads that are currently on the fieldhere are the supercapitals problems  a siege module would fix thissupercapitals wouldnt require truely massive amounts of ships to be taken down as they wont be able to rr eachother and have their offensive capabilities same goes for titans apply a no reps if a siege module is active a tracking nerf just like the regular siege module that wreck the dreads ability to hit subcaps actually subbattleships and a committing to the fight thingadd the supercapitals can still online and offline modules but the onlining of a module from another ships fitting service will consume 80 of the ships capacitor that doesnt prevent supers from fitting and unfitting modules in a pos thats the minimum they should have it would be terribly hard to manage a super without that but refitting on the field is a massive problem when you encounter tracking titans the fact that you can adapt in 10s a ship from being the ultimate killing machine to being the undestructable mastodon is simply wrong and doesnt fit anymore in eve postcrucibleright now supercapitals are kind of a guerilla supermachine they can jump somewhere kill  lightning fast while being untacklable by anything that isnt a dictor or a hdictor those will get instapopped by titan guns they can refit from tracking titans to tanking titans and get out if eventually things dont go their way this is simply too much for one shipclasswhile this is kinda harsh to supercapital heavy alliances you need to give supercapitals new things to work with such as a workable clonebaysma thing with that kind of things reshipping from a couple supercarriers in a staging pos will be an actually usable strategy i dont think i ever saw a fleet reshipping from supercarriers smas why is that  because its hard to usemanagecontrol maybe
 rock  paper  scissor  rock supers  sub caps  capitals  supersyou think in terms of sub caps vs supers only ccps only mistake is listening to sub cap loving hobos who dont like losing their canes without getting a kill they need to expand capital hulls with new t2 stuff to counter subs and supers and nerf the  out of sub caps not make rocks harder to find or so heavy to pickup that nobody bothers playing itall these alliances have thousands of sub cap pilotsthe true blob hundreds of capital pilots the should be lynch pin and i doubt these alliances could field 3 digit super fleets if they wanted to since there are only half a thousand titans to begin with so the numbers are not at fault at all i just hear constant whining about how hard it is to kill something thats so hard to train for build and fly from people who hate getting wtf owned by itand make no mistake the object of any war is not to die for your country but to make the other guy die for his and in a ship that costs 2 kidneys i wouldnt want to lose it eithernow go die in a fire
lets not forget the massive bot mining problem thats running rampant and unchecked by ccp they mine 237365 and those minerals are flooding the market mass producing supercaps is now cheaper and easier to do than ever stopping the bots  stopping the mineral flood in the market  increased cost of minerals  decreased minerals available  increases the price to produce supercaps  supercap mass production slows to a steady crawlas to whom caused what im not sure did the demand for mass producing supercaps drive the mining bot activity up or is the mass production of supercaps merely a result of mining bots flooding the market with mineralssummary of eves last four expansions
realy  you realy never know anything from supercap fightssupercaps always has other support fleet too in the fightst but not need too much rock  paper  scissor  rock   supers  sub caps  capitals  supers  really subcaps cant kill supercapital blobs you talking stupid things i saw many times 500 supercaps  200 support ships how fought with over thousand subcap and there the subcaps never won last time i fought where was over 1500 subcaps and they fought against supercapitals but i saw just 1 and 1 titan kill from each sideand the most ridicuolus thing the over hundreds titans there killed with their ridicuolus tracking some small frigates during motionyou have doubt these alliances could field 3 digit super fleets lol man the supercapital pilots created supercapblueblobfest in the game hundred and hundred dreads couldnt kill them at least 1 years ago but you thinking about that the supcaps can kill them this supercapbluehordes in the past year demolished mostly the 00 parts of easternsouthern and northern territories would be able to talk about this atlasamorsus mihi init razor etcoh myyou have doubt because you talk blablabla but we can prove iti wrote 1 weeks before this and i linked a picture 2012 jan 14 plraidenncevoke fleet with 100 titans and 400 supercarriers
so this is a simple fix to the amount of titian that are out there i dont believe that the titan is over powered or that it is even needs a fix for the tracking titan the thing is meant to be the be all and end all of deathbut as many of them that live in 00 know there is just far to many of them now many players have had time to skill up and get one so we need a way to reduce the amount of them with out nefting them and a simeple way is to just increase how long it takes to cook one if a balance can be found that means that the rate of building one is over taken be the rate they are destroyed the frequently that the titan blob would be seen and used will decreasethis is a simple idea and i am sure there is lots of reasons for it the fail but i am just putting it here anyway never know it might work side note to help with titan and super cap destruction i would also like to see dreadnoughts get a buff on warp strength make it so that a hic is needed to warp scrabble them then you might see more dreads on the field to help in the cause that is killing titans and super caps
titians should be boosted but make them really really expinsive thats why there less titian because no can afford yes
no isk is not a factor for the likes of pl goons a and so on plus its the market that sets the price not ccp it is us the players that set how much we want for the building and selling of a titan there is in fact no way ccp can increase the price of a titan
well i suppose if you raised the construction time to a year and the price to some amount so large as to be meaningless you could probably slow the expansion down for one year until all the new assembly lines started spitting out their queues
you would think that at the start but if takes a year to make one then that is 1 year that anybody has time to find a csaa that is cooking on and kill the pos 1 year to make 365 days for somebody to abort it itas for increasing price this will not work as it is us the players that set the price not ccp but i will add that if build time was to increase the price would go up anyway you have to remember it is players that make titans not npcs
if you have sovereignty and a bunch of titans already what are you going to guard those assembly arrays withwhos going to stop you the other alliances who are using their own titans to guard theirs
hell if i know but that is what war is for 
war is indeed for throwing yourself at a spike covered brick wall until you cant stand up again but how does that do anything about titan production
yes but ccp sets the amount of mins that go into said titans so the minersbotters set the pricesmaking it harder to built titans is not the way to reduce their numbers and is certainly not the way to fix the wtfpwn blobs of titans the best way to fix both of those is to make titans easier to kill how to do that is up for debate though there are several solutions that i like1 make it easier for super caps to kill each other ie increase doomsday and fb effectiveness against other supers2a nerf titan tracking so that they cant hit faster battleships but can still hit something like a triple plated abaddon2b leave titan tracking as it is but make it so that titans either cant refit in space introduce a limited form of super cap docking cant refit from moms or suffer some form of penalty when doing so meaning that if a titan pilot fields a tracking death machine at the expense of tank the cant instantly refit to a massive brick tank once they become primary3 introduce new capital ships such as a capital ewar ship capital dictor capital version of the teir3 bcs lots of big guns on a fast fragile frame or some other ships that increase the tactical elements of capital warfare4 wont make them die faster but makes them harder to deploy from half the cluster away introduce a spool up time on jump drives andor portalssuck it stupid forums ctrl cp ftw 
because is what will happen as alliances try to stop each other getting more titans
this first statement is utter nonsense i pvp in a clone that is often worth more than the ships i fly and with the implants i choose to use its definitely worth more than most ships i fly there are always excess skills that arent applicable to every ship you fly the idea that those extra skillpoints gimp you totally is absolutely ridiculous there are no truly significant increases in clone costs until you are a very high sp 100m character even then the cost of implants often outweighs the cost of the clone any unnecessary skills increases your pods cost while not giving basically any advantage thus gimping you totally  lol this is just so ridiculous fyi those extra skillpoints always give you improvedextra abilities in game which equates to alternate ships to fly alternate methods to make isk improved iskmaking methods etc with the arguable exception of afterburners this is never a disadvantage yes i pointed out what you could train given a few million skillpoints i must have been too subtle with my purpose in pointing it out so let me be blunt it takes a decent amount of time to setup support skills for shields armor navigation ewar et al  15 m but once you have those cross training into different races of combat ships does not require enormous amounts of skillpoints or time so either your redistribution gives enough skillpoints to instantly train into the fotm or youre just to lazy to wait a few weeks for that new skill as long as you create a mechanism to redistribute your skillpoints fotm rerollers can benefit from it if there are perfectionist type players and the like that need to clear out their character sheet for ocd andor aesthetic reasons i have a nice compromise for you you and i both know that my compromise wont meet your personal goal however you want to move skillpoints from lowutility areas to highutility areas rather than take the rl time to trainup those higherutility skills in other words youre asking for a skillpoint mechanism that allows you to fly the ship of the moment build the product of the moment invent the tools of the moment etc you have yet to provide any reason why this is needed in game finally this particular proposal which allows me to simultaneously learn and unlearn is also a veiled tool to learn lessoptimal skills at the fastest possible rate let me explain i max attribute map percepwill i train percep will skills and untrain those same skills it doesnt matter the rate at which i untrain them as my total sp pool is always increasing at the percepwill rate and given the enormous number of percepwill skills i will never run out of percepwill skills to train now every months or two i take the unlearned skillpoints to instantly learn any skill i want but am not optimized to train at my current place in game i would no longer need to worry about other attribute implants i would no longer need to worry about remaps i will always increase my total sp by the max possible rate and untrain occasion quicktolearn skills to learn the notsoquicktolearn skills sure im capped at 3m of sp redistribution a year but thats a lot of sp redistribution are you ready to admit you really just an fotm reroller or would you like to try againwhy do you want and deserve sp redistribution
firstly theres difference between skills that arent applicable to every ship and the skills that arent applicable to any ship that you may ever consider flying you see what i did there the thing is that these certain sps will never help me nor they will ever contribute in any way they are wasted simply secondly you pvping in expensvie implants has nothing to do with that clone costs increases fact thus high sp characters are penalized compared to lower sp ones also fact wait then how the could my method which makes you untrain skills at lowest possible speed allow to reroll faster than simply training these usually percwill skills at high attribute based speed care to explain if rerolling as you said takes just a little bit of time two weeks then what would be the point in untraining something at 1717 lowest possible attribute speed when you could simply train them at 3226 or so also keep in mind that you dont have unlitmited sp coming from respecs they are not magically taken out of your ss add to this an limited sp pool size that prevents stockpiling plus annually capped retrainable sp and you as fotm reroller are basically blocked in every waynone of the above is the case using this mechanism you cant have anything of the moment as sp stockpiling is basically disabled it needs a time and it needs more time than as it would by default you have yet to provide any reason why this is needed in game well i did many times read the topici must admit that this particular problem existed in previous version of this idea i posted on the old forums but fortunately its no longer the case after i added limitations in form of total cap and pool size assuming that you can untrain 1m sp which as i said is debatable and fully adjustable then you could train whole 1m charisma based skills at 32perc26will speed yay thats fantastic thats marginal amount now are you ready to admit that you are just being an really stubborn person
why do i get the feeling the op is a bitter toon who was bought and not trained from scratchand this is why hes pushing this foolish venture of an idea that has been rejected repeatedly stop the evemail spam
this is my counterproposal it solves all the same issues your proposal solves without breaking the game even those skills that arent applicable to any ship that you may ever consider flying still give you a potential advantage in this game because you can utilize them just because you choose to not utilize those skills does not mean they dont provide an ingame advantage and while the youre lowutility skillpoints contribute to an increased clone cost the extra cost is very small especially compared to the benefits gained by the extra sp this is a bullshit reason and you know it and if you feel otherwise my counterproposal gives you perfect solution that doesnt break the game at 1717 you earn 250k spweek specd you earn 300450k spweek with your annual 3m sp cap youre suggestion allows for 3 months of highly increased sp retraining let me explain what the status quo will be with your suggestion most players will retain their near cap sp pool until they need those sp they will instalearn something when they need it and then restock their sp for the next need a low stockcap will limit some of this but even at 1m spstorage they can learn a shitload of skills instantly to v and every skill in the game to iv by being able to apply those sp instantly your enabling anyone that stores their sp to instantly get into a ship or use a module or ability that they didnt specifically plan ahead for this is the primary definition of an fotm player and your redistribution scheme enables it even with your low cap prior to any major patch 85 of eve will start untraining their sp up to their sp cap come release date fotm fliers will have those instasps plus signficantly increased training speeds provided by the unlearnrelearn trick to very quickly get into any new and hot ship fotm builders will do the same allowing them to very quickly mass produce any fotm items etc etc etc this very much marginalizes the benefits a wellrounded player gets from having planned and previously trained the lessthanbooming stuff that is now booming this might seem like a nobigdeal thing to you but it undermines the longterm planners and players because their sp advantages are quickly negated by your sp redistribution this is what people are talking about when they mention instfotm repseccers and its reason number one why sp redistribution is wrong do you not understand this or do you just not care you realize that not being able to undo your mistakes is a core tenet of eve you dont get money back because you have buyers remorse after buying a bunch of overpriced stuff or misreading a contract and getting scammed or losing your ship to pirates or losing your ship to npcs because you fit the wrong hardeners or you fit the wrong rig on your ship or stuck in the wrong implant or    why should you be able to correct lessthanidea training choices training a lessthanidea skill does not prevent you from later on training a higherutility skill it doesnt hinder you from advancing in game
ive read your posts and no you didnt please prove me wrong by qote yourself here is the list of reasons ive seen you provide you would be able to correct our mistakes by cleaning out our character sheet  but living with your mistakes is a fundamental part of eve it saves on clone costs  solved by my counterproposal without any of the negatives listed below it allows for an aesthetic looking character sheet  solved by my counterproposal without any of the negatives listed below it would prevent players from unsubbing after they realized they wasted a few months training something less than ideal but it would also reduce the number of alt accounts because people would just respec insteadthats it all three pages have lots of rebuttles and lots of explaining mechanics lots of revisions to try and limit the loopholes your proposal makes but no good reasons why sp redistribution is a good thing needed in game your pros are almost entirely centered around the incorrect notion that your caps and limits prevent abuse by the way my counter proposal solves your clone cost and charsheet aesthetics reasons just fine without the fotm drawbacks here is a list of reasons you have been rebuttled it allows for fotm insta or nearinsta respecing i know youve tried to limit this but youre still enabling it whether you want to admit it or not it undermines the sp advantages of alreadytrained characters wating for rebuttle it doesnt fit within the rp scenario waiting for rebuttle you cant unexperience the experiences having those sps allowed you to do so why should you be allowed to unlearn those sp waiting lost subs from people rage quitting and lost subs from people respecing rather than alt training but you keep people that would ow unsub wout respec it allows you to train unspecd skills at optimal training times up to your annual sp cap but its capped at x million sp annually what currently notsocommon skills would people untrainretrain to learn with your 3m sp cap by the way 1m per year is about 5 of your total sp learned in a year 1m sp earns you l5 and 3 warfares to level v or cyno v or pefect rd or acct v or cc upgrades v or interpalnetary consolidation v or 2x armorshield compensation v or cybernetics v or infomorph v or jdo v or 12 of jdc v or thermo v or anchoring v or they can instalearn lost skills from t3 losses or    there are tons of extremely useful skills that people put off training becuase they arent specd for them and now they can redistribute 515 of their optimal trained sp to learn those more obscure sp
sorry but i got no time to write three doublea4 posts on daily basis so ill keep it shorter nowthey give me potential advantage which will most likely never be used while giving actual disadvantage that is always there sorry but i will pass and choose something that is used most of the time or wait or simply something that is used and no but 90m per clone is not cheap its actually cost of tier2 bsif 1m sp allows to get shitload of skills then those skills with their low multipliers could as well be trained traditionally almost equally fast they are non factors skills that matters the x8 and higher ones are practically not affected by this mechanism at all if you suggest that someone getting mining or some similarly important skill from lvl 4 to 5 will break the game you must seriously rethink what you say you keep mentioning these 3m sp in every second post like it was the core of this idea while its not ive pointed many times already its adjustable and open do discussion it could as well be 1m 500k or even fcking 100k sp in pool could decrease over time so you would be forced to redistribute faster sp pull could even not exists at all and skill points would be transferred from one skill directly to another completlely negating every single one of your objections why couldnt you suggest any of those but instead you come here to bash everything i sayi came with the pool idea since its here already working and implemented in game linking it with untraining mechanism code parts would make it much easier but hell lets just scrap it right its not its just stupid mantra repeated by people like drake draconis  co the thing they made it like that in 2003 doesnt mean its perfect and shouldnt be changed its game developers they can do mistakes

a 90m isk clone has 264m skillpoints and needs an extra 80m sp in unwanted skills to bump it up to the next level which even then is only a 30m difference in price no where near the cost of a t2 bs 500m realistically even if you spent the first year training skills you no longer want your increased clone cost from your desired skills to your current skills is on the order of 7 million isk or less this is not a signficant cost unless your a noob and if you are a noob you dont have that many sp so the cost is no where near 7 million this cost you point to is very very negligible for any competent player lvl 5 rnk 1 costs 256k double that for rank 2 512k triple it for rank 3 768k etc so 1m sp instatrains a rnk 4 skill to level v and gets you 80 of the way to completing a rank v those numbers are from scratch its pretty much exactly 1m sp to train from lvl iv to lvl v with a rank 5 skill if you think the only skills that matter are x8 and higher youre are very ignorant rank 4 and below all frigate and adv frigate skills trade skills most industry skills most pi skills all subsystem skills all social skills all armorshield core skills all ewar skills all medium weapons small weapons and most weapon support skills rank 5 any racial cruiser adv sc rdinvention skills cynos adv ewar skills drone skills large weapon skills leadership specialization skills rank 6 bc hac recon logistics awu warefare specialist hics transports rank 7 capital weapon skills starbase defense skills rank 8 command ships bs skills adv large weapons capital armorshield skills wc rank 9 fc bo marauders and capital ship skills 1m instatrains into a cruiserbc 2m instatrains into a bs and 3m instatrains capital shipsscenario ccp decides to revamp mining so it now pays better than incursions i have no mining skills to speak of but with 1m sp i can train industry v mining v  astrogeology v now my percepwill specd character suddenly can train mining barge to 3 win half a day and can be in exhumers within 2 weeks without the 1m in stored sp it would take me 28 additional days to get to the same spot half that if i had a couple respecs to use but i dont recent scenario ccp buffed assault ships to be awesome solopwning frigates with 1m sp to spare people could instatrain any t2 frig with t2 weapons people can instantly jump into ships like the hawk or harpy which were obscure and often untrained beforehand they could also instantly train assault ships v since it now fully fleshes out afs into potent little ships they no longer have to wait the 24 weeks to train these and can do it instantly optionally if i was an af builder i could instantly max my hawkharpy invention skills to maximize the profits associated with the new ship demands you specifically asked for cons  find one in your post you didnt ask for ideas on how to improve it not only did i find cons in your post like you asked i explicitly showed how your notion that this idea wont create fotm respecs is incorrect by the way you implicitly ask for critiques when you posted your idea to the forum area specifically designed to debate issues and ideas im trying not to bash on you nor undeservingly bash your idea but i am critique your idea by pointing out the major flaws in your idea sorry if this comes across as unhelpful but this is not a new idea nor is your spin on it additionally you do not come across as someone that has researched it nor as someone that understands the nuances within it this is why you have been met with such overwhelming negativity if you want to debate this too we can dig up some dev quotes supporting my notion we can point out the game mechanics the gm rulings and the examples that support my viewpoint however i dont think you really want to go there if you do let me know otherwise given the lack of valid reasons why we need this im ready to let this thread fade away into oblivion
double post i know butthe gms thoughtfully provided me with this link which lists a very different refund policy than i remember
done a search and only found 1 post that mentions it at all and that is quoted at the bottom of this postfirstly i have never had my accounts hacked i have a decent length password alphanumeric with symbols ectbut as added security a lot of new release games are giving the option to purchase a physical rsa style token that when activated means that without the physical token you cant login to the game even if you have the passwordi think that something like this to login to the client would improve security on accounts and reduce hacked accountsthings to make clear tho this should be optional if you dont want one you shouldnt have to have one this should be configurable to allow you to choose what asspects of eve need a token account managment forums client ect a single token should be used for all your accounts not 1 token per account flame on
did you actually read that quotewhy suggest something ccp are already doing albeit slowly
so a users post means ccp is actually working on it there is no mention of it anywhere other than that 1 post
proof please stop the evemail spam
if people would just be smart about their computer security there would never be an issue the only time a third party has access to someones account is when theyve given their password away either on purpose or accidentally physical keys doesnt prevent outside attackers from getting access any more than passwords do it just makes it harder for the user to give away their password by being stupidoh and you can already rig up physical security keys to work with eve with a bit of knowhow
users will always be users thats a given but if you need a code off a physical device in order to login how exactly do you propose i get hold of that code without the devicealso care to elaborate or support your comment that this can be done already postit notes with your password dont count
it was announced at fanfest last year v
i was asking for documented proofnot wordofmouth crapanyone can say they are working on ittmgive me a dev blogor an ccp annoucement saying this stop the evemail spam
one major issue with authenticators or whatever is that it will be a huge pita for people with multiple accounts which in eve is pretty much everyone so if they are optional a lot of people will never use them if they are not then prepare for authenticatorgate any technical issues with getting them to securely work with multiple accounts not withstandingalso op it doesnt matter a damn how much you have your numbers letters and cases mixed up in your password proof
cartoons are proof

make them way more expensive i mean titan in the 300 bil range negotiable same with supercarrier simple make them vulnerable to subcaps
price is not an issue for mega alliances only the smaller ones will be hurt by this and how will a price hike make them more vulnerable to sub caps
like i said negotiable jack it so high it will hurt the subcaps thing was a different thing make titans rely on smaller ships to kill smaller ships
facepalm what part of price isnt an issue for the megaalliances do you not get
i agree with the posts above you clearly have no idea how much isk the large alliances actually have you could charge a trillion and there would still be a ton of titans in gamealso make them vulnerable to sub caps doesnt really tell us what your plan is here can you be more specific as to how they should be made vulnerable
 really this is your grand slam solution to a problem that you clearly know nothing about please make sure the suicide booth door doesnt hit you in the ass as you biomass yourself immediately
but need to change their prices because the game changed after game start the alliance incomes increased at least 20x bigger ago 2004 and the titan prices without modules decreased from 100 billions to 5060 billionsanyone can buy easily a rare titan  easily can buy everyone a supercarrier because a ratter in 00 can ratting 1520 billion isk within 1 month at incurson someone made it 1days2billion iskneed to change this the supercaps number dramaticaly increased over 4000 in the past 2 years must stop this sht1st need to change supercarriers prices at least to 50100 billions need to change titan prices at least to 200300 billions increase mineral requirements 2x3x more2nd increasing their building times at least 3x times longer thats ridicuolus if a supercarier building time just short period longer than a carrier building time even then their hull size 810x bigger than carrier hull size this can be slowing littlebit their growing numbersand the last need nerfing their abilities make them more vulnerable against dread fleets etcneed to stop supercap blobs because i saw bigger supercap fleets than drake hordes not once over 500 supercap blob flying in 00
1nerd tracking 2make titan only have bpcs that can only be found once a month in lvl five missions of the titans faction 4make the price very high like 1 tril5make them take 8 months to build6nerf hp dramticlywhile this may seem to hurt small alliances i dont think they should have titans in the first place they are the biggest ship and only the biggest alliances should have them
btw nice troll
1 yes needs to be done carefully but ccp is already working on it2 maybe but the drop rates will have to be carefully done3 just no anything that increases null secs dependency on hi sec minerals is bad it would barely slow down production and most importantly would result in less super caps being killed and bigger super cap blobs because nobody would risk them by using them in anything less than wtfpwn blobs5 no as it would not result in less being built in a few months production would be back to normal6 maybe i dont know how many dommsdays it takes to kill a titan but im guessing quite a lot based only on the fact that so little actually die in titan vs titan battles perhaps instead of nerfing their ehp buff the things that kill them but only against supers  ie doomsdays do 200 more damage against titans 150 more against moms numbers pulled out of my ass and the same idea for fighter bombers and maybe dreadspersonally i am of the opinion that the best way to kill more of them is with new capitals such as a capital ewar ship maybe to replace tracking nerf or even a teir3 bc style ship with 8 xl gunslaunchers instead of ehp nerf
better ideamake them easier to build allow for building them in lowsec then challengers to the nullsec establishment can build their ownviva la revolution
no make it easier to kill them in production maybe like bombers can slip inside the pos field and bomb them with some special ombtype
1 seems fair to me
1 fix this already 
does iti have no gripe one way or the other but if anything it makes more sense that the bigger the ship the bigger the bomb when it blowsthe length of the fuse on that bomb is pretty arbitraryfor purposes of the gameaswritten you engage someone their ship blows up you win who the  cares who gets credit as long as the ship is gone
1face it we can already do this we choose agents that are near other agents for a reason making it official would let those willing to run tag missions do so and visa versa there is one more thing i suggestincrease the drop rate of tagsthat would 
if standings are so precious then yes tags are a bother and a half to acquire but if you do not care much about standings do a bit of rp or merely embrace the sandbox of consequence then they are rather bountifulwhat i proposed yes hirana is little old me would increase tag availability substantially as tag collection is a byproduct of fw plexing and giving pilots the choice by way of a button would allow for everyone not in the militias to gather them provided they are not attached at the hip to their standingsthe fact that the principal lp earners highsec runners does not want to tank standings with one faction or another is irrelevant to the question of whether tags are dropping enough  the tags are there just not freeforall lying on the ground there
first off until structure shoots are abolished you will never get rid of the need for large cap fleetssecond while large cap fleets are still needed you will never get rid of the necessity of having capital fleets and sub capital fleets set up as separate entitiesthird given the necessity of large fleets of cap ships you must make sure that said large cap fleets are balancedfourth carriers dreads and supercarriers are all currently well balanced around this concept only the titan is still balanced around the idea of it being a rare shipfifth my proposal is focused around fixing the only ship that is not balanced properly for current game mechanicssixth if you think that my proposal does not fix the problem with titans under current game mechanics i simply request that you explain why and provide a solution to improve the proposal if you cant do this please post elsewhereas a sub note you will never get rid of cap fleets even if you abolish structure shoots because too many people enjoy flying in cap fleets like i have said before cap fleets are as much a part of eve as subcap fleets even the terminology proves it subcapitali agree that dreads should not be able to hit anything smaller than battleships and in fact they cant even hit battleships while in siege mode due to the tracking penalty when in siege so the massive damage bonus of a sieged dread cant even be used on subcaps i think fighters are pretty well balanced atm due to their obvious weakness to smartbombs and bombers the superdread would not get the tracking capabilities of a titan but from a dread since thats what the new hull would be based on it would be balanced because it would also use a siege module making it only able to hit battleships with its guns while not in siege you wouldnt be able to tracking fit it either because you would have to fit a tank since you couldnt be remote repped while in siege the doomsday wouldnt be usable on subcaps eitheryou want to bring balance to the fleet by nerfing capitals until they cant stand on their own forcing them to become support for subcaps realistically you have it backwards destroyers frigates submarines and cruisers are all there to provide scouts and support for the aircraft carriers and battleships you say that a eve carrier should launch piloted ships instead of having fighters which is a nifty idea but it is not feasible even if you limited a carrier to launching 10 frigates each you would still need 11 pilots per carrier making one of the aformentioned necessary capital fleets require thousands of pilots before you even start counting dreads or supers eve does not have the playerbase or the server capacity to make this idea possible hence the existence of fightersdrones

after listening to a huge amount of whining about this on comms last night i have to admit its an issue that needs addressing
how about making cynos like whs 1 sc would cause the cyno to collapse so to speak so if you wanted to blob scs it would take a  ton of cynos instead of just 1 remove ability for supers to fit cynos
multipost
then attacking a system would be impossibleyou attack our home system we have 500 super caps we got them there last nightyou take your cyno alts in you have a few optionscyno all in one spot cyno all in random spots either way your screwed
wouldnt be a very bright idea to go in then huh defense is supposed to be easier then offense if you are set up for itso you now have 500 scs in a system looking pretty when absolutely nothing is going to come in the hostile scs are now free to hit another system and now you have to reposition to counter it if youre all holed up in you very last system it shouldnt be easy to take itif thats youre only nit picklolmove along and troll elsewhere
should be obvious no its the forum area specifically designed to debate issues and ideas after all feel free to criticize but try to contribute in less antieverything way a bit at least and no i didnt mean i support this posts by any case but saying no because 3m sp because no is so drakes draconis style till i proved that you werent right read all of the above posts and check that you have not showed anything you keep spamming about some unimportant low multiplier skills being affordable in faster training speed once per year as game breaking issue then you basically kept spamming this over and over the only other thing you say is that 90m clone cost means nothing which is just lol no point arguing with you you simply hide your lack of real arguments behind of your wall of text thats it i assure you this in its current form is new and totally mine idea though ive firstly posted it in its basic form an half year ago then reposted here with improvements ofcourse respec suggestions pops often here  once per week i heard  which is quite strange since in your opinion majority doesnt want it right annual respec ideas pops from time to time seen quite a few full respec ones but never seen this exact one well thought with all best parts of other suggestions merged in already as i said devs changes their opinions changes and games mechanics changes thing they thought will work perfectly in 2003 may not be so perfect in 2012 also gms opinions doesnt matter they say whatever they are told to say with no offence to gms but they are non factors in this caseand btw tier2 bs is not t2 bs
thats actually a really good question i dont have a solid answer but im open to suggestionsa couple things i thought of off the top of my head which are probably the most obvious answers option 1 capssupercaps supposedly cant use stargates because of some sort of mass limitation on the stargates themselves by this logic any ship that is capable of carrying multiple rigged unpackaged battleships also wouldnt be able to fit through a stargate therefore these ships would not work in highsec but still be viable in lownullsec where their forceprojection capabilities are most needed anyway it may not be the most pleasant answer but then again by the same token how easy should it be for a nullsec alliance or anyone really to cross from one end of the galaxy to the other something important to consideroption 2 allow them to use stargates but still not be able to cyno in highsec doesnt make a whole lot of sense by the lore as far as i understand it but if it must be done for some reason beyond how awesome would it be if  then thats one wayoption 3 special cyno for supercarriers motherships if you will like they used to be called itd work in highsec again doesnt make a whole lot of sense to me but you can write it into the lore as a new tech breakthrough or that this new modulated cyno is permitted by concord its still very important to consider the ramifications of giving nullsec quick and easy access to regions far far from their home turf naps are already a pretty rampant problem according to some of us and why bother fighting your neighbors when you can fight someone really far away at your relative liesurebased on these kneejerk options i like the idea of keeping this sort of forceprojection ability out of highsec i am open to discussion and suggestions though for sure i dont have all the answers just feedback as a really old player whether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
letting any capital ships into high sec would be a bad idea imo carriers are only slightly larger than freighters to begin with yet they cant use jump gates which leads me to believe that they arent allowed in high sec because concord doesnt want them there a freighter designed to carry rigged ships would need to be bigger than a standard freighter i would think so why not make it a teir 2 freighter instead of tech 2 then you could always add a tech 2 variant of your ship hauler with a lowered maint bay capacity and a jump drive
you could give it a long range and remove the gridfu problem itd probably be easier to code on account of using an existing mechanic as well just make it into a huge bubble effect like an interdictor probably not as dramatically apparent
i can pretty much fit my tech 3 very survivable even with 3 command links survivability isnt a problem i also think command ships are still very tough and in larger fights you can use titans or carriers i dont really see this survivability problem anywhere reallyalso this is a bit off topic but related matter in a sense how powerful these gang boosts are gang bonuses and links scale very badly for smaller fleets and gangs for those smaller skirmishes bonuses you get are very strong like think when you have over 20km webs and like 40km points on your ships this is on ships with no natural bonus on ranges yet add there other bonuses and its totally weird i would argue that gang links are not balanced at all and in many cases they break natural roles of ships etc
from the perspective of someone who lives in null sec this might make null sec roams also head into low sec a lot of people in null sec dont like to pvp in low sec because of the sec status hit they take we have to go to high sec at some point or another and if we are 10 then we just cant do that1
this tbh seems like everyone in low sec has a scout in all directions and bait cyno battle cruisers ready to bridge in a blob all one can do is try and bait themselves
bounties should affect the player and not just the character towards that end id like the introduction of associatesassociates are characters that have had financial dealings with the bountied character giving and receiving money contracts and window tradesusing a player defined filter a locator agent will display all the matching characters who can then have bounties placed on their heads
i have idea to fix loopholes or exploitshave it be that the payout is based half of anything that is lost and doesnt come back in insurance or drop for example fully insuring a ship and losing it will cause you to lose some money the payout will be half of the amount that would be lost regardless if a person fully insures the ship or not  if they have a alt kill themselves they still need to spend twice as much isk to remove the bounty through bounty hunting fraud and will not gain more then they lose another thing that can contribute to the payout for a kill is the cost of a clone half off the cost of a clone so even if they kill themselves and pod they would still be out on half the money needed for a new clone being something that frowned on in empire doing so might flag you with a bounty which gives incentive to do dirty work elsewhere or pay the price of being a outlaw hunter who themselves is a outlawsame with implants maybe even mods and rigs can be added into the system too half the value of the mods destroyed drop not counting by paying half of the value that is burned will make fraud unfeasible and unprofitable compared with paying 100 also with a new bounty system tied to kill rights makes greifing others nonpirates with bounties unlikely unlike killrights in current form bounties should last forever until paid out only the person who lost a ship or pod may place a bounty on a target with positive sec status in a week window frame and its a one time deal no forever additions unless the are negative sec statusthey should also allow people with bounties on head to be shot at anywhere without penalty untill the bounty is gone no highsec hiding for outlawsplayer sec status can still play a role in that if it is at all negative that anyone can place bounties on them at anytime how deep they are in the negative will determine how chronically they are stuck in it for grinding out of it having a high sec status does not excuse a person for past crimes and the still may be hunted by players without penalty killrights or concord until it goes awaybig reforms in bounty hunting will not only make it be a real profession but encourage those who are outlaws to stay out of highsec save clandestine incursions bounty hunters looking for the targets will venture into dangerous space themselves
not supportedthere exist 3 ways to get faction tags on a semi regular basis faction warfare missions faction warfare complexes and npc nullsec any change to the drop rates would be a boost to high sec mission running and a nerf to fw and 00 mission runningthere are actual pilots who make a tidy sum from running those missions and complexes and selling the tags i know this because i buy tags from them in their theaters of operation i also take the risk of transporting them to empirewant more faction tags run fw missions fw complexes or 00 missions on a regular basis and accept the negative effects caused by that activity edit there is a fourth way level 5 missions no one seems to collect the tagsat least they do not sell them locallybe careful what you think for your thoughts become your words be careful what you say for your words become your actions be careful what you do for your actions become your character and character is everything  author unknown
do you not think that the tag requirements for all items are pretty ludicrous especially since they were set way before fw and the like were twinkles in ccps eyes  which makes it all the more ridiculous additionally seeing as the distribution of antifaction missions is mindbogglingly stupid antiamarr missions for gallente anyone something definitely has to be done and forcing people to go out into low and null who simply dont want to leave high sec will accomplish nothingccp seriously needs to look at this situation  its not a matter of boosting mission running its a question of fixing the broken lp stores
i support this idea i dont know how many times ive been grinding missions for fun and isk only to suddenly receive an antiamarr mission funny enough its always antiamarr missions never the other empirefactions and have to stop running missions for another 4 hours its really annoying when youre already hated by the amarr and actually want to improve standings with them by working for their allies until you get access to better amarrmissionsas for the tagmarket i dont know how that looks i generally only work for soe or buy faction ammo from other factions because its just too bothersome getting those stupid tags for the marginally better factionmodules
jumpclones are a fantastic thing but in their current form theyre very gimpedtheres been a number of people ive spoken with whod like the timers reduced so that they can be part of more than one cta in a day using more than one implant set but cant do so due to the 24 hour cool off timer given the current state of pvp in eve a lot of corporations are swapping between fittings and gang styles such as going from fast moving buffer fitted shield gangs with logistics support to heavier groups of ahacs with guardian support often ctas for corporations are to the point where theres two within a 24 hour timeframe and people end up stuck in the wrong set of implants for the fleet they want to be a part ofobviously jumpclones with a simple reduction in timer are a bad idea because they can be used for i am the monkey i can go anywhere style shenanigans effectively bypassing a lot of travel the timers however do need addressing as theyre counter productive to the operations of a lot of corporationsproposal  reduction of jumpclone cooldown timer via high rank skillpros  cons governing the timer via a high rank skill means that those people who feel the need to have a faster jumpclone recovery time have the means to reduce the timers however it comes at the cost of dedicating significant time to the training as well as a remap to increase charisma for the duration of the trainingmaking the skill the same rank as a racial titan skillpack means that people who only decide to train it to level iv still have to invest a significant amount of time into doing so in order to get the benefit from itfurther benefits mean that small gang and solo pilots can have faster access to their clones to move around and diversify their fittings more without having to wait 24 hours to swap implant sets or move to a new sphere of operations the move to a trainable reduction in cooloff time between jump clones would empower small corporations to be able to be more versatile with what they can fieldif youre feeling the same about the jumpclone system being gimped feel free to like this post and spread the link around the more people who see it the betterverone ceo  executor veto corp wwwvetocorpcom
knew if i bitched about jcs long enough someone would word it right here 1
nice idea current system needs addressing for sure
1 seems like a good way to improve the current system without breaking it
1this will also serve to encourage carebears to try out pvp more pvp is good for everyonetwitter blog
i like reducing jc cooldown idea but not so much via adding another skill theres enough skills in game already someone said it would take 24 years to learn all of them and the more skills the bigger gap between new and old players becomesalso an x12 multiplier is still nothing hard to beat i could train it while not logging into the game even once soi would simply add an secondary effect to isomorph psychology reducing clone jumps so yeah i support this but i still could do it better

bump for relevence for the million miner march
i think others have clearly stated what is wrong in past wars it was it was not rock paper scissors but gold rock supers beating everything elsethe inability for the death ray targeting subcaps is a step in the right direction personal i thought it would be better if it could still be used just upping the miss chance for how small the ship is half miss on bs quarter hit cruiser 110 hit frig1 a clear issue is the ability for titans to hit anything smaller then capitals and bs 2 another is liberal use of fitting a titanic war machine should not be refit on the fly3 flat immunity to warp disruption and ewar it should be a tenfold better then a carrier but not a absolute same with warp strength 50 for titan 10 for super carrier
just recently i noticed a buysell margin trading scam in progress and decided to have an underhanded go at it quickly amassing the proper number of items in an outside market at a normal price i flew them over to drop on the buy order and it failed why did it fail because the amount of isk in escrow was lower than the value of the minimum buy order what this means the buy order was intentionally rigged to fail knowingly and intentionally placed despite the fact it could never be filledthis issue has been discussed to death but theres a pretty quick and logical solution to it one that inconveniences legitimate users only a little and absolutely ruins the unwatched buy order scam repeat this does nothing to the cancelled buy order variant of this scam when placing a buy order the margin trading skill allows players to place less than the total amount of isk in escrow 100 75 5625 4219 3164 2373 what i propose is that this number be compared to the isk value of the minimum volume for the buy order if any and the higher value used for the amount in escrowunder this process legitimate users of the margin trading skill can still place buy orders with minimum volumes  one way or another enough isk to cover the minimum purchase amount will be placed in escrowfor scammers this means that placing an order of say 500 units with a minimum volume of 500 units will require 100 of isk to be placed in escrow regardless of margin trading skill level eliminating the possibility that the order cannot be fulfilled by legitimate ingame means as noted this does not stop buy order cancellation scams only those that rely on the order automatically breaking when it cant be afforded from the placers end

hello ccp team i wondering what about next expansion of eve to add tier 3 bss i am sure this isnt the first time you see this idea but it is a good one i thinkso after you add tier 3 bcs which was very good step into eve world you can reconsider to offer t3 bssto avoid the repeating effect my suggestion is to make something like entire new battleship setup for each racethe thing wich spinning in my head is not to make bs for each race but only two designs one for armor tanking and one for shieldother things like firepower engineering electroncs can be like tech 3 ships with some kind of subsystemsthis way every player can choose the right ship for its own tanking skills and other things can be configurablethis is only the surface of the idea about tier 3 bss but i am sure your teams can make it a lot more creative and improvedbest regardsnick kavees
you know abbadon rokh maelstrom and hyperion are the tier 3 battleships
this was a dirty answer hem tech 2 battleships are already not very used except the obvious and hotdrop 151 titans can bridge fleets of thousands players so who needs blackopsany silly frigate can equip cyno and use it so who needs recons for that or covert cyno no one uses other than hotdrpers on a poor drake rating in nullthey have cloacky speed bonus nothing that makes those interesting to havefly for other purpose than hot drops and sry but this must be said again sin as gallente black ops makes already all black ops serie bs a jokeso why tech 3 battleships when tech 1 are already crap except for blobs 1 of 4 races still out witch happens almost in every aspect of eve except gates and undockswhy tech 3 bs when tech 2s are just expensive toys good to pave killboards
mmm  nope fix what we have then add new stuff meaning get rid of the tier system entirely and balance things based on rolenot supportedwhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
sorry my mistake so tier 4 not tech 3 because price would be too high
do we need tier 4 battleships or do you just want tier 4 battleships
the tier 3 has 8 gun slots and the best tank how can you get any higher then thatadd to that for some races its redundant anyway with 3 teirs when they have multiple racial gunship would this new ship be a 8 high slot with double damage bonus and no tankor in the flavor up upgunning things give it capital sized gunsadd to that maybe have a lower teir bs have lower powegrid twice the fire rate and 50 boast to range bonus with equipping medium guns

i was being sardonic with that postwhat i actually meant was dont just assume that this proposal is for lownull sec as people do still need to move ships around hi sec space as wellthis proposal would benefit all oh and by the way freighters jump freighters and orcas are capital ships and they are already used in hi sec as long as this ship does not have a direct combat capability it would just be following on from the capital ships already allowed in hi secstill would like to see a tug class ship solely for moving ships
i agree with you in all ways except for one glaring thing no matter how well tanked a thing is its not as survivable ongrid as it is offgrid thats what needs to change whether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
so you didnt read all the op right
if you support that like the op captain  the ideas are the same
this seems a simple fix any chance of it ever happening
you know once upon a time people used to travel from system to system and region to region using gates these were fun times as you had lots of little fights all over the place small gangs would roam around and run into other small gangs things would go boom and people were happy as they had fun win or loosenow people have jump bridges titan and to a lesser extent black ops bridging and with this new proposal jumpcloning that even a word if not should be all over eve its a good idea to get people into fleets but kind of has a knock on effect in actually reducing pvp as its hard to kill someone that jumps from one station to the nexti know ccp seem to be thinking the same thing when the nerfed or fixed jump bridges so i am not sure if this one would be one that ccp would likepersonally i like this idea but thats for selfish reasons as i dont want to fly all over eve if i can just jump clone to a new place instead
a better idea would be to increase the timer to one week
just make a cool down timer dependent upon jump range and nerf suicide travel 
so in the end with your skill maxed out the cool down timer will be at minimum 12 hours i could live with that 1 i think a new skill to train is the right way to do that as well
i dont think that jumpclones should be used more than onceday that would allow for too much instanttravel you should live with your decision of what youre flying for a day i would agree with a skill that reduces the jumpclone cooldown period to say 20 hours at the shortest to allow players to log in the next day and not have that annoying 30min wait but i think that jumpclones used more often than that would be bad for the game and would result in large fleets able to move too quickly
1 from me this has been a need for a long time
how about no skill needed but if the clone jump does not result in a location change you can do it in just a few hours after your last clone jump that way you can jump into a clone with different implants quickly but you still need 24 hours before you can jump across the universeit could even be fit into lore sending your mind across the universe is stressful and can only be done after a 24 hour recovery period but if you and your clone are in the same station and so can be hard wire connected the stress is much less and the jump can be done just a few hours after your last jump
i like the idea of giving more features and optimizing current ones1 also the forum rules clearly state bumps can only be made by the original poster no exception
having used the survey scanner once upon a time i agree that there needs to be something to highlight what you have targeted1
i watched a comedy moment with an awoxer and a mach the other day because of this very issue didnt end well for the mach pilot supported
qftthe only problem with supers and titans is that they can omgwtfbbq sub capitals both types are designed to fill an anti capital and supportcommandbonus and doomsday role because they are immune to ewar means they cant be stopped even by an overwhelming sub capital fleeti would sayremove immunityremove rr from sc meaning they need carrier supportadd 15 warp strngh to scadd 50 warp strength to titanremove fighters from scadd signature resolution to titan to prevent it blapping sub capsproblem solved
supercaps should not have ewar immunity its a broken design from the outset eas have their role if it is a teensy niche in the eve landscape just because you dont see everybody using them doesnt mean they arent used or useful
3 years ago they were alliancelevel assets and seeing one was awesome today they are individual assets and seeing one is meh hell even seeing killmails of one is meh
should just make a antititan frigate that flys into its drone bay and warpdrives into its engine core causing the eventual implosion of the titanor what you guys said i guess that works too
and what are alliances that dont have titans or have half the map napped going to protect their csaas with thats the problem contributer to eve is easy
not just titans but need increasing constructionbuild time for the all supercaps tooat least they need 3 months build time to slowing down supcap trends yearly 2k supercapital build is too muchother thing their prices too low increase them at least up to 3x
wouldnt do much of anything other than make existing supers a lot more valuable if aim was to slow it down then we are a few years too late as super blobs are already as standard as rr blobsmake the csaa more vulnerable as in associated pos having 2550 available space for stront and csaa taking so much fittings that there is a bare minimum available for gunsjammersetcallow small gangsfleets that are unable to engage the tower directly to disruptinterrupt build process by hacking andor completing some other secondary taskin short make it much less of an setupandforget thing and force super spammers to actually protect their nurseries
this has probably been discussed numerous times before i havent searched the entire forumget rid of out of game skill training now before you all go ballistic hear me out one of the major faults with the current system is one that has been around the block on many forums since the game first launched that of new players never being able to catch up with the veterans and this puts a lot of people off playing the game i myself know three players that actually login to the game no more than a couple of times a month each time for a few minutes to check their training queue and market changing the system would allow players who actually play to catch up and remove that obstacle to compensate for losing the ability to train out of game the training times would need to be reduced accordingly which in itself removes another percieved obstacle to new players the perception that skill training takes too longa danger to this of course is that people could just leave their toons logged in all day so i would also propose an automatic logout after 60 minutes of innactivity perhaps with a warning popup that if not cancelled will result in the logout this would also take care of a number of other issues such as mining bots etcwho would this measure upset the people that login for two minutes a month to set the training queue and those that use afk bots or exploitswho would benefit the people who actually play the game
so you want to completely break one of the core features of eve which sets it apart from other mmos in a great way hayou dont need to catch up with another players sp completely first off the 5level skill system makes it so that you can be completely even with another player that has twice your sp in certain areas sp doesnt make you any better it just gives you more optionsyour understanding of the skill system is fundamentally flawed which has led you to post an idea which is quite frankly stupid the skill system already works extremely well asis
this idea is terribadeve down under  a community for players in the autz
how much better can a 100m sp veteran character fly a rifter than a 20m sp character tactical logistics reconfiguration provides no benefit to rifterflying electronic warfare provides some benefit to unusual fit outs jump drive calibration has no impact nor do multitasking energy emission systems production efficiency scrapmetal processing starbase defence operation or ethnic relationsyoull find that you max out the skills required for flying a rifter when you can fit t2 modules  rigs of every kind and use 5 percent implants related to flying that ship heck with enough isk you dont even need to use t2 modules officerfit that rifter for a huge advantage over the competitionwhy are they still logging in are they waiting for their characters to get enough skills to compete with someone or are these other players logging in various market alts to update the training queue and market ordersthe existing system allows people who dont have 12 hours a day to play the game to play on a relatively level playing field no longer do the high school dropouts gain an advantage simply because they can grind for xp and legendary items 12 hours a day compared to my 12 hours a monthfixed that for youthis is a classic example of players making very bad game designers you have reached a point where there are a series of long skill training sessions ahead of you perhaps 7 days to get from frigate to battleship and it occurs to you that the game would be more entertaining for you if you could shortcircuit that training time somehow it doesnt occur to you that the real time training means you have to make compromises you cant train a character to fly a titan this year if you also want to run a corporation of a few hundred people you have to choose battleship 5 or ethnic relationsit is the sacrifices and compromises you have to make on the journey that make the game fun and challengingif you were able to shortcut the training by staying logged in so would everyone else then youd find that some people would manage to stay logged in from downtime to downtime far in excess of your ability to stay logged in for a few hours a nightbefore suggesting changes to game mechanics that you perceive would be to your benefit just remember that there is always someone out there who has more time and money to spend on the game than you do imagine how much fun your game would be if the veterans were able to shortcut their own training the same way you can except the veterans also have twice as much time to spend on their hobby as you doso you might suggest a limit of x hours a day of skilltrainingwhileloggedin which would eventually have to be wound back to fewer hours than you play because theres always someone out there who doesnt have as much time and money to throw at the game as you do why should you have an advantage over them after all you want to be fair dont you so ultimately the skill training for being logged in time gets reduced to the minimum amount of time that anyone spends logged in for the sake of the exercise lets say its about 30 seconds per day now everyone has to log in for at least 30 seconds a day in order to remain competitive since the skill training speed is so damned fast that not logging in for 30 seconds means you fall a day behind everyone elsesure thats an exercise in reductio ad absurdium but can you see that all these game features have to be evaluated from many perspectives you are not the only person who plays the gamehaving skills train in real time is the most fair method of character development short of not having skills at all
a few expected responses from long time players i see afraid someone may actually be able to compete the example with the rifter was hilarious  keep the noobs in crappy frigates they dont deserve to be as l33t as me  i also caught a hint of suggestion that i only want the skill change to benefit myself far from it considering i started to play eve when the game first released  check my employment history before assuming  eve needs new blood as any mmo does and a change that removes one of the major obstacles to new people playing has to be a good thing why do you think it is that no other mmo before eve or since uses this systemhowever i am not without the ability to compromise i firmly believe that actually playing the game should have its rewards so for those that wish their character to get better while they sleep fine leave it as it is but how about doubling the speed at which skills train when you are logged in this of course would still require the automatic logout feature to prevent it from being exploited
about 4 seconds after this went live some people would be macrobotting skills and powerlevelling services would sprout up like mushrooms veteran players are at least as capable of doing this as new players  in fact theyre probably more capable since theyre more likely to have multiple accounts and theyll be able to leave whichever ones theyre not using right now macroskilling away a classic demonstration of malcanis law in actionso yeah no im not enthusiasticone of the biggest attractions of eve is that you can spend your game time achieving your goals rather than having to grind skills youre still stuck in the skinner box of thinking that leveling your character as the goal rather than increasing skills to use as a tool to attain those goals its understandable since in almost all other mmo you can only win by maximising numbers on your character sheet because noone gives a crap that youre the 13896514th guy to kill naxia or whatever try and jettison that thinkingits incredible to me that youve finally found a game which frees you from the grindmill of levelling and yet you actually want to climb right back on it
even without an in depth knowledge of bot programming i can see this creating a new industry over night and gutting a key feature of this game
sounds like a wonderful way to turn eve into spacewow you know what happens to wow clones right
you missed this bitthe mmo industry are akin to a flock of carrion birds every really good idea is quickly pounced upon by the flock copied and inserted into their upcoming games eves skill training system has been avoided like the plague and for good reason i see nothing wrong with rewarding people for the work they put in if someone works twice as hard as me then they should have twice the reward wouldnt we all love it if we could sit at home all day watching tv and still collect our paycheques at the end of the month and this is exactly what the current skill system allows you to do instead we have to go to work to get that pay and that is a good thing because if we all stayed home the world would grind to a halt i am open to better ideas if anyone has any
so are you saying that prenge swg was a wow clone no it was a sandbox and one fondly remembered by those vets that played it skill based and no out of game skill increases
the skilltraining system is one of the few things in eve that doesnt need to be fixed whatsoever why because it works as well as intended if not betteras they say if it aint broken dont  it up horriblywhat you want wont help balancing anything at all you just want to be able to catch up to those with more sp who dont have as much evetime as youif anything i can point out a dozen things that ccp should rather take a look at revising
so you are basically saying that all the effort and years of game play that i had to do should be thrown out so someone new to the game can compete with me sure ill agree as long as my 5 years of subscriptions and sp are refunded to me so we can all start with a clean sheet seems fair dont you thinkseeing as you like real world examples of why this is a stupid idea how about comparing this to the 16 year old just out of school the noob joins a company for his first job the company has been around for many years and the guy thats hiring him the veteran has been there since day one now going with your idea the noob should have the veterans job so he can compete in the job market he shouldnt need to learn anything or have to grind his way to making money no it should be just handed to him because its fair thats what you are asking for never gonna happen
no i didnt miss it you suggest an automatic logout for inactivity  fair enough but a skillbotpowerlevelling service means that the character wont be inactiveyour idea is bad and it goes against the whole idea of eve you suggest that people should be rewarded for playing well they are they accumulate assets shoot their enemies rep their friends they get to actually achieve meaningful goals in an open worldlike i said youre stuck in the oldfashioned rpg mindset where the object of the game is to maximise your characters stats eve is not such a game
look maits a bitterboughttoon ing about skillsps my thougths echo everyoneelse that says nay for this foolish obscenely stupid proposal stop the evemail spam
the way skills training works in this regard will never change may as well just give up now on this one this is one of those mechanics at the very heart of eve that makes it what it is change this and you may as well just make a new game
yes lets reward those who are able to jog their mouse every 55 minutes by giving them lots of skill points while the rest of us can only train for a few hours a day at best
i could write a simple script that would allow me to circumvent your little attempt at preventing idling and im not that good a programmerwho would benefit no one
ugh  whatever happened to that proposal that npccorp toons were banned from posting ideas
this is one of the worst ideas ive read in the assembly hall a couple of points1  ideas like this should go to features and ideas before being posted in assembly hall that keeps assembly hall open for ideas that actually have merit 2 eve skill training style make the game you want to turn eve into wow  not going to happen as has been stated this idea is stupid on every level3 after you biomass yourself wow is over there 
op is mad because specialising is too hard to figure out
cracks knuckleschugs coffeeall right lets du theeesssthere is no such thing as catching up in eve at least not the way you see iton the skill system itself every skill caps out at level 5 only a certain number of skills affect any one shipmoduleweapon at any given time the difference between having a skill at level 4 and level 5 is about 2 to 5 per skill this means that if you have a whole bunch of skills in a certain specialty at level 4 you are operating at about 80 to 90 of the effectiveness of someone who has all the same skills at level 5 which is rarely the case because getting a skill to level 5 is supposed to be time consuming and painfulwhat the skill system does by having the skill system time down automatically players can freely explore the world around them andor focus on the goals they set for themselves rather than be consumed with the idea of becoming more powerful not having access to the top rated ships weapons and equipment means that a player must think of ways around hisher lacking skills to tackle a problem hire a guy who can probe how about fitting this mod here by being denied access to higher level equipment until ones skills are up to snuff a newbie is protected in a sense from hisher own stupidityignorance true any loss a newbie incurs early on is going to hurt but how much more painful do you think things would be if the newbie spent all of hisher time powerleveling and then went out in an expensive ship only to lose ithow ships and mods factor into all this ships are balanced against each other battleships may have beefier tanks and higher onpaper damage potential but they require a god awful amount of training to use to their fullest potential are slow have trouble target locking small ships have trouble applying damage to small ships that crappy frigate that a newbie is flying can last a long time against a fully skilled battleship if the frigate pilot has been taught well hell its entirely possible for a frigate gang to take down a bunch of battleships and a goddamn capital ship
for anyone late to this threadtldranother stupid idea to change the skills that isnt broken and just about everyone hates
as a fat lazy and forgetful meatbag as evidenced by my virtually nonexistent attempt to find out if this idea has been mooted here before i find it frustrating when my goldfishlike brain forgets to resume my skill training following a clone jump ive had occasions where i havent noticed my training queue was inactive for up to a day or two after performing a jumpthe actual proposal so theres no confusionwhen i open my jump clones tab on my character sheet select a clone and click jump my skill training queue should pause perform the jump and then immediately resume my skill training automaticallymake it soeve down under  a community for players in the autz
same thing with plugging in implants yeah its been needed and no reason not to for a long time were just waiting on the devs to realizeget around to it
agreed
agreed its a nice quality of life improvement
cue the bittervets saying the removal of several clicks is somehow dumbing down the gamei agree completely theres no point in having to leave your ships pause your queue and resume the queue later when its a required process for every jump lets assume the pilot did that and get on with the game and do the same for plugging in implants
agreed  theres really no reason to even fake a pause just let me jump andor plug in implants whenever i feel like and dont worry about skills that are being trained
well its a locking issue as to why the game requires a pause from what i know of programing im fairly sure theres a very good reason for the game to need to stop and restart the skill though its hard to explain in a simple way since it uses some fairly complex concepts however theres no need for the user to have to do it themselves whenever a clone jump or implant insertion happens you will always have to pause you skill and you will always want to resume it afterwards so theres no reason the server cant execute those three actions in sequence from one button click saying jump or plug in
agreednever understood why we have to go to such great pains to addremove implants and clone jumpsurely this can be automatedhell add a session timer extension at best if its needed stop the evemail spam
they have this if you fly the freighter and want to move fitted ships you contract the items to an alt and have the alt set up a courier contract with the freighter boom you can now move fitted ships in a freighter

as every one know eve is based on a self advancement of character skills that allows us to advance into the game this mean with time you get closer to mastering the game but that simple thing takes a lot of time and good knowledge of all skills and etcnow what i real like eve next big thing would be is to allow corporation to train them self giving a small but efficient bonus for all their corp mate now how does that would work pretty simple think of the current eve system a boss you comes in the game and he put skills to be trained on the character now what if we put this on a corp base the boss the ceo as to come on the game and go throught the corp management window and decide what type of sector the corporation should invest time intowareconomymanufacturingprocessingtheses 4 domains would cover all eve available activitys that it is from mining to kill peoples in 00 what is the rp way of that new feature wel i think of it that way a corp could invest on buying scientist and placing them into they office at any station each station could give a bonus to the duration in time the scientist can last lets give him 3 hours if i a ceo purchase 300 scientist this mean i will be able to define how much of them will be working at the same time so i can decide for a balance between time and long term duration now let say one scientist work at a speed of 10 points an hour my current office and all its upgrades allow me to run a max of 3 scientist at the same time so lets make a review i have 3 scientist working at 10 points an hour they will last 3 hours witch means 90 points over x amount of points for the war sector this mean they will work on trying to find new bonuses to allow general achievement to all the corp warriorsthere are 2 sides to this feature good this can allow a vast a new vision of eve to the old players it can bring their interest to the game as they can get a large feature to explore again it also add a new way of valorising your corporation as only wealth can influence this feature in a small way a war focused corporation could have bonuses that could allow lower player to find match in batt le or could help lower corps to get more tactical and find more power to overcome veterans corporation giving more challenge to the veterans as they will find it harder to b peoples with great additional bonus to their shipsbadof not settled correctly this could unbalance the entire eve online universe making the advantages to big for one side only what i see in this feature is something hard and long to achieve i am talking of months before the research progress can bring any advantages to the corps mate but once done it can be used as a powerfull skill for more advanced pvp player or more hardcore playerthere are thousand of ways of seing this feature and modifying it to adapt it to eve universe tell me what you think and if you think its way to much text and mistakes into the text consider the fact that i am typing on an ipad and my native language is french thank you for reading
keeping this space for further explanation and structure to the featureor mainly reserved
why how would this benefit eve as a whole
i see this as unbalanced and exploitable  let me explaina large alliance can now afford to put scientists in every station etc max levels now being part of said alliance means that i train a little faster become a better pilot quicker etc however one of the core concepts of eve is that the skill queue is not affected by anything  not by corp status not by length of time youve been playing etc the only thing that has any impact is implants which are available to anyone blah blah eve will never have any sp bonuses respecs purchasing sp etc any of those would be gamebreaking in eve and are not needed at all side note ideas belong in the features and ideas discussion subforum not assembly hall
before you even consider adding a new ship to eve you really have to have an idea of which role it will fillt1 battleships cover just about every role for the battleship classes as it is t2 battleships are pretty awful for the most part which is why you rarely seem them exception is the marauders in pve but even those are pretty rare still as yet again the t1 battleships do the job just as well for a fraction of the costa new tier or a t3 version of the battleship would need to do something that the t1 and t2 variants cant and i cannot think of something that would not be done better by t1 ships at this timebetter to fix what we have before we go looking for a new tier or t3 ships for the battleship class
i thought he was going to suggest bs with small tank and capital sized turrets
much as i know i ought to hate that idea i cant help an irrational attraction to it
id rather see an 888 supersubcapt1 and t2 variants except gallente of course they get a new hull with 40k base hull hp a 666 layout and the same drone control system as a dominix just to be fair
cuz you guys turn the topic to what we neednot what is fun my point was we saytwo tier 4 bss one with bonuses for armor other for shield and depending on the subsystem is equipped following bonuses for turrets missiles electronics engineering etcso that way the only issue player must consider is what kind of skill he has better for tankingno need to be afraid of some new upgrades in game after all this is the thing which making the fun from whole gamingwhy we must put limitations around all stuff do i need that or i am just too bothered to be creative so please stop making excuses of typewe got everything or fix the old ship specs because we afraid of the new ideas different from our owns
its the bigger gun is better syndrome i know a great therapist for that  stop the evemail spam
first of theres this thing called grammar its pretty cool you should check it outand back to the topic the more intelligent members of the community ask you to provide justification for a need for good reason if it doesnt have a need in the game then its better to not have it in the gamesee this quote from the whole refocusing on bettering the game after the incarna fiasco
absolutely fantastic proposalfriendly bumpto the pessimistic csm member if ccp wanted to leave their game development to their game devs you wouldnt be csm because there would be no csm there would be no features  ideas discussion it would look like all the other mmorpgs out there that are dying have a little faith in the powers that areand concerning the comment about how eves game devs are better thinktanks than the general public may be true in the wider spectrum but as an artist and as any great artist will tell you the best ideas and inspiration come from not within but from withoutsurely i think if ccp does take on this proposal it will have to be run through their game developers to fit in with a criteria that we are all clueless about which may burn the concept down to some core elements but hell if only 20 of this proposal gets accepted i will be a happy camper1 to eves evolution
im in doubtalthough i can see the advantages of some of the op suggestionsi have some question1 wouldnt just end up in pirates that flee by jumping in to high sec2 wouldnt it kill faction war why join the millitia and be a target all the time even in highsec for other players while you just can kill at randomwhy not let pirates players connect with some of the pirate factions for instance ally your self with the guritas go kill people sec status lowers as normal though as one of the greatest meneces of the caldari gelante allow you a safe have in their empire space they might be a little less happy when you kill gellante pilots thoughor leave the pirated factions out and just let people sign up as privateer with a safe haven at the empire that gave him his licencethen you have your way to enter parts of highsec and there are still concequenses to pirating you couold still go pirating the old way as well with the current penaltiesthat is rather simple without wrecking other game mechanics like faction war that gets a large update comming expantion i believe what might make it hard to get ccp to go with the original idea
as a mining and industy character i should flame you and give you carebear tears but i sir fully endorse this idea sounds good
as a new player i so totally agree with this proposition
i agree
i was wondering why those rogue drones strong em resist hole were taking only slightly more damage from the acolytes as they were from the warriors i cant believe i never noticed this beforeccp should hotfix this seriously2
anyone else have some suggestions to improve the proposal comments and thoughts are welcome if they focus on the topic
1 more immersion is good
i like this
to me it seems hand in hand with alts the lesser amount of restrictions on jump clones the less of a bonus players get from multiple accounts in some small ways anywayas a person who only uses one account and one character i like the idea but i also see many reasons why other players would be oppose to ithowever anything below 12 hours is pushing it and anything below 6 would be nearly game breaking
i had no idea still cant find that rule i guess this makes me a rebel worth being a rebel to support a good idea though whether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
the word minerals has the word miner in itminerals should mainly be coming from miners not mission runners and drone poopif this would cause prices of items to raise thus reducing pvp then buff miners to make up for itminers are in need of a good buff  or maybe not a buff but atleast an update 
i vaguely remembering something about this before and it seems theres very little minerals released from refining loot from missions in comparison to mining and drone lootagain i am sure there was some proposal from ccp about changing the drones in the drone regions to have bounty and not drop the current loot for mineralsthat alone would buff miners as that accounts for a huge amount of minerals in the gameprobably best to do a search on the forums about this think it was in the latest csm minutes
not supported i like the new names
new names are better
i agree
good idea i am not a mining fan but when i have to do corp mining ops it is a great toolalso a current alternative can be to change your overview setting byopen a new tabright click the tabselect mining presetit will show you all the rocks that are around you and you will be able to know what you are currently targettingit wont show the quantity of the rock but by selecting it from the overview it will most likely select it from the survey scannervoilUFFFD but 1 for the idea
supported
this should have been done initially1
csaas arent destroyed everyday adn even if they dotn field supercaps these alrge powerblocs that can afford these hundreds of csaas could just rifterblob any sort of aggression to death all this would do is ensure that only the largest of alliances woudl eba ble to defend and construct capitals so only they woudl get them effectively closing off 00 to any alliancecorp not willing to bend over and take it daily from a 00 slavedriver so no simply increasing the amount of time to build a titan would not help
here is the link to the part of the forum the petition is one all support is appreciated us linux users need our own client just like the windows and mac users have
no please nolast time they tried they did a halfed job and messed it upbetter that they mostly ignore us
iirc macs dont have their own client either theyre running a win client which sits on top of a variant of wine the issue is that separate clients require more development work and they already have enough issues keeping the bugs out without branching for another os im an avid linux user myself and i understand the frustration but i also understand the issues with trying to develop for multiple oses in parallel and fear that it would cause more issues than it would solve
i can understand every ones fear of this happening in the sense of them messing it up bad and making it more of a problem than a remedy but isnt that what the linux development community does we strive for things to be accepted in our way to also to help out in anyway we can in these developments windows is a primary operating system linux is pushed back into the closet and forgot about i say give them a chance and one all things have come and they have done there best then make the choice to accept the new client or to throw it away they have come a long way in many things lets give them a chance and give us a chance to truly enjoy the way we choose to compute and game
as much as this would be great for all the linux users its purely for a minority of users so using ccps time for a new client wouldnt really be the best ideai run eve on wine and it works well for me so i am relatively happy about this
your above justification for brining in a different skilllevelling system is fundamentally flawed the system you are proposing could be as easily used by any veteran pilot as well as a newstarter therefore new players will still be behind veteran players in all the same respects as they are currentlyi agree that increased activity in the game should bear merits but it does already the more i exercise pvp in eve the better i get at it the more lootisk i collect and i learn more about the myriad of mechanics and tactics involved in pvp  making me better than someone who didnt bother logging in at all the more i watch the market flow the more profit i will make when i sellbuy at the right time as opposed to those that miss out because they are logged out the more i shoot little red crosses and rocks in space the more isk i will make by reaping the rewards and so ontherefore there are clear rewards for activelly playing eve and no training skills is not one of them as it shouldnt be you are playing the wrong game
frigates are crappy have you actually flown onethere you go again entirely avoiding discussion of the main issue i raised how does training faster when you are logged in benefit a new player more than an old one this foolish proposal will only aid bot users and people with no lives outside the gamewhy are you attempting to frame your suggestion as a boon for new players when it obviously is not have you considered how many people play the game for more hours than you do would you be suggesting this idea if you only had half the time to play the game that everyone else does
it takes literally 5 days to train your toon into a competent pvp pilot not supported
is this a troll or are you actually mentally challengedor are you enslaved by a korean wow meatgrinder trying to find new markets
so what happens if i go on a vacation and cant play eve do i lose all my skillpoints for that period and there is a way for new players to catch up its called farm isk and buy a character only change to skills i would like to see is being able to update skills from a smartphone app you can already check your mail and stuff so idk why you cant update skills say your at work and your skill que goes down thats lost points but who am i to make suggestions
your only choice right now is to queue up a l5 skill that will take longer to finish than your vacation and there are plenty though you might have to go off plan or lose the pointsit isnt fair or logical but apparently thats the way folks like things around here
its called planning ahead common sense yes stop the evemail spam
ccp has made some noises in the past about being able to update the skill queue through eve gate i guess theres some internal discussion happening about whether it would encourage character farming bots or whether the utility to players is more important than any ability to exploit the webbased interface for personal gain
dear god this ideawhy have we not talked about this before
supported this does get annoying plz implement this
i agree something like this is long overdue
not so complexthey generalcased implants since a change in training implants may change your skill training time your skill training needs to be stopped recalculated and restartedthey just made it such that the player does this instead of the program
we have many times many many times it keeps coming up every few weeksmonth since ccp hasnt gotten around to fixing it yet
yes pls
minmatar ewar consists of target painters and stasis webifiers everyone uses them but the minmatar ewar ships specialize in them why then if they are so popular do some of these specialized ships never get usedi see some problems with minmatar ewar and have brought some solutions both to nerf the over powered and to buff the underpowered to bring these ewar ships into usage and to smooth out this particular field of ewaritem 1 stasis webifier velocity reduction bonusthe ships that have this bonus to my knowledge are the cruor daredevil ashimmu vigilant and vindicator at skill level 5 they have a 50 bonus to the velocity factor of stasis webifiers per level with a tech 2 stasis webifier this results in a 90 velocity reduction from only one webifier considering stacking penalties it would take 5 tech ii stasis webifiers to reduce a targets velocity by 90 without this skill bonus therefore it seems way out of proportion i propose that the 50 bonus be calculated in a different waytargets speed  xspeed reduction factor  y x  normal speed reduction y x  speed reduction with level 5 ship skill bonusy  15this would cause the total speed reduction from one webifier on a ship with the speed reduction bonus at level 5 to be 733 this is quite a bit of speed reduction almost as much as 2 webifiers without the bonus if multiple webifiers are used with the bonus the targets speed can be reduced to a negligible amount however it leaves a potential reason to fit more than 1 webifier rather than leaving 1 webifier to be the end all be all of webbing or god forbid allow a single ship to web several ships near it almost to a complete standstillitem 2 poor slot layout for the vigil and hyenaanyone flying an ewar frigate in pvp usually does so in a decentsized group and will fit the ship for allout ewar potency knowing that it wont last long in enemy fire no matter how its fit the idea is either to subdue the opponents and not allow them to attack the frigate or in the case of the vigil or hyena make sure the opponents dont have time to attack the frigatethe vigil has 3 mid slots and the hyena has 4 mid slots this is room for one prop module always a good thing to have 1 webifier and 1 or 2 target painters and then there are 3 low slots which could maybe be used for some tank or a bit of speedagility boost perhaps theyre not particularly useful for anything really if they were mid slots they could just as easily be used for tank or they could be used for more target painters or stasis webifiersif they had 5 or 6 mid slots they could fit a prop module with 2 stasis webifiers and 23 target painters these webifiers can be used to web two separate targets or since the ships do not have a velocity reduction bonus to stack together to really slow a target down with 23 target painters on a target and that hefty minmatar frigate skill bonus to target painters a ships signature radius can be blown up even more than double the vigil or hyena wont last long but with that kind of power they can turn the tide of battle in seconds and that would make them worth fielding as they are nobody flies them because its just easier and more effective to put the odd target painter or stasis webifier on random ships throughout the fleet who happen to have an extra slot handy and they get no skill bonuses to this ewaritem 3 no rigs for minmatar ewargranted the particle disperson projector increases the range of target painters as well as other ewar modules but there are none that increase the effectiveness of minmatar ewar the particle dispersion projector doesnt even increase the range of webifiers which given their short range would in many cases be akin to increasing their effectiveness also target painter range is so long that in most cases its range is a nonfactori propose the following rigs be addedsignature projection amplifier iincreases the effectiveness of fitted target painters by 5 at the expense of 10 shield hpcalibration cost 200signature projection amplifier iiincreases the effectiveness of fitted target painters by 75 at the expense of 10 shield hpcalibration cost 300propulsion jamming projector iincreases the optimal range of fitted warp scramblers warp disruptors and stasis webifiers by 10 at the cost of 10 shieldscalibration cost 100propulsion jamming projector iiincreases the optimal range of fitted warp scramblers warp disruptors and stasis webifiers by 15 at the cost of 10 shieldscalibration cost 150thats all i have to say about that i hope anyone who reads this can agree that minmatar ewar could use some looking at plus a bit of quick and easy balancing this stuff seems pretty obvious really i can only guess that nobody at ccp has taken very much time to examine this particular field indepth
posting in a buff minmatar thread albeit one that claims that huginns and rapiers are never used anywaysix medslots for the vigil come on the race with the most medslots is supposed to be caldari and minmatar ewar is supposed to be poorer because of minmatars advantages in mobility and sig all those electronic jobbies are heavy and take a lot of power adding more will slow your ships and increase your sig you know
just because you dont use them does not mean they are not used
i never claimed that huginns and rapiers arent used and i would never do thati merely used 6 mid slots as an example and it was intended only for the hyena 5 would be fine but 4 is too few and 3 on the vigil is way too few
its your opening argumentnot really the kitsune has five medslots the griffin has four why should minmatar have caldari slot layouts one medslot fewer on the minmatar counterparts seems entirely appropriate
are you kidding me minmitar ew bonus is the best in game for catching nanos which are pretty much the standard roaming gangs these days they are also included in nano roaming gangs to stop tacklersin no way to they need a buff to their slots or ew strength they are already the chosen race
quotereaver glitterstimminmatar ewar consists of target painters and stasis webifiers everyone uses them but the minmatar ewar ships specialize in them why then if they are so popular do these specialized ships never get usednever used eh maybe not if youre a carebear oh wait theyre popular in incursions and wormhole use which is elite sauce pve for carebearsi think you your are sadly misinformed the loki rapier and huggin are the most dangerous ewar ships anyone can encounter because unlike the falcon these ewar ships can carry tank and do more than hope to jam something out 1 for a poor idea1 for not researching before proposing a pointless change
the only ships i see these days that actually use their ewar bonuses are minmatar shipsany fleet fights will have a ton of huginns and lachesis massive web and point range are all the in thing at the moment so i would say the ewar bonuses for minmatar are working fine wouldnt say the same for damps though

crossposting an idea that is contested in the original thread is pretty poor form stick to your original thread and continue revising it till its widely supported before posting it here
to top that offbeing able to throw 2 space bombs is overkill dpswhen well the foolish ideas will stop stop the evemail spam
did you read anything more then 2 bombs or was that it they can only target capital ships much like the dooms day weapon bomb launchers are only able to fire in 00 how is this overkill when your going up against ships with 35 mill  hp
oh i read it alrighti was pointing out the most obviousbeing only able ot target capitals is just next step down a slippery slopeno ones going to fly a ship that only targets capsedit btw smartyou dont need to target  to use a bombobviously you didnt think about that now did you stop the evemail spam
so making a new laucher you could make it use targeting and yes i want it just to target capital because like so many people have said it needs to have a defined role that no other ship class can do
then you get people who use cap ships as baitand wipe out entire sub cap fleets with multiple bombsagainanswer is a resounding noits full of holesand expoitation is drastically easy on this stop the evemail spam
so you use a cap ship as bait and the fact that the bombs only have a 3km explosion radius and they must lock a target to fire makes them anti sup cap how
as much fun as this would be i would have to say its not that great an ideamy reason for this is that dreads are supposed to be the capitalstructure killers and lack a role as it is this proposal will just make them suck even more why waste a year or more training for a dread when a bomber can do the jobno let dreads kill capitals as intended bombers are purely to cause havoc on large concentrations of ships and these roles should remain that way
you do not speak for the entire playerbase vertisce you speak only for yourselfanyways1 i like this idea new graphics are movie quality this game needs movie quality sound effects
in space no one can hear you pew
i use 180mm autos instead of the 220mm purely because the firing sound from the 220mm sounds like a flatulent mosquitoand then there is the abaddons that greet you with the crackling soundeffects from the 1980s
i wouldnt miss most of the weapon sound effects though i dont think theyre particularly bad either however i would like to state very clearly that i would not be a happy camper if something were to happen to my giant staple gun sound medium railguns
the issue for me is if you join faction warfare then you are signing up basically for the army for war so why should you be allowed to carebear and farm high sec lucrative fw missions and be protected by the navyi suggest you remove the high sec militia boundaries and the navy if someone has voluntarily signed up for faction war then they should have all the risks of being in a war
so if my commanding officer sends me out to go do a mission i am to expect no backup or rescue should i be attacked by the enemyi really dont do fw but with the way you posted this is how i would see it
shrug get over it eve is a sandbox theyre playing the way they want to and theres nothing wrong with it if you want to kill them then go do it theres nothing stopping you
ccp can you please do something like an automated response system to petitions i know you know how many petitions you have open at any time i know you know some petitions take 5 mins most take 1015 for investigation and maybe 5 more for reply and some take hours and worse yet the qa that ensues but you can say a health average is 15min now say like over the holidays when you had 6000 some petitions it would be so simple to write a program that says 6000x1590000 minutes of work holy  lol now divide that by how many gms you have idk the number but i know yall said it takes somewhere around 6 months to train a veteran eve player to be a fully fledged gm they better get paid good for this crap lol so it cant be too many but lets say you got 10 people doing petitions 8 hours a day idk if you even have 24hr support but for arguments sake ill say you dont so 90k minutes divided by 10 ppl thats 9000 minutes of work load so 9000 minutes translates into 150 hours 150 hours at 8 hours a day thats roughly 19 days 1875 till someone could expect a response now it all makes sense so have the system say hey dude we recieved your petition we love you and value you as a customer ehug high five bro we are a little behind and you can expect a reply in roughly 19 days i would cry but at least i know your working it now i know you dont usually have such a high load of petitions as you did over the holidays due to gms being home for xmas and drunk for new years and what not and maybe you got more than 10 ppl working it maybe you have longer than 8 hour days or more than one shift idk i hope you do but that would at least shut ppl up from emailing you multiple times asking wtf man why arent you answering me i hate this game qq imma go play wow now after thats said i would like to say thank you to the gms i know your workload is astounding and the general eve player has no idea how much work actually goes into this stuff just a suggestion it probably wont happen but hey maybe if some people read this they will gain some respect for the guys behind the scenes oh and kudos to the other departments too like all you artsy guys who make planets look cool and programmers and on and on wall of text finished fly safetldr make an automated reply for petitions with an estimated response time
oh thanks bud sorry didnt know this was enlish 101 forums feel free to spell check and ill go ahead and edit it in to the post otherwise quit wasting my time oh and thanks for the free bump
the place for stupid ideas that are poorly written out is called the features and ideas discussion subforum and its over there
wouldnt their time be better spent actually replying to the petitions rather than writing more code for an automated system that probably wouldnt be accurate anywaygiving people an estimate is a really bad idea because people being people will automatically assume that their petition will be dealt with in that time frame however there are many reasons why it may not be and this will generate more angry responsesbest just to confirm its actually being looked atreceived and leave it to ccp to decide how best to deal with their workload
i agree
i would support this if you untrained at the same speed you trained based on your current attributes  implants provided you only get half of your sp back to allocate freelyconsidering its slow and gradual i think there would not be a problem with it if people buy a character and then untrain it into new skills they could just as easily have bought a character that had those skills instead thus the arguments against it are irrelevant it would let you train into a skill faster provided your total sp gain has been greatly reducedonce again i only support this if you lose half of the sp you untrain1editas you untrain a skill the sp should be directly transferred to another skill so you would have two skills at once in the queue it would end when the first one finishes this is to avoid stealth skill training all of a sudden with stored sp
yes but the point being that you have the option to use sp you have already aquired towards something else while untraining you would not gain any new sp your total sp stays the same you instead gain unallocated sp and lose a skill i believe his proposal is to allow both training and untraining at the same time i would not support that
what would be the point of untraining if you could just delete these skills while training something usefull instaed that makes no sense to be honest what you want is not untraining nor any sort of partial respec but an simple delete sp option
your entire proposal makes no sense it would be gamebreaking in eve and defeat one of the core concepts of the game this will never happen so get used to it otherwise please biomass yourself and go play wowspace barbiesswor
primarily just to get rid of the skill and use the sp towards something else the primary reason one wants to get rid of a skill is because they dont use it well finebut you should be able to gain from your mistake and you certainly should be penalized for screwing up and wanting to fix it heck i would just get rid of one or two skills my character started with that i will likely never use unless i decide to go ahead and train for gallente ships
i support
i think that some designs should be bought with plex or aurum and those or any other very expensive designs should be kept after ship destruction but i also want cheaper destructible designs for more on a whim experimenting or just trying out a varietyi also feel there should be 3 menu options show all designs default setting show only my ship design show only default skins 1
thanks i will add that to my list of stuffs 
also must have purple rifter for 100k isk or less
i agree
i have noticed the same thing i felt that the quality of service and response time of the gms was positively stellar when i first started playing now it feels like i cant be sure if the logs really are lacking pertinent information or if multiple gms dont know how to read themim waiting on two ship replacement petitions both of which have been declined and closed one of these was due to a bug that had been reported in the forums by multiple players and a fix had allegedly been put in the works i was told that this aggression bug had been fixed even though it happened to me and was told that the logs show nothing by three gms
first of this is a proposition of a feature that can be included into eve if i am wrong i will move thissecond i didnt said it would affect directly the skills what i said is that it would give an advantage to the member of that corporation pretty much like a global implant that is applied into the entire corp third there are ways to balance this i could write down pages and pages trying to explain you the whole point here butin short you can also compare it to a pos it requires fuel aka scientist it requires a suitable location the office and what makes you think there can be more than one training all i am saying is would you be in the favor of having the ability to have corporation trainable ability or not
well unless someone has rich friends or plays pay to win the higher level implants arent available to them for quite a while after they start playingso no implants arent available to everyone except in the loosest theoretical senseagreed on this belonging in fi though
the only combat capability one of these ship classes would have would be purely defensive modules modules designed to break locks and assist in escaping hostilities and some base tank modulesi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
if anything i would think that tech would move away from bras
1 more npcs flying around would be cool too see lets hope the amarr carry good loot
good idea verone but dosnt 10 per lvl is to high maby 5 would be beter 
currently bookmarks are limited to 13k you can still install more then that but no longer make your own unique ones some of us have well over 15 to 20k since a good majority of us have characters that have been in the game for 3 or more years of course we would end up getting to our limit one day id like to see an increase to 25 or maybe even 50k so people can once again get back to making more
really for the love of godwhy would you possibly want that many damned bookmarks you got every pos bmd for every system in eve or something how about instead of asking ccp to increase an already insane number even higher you actually do something about it yourself and clean housenot saying i wont support itit just baffles me that someone would need let alone want that many bookmarks
head over to seleenes sandbox where the issue is being discussed reducing the value of reprocessing is not a good idea imho
i have heard others agree that drones should stop dropping compounds that reprocess for minerals as a matter of fact mineral income from sources other than mining actually outweigh total mining yield even though most of the mining yield comes from bots reducing the minerals from sources other than mining will not have all these crazy effects that so many people come up with they need to think more than one step ahead les minerals means mineral prices rise means more players mine the market would find a new equilibrium mining would be a higher paying profession and more commonly done by regular players and ship prices would also rise significantly but not dramaticallyid plus one you but its already being discussed elsewhere
nice short corniel but no that doesnt work im afraid  wished it did though
indeed thanks to everyone thats bumped up so far and many thanks to csm trebor daehdoow for his support on this topic more bumps  tell your friends
increasing the time for assembling them may be good idea
it would be nice if they acknowledged and supported wine as a windows versionthat would suffice for support imho
wont happen they stopped supporting linux for a reason the 0002 of players that use it just isnt worth it
oh hey then weve all posted to this thread already and were done heremore people are playing on linux than ever used the official linux client and with their new diagnostic tools ccp can probably tell how many of us there really aremore importantly we are willing to make an extra effort to play the game unlike those lazy mswindows users who just settle for whatever was packed on their system to begin with
fine the idea didnt go down well i can live with that as this is afterall a place for discussion what i will not live with is tossers like you assuming that this is a bought toon i remember fighting through moo jetcan blockades high value ores in high sec belts taking the time to set waypoints 10km past the gates as we had no warp to 0 function a time when it was considered an achievment to get a cruiser instead of isk falling out of cornflake boxes as it does now so stfu if you have nothing constructive to add to a discussion then dont add anything
no
all youve done is quote common knowledgesorrybut were not buying itthose who have such high numbers of sps wouldnt propose an obviously stupidfaulty ideaespecially with a horrid gap in employment historythe fact you feel so strongly about it and telling me to stfu llke some 3 year old is proof enougheither you learn to live with the skills you trained or bought for that matter or you stfu right backi dont see any other legitimate old timers throwing a damned fit about their choicesso why do you have a problem with it self proclaimed expertget over yourselfthe skill system in this game is a one of a kindits what sets it apart from all others we dont need someone turning it into wow with prophecies of doom and gloom and people leaving the gamecomplete and utter bs that isbtw  everyone else is waiting on your answer to explain your terribad idea since your so quick to answer my little postwell that just tells a bit more dont it stop the evemail spam
well an active skill training system does work in darkfall mortal online it also worked well in ultima online and few other games so yeah why notthe only problems i see are it may be too late  everyone who didnt like passive training probably majority has quit long time ago theres so many people paying for an ability to log twice per month to just switch skills thinking that they play the game and they are happy with that why would ccp want to encourage players to actually play thus use their servers bandwidth while they can just keep getting paid for nothing
i was told to by the gms
the overall idea is to post in fi first get a general feel of how people will react to the idea and if it will actually garner support and then post in assembly hall when you think it might succeed if people like the idea and assuming the csm members are doing their proper job and reading assembly hall posts it will be seen and forwarded to ccp if deemed worthy either way this has been beat to hell in the past and i believe several working options have already been submitted to ccp whether they do something with it or not is up to them
while this will make the margin trading scam a little less profitable a little more tedious to setup and require a little more funds on behalf of the schemer it will not in any manner prevent the margin trading scam this is because funds are first withdrawn from escrow and then drawn from your wallet essentially rather than buy all the units in one transaction i can set it up to buy all the units in two transactions then i just sell the units to myself to clear out the escrow and then i put those units for sale this will double the fees associated with setting this up but thats not going to stop the margin trading scam
not if the system pops the order once you no longer have the funds available to fill the minimum buy order
there i fixed it because apparently everyone who viewed this completely missed my focus on the vigil and hyena specifically and jumped to the conclusion that there was anything wrong with the rapier or huginn if i thought there was anything wrong with those i would most certainly have mentioned it here by merely not mentioning it i thought i made it clear that i wasnt knocking on themwhy should they have a lot of mid slots because theyre ewar ships amarr ewar ships get away with only a few because they use high slots for ewar not so with other raceslet me ask you this why should minmatar have gallente slot layouts for that matter why should gallente have more midslots than minmatar the maulus has 3 midslots just like the vigil while the griffin has 4 the vigil could have either 3 or 4 and still fit between the maulus and griffin but the keres has 5 midslots while the hyena has only 4 now if thats not reason enough to turn one of the hyenas lowslots into a midslot i dont know what is
i never mentioned the huginn or lachesis my entire discussion about underpowered ewar ships was focused on the vigil and hyena unless you have evidence that either of these is both popular and effective you have no statement to make here
i didnt mention the loki rapier or huginn and for good reason i have no gripe with those ships i specifically focused on the vigil and hyena1 to you for taking what i said out of context and basing your whole argument against mine on something i never said1 to you for accusing me of not researchign when you were too lazy to even read my post1 to you for fail use of the quote not editing your post to fix it and misspelling huginnhow come i can find lots of intelligent feedback in general discussion but assembly hall is chock full of arrogant misquoters with overinflated egos who have nothing better to do than point out stuff that either doesnt matter or was never stated in the first place
fyi those specialized ships include the loki rapier and huginn so yes you were referring to them even if you didnt mean to if youre specifically complaining about the vigil and hyena then say so dont complain about all min ewar ships never being used because they are and you are getting intelligent feedback here in ah were quite used to seeing tons of terribad ideas on a daily basis and are extremely experienced in poking holes in them and explaining why they make no sense at all dont misconstrue rebuttal with poor posting dont make blanket statements about stuff never being used because youll always be wrong its one thing to say ships x and y seem underused and heres an idea that could increase their usefulness what do you think its another to say min ewar ships are never used and need a massive buff i have seen the light and am called to share my wisdom with the forums one gets you friendly responses one gets you laughed at and little considerationand finally the min ewar frigs are already balanced compared to their counterparts in other races especially when it comes to slots look at the numbers every single ewar frig has 10 slots every t1 ewar frig has 8 slots except for the vigil  the vigil has 9 instead theyre balanced just fine against each other the whole line of t2 ewar frigs needs a buff to make them costeffective but the min ships are no worse off than any other races ewar frigs
what you said is fairly intelligent but the rest of the responses i got were not so i made a small error in my speech what everyone else did was jump immediately to that error and post that that thing i missed was wrong completely ignoring the meat of my post for the most parthow many slots a ship has total is not an effective measure of its balance many hulls find one type of slot has a dramatically different value than another type ewar frigates used in fleets for the most part couldnt care less about their high slots except amarr likewise low slots have negligible use for ewar frigates and pretty much everything you can do with those low slots you can also do with mid slots a more important part of balancing is checking to see that a particular hull gets as much utility out of its slot arrangement as other hulls do or making sure that it doesnt get too muchone of the main reasons amarr ships get a lot of low slots and few mid slots is that they tend to prefer an armorbased tank its not because giving them mid slots would make them overpowered rather its more along the lines of they probably will prefer a low slot over a mid slot most ships with a good slot arrangement would only be gimped by changing the arrangement in most cases where changing the arrangement would make a dramatic improvement the ship is gimped already and rarely used
my point is that the slot layout isnt the issue with either of those ships thats not why they are currently rarely used the reason you dont see them much is that they along with all of the ewar frigs line suffer from a lack of survivability which makes their iskeffectiveness less than other ships so the solution isnt to individually buff a certain ship or two its to fix the ewar frigs as a whole because the whole class is widely known to have survivability issues interceptorlike ehp on a ship that acts as a force multiplier makes them primaries which isnt fun in a 20m hull and again with regards to the vigil the reason its used little isnt because its worse its because the tiered ship system leaves it less useful than a combat ship 90 of the time adding slots wont change anything also the reason that people jumped on that small error in your post is that it completely changed your post from saying that the vigil and hyena seem underused to the vigil hyena loki rapier and huginn are never used in combat regardless of what you meant to say and that is simply wrong it may have been a small change of grammar but it changed the context of the post dramatically not trying to rag on you or anything just trying to point out why people jumped on you for it so that you can learn and people tend to simply reply to the easiest and most obvious thing first because there are lots of terribad posters in here who arent going to listen to logic anyways so theres little reason to write out a long and thought out post when theyre going to just ignore it and continue insisting on their own idea regardless of how much theyre proven wrong
i agree very much that the ewar frigates need something for survivability or lower cost but im pretty certain that the minmatar ewar frigates still wouldnt be used even after that happened ive played around with the tech 1 ewar frigs and ive found them to be fairly useful in certain pve encounters granted a battlecruiser usually did the trick as well but in using these ships i found through experience that i just couldnt get any sort of comfortable fit at all on the vigil barring all other shortcomings it still needs another midslot just to even work two to do anything really usefulso what do you think about my other points
here is part of your answeranmar prefer armor tanking caldari prefer shield tanking and ewar so why would a should a minmatar ship have more mid slots
please move to features and ideas 
honestly i would like to see torpedos able to reach out to a decent range again maybe make them slower so ships smaller than a bs with a proper fit can outrun them but let them go out to 60k again
as of now fleet finder allows filtering by range with folloving options any 5 jumps 10 jumps region i would like to add currnet region and neighbouring regions  i find that often fleet is just a few jumps away but in a different region and 10 jumps is way too short range especially in 00 where jumpbridges are commonthis option would show fleets that are reasonably reachable
hehe this is one area that i cant really say i have an opinion one way or the other as i never play eve with the sound on usually i am in fleet so i dont really want to hear anything other than whos primary and which carebear is lootingsalvaging in the middle of the fight
12 pages and no ccp reply on any of our feedback which alot of the players are providing a much better alternative while meeting ccp goals of name changes mind knocking them on thier head and make them read the thread again and at least address some concerns or concede that maybe thier approach isnt the bestlast round of name changes we where completely ignored and this just seems that out of tune that most of the ccp is inclinded to listen to what we have to say while the writers responsible for these name changes are not
i dont understand why this is such a big deal honestly i have seen a lot of people complain over the change a lot of people state they just dont care a lot who like the change and a lot of people tell everybody else to just shut up about it what is wrong with the change yesit is a change and things are a little different now but they are just names of expendible items the naming convention as it is now makes more sense and is more straightforward but frankly i never saw the old names as a problem to begin with does the name change prevent you from identifying what ammo you need or want is it more confusing for you than the old system
read third link first and reply there if you want to argue this thread isnt to argue about the names its to complain how there seems to be absolutely no feed backdust 514s cpm 1 iron wolf saber eve mail me about dust 514 issues
then dont post it if you dont want to have a discussion then you shouldnt post a topic just dropping a post to complain about the devs without being willing to respond to it is pretty weak
i am not trying to argue i am trying to get a more clear understanding of why this change is so bad for people i have read through a lot of these threads on the topic alread and dread doing so again i would agree that if ccp really has not given a clear and concise answer to at least one of the threads already then it is about time someone does
oh god really why do you think that every time you guys stamp your feet and throw a tantrum they should listen to you to be honest its becoming a joke bitter vets spitting their dummy out demanding they be listened to every 5 secondsat least now there is consistency yes you could have fancy names but hey i would love to win the lottery but it aint gonna happenadapt to change better still embrace it
for start  there is no such thing as high sec fw missions all fw missions are in low sec and to make it worse they are in the enemy low secthere are high sec fw agents but they only give missions in low secsecond thing missioning in high sec while in fw is the one of the stupidest things you can do  for one the fw missions generally pay more than high sec normal missions and also you are missioning with a war dec on your head try searching for jalmons kill mails and youll see why this is a bad ideaso the only protection you get is that some people will have to face a couple npcs when they kill you rather than the total concord protection you would get when missioning in high sec without signing up for fw
