isboxer aint really just an simple alt is ityea sure defenders of isboxer say how hard it is to set up i guess people get that program for losing isks right oh wait thats not true they get it cause they can get tons of isks by its help or blob someone solo so for 3 days you have a bit rough time with it but than you can easily do anything solo why playing multiplayer game anyway just find yourself some nice scifi strategy crying how bad is the isboxer when everyone knows for little trouble it gives you a huge advantage just wow why not make ok trade bots for example im too lazy to trade properly so id like one you also need to set it up so i guess it would be ok right
3days till forever im still tweaking my setup and ive had it for years i also still have to deal with every single thing i stated above if i can go a day without having to restore from backups then its been a good dayi can get tons of isk a lot easier without isboxer i actually isbox for the challenge the isk i make in the process is enough to cover losses which happen frequently with a tidy profit left over you can ban isboxer and id still multibox people would still get blobbed soloed eve isnt about fairness and almost no one really looks for a fair pvp fight like i said earlier some look for fair fights but what they want is the illusion of fairness not an actual fair fightbot thats where you should of stopped with your inane trade bot commentill be back for the silly post by ltcol rtbutts later it always cracks me up when someone claims they are the sole expert on computer systems and networks bonus points for claiming to be an expert with a program and activity that he clearly has no real experience with
now we know why aaa left catch 1
forcing players attempting exploration to gimp their ships with hacking  archeology mods instead of a pointweb does nothing but encourage the delineation between pvp players and pve players if they werent forced into dropping points and webs for otherwise useless modules most would still be easy kills for experienced pvpers however this change would allow experienced pvp players to fit for both exploration and pvpon purposewithout losing ship functionality for pvp this would enable people to explore when the pvp is slow and pvp targets of opportunity when they present themselves during explorationthere is no real point to insisting that people gimp their ships before exploring anyone should be able to fly a t1 frigate into an exploration site and if another t1 frigate shows up and wants to fight be able to actually bring a good fight instead of running away or just dyingwhy should be there pvponly and pveonly mods at all
because pvp and pve are inherently different things and choices and consequences
little goon is scared of 1 little web and scram
hellobecause of this i will propose a new idea to have an option in the popup window after you press the declare war button where you have to search after corps or alliances to war dec and add an option to set 10 standing to everyone that we war dec as we also want to have the standings back to what it was before the war started ccp can also add another option that sets the standings back to the default ones when the wars is overby adding those 2 options there it will make it available to those who wants to use that like us who dont have the time to set each corp  alliances to 10 in standing each weeks and it will still work like it should for others who doesnt want to change the standingsthis changes nothing for the corps or alliances that gets war deced as they can still use the normal overview settings as normal it will only change standings for those who uses those options by doing this we can just use check the pilots have terrible standing option in our war targets overview tab then we will only see the war targets there witch is the thing we want to be able to do to sort out only the war targets in a seperate overview tabthose who have few war decs against someone can just set standings manually the normal way like it is now against those who war decs them takes them some few minutes to change this for those who have few war decs going so its not an issue this way without having to send out a war dec witch costs isks to be able to add a 10 standing in an easy way to be able to see only the war targets in the overview tabso this is more of an option to those who does houndreds of war decs every weeks that needs to set the war targets to 10 in standings in an easy way to be able to correctly see the war targets on the overviewim sure the mercenaries who do war decs simply dont cares about the standings getting changed under a war against some corps or alliances as those who are getting war deced are going to fight us anyways and will be blinky red no matter whatwhat do you think about this idea will this works as a temporary solution or will this create other problems in the process
1 i approve of this message
first problem i see is that not everyone wants to set 10 to their war targets a war target doesnt inherently mean your standing is terrible you may have differing degrees of war targets so you may want to set your serious war targets to 10 and your low threat war targets to 5 groups like rvb for example may want to set their rvb war to 5the second issue i see is that it wouldnt just be changing the aggressors standings youd be allowing the aggressor to trigger standing changes on the defender this may mess up other standings based mechanics they have set up when they didnt want them to like the use of pocos for examplemost people have been happy with the current workaround of adding standings when a war is declared leaving them complete control over their standings situation i would suggest that the issue here isnt the workaround but the number of wars a group is able to declare simultaneously for a trivial sum of isk if the number of aggressive war declarations were limited or scaled in cost exponentially it would prevent situations like this occurring in the first place leaving no need for a further workarounds for the handful of corporations affectededitfair warning to any csm members planning on reading this be warned that any time nightmarex was challenged in this thread he reacted by screaming you dont understand and hurling personal attacks most of what you will read will be repetitions of itself and all in all the idea isnt worth championing as it would cause more harm than good
again its a temporary fix that actually works until ccp have fixed all of the issues with the overview in the futurefor those who does empire wars this temporary issue will make perfectly sense as it doesnt mess up anything else for the war decersedit you said this most people have been happy with the current workaround of adding standings when a war is declaredthats because they dont do many war decs try putting 230 corps or alliances to negative standings manually every weeks and you will realize how troublesome this is
its still a temporary fix that would negatively impact a lot of players just to make it easier for a handful of groups why should ccp push out a temporary fix for just a few people which would cause problems for others when the existing workaround have been accepted by most for a long time if you find that you have too many wardecs to use the existing mechanic then reduce your number of wardecseditexactly most group dont have 230 wars a rather ludicrous amount so you want most people to accept a change which forces standings changes on them which they may not want and that may cause them problems just to help a handful of groups who have declared too many wars it seems to be unreasonably biased
how would a 10 standing negatively affect those who are war deced to begin withthe 10 standings wont go active before the wars is going active anyways so once the war is active it doesnt matter what standing they have as they will be blinky to us and they will be blinky to us and when the war is over the standing goes back to the normal standing we had before the warso it wont matter at alledit good to see that you are ontopic so far keep going that way
some people use their standings and would probably want to be able to set arrays of standings some may hold pocos and not want to automatically deny usage to anyone that became involved in a war dec with them especially since being at war doesnt necessarily mean aggression wars can be transferred so standings would transfer with them even though they might not actually want to be at war with the group who it was transferred toit wont matter for you but it may matter for other people you have to look at a change from the perspective of others and not just from the benefit it would provide you i certainly wouldnt get behind an idea that removes choice from players just to help out a couple of groups
how would it affect those who are war deced when they will be attackable once the war goes activeyeah they gets terrible standing under a war why would that matter to them when all of their stuffs can be attacked anyways thena 10 standing wont matter to them under a war only outside of a war
sorry but ive already explained it i dont know how i can explain more than some people do not want their standings set to 10 when someone decs them or when they dec someone else some people want the choice of setting their standings and holding their standings the way they set them and its not only the overview that would be affectedyour idea would remove that choice purely to help a couple of groups manage their overview settings because theyve declared too many wars and cant manage their standings anymore
what differences does it make to have a 10 standing under a war or not while you are blinky red anywaysif someone is at war then the standing doesnt matter as everything they have is attackable anyways this just changes some standings ingame to someone while someone is at war its simple it doesnt change a single thing except for some numbersand peoples are smart enough to figure out the differences by getting a negative standing to getting negative standing when they gets war deced it can even be described in the war dec mail you get that once the war goes active your corp or alliance will get a 10 terrible standinghow hard can it beedit incase you are misunderstanding the corp or alliance who gets war deced by us isnt getting their own standings towards us  the war decers adjusted the standing will only be set  adjusted to those who war decs someone
how can i explain it more some people dont want to set the standing to 10 some people want to filter their war targets take for example rvb they might want to have their other alliance set to 5 so that if they get attacked by a real war targetthey can all switch to see only that war target rather than seeing each other tooalso again standings affect more than just the overview people dont necessarily want to set 10 to all war targets automatically especially if the war is the result of a transferi understand that for you its a nobrainer and would only be a positive change but for other people it would have negative consequences and limit choice so no i do not support the change
read my edited reply in my earlier postmy idea doesnt change anything at all except for some standings that doesnt matters for us who war decs under a waredit i even edited my first post to cover this that this only applies to those who sends out war decs those who gets war deced wont see any differences or changes at all they will just get an evemail where it says it takes 24 hours before the war goes active the only difference here is that the evemail will say that they will be set to 10 to the war decers once the war goes active
even so that would mean you can only wardec someone if you want to set 10 so again how would groups like rvb with fun wars manage thisalso how would this work where wars are transferred would it still not set to anyone but the initial aggressorthen further this would then create an inconsistency where a war target overview would suddenly not show all war targets if those war targets decced the defender instead so people would now set up their overview and they would show all their war targets fine then suddenly someone thats not on their overview blows them out of the sky this is would argue is even worse than it currently isand again this is only a good change for a couple of groups who have too many wars this isnt really a great benefit to the majority of the game why cant you just have less wars and manager your standings like everyone else
its simple you dont understand the proposal im talking about hereand if i want to war dec someone does it matter if they are neutral or 10 to us thenand if i want to kill someone and war dec them they will be as much dead as before with a 10 standing and those who are war deced by us will still see us as blinky red as normalso it doesnt matter at all as they will be my  our targets anyways then and will be blinky red no matter what then the war for both parts will be the same war as before even with a 10 standing this is the thing you dont understandso what differences does it make except for a standing that only gets adjusted for us who war dec that doesnt matter to us or to those who gets war deced under a warif i get the marmite to set your alliance to 10 in standing what does that change on your sideexactly it changes absolutely nothing for both partsi have played eve enough since 2004 to not understand those things 100 in and out
right i do understand so please dont be so rude i understand that for your purposes a 10 standing with your war targets would only be a positive and you wouldnt require any other standing settings but thats just you other people would not want to have their standings set in every instance ive already explained why rvb would not want it for 2 totally different reasons for exampleyou have to look at it from other peoples perspectives not everyone has a black and white approach to war targets like you do the freedom to choose the standing is important to some people and you want to strip away that choice because you dont need iti could do the same why dont we just take away wars instead i dont use them so why would it matter if they didnt exist see how that makes absolutely no sense because its completely biased to my view and neglects the needs of others your suggestion has the same problem
alright when you finally have understood what im proposing then can we all agree that im making this topic to see what kind of response i will get back independent of what you think of the proposalyou dont know how many that will support this or not i know alot of peoples who are tired of those issues im talking about here and would gladly support this idea so all i will say give it time
indeed i can see that i however dont just think the idea has low support but am actively against the removal of standing choice and am making that clear other people can weigh in but if i were you id rethink the proposal altogether
as this proposal only applies to the war decers like im saying im sure it doesnt matter if the war targets to us are neutral or 10 in standing so it doesnt matters so its not about the freedom to choose standings as the standings for us doesnt matters under a war but the freedom to be able to see our war targets the right way on the overviewthats the thing here 
it doesnt matter to you it matters to other people with war decs example rvb you would be able to see wts in the overview like everyone else if you didnt have so many wars or if you set standings yourself so it seems like you could already resolve your issue though ingame means by either spending the time sorting your standings the bulk of which would only need to be done once or by reducing your number of wars
if we war dec rvb its only us who gets the standing adjustment that wont affect rvb in any ways so via the war decers perspective it doesnt change a single thingif rvb is war decing us then rvb will get their standing to us adjusted to 10 and we will just see them as normal war targets so what differences does it have to have a 10 standing under a war for someonehaving 10 in standing or just be a normal war target what changes does it makes except that your standing changes and you will still be able to fight as normalagain nothing changes as those who actually have a 10 standing to begin with will be blinky red to the war decers anyways and the other way toso a neutral 5 10 standing towards someone will still turn up as a blinky red one a war goes active once a war goes active you turns blinky red independent of what standing you have to begin with
if red decs blue then they will be set to 10 if red then decs you you will be set to 10 now if you attack while there are blue in system they cant hide their fun war to focus on you because you both have 10 and thats not the only reason you might want to change from 10 for example rvb might want to dec bni but might want to still allow them to use their pocos at a normal standingso again its not just how it affect it from you view and again i will suggest it seems like you could already resolve your issue though ingame means by either spending the time sorting your standings the bulk of which would only need to be done once or by reducing your number of warsstandings dont only affect the overview other mechanics are affected by standings who are you to determine that all war targets should be 10 for all standings purposes
if red decs blue where red adjusts the standing to 10 to blue then they will just see each others as normal war targets aka blinky red setting a corp standing to someone to 10 doesnt change anything on how someone sees someone under a war under a war you are supposed to kill each others no matter the standingswhen the war is over you will automaticly gets the standing adjusted back to the default standing you had before the war witch means that you can use the pocos in this case at normal standing and so onif marmite sets your alliance to 10 in standing what does that changes for us and you when you will turn up as blinky red witch is the point of a war anyways
yes so while they are at war with both you and blue they are completely unable to set up an overview that only shows you see how that might be an issue some groups prioritise targets by setting different standings and setting up different overviews to show those standingsand what if they want bni to be able to still use the poco before the war is over
if red have blue as 10 or the other way you can still override that by getting everyone to show up correctly for them on the overview easilywhen its about the pocos cant you just set invidual corps or alliances to be allowed to use the pocos even with a 10 standing by overriding the standingas for rvb they would only have to adjust this towards one single corp between each others witch takes seconds to fixfor us  others with over 100 different wars every weeks its a different story it will takes us many hours to fix that going from seconds to many hours is a big difference
so this basically boils down to because you cant be bothered to set your standings other people will need to mess around with their standings when they get automatically set by war decs not to mention that if the change were put in it would create a clear inconsistency between aggressors and defendersi think not just sort your standings out like everyone else or cut down on your wars if you have too many no temporary fixes required you can do that right this moment if you wish
you didnt read what i said i said for rvbs case they only have to adjust something towards one corp to each others inside the rvbrvb wont allow others outside of them self to use their pocos anyways so its only between red and blue its not the same case for us who have over 100 different wars every weeks where we have to change standings to each of the 100 corps or alliances we war dec every weeksyeah rvb have to change some very few settings a single time towards red and blue to see each others the right way while we have to adjust those stuffs over 100 times each weeks not hard to figure out that this isnt an issue at all when it comes to rvbedit  just got real a massive amount of mercs including us in empire have war deced rvb now
yes i did read and it was basically along the lines of you dont want to adjust your settings manually so you want them done automatically and anyone that doesnt want that will have to set their manually instead basically you want to make your problem everyone elses problem insteadand rvb pocos are open to anyone they have set red as far as i knowyou only have to adjust yours so much because you choose to have too many wars you put yourself in the situation you are in so you can resolve it yourself the system shouldnt be changed so that you can have an easier time while other people have to mess about its a selfish changeand why do i care if you decced rvb
again why would someone care to adjust one thing a single timewe are comparing 1 time vs us who have to adjust this kind of things over 200 times at most every weeks and rvb doesnt have to adjust this every weeks either see the differencesits about changing things for the better under a war for rvb it wont matter to change something that takes you 1 minute at most while it will takes us half a day to adjust those things every weeksjust because we decide to have alot of wars we shouldnt suffer to a broken overview eve is a free game where you can do whatever you want and you should not get punished this way just because you have another playstyle than others it should be as easy to play for everyonewhat if our war target would bring in 100 neutrals  alts that is blue to them so they dont appear on their overview just to disrupt our ability to lock our war targets correctly just because the overview are broken for the most part for war decersthats the same as gaining an unfair advantage over others by a bad game mechanic that is broken just because someone decided to war dec alot of corps and alliances where others could use neutrals to disrupt us by messing up the overview
but its not 1 time its 1 time each time anyone who doesnt want it change declares war the fact that you have so many wars is your problem you chose to have those wars look im not going to argue this all day with you because as usual you have absolutely no idea how to look at things for any perspective than your own so this is the last post unless others chime in and heres the list1 its a selfish change which would benefit you at the detriment of others2 it creates a divide between the settings of aggressors and defenders which is likely to lead to people not realising that some targets will not be shown in their overview worse than now3 the change is only needed because you have too many wars and you cant be bothered to deal with the consequence of doing that4 its automatically adjusting settings which people like to control manually which affects far more than just the overview eliminating choice and potentially causing further issues3 is a pretty big one you want hundreds of wars complex management is your consequence why should it be made even easier for you just because you cant be bothered to put in the leg work for the situation you chose
1 no it only makes the war targets shows up correctly on our overviews so it does denefits everyone who does wars2 once a war goes active against someone they will turn up blinky red to the war decers independent of the standings they have before the war decs are sent out3 war decing should be as easy for everyone there shouldnt be any differences just because you decide to have more war decs than others so ccp fix the issues so this can be as easy to manage for everyone just because issues appears for those who does alot of war targets we shouldnt be punished for that because ccp are lazy to fix the issues yes those issues are fixable and should be fixed why shouldnt ccp fix the issues with the overview to begin with4 peoples who sends out war decs doesnt cares about what the standings is at as i have clearly explained earlier in this topicbecause once the war goes active they will turn up blinky red witch is the whole point so they dont care what the standings are before the war as they are going to shoot the targets no matter whatfor rvb its only a one time change on how red appears to blue and the other way once that is done they will still appear like they should towards each others when they start a war against each othersthis proposal doesnt change a single thing except that red and blue have to change some few settings one time
ok so 1 more 1 no it makes it easier for groups like you groups who like to vary their standings  even on war targets  have more to do2 yes except you states it doesnt change for the defender so if i am in a corp that has started war decs i set up a wt overview now if someone declares against us they will be invisible on my overview if we dont set their standing thats inconsistent behaviour which is bad3 no it shouldnt if you choose to have 200 wardecs you should have to do 200x the work you cant be bothered and want it to be automatic so you can wardec as much as you like effortlessly well tough choices have consequences and you made your choice personally i think there should be even more downsides to having hundreds of wars4 not all of them you explained how you feel about it you are not everyoneand thats itthread
1 explain why it doesnt benefits others who does war decs when all who does war decs want to see the war targets correctly in their overviews in the same way as they see neutrals the correct way in the overview2 if marmite war decs your alliance or the other way around you  i will now appear as red blinky war target on the overview in the same mess with another 1 million neutrals if you are fighting in empire this applies to everyone who just sends out war decswith my proposal you can now sort out the war targets only in a seperate overview tab as you can just activate pilots with terrible standings in that overview tab and wooosh you will only see the corps and alliances with a 10 standing  terrible standing or those who are at war to you this benefits both sides as it eases up the fighting as you can now concentrate on clicking on the war targets you are going to fight instead of messing around with another 55739579 neutrals where you might misslock someone and have to unlock them and so on3 if i decide to have 4 wars or 500 wars it should still be the same in war decing someone or let me take it this way would you like it to have it so the bigger your alliances get the longer times it takes to build capital ships  poses or stationswould that be fine as a punishment because you decided to join a massive alliance that are bigger than othersno it wouldnt4 to be fair i would make another easy solution when you press the declare war button you should get a popup where you can search after those you want to war dec when you press the corp or alliance you want to war dec you should get a new option in that popup where you can choose to set the corp or alliance to 10 before you sends out a war dec to themthis way rvb can choose to ignore the 10 standing and rather let those who want to use that temporary fix to use that to ease up the fighting in overview
i edited my first post and also changed the subject of the topic to the new proposal here its pretty much the same with some small changesthis new proposal with 2 new options under the popup window you get when you are pressing the declare war button is optional to everyone if you decides to use the 2 new options it will only affect you who sends out war decs and no one else if you dont decides to use it you can just keep doing what you are doing as normal this wont affect rvb at all as they have the option to rule out the 10 standing when they sends out the war decs to each othersso what do you think about that lucas
dear steve ronukencould you please explain to us plebs what is the reasoning behind the ridiculously low limit on the runs per copywith max run bpcs no longer required for effective inventions why was this number lowered instead of raised to encourage production from bpcs as claimed by ccp it is another majot pita that crius has wrecked upon us industrial folksthank you for your time and attentionlowly plebps they just added more shiny to the ui seriouslythe csm xi election are now open until march 25th 2016 consider niko lorenzio for csm xi
basically to prevent ghost copying have alt start 11 6month long copy jobs just before sub ends briefly resub in 6 month or just abuse hours for plex collect copies start next batch repeat in 6 months time
nope you can still have month long copy jobs but you need to make several copies all industry jobs are capped at 30days or 1 run the runs per copy are the ones that are capped at like 1 day worth of researchthe csm xi election are now open until march 25th 2016 consider niko lorenzio for csm xi
the only part that wasnt hey im better than the usual whiner because reason was the last two sentencesop tldr long winded post bloat followed by whine that hes bored and apparently playing other gamesno real content just a cry for attention
i read it and kept waiting for a question or a suggestionthe game changes and so do the people playing it it is why you left wow your life changed not the game eve is undergoing changes and this may or may not be a good thing for the players some will decide the new eve is not the one they fell in love with and leave others may join on liking the idea of a game that is not static not just adding new monsters or a new map but changing the dynamics of the gamethe tax thing i would contact the cpm folks they just got elected and see if you can get them to address that issueif you stay you are welcome to be part of the evolution of the game dammit somebody else already asked if they can haz your stuff if you decide to go but even if you do dont burn bridges space is full of people who leftm
totally agree
i like this idea at first glancehowever would your idea encourage people to undock and actually play or does it remove the need to undock to find out what is near the station im not sure features that remove the need to undock are good for the game
oh god i go away for a year and this is still an issue
im complaining about the eve client and the servers unless somehow its been decided that the eve client is a third party program if anyone is ignoring how servers systems and the internet works its you its blatantly obvious youve never tried to use isboxer to manage a fleet also you have either never used more then one client at the same time or youre just pretending everything was perfect im going to assume youre not a willful liar trying to make a point through deception as such ill attempt to help you see what really happens when you multiboxyou know how when youre running one eve client that sometimes the game will freeze for anywhere from a microsecond to many seconds dont try to claim that eve never lags on you ive seen top end i7 systems with solid ssd setups exhibit the system lagfreeze albeit very briefly this momentary lag is even more likely when youre in a fleet combat situation since many times more assets are required to load when fleets are fighting now take that times however many clients youre running when youre running a fleet overall system responsiveness decreases greatly compared to a single client so its extremely easy for the mouse cursor to lag just enough on one or more clients to cause the wrong target to be selected or for the wrong warp off destination to be selected etc since youre forced into using the overview for target selection even a slight lag can result in you shooting yourself then theres the whole issue of having to wait on the slowest client in your weaponsewaretc setup before you can fire again even with a boss system you will experience varying levels of system and internetserver lag on each client that is why youre forced into making slow deliberate movements of the mouse and why youre required to delay clicking up to several seconds compared to a single client youre moving muccch slower and clicking a lot slower as a multiboxerspeaking of a problem that afflicts us all serverinternet lag i cant tell you the number of times ive had partial socket resets on my fleets anywhere from one to the majority of clients can just socket reset for no apparent reason the pings between ccp and i can look absolutely beautiful and yet a client or more will dc out of 10 clients hell ive had two clients running on a beautiful day and one client will just be sloppy when it comes to responding these issues hit multiboxed fleets harder because were just one person trying to get however many clients to agree on doing the same thing the more complex your isbox setup the more vulnerable you are to crashes and suchi follow the kiss rule in life when it comes to many things including computers i keep my isbox setup simple because going complex just leaves me more vulnerable to various things granted my complex setup does run sites a bit smoother assuming everything is going well once something minor goes wrong though that complex setup can be difficult to recover with being an oldschool multiboxer im very skilled in the handling of multiple clients with none of the fancy stuff anyway
i like this
there is only 1 fix for nullsec fw sov mechanics but then on bigger scalecomplexes should be medium large and xlarge for capitalspros1 in fw sov mechanics there are no timers2 you can still use your supers to bash the ihub once vulnerable3 if people are not defending their system actively even small alliances can make it vulnerable4 there will be a lot of traffic in 00 to run the complexes for either offensive or defensive plexingthis will bring a lot of pvp in space  and no you wont be able to run the plexes in stabbed frigates you will at least need a cruiser sized or a very well fitted dessie for the medium complexes the larges and xlarges will need cruisers and uppeople wont be farming for lp instead both offensive and defensive should get a preset amount of isk out of the alliance wallet that is determined by the alliance itself pilots that are not in an alliance can not run the complexes that way the alliance can reward the pilots that are working for them to get sov the more sov an alliance would have the more they would have to pay to their defending pilots so holding more sov would mean more costs this would mean small alliances have a chance too at a smaller scalepilots will get paid for defending and offending systems and you dont need srp anymore since people can pay for their ships with the isk made from the sov warthe better they are at pvp and the more systems they take the more isk the pilots makethat way pilots can make is fighting for sovmaking isk with pvp ideal world
if i had a dollar for every time some customer was wrong id not have to work good doesnt mean giving in to stupid demandsim glad you got your  back though thats nice
wait this rage was over a stealth bomberlol ccp gief back my pocket change naow
what about fwccp wants people to move out of high sec and try low and null baiting them out there with pve is a good idea fw accomplishes this but if we want to go exploring we must gimp our ships to pvpfail level before going into what is basically a pvp zone it sends a mixed message come to the pvp zones for the exploration pve but first gimp your ships pvp effectiveness so that you wont stand a chance in a 1 on 1 fight against the same hullto participate in exploration in something other than a t3 outside of high sec we can only bring victim failfits pass
i cant say i like this idea i get your issue you have a lot of wars and a lot of standings to manage the problem is more the amount of wars you have not so much the system you just have too many to handle thats your problem dont make it oursgroups like rvb dont want to auto 10 every war target for the reason lucas explained perhaps marmaite doesnt use the standings system for anything else than overview convenience but rvb for example uses it a lot more extensively i know of plenty of other corps that have done the same first things that come to mind is access to pocos infrastructure  being at war doesnt mean you want to block people from using the facilities you have availablei dont think something which works as it is should be changed if you decide to send out 230 war decs you deal with it
i dont think you fully understand what the problem is it doesnt matter how many wars you have before you can get the war targets only to show up on the overview in a seperate overview tab you have to set 1 personal 10 standings to everyone you war dec 2 set corp standings to 10 to everyone you war dec or 3 set alliance wide standings to 10 to everyone you war decit should be enough to just war dec someone to get the war targets only to show up correctly on the overview if you have edited a seperate overview tab to show only war targets why do we have to mess around with standings for many hours each weeks to be able to get them to show up like they should for usyou can create a seperate overview tab to show drones wrecks poses and so on only so why cant we do the same with war targetsthe fact is that you shouldnt have to touch the standings at all to be able to see the war targets correctly on the overview so the only easy way is to temporary fix this like this until ccp fixes the issues with the overview by adding those 2 options in the declare war popup window as i did write about in my first post by doing this temporary fix ccp can relax a bit more and use more time to fix the issues with war targets in the overview and make sure they fix the issues for good this timehere you will rather get an option in that popup window where you can enable the add 10 in standing to active war decs where the standing automaticly will be added to 10 when we sends out the war and the war goes active against someoneas we dont really want to have everyone at 10 in standing after each wars you will also have an option called automaticly sets the standings to those you war deced back to the standard standings you had before the war started when the war is over or something like that to see the nonwartargets as normal againthose 2 options wont change anything except for doing an easy workaround of the issues with the overview when it comes to the war targets there those who doesnt needs to use them doesnt have to use them if they dont have many war targets and can handle the overview as it is but its also available to those who do alot of war decs like us in marmite to be able to see the war targets only on a seperate overview tab without having to change a million things ingame to be able to see them correctlyso this is nothing more than just the best workaround option to date to fix the issues with war targetsnow the war targets isnt the only problem here in the overview the criminals suspects globals and outlaws does have the same problems to but they are usually few in the same overview so its not an issue to handle thatso its most important to be able to fix the issues with war targets first of all
yeah the overview settings with respect to wts has been borked ever since i can remember i dont get why fixing a bug has to be so contentious
my responselawl take 5 minutes and make a wt overview like everyone else when you do more than sit under 12 stations your standing levels actually mean something to you wts come to you because you are only in jita amarr and 12 systems in its pipe for us larger alliances you wardec we have more important things to do than visit the hubs we have active reds to fight the odds of seeing you in our systems are exactly nil therefore the change in standings are just a pain that does not need to happen standings are for a reason you have different icons for wts in overview for a reason create a filter and dont be lazy
ok ladies and gentlemen here we have a player who have never done wars in empire lolwhat you say here sarius doesnt work bro you have to enable the pilots with no standings option under the overview settings to be able to show the war targets in your overview there is no ways around this and everyone knows what happens when you enable that yes you wont only see your war targets thenyou have to add personal corporation or alliance wide standings of 10 to those you war dec to override this and its here the problem is as you shouldnt have to set standings to be able to sort out the war targets in an overview tabcome back when you know what im talking about
i see you modified your original post to something like thiswhen putting in a wardec it would be cool to have a little check box on the popup screen that reads automatically set this target to 10 for the duration of the waralright that makes more sense it leaves the option for players to leave the standings as they are and it offers a 2nd option for entities who would like 10 for their war targets instead this i can understand that said rather than adding in this i would like to see an overview tab with just war targets regardless of standings that would pretty much just sort everything out what really needs to be done here is fix the overview not add in new features to go around current shortcomingscva is also one of the oldest alliances in the game i wouldnt exactly say they dont know what empire war is like p
yeah i totally agree herewell someone seems to not have the ability to read my topic so someone missunderstands totally what im proposing here not a suprise that someome might take them as complete noobs
what bounty do those reds have 12 mil
they usually do not have any bounty because in nul when you battle you fight you die and you say gf in local without setting bounties like a damn fool and yes i understand you meant npc rats
agreed stares at nightmarexthe problem here is still that you have too many wars you should have to put in 200x the effort to set yourself up because thats the consequence of taking on way too many wars if ccp are to put in a change to make it trivial for you to do your setting up then you should be restricted on how many wars you are allowed it seems pretty silly to allow you to declare war on every nub industrial corp in the game and not have any downsides at all
or maybe the problem is that you dont have iq enough to understand the issues with the overviewif i war dec 5 corporations it shouldnt be any different from war decing 200 corporations war decing is war decing in the same way as isk whoring is isk whoring and shouldnt be any different on how you see it in the amount of war targets or isk you getedit there is nothing in eve thats called to many wars or whatever or does it says somewhere that you can have to many peoples in your fleet to or whateve is an open game where you can do exactly the things you want you are completely free to war dec one corp or 500 corps it shouldt be any different from sending out 1 war dec to 500 war decsyou are an idiot sorry to say it but its the hard facts if you believe there should be differences how we see the war targets on the overview just because someone decided to war dec more than others
ill ask about it
helloduring discussions with my corporation we have come up with a couple of ideas that we think should be added to eve1 an alarm that can be set for a full ore bay on a mining ship like the tones that can be set for shield and armor damage we would like to have tones that warn when our ships ore bay becomes full2 war declaration and cool down periods on the corporation calendar all corp members receive the evemails sent when the corp is war decked we would like to see this information our our calendar as well we already see calendar posts automatically made for pos tower fuel issuesthank youmarcus vannosh
hi therethey sound not crazy the first one poeple will complain that it promotes afk mining but i get what you mean and the second one u can do manually ofc but i get the idea there is a ideas and suggestions forum section  maybe a forum admin can move this one there
my soe frig is a beast in pvp and it has the ability to hackscan i dont consider it gimped and nore do the people that thaught they had an easy killat the end of the day if you want the loot in the arcdata can then go fitted for it also mobile fitting hanger is your friend
first pirate frig so much for exploration with a realistic pvp fit in a t1 frigate isnt exploration supposed to be new player friendlysecond mobile fitting hangar as an answer kills the idea of a fastpaced game oh a frigate on dscan landing on grid take the fight in seconds nope ill go refit and hope this frigate is still on grid in a few minutes yawnyour workarounds are a buying a pirate faction frigate hull for 85 million isk and gimping it but it can still shockingly beat 1 million isk t1 frigs even when gimped or b losing fight opportunities to go refit how are either of your alternatives to my suggestion better for the game
see and you leap straight back to personal attacks and you really expect people to take you seriouslyill make it clear i completely understand that the current state of the overview makes it difficult to set up overviews showing war targets as you need to set up standings for most people this is not a problem if it takes x about of time to set up a corp then a corp with 5 wars takes 5x time to set up their stuff a corp with 10 wars takes 10x so a corp with 200 wars should take 200x time to set it up the game shouldnt be made easier for you just because you want to do 200 things at once i cant set up trading orders 200 at a time either so it takes me more time to set all my orders in comparison with a guy trading a handful of items like it shouldso yes its should be vastly different between setting up 1 war and setting up 500 wars if you want to do more you should have to work more not be aided by automatic mechanics its really that simple so yes you should be able to do what you want but you should have to live with the consequences of those choicesand no im not an idiot nice personal attack again just because i disagree with you your idea is badly thought out and designed to fix a problem that affects only a handful of players who have made a choice to declare hundreds of wars while introducing a number of other issuesnow if you cant be civil keep your mouth shut
the simple fix would be for ccp to actually enable the overview to work correctly as in the pastwhy should they waste time creating this fix and making life even harder for othersdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i imagine that since the bug is so old its probably built into the old codebase making it less simple to fix which is why its been an issue for so longthe thing is though very few people would actually use it most people just set standings anyway and if they did fix it wed probably have a period of oh wow whered everyone on my overview go and why does my overview not seem to want me to know im shooting blues for a while so is it really worth the time to fix at this stage in comparison with all the other improvements that would have much more impact
and you havent already done that like a million times alreadyand you expect that someone will take you seriously thenno it takes you more times to war dec more or sending out the war decs it shouldnt take you more time to set up something that will make the war targets to appear the right way on the overview when a war target is a war target on the overview a war target will still be the same war target on the overview independent of how many we war dec war decs is a part of the game and sending out 200 war decs should take you 200 times more time over just sending out 1 one war dec thats how it is now and it should be like that it shouldnt be 200 times harder to find the war targets in the overview over how you just see the war targets with just one war dec on your overviewor would it make sense to make it harder for players to find npcs or rats in the overview as more npcs or rats there is in a missionthat would be awesome rightthat would absolutely keep new peoples to this game aaaaaaaaaaaaaaal the timethere should be absolutely no need to do a setup of how you see the war targets in overview it should be as easy to see the war targets in overview if you war dec 250 corps or alliances as it is easy to see the war targets by just sending out one war target it should be an option in the overview settings that will enable a seperate overview tab that will show only the war targetshaving complicated setups in eve isnt really there to make eve an intresting game for new peoples before the game will be more intrested for new players the game needs to be more easy to get into and as far as i know the overview is a complete mess and a big confusion to new players the overview setup as you will see it the first time you undock havent been changed in many many yearsit needs to be changed for the better and not continue to stay messy just because someone have huge understanding issues to see where the issues with the overview is luckily the overview settings have got a pretty nice overhaul on the test server already so keep saying the overview wont get fixed brono making things more difficult just because someone decides to war dec more corps or alliance than others or to make the game harder for peoples just because they just want to be in a bigger fleet is driving peoples away from the gane and not into the game you have to be somekind of a genious to not see this seriouslywhen it comes to the knowledge about eve yes you are that by a long shot because i dont know someone else that are as clueless about the overview as you are because you have shown it here times after times or in my earlier topic about this that you have never ever done empire pvp or war decs at all and dont have an iq enough to figure out how the overview works and dont know where to look to see where all of the issues are in the overview those peoples who dont find issues with the overview the within first 3 hours they are playing eve and are using the overview is not changing anything on the overview at allits that simplewell you cant expect others to be nice with you when you have a massive tantrum trolling fest here where you cries like a mofo dont expect others to be nice with you when you simply dont understand eve and just spews out stupid troll arguments
ccp have done some pretty nice changes to the overview settings on the test server now so i will be testing it out now to see if there is any fixes or improvements there who knows they might have fixed the issues with the war targets on the overview alreadyoh also how is adding 2 optional options when you are going to war dec someone gonna make it harder for othersit doesnt as it makes it easier for players to see the war targets correctly on the correct overview tab on the overviewedit yes ofc ccp should fix the issues with the overview that should be their first priority but as i believe that they might be using another 5 years to finally fix it im rather proposing a temporary fix that is easy for ccp to add in eve that ccp can add in the next major patch or something as this is an easy fix to put into eve it will actually free up ccp a little with this temporary fix to let them use more time to actually fix the issues with the overview where they can make sure to use more time to really fix the issues in the overview for real this time
please point out where in this thread im attacking youany time someong disagrees with you you call them stupid your opinion isnt automatically right because you said it so get over it if you cant stop throwing around personal attacks then go back to cp and troll on there im pretty certain the csms arent interested in watching you call the rest of the playerbase idiotsat the moment when you set up a wardec you set up the standing at the same time so yes that should take you 250x more time if you want 250x more wardecsit should be more difficult you choose to have 250 wardecs so you choose to take on the challenges that brings on the problem is you want the game to do it all for you you want to reap the rewards but dont want to put in the effort toughlook mate people arent idiots just because they disagree with you i dont agree that you should be given all of the automatic help you ask for i dont think that choices in this game should be without consequence that doesnt make me an idiot now keep your damn tongue civilhow am i trolling im putting across my opinion and you are attacking me so whos the one trolling here huh
you are attacking me because you refuse to accept that there is alot of issues with the overview and think that its normal to be like it is now thats where the problem isand thats where you have massive issues to understand that you shouldnt have to setup any standings to see your war targets correctly in the overviewdo you have to setup standings to see npcs on the overviewno you dont have to and thats my pointand answer me this would you like it to be 250 times more harder to see your enemies on your overview correctly by being in a fleet of 250 peoples over how you are seeing your enemies on the overview by being alone in your own fleetit shouldnt and it shouldnt be any harder to see your war targets just because you war dec more than others it isnt any harder to see your enemies the more that joins your fleet either so why should it be more difficult to see our war targets correctly the more we war decoh also standings has nothing to do with wars to do a war is a tool that goes outside of the standing system as they will be blinky red after a war goes active independent of what the standings are you shouldnt have to change anything with the standings to see the war targets because of thisor do you want me to put up a new proposal here that makes it harder for you to find your enemies in your overview the more peoples that joins your fleetthat sounds like a good idea do you want me to create itahh damn thats a genious idea as that would probably reduce the blobbing in eve took lets make a new topic about my new proposal where we can make it harder for you to find your enemies the more peoples that joins your fleet dealyeah you want the game to do it all for you so why not change the game for the better and make this harder for everyonedude disagreeing that there isnt any issues with the overview when it comes to war targets is like being asked to be called an idiot its your choice to be taken as this as you dont understand eve if you dont understand eve and dont understands the problems then why are you in this topic to begin withthe fact that you dont see it yourself makes it even more obvious that you arent playing this game broits not an opinion that there is issues with the overview as it have been bugged for alot of years now anyone who disagrees with this havent used the overview for anything
wrong i accept that the overview doesnt work entirely as it should i just dont think its a priority change i dont think your temporary fix is suitable and i think that when it is fixed there has to be another change to restrict people from effortlessly wardeccing hundreds of peoplewhy shouldnt you have to its part of wardecs you dont have to set up npc because thats a completely different mechanic you cant take 250 missions from the same agent at the same time so for each one you have to redock hand in take new mission for you wardecs its the same for each wardec you have to set it up then at the end unset it if it was automatic and effortless like you want then there would be no downsides to declaring wars on hundreds of noob corpsgo ahead see how it does you are making comparison where comparisons do not existwhen have i said theres no issues ive clearly stated that there are issues they are just low priority and will need to go hand in hand with changes that restrict war declarations to add consequence to groups making decisions like yours doesagain just because my opinion is different from yours does not suddenly mean im wrong and that im not playing or im not paying enough attention you need to learn to accept that other people have opinions too and that those opinions are just as valid if you cant accept that you have absolutely no right to be posting in this section of the forum your behaviour here certainly isnt going to encourage a csm to champion your idea
and if the overview doesnt work like it should then we should be able to apply easy workarounds until ccp have fixed the issues with the overview and my proposal here is the easiest temporary fix so far its easy and fast to put this into eveyou are free to disagree on this but at least give explanations on why it wouldnt be a good idea to do this if not no one is going to listens to you i have given many valid reasons why its a good idea to put this into eveccp have used alot of different temporary fixes in eve before that goes around the problems until ccp have properly fixed the problems so they are fully able to do the same now so my idea is a good idea as it makes the war targets appear the correct way on our overviews like it shouldyou say you think its a low priority change to fix the overview settingsahh so thats why ccp have given the overview settings on the test server an overhaul alreadyyou arent really genious to say it that way because if you had spent at least 5 mins to do some searching you will see that the issues with the overview is a high priority for ccp the thing is that it takes times to fix those issues and it can appear to be a low priority because it takes so long time to fix it but its not the case as the test server shows nowstandings have nothing to do with war decs as the standings is overrided by the war decs anyways then it doesnt matter what the standings is so why should the standings matters in a war thenexplain this smartasssure it will do great as you will support it and many of your carebear friends will like it yeah making eve a harder game to play is what you want rightyes there are issues with the overview like i have said then why are you refusing to get the issues with the war targets to appear correctly on the overview to be fixed theneveryone knows there is issues with the overview so why are you still trolling and saying standings should matters in a war when it shouldnt you can have your opinions yes but as its facts that there is tons of issues with the overview settings makes your opinion here invalid bro you have your opinions while i have the facts about the overview settings because its a fact that there is issues with war targets in the overviewopinions vs the facts i have its not hard to see whos right and wronglastly i have an opinion that you dont use the overview at all does that makes me to be right about it when you know its not true
first off yes it should be fixed when there is capacity to do so and when its a priority which it isntsecondly your easy fix contains automatic standing adjustments based of an option placed when a war is declared im pretty sure that isnt as simple as you think it isthirdly i and others have given you several very good explanations and youve simply ignored them you cant just ignore everything other people say because you dont think its validif it was a high priority it wouldnt be a bug that is years old and you would have people here supporting youwell obviously standings do have something to do with wardecs since everyone using wardecs is using standingsbecause thats not the topic the topic here is that you are too lazy to put in the legwork to support your hundreds of wardecslolso once again youve jumped to the conclusion that what i say is opinion and what you say is fact even though other people here agree that your idea is terribleyou are not a special snowflake what you say is no more valid that what anyone else says stop acting like you are somehow more right than everyone else your idea is terrible several of us have explained why and you need to accept that you arent right purely because you think you are
im not going to keep getting into these wall of text arguments with you so either be constructive or im just going to tldr your posts ive had quite enough of you throwing a tantrum and lobbing personal attacks around every time someone doesnt agree with you if you want to do that head on over to gd or cp dont waste the csms time with your utter inability to see things from other people point of view and your selfish desires to make your own playstyle easier
1 its enough priority that ccp is already fixing  changing stuffs with the overview on the test servertake a look at those pictures
im more special than you as i know where the problems  issues is and i know that those issues are affecting the overview on how it shows the war targets and as i know how to temporary fix the issues im also more special than you as you cant even figure out that the overview have issues that needs to be fixededit i will give you one more chance to stay serious here now you are just trolling be warned
so quit crying and see if they fix it when they do you can be damn sure ill be pushing for change to wardec mechanics to make it harder again for you guys to just wardec everyoneand it still doesnt make it an easy fix it also still creates a divide between behaviour in an aggressor corp and expected behaviour for others if people expect the war target stuff to just work because their corp leader sets it then if they are in another corp that doesnt set it or if someone decs them their overview suddenly wont work the way they expectgrow up just grow up me not agreeing does not mean i do not understand do you get that do you know how that works do you understand what a difference of opinion ishere it is as simply as it can be putstop assuming people do not understand simply because they disagree with you your opinion is no more correct that anyone elses
no you clearly do not understand the issues as well as you thought you did clearly people have posted issues with your proposal here and youve just ignored themand give me one more chance before what what are you going to do report me for not agreeing with you good luck with that onethis is a serious forum designed for people to lay out serious proposals and for people to discuss their merits people are allowed to disagree with you just because you dont like it doesnt mean its trolling what makes it even funnier is that you have thrown several personal attacks at me throughout this thread calling my iq into question calling me an idiot calling me stupid and repeatedly telling me that i just dont understand
no because as i have said the more peoples who complains about this the faster they will fix the issues you cant be old in this game if you havent figured this out yetits an easy fix as it 1 fixes the issues with war targets in the overview for those who want to see the war targets correctly on the overview 2 is optional to use so no one is forcing you to use the options again its the easiest fix possible as a temporary solution and its easy to put this code into eve 3 doesnt gives any drawbacks or other issues back for using those 2 options it will only affect the corp who sends out war targets so its only up to them to choose how they want to run their corp or alliancesaying its not valid isnt an explanation its an opinionthis guy gave an explanation
if someone doesnt understand the problem they can still disagree with me but dont expect me or someone to agree with peoples who doesnt understands the issues therefore im right in disagreeing with those who have no clues
except there not more people theres just you you throwing personal attacks at people and expecting that to make the csm take you seriouslythere clear are drawbacks as have been detailed at great length you have simply ignored the concerns and regardless it doesnt make it easy to put into the gamewrong i do understand i honestly dont care if you think i understand or not several people have explained why your idea is terrible and youve simply ignored them but that really doesnt matter what matters is the csm will take one look at you attacking people and screaming you dont understand and they will realise that you are not to be taken seriously i call for a thread lock since this is not going to go anywhere
1 and what issues have peoples posted about my proposal heresaying its not valid isnt giving explanations on what the issues with my proposal is bro2 no i have already reported you for trolling and for not discussing what the topic is about as you brings in that my proposal automaticly forces standings upon someone when i have clearly stated in my subject of the topic and in my first post that those 2 options are optional to usetherefor you are taking the topic offtopic so yes you are reported for these reasons1 trolling2 not reading my topic3 taking the topic offtopic3 my proposal is pretty damn good here as long as someone cant give a good explainations on why it would be a bad idea
you cant expect someone to take you seriously when you are1 trolling2 not discussing what my topic is about3 taking it offtopicexpect to be flamed backwhat are the drawbacksthat they forces standings upon someone when its optional to useim mean come onyou dont because if you had been understanding it you would figure out where the issues areyour post is again reported for trolling and for taking it offtopic
people have explained in great detail myself included just because you havent bothered to read it doesnt mean its not been explained im not going to copy paste what you can go back and read nowwe are discussing the topic the only time it goes off is when you start personally attacking me or when you start telling me i just dont understand thats not a constructive way to postclearly you are unable to take criticism on any level so perhaps posting proposals in this part of the forum is not the best idea for you1 i havent trolled at any point2 not a rule but i have been reading seems you might need to do the same3 not the case the only person dragging this off topic is you with your personal attacksso report awayits good in your opinion other people clearly disagree and you cant accept that any time someone explains what the problem are you just start telling them they dont understand as if your ideas must be infallible so therefore everyone else must be wrong
proof or it never happened you use this excuse to not bother to go back because you cant find any explanations therefor you will get reported the 3rd time for trollingno you are discussing forcing automatic standings towards war targets when im talking about something totally different im not talking about forcing anything towards war targets as my proposal is about adding 2 options that is optional to use so yes you are taking my topic offtopic so you are reportedwith pleassure1 see quote 1 and 2 yes you are trolling2 even though you might have been reading it it doesnt automaticly means you will understand it3 thats your opinion im just posting this stuffs because you are1 trolling2 posting about something that my topic isnt about yes about forcing standings towards war targets when its not forcing to add options3 taking my topic offtopicits good reasons as i understands the problems and have explained how the issues is and where they appear you havent explained why its a bad ideaso because you cant explain this you are taken as a troll so like ive said you are reported
lol grow up the answers are already in this thread even if i were to go back and link it all here youd still complain its invalidand you realise you are abusing the report function if you are reporting me fro trolling simply because i dont agree with you rightno thats not at all what i said what i stated is that by having it an option and by having it only on the aggressor side that you are creating inconsistent behaviour that is likely to lead to targets not showing up on the overview when that happens it will be worse than it is now and the complaints of that guy didnt show up will pour inyes i have you simply havent read it and enjoy abusing the report feature by reporting me disagreeing with you im certain that will end well for you especially when they read the thread and see the many times youve hurled personal attacks at me while ive tried to keep the thread civil
i cant find the answers in this topic can youim free to use the report function as much as i like when someone is trolling talking about something different than my topic is about and for taking it offtopic you are just mad because i can report you for doing those 3 thingsno the only thing those 2 options is doing is to make sure the war targets appear correctly in a seperate war target overview tab you creates a new overview tab called war targets and only enables pilots with terrible standings for that tab by doing that you will only see the war targets in that overview tab witch is the thing we want to see you are missunderstanding what im trying to explain herego back and read my first post 5 more times and you might understand itwhen you understands what im talking about here then you can come back and discuss here and no saying its a bad idea isnt giving explanations and the other thing is that you think its a bad idea as you missunderstands the whole point of the topic and what we want to see fixednow you are just trolling want me to report you the 4th time
im not mad about anything fact is that no trolling is occurring i disagree with you thats all while you can report whenever you want theyll frown upon you reporting people because they dont agree with you now since you are taking this off topic by talking about reporting im done discussing whether or not you think this is trollingno you are misunderstanding what im responding with if a guy expect to see his war targets in his overview because his corp leader has always ticked that box then the times they dont tick that box or the times a corp decs them the overview wont have the behaviour that player expects thats called inconsistent behaviour and its not a good thing ive explained this like a dozen times and you just come back and repeat your idea at me i get it i understand your idea and i think its a bad solutioni do understand and i can discuss it whenever i want you dont get to choose who is and isnt allowed to discuss it
you are mad because i use the report function you are mad because you think you can just trolls away here without getting consequences back remember this is not general discussion forum section incase you have forgotten thatnope you fully missunderstands me and it cant be said more clearer than thatif you think its a bad idea then explain why it is thatyou think its a bad idea as its forces standings upon war targets even if its optional but mate its up to the corp  alliance leaders if they want 10 standings towards the war targets or not their members have to adapt to how the leaders want to run their corp or alliance this options only applies to those who sends out war decs those who gets the war decs will continue as normal as they will just see the normal evemail about getting war deced nothing changes that way it only changes standings for those who sends out war decs but like i said its up to the corp or alliance if they want to use those 2 optionsso what was the problem with my proposal againnope i have explained in great details on why you dont understands the issues or what im trying to get fixed its in this topic im not gonna bother to find it as its easily available to find in this topic use the search function if you are that lazy
im well aware which is why im discussing the merits or lack thereof of your idea while you throw attack after attack at mei left my quote in since that in itself is a reason its a bad idea you literally just quoted me explaining it then demanded an explanationthat is not at all what i stated please go back and read it again at no point did i call in to question the fact that it is optionaland ive explained in great detail why your idea would be bad for the game
no you arent discussing as you puts out your opinions on something you havent understood yet there is a difference from telling your opinions on something you understands and to saying your opinions when you havent understood the issues the last thing here is the caseagain you dont understands what im saying peoples who doesnt changes anything on the overview will see the war targets like they appears now like normal they willl be blinky red no matter what standings they have on those targets the war dec system overrides all standings therefor it doesnt matter for a new player that havent modified anything with his overview settings that they will have the war targets as 10 as the corp decided to have them at thator can you show some evidences that a war target for a new player will appear different with a 10 standing than how he will appear with just the war decno you cant as i know how this system works there is no difference on how you see the targets from having 10 standing to be neutral once someone is a war target thats why my idea is really good as it wont matter to anyone except that it fixes some issues with the war targets in the overviewyou should be more educated in this before you spews out nonesenselook at my quote over on why you are wrong i dont have to say more than that to figure out that you dont belong in this topic as you dont understand the whole case hereyou claimed that my idea with the 2 options are forcing standings or whatever upon someone this is not what my topic is about its about having the freedom to choose to use those 2 options for those who sees the needs to use it where are the forcing hereand as i explained in my 2nd quote over you dont understand the whole case here so you are talking about something different than what im trying to get fixed or get into evewhere are those explanationsi cant find them
right so people in those corps the members will have their overviews set up and will expect to see their war targets but in certain situations their war targets wont show up ceo forgets to tick box defensive war dec which is inconsistent behaviour those people would now have targets shooting them that they cant seeim just going to go ahead and ignore the attacks that make up the rest of this paragraphno that is not at all what i stated please go show me where in that post i stated anything about people being force into the option you cant because thats not what i said at all
no no no again you missunderstands if you dont modify a single thing on the overview as a new player or whatever the war targets will still appear on the overview like normal the differences is that the war targets here will appear in the same place as you see all other neutrals or those with no standings this happens no matter if the war target have neutral standings or 10 standings and this is what i have been trying to explain to you for ages because of this it doesnt matter for anyone that the war targets gets a 10 standingthere will be no changes this way as i have said a million times to now once someone goes war target the war dec system overrides the standings so with my proposal a new player will still see the war targets together with other neutrals in the overview as long as they havent changed anything on the overview like it is by defaultthe proposal here will only apply to those who only want to sort out war targets in a seperate overview tab those who decides to not do that will still see their war targets like normalas i have given you an explanations on this case now over in my quote its pretty obvious that you didnt take my pointsyou should understand the war system and how the overview works before you speaks about something you dont know im just sayin
no you misunderstand if you do change you overview you will expect to see war targets on it but in certain situations you wont see them that is inconsistentim not talking about new players im not talking about people who never modify the overview im talking about people that have not getting what they expectwell you keep explaining something ive not called into question you keep reexplaining your point and ignoring what ive actually stated so what do you expect
nope either you use the default overview setup or you will just modify your own overview tabs if you leave the default overview tab as default nothing will change on how you see your war targets on the overview no matter what standing they have thats the thingif you modify your own war target overview tab you are supposed to sort out war targets only in that tab nothing except for the war targets will appear in that overview tab if someone sets their overviews up so they dont see their war targets when they should then they have set up the overview tab wrong you can remove everything you want from showing up in your overview settingsyou can add a seperate overview tab that only shows stations and pocos for example so why shouldnt you be able to sort out your war targets to only show up in your war target overview tab thenthis is what my proposal is all aboutif they expect to see the war targets in a seperate overview tab then they have to modify their own tab to be able to do that they cant expect things to automaticly appear up better in an organised overview setup if they dont have to change settings in the overviewi have explained everything on what happens right now if you tries to sort out war targets only in a seperate overview tab it gets messy i have also explained that you have to be able to choose those 2 new options i have proposed if you are going to be able to sort out your war targets only in a seperate overview tabthis only applies to those who want to have that this doesnt changes anything for those who sends out wars as the war targets will either appear as normal with this idea but they will also appear correctly for those who want to have a seperate overview tab for war targets only
right so there yo uare with your wt overview all set up right so you can see all your wts now what happens is someone decs on you or your ceo forgets to tick the box what doesnt show up in your wt overview under your idea oh thats right wts all of a sudden invisible people can shoot youits not hard to understand why this behaviour is inconsistent so i dont know why you seem to be strugglingno you havent because you dont understand what im saying and so you keep just repeating yourselfmate its a bad idea this has been explained at length you dont get it because you actively refuse to look at anything from any point of view but your own
still no because the war target will just appear on the normal  default overview tab you have with all other neutrals then so no war targets will be hidden brolike me now i have the normal overview tab as you can see here
but you wont be looking at your normal overview youll be looking at your wt overview and expecting to see wts what is the point is having a wt overview if all you are going to do is look at your normal overview anywayat the end of the day your idea would result in a wt overview that people use to look at wts sometimes not having some of the wts on it that is worse than it is now by a huge marginsigh ive explained the reasons to you why this is a bad change you still seem to just repeat yourself over and over claiming that i dont understand when will you get it that i do understand im not sitting here blindly staring at my screen screaming how do overviews work im simply pointing out the glaring flaws in your ideahonestly ive had quite enough of repeating myself just for you to attack me and tell me i dont understand so until either someone else posts or you learn to grow up and accept that you are not the oracle of eve im done with this thread for now since well get nowhere no csm would take someone like you seriously acting the way you do though so you might want to review your behaviour
if you are supposed to see your war targets in the war target overview i have told what the corps or alliances that gets war deced can do to fix that as most corps or alliances rarely sends out more war decs than 30 each months its a small case for everyone to manually adjust the 10 standings to each corps you are getting war deced by as most corps or alliances usually dont have more than 2030 war against them at thr same time at maxlets say we gets war deced by your alliance as its the only war decers who can set this 10 standing at the same time as the war decs gets sent out we that gets war deced cant choose to use that option so we have to manually adjust our standings to 10 towards you to be able to see only the war targets in the war target overview and as i said as someone almost never gets war deced from more than 2030 corps  alliances at the same time its a small thing to fix this wayif you war dec then you can choose those 2 options to automaticly set 10 standing as you do see much more war decs getting sent from an alliance than you have war against you it will just take 1015 mins max to manually adjust the standings to 10 for those who are getting war deced that doesnt have the ability to use those 2 options when you sends out a war dec no read what i wrote over in my quote you are still wrongoh now when youare done with my topic again will i see you in a new corp tomorrow 
no in fact you are wrong and you are too selfcentred to see it luckily for me people that matter can see it so your inane ramblings and incredible rage posts wont get taken seriously so they wont screw up the overview with your dumb ideascertainly not just much like the earlier point in this thread when i left it for a bit i see no point in wasting the csm members time with you repeating yourself the whole thread is already a waste of their time and id rather keep your walls of text to a minimum
nope you are wrong because my proposal fixes the issues with war targets in overview it also fixes the same issues by manually setting the corps  alliances you get war deced by to 10 to take advantage of the proposed fix that makes you see the war targets in the correct overview tab you have configuredthere is absolutely no problems with my proposal at all it just makes it easier for peoples to be able to sort out their war targets only in a seperate overview tab if they want that if they dont want to change on somethings on the overview then they cant expect to see the war targets sorted out in a seperate overview tab eitherso to sum it up1 for war decers this will only fix the issues with sorting out war targets only in the right overview tab for those who wants it2 for those who gets war deced they can still manually adjust their standings towards the war decers to 10 as you rarely comes over that someone gets war deced more than 20 times at most every weeks so its super easy to modify standings to 20 corps  alliances every weeks for those who gets war deced over adjusting standings to over 200 corps or alliances each weeks as it is now for those who sends out war decs3 those who doesnt bother to change anything will still see their war targets on the overview exactly the same way as they do for them now in the default overview tab4 this change is for the most part meant for those who sends out war decs so they can more easily decide to put their war targets to 10 standing as its a pain for alliances to manually adjust standings to over 200 corps  alliances that gets war deced like from us5 as most corps or alliances almost never gets war deced from more than 20 corps  alliances as the most my proposal will rule out the need for war decers to struggle with the standings just to be able to sort out war targets correctly in the overview while it still will be easy peasy for those who are war deced to manually adjust standings towars those they gets war deced bythose who gets war deced now have to adjust their standings anyways to be able to sort out war targets in a seperate overview anyways now so it wont be any more hassle for them with my proposal it will only take away one thing for the war decers that makes it a better experience to war dec someone and to get a better way of sorting out war targets in the overviewprofit
those 2 quotes dont make sense together how can there be no problems if you have to set things manually your whole complaint now is that you have to set things manually so you are fine with other people having to set things manually as long as its not you selfishso to sum it up1 this is only a fix for marmite2 the existing workaround works for everyone else3 you are too lazy to use the existing workaround4 your idea would create inconsistent behaviour and cause issues in several circumstances5 you could just have less wardecs instead6 the amount of effort for this temporary fix is probably on par with a fix for the real behaviour7 you are unable to take criticism on even a basic level and so shouldnt be posting in this section of the forumso no bad ideaback later
nope as you compares those who gets war deced who have to manually set standings towards like 1520 corps  alliances as most to fix the issue anyways it wont change anything for those who gets war deced as they have to do the same thing anyways today and because comparing those who gets war deced by like 1520 others at max against someone that sends out over 200 wars every weeks doesnt belongs anywherefor those who gets war deced nothing changes from how it is today and for those who war decs my proposal will only remove one issue where you have to put in 10 standings to 100200 corps  alliances you are war decing to be able to sort out the war targets in the overviewin the end only one bottleneck gets removed while everything else stays the same as todayso you still dont understand the core issue here thats pretty freaking insane considering i have been explaining every details to you on how this things works pages after pagesyou cant be genious
as an indy pilot with little interest in pvp i find the whole wardec system very unbalanced it gives pvpers the tools to play their style of game while completely stopping indy ppilots from playing at all how is this in any way fair does ccp only care about pvpers enjoying eve to hell with the rest of usso i dont join a corp and play solo and miss out on the community experience of eve so i can actually lpay the game not a great solution in my view im sure the smart folks at ccp could come up with a way so pvpers can enjoy the wardec system and still allow breathing space for indy pilots  for example a corp can only be at war with one corp at a time  not 25 like one of the corps currenty wardecing us if a corp has been wardeced then there could be a 3 week cooling off period before anyone can wardec them again this would spread the love more evenly across the landscape and allow everyone to enjoy the game the way they like to play it right now i feel i am forced to play the game the way ccp want me to play it and that contradicts all the noise they make about it being an open sandbox with a wardec in place  my game is over until the war dec is over unbalanced
i think you misunderstand the term sandbox it does not mean that you will get to do whatever you want whenever you want it means that you can try and do whatever you want just like everyone else in the gameyour greatest opposition to your attempts to succeed in the sandbox are other players also attempting to succeedhowever the fact that you make the active decision to stop playing because of the actions of other players is in no way ccps fault not is it their responsibility to fix this nonexistent problem the wardec system does have some issues but you cowering in the corner is not one of them
you miss the point 100 i am wondering if you expect me to fight back with my awesome indy skills that ive trained or just mine anyway and loose an orca every day or abandon mining and go do something else see point about being forced out of my game play it seems an indy pilot cant raise any point without someone like you accusing us of being wimps how about im not interested in pvp how about my toon is not skilled for pvp how about 3 or 4 people cant defend against a fleet of pro pvpers no matter what they dothe issue here is an unbalanced system that favours the pvp pilots and you dont need to be a genius to see thats exactly what it is stick to that facts and leave the shallow coward comments to the preschool kids
no develdrin has it spot on you are most certainly allowed to do what you want to do but others are allowed to do what they want to do even if it runs counter to your goals moreover you are allowed to avoid it using the mechanics and your adversaries are allowed to pursue you and you are allowed to hire mercs to defend you the same way they are allowed to get their own industrialists to supply them with ships and equipmenteve is a rat race there is no quiet corner for anyone if there was one then everyone with half a brain would use that to their advantage and set up supply chains that cannot be war decced
your opinion is one sided and thus you dont actually know what balance isyep if you cant be asked to defend yourself or even bother to train combat skills then you can stay in an npc corps with the rest of them
you guys are missing the fundamental point  i understand and appreciate what you are saying and in part i agree with your views however the mechanics do favour the pvper and it would be very easy to make it less brutal on the indy corps  your opinion is one sided and thus you dont actually know what balance is thats pretty pathetic and childish  dont waste my time i expect all the anti indy sheep to start making a noise i expect anyone whos income to be affected to make a noise  so be it ive put the idea out there for people to chew over  have a great day folks
why hello there opall you did now was make your corp an even bigger target with your one sided approach and whine if a corp is unable to protect themselves it is not ccps fault there are many corps that can bite back and do but you are effectively asking ccp to fix your inability to do something about it incidentally this is one of the ways i make isk ingame helping helpless corp on how they can make life difficult for aggressors you only achieve and progress if your willing learnall i will say now is see you soon
let me shine your balance complaint in a new lightyou feel that as an industrialist you have little power to fight back against pvpers this is the exact feeling many pvpers have when they buy new ships and equipmentpvpers must either learn how to perform some industry themselves despite having lacking skills and knowledge make friends with an industrialist who can make them stuff in return for isk andor protection or just shut up and buy stuff at the prices that others set as said before you are allowed to play the way you like but so is everyone else and no one is guaranteed to get what they want you are not guaranteed to be left alone any more than i am assured getting a killmail
the problems with the wardeccing systems is not due to the amount of wardec a corp is limited to the wardec has its problems but the fact that your little indy corp being wardecced by a few asshats the asshats could include me sometimes its hard to keep track of the people im shooting at is not an imbalance issue combat in eve should never be completely limited eve and im sorry if you think otherwise is a player versus player game if you dont like that then htfu or go play some other mmo wardecs are a means to an end if that end means padding killboard with stupid indy pilots who think its okay to go afk mine autopilot an indy ship to jita say going through the udema pipeline or using a bs to try and fight a character that is hilariously more skilled than him is nothing and i mean nothing but the pilots own fault you die in a wardec because you do not have the skills to deal with it hire a merc corp forsaken asylum sovereign infinity marmite breakawish so on and so forth then once you have your ally move your silly little hulk to where they camp the most the majority of wardeccers will not cross paths with another wardeccing alliance you say you dont have the ability to deal with someone like that that is your own choice you choose to invest time into getting a tech 2 mining barge you made that choice and now you must deal with the draw backs you willfully remain ignorant of how combat works in eve and you arrogantly splutter into the eve forums demanding for change because you think it should be different because of your own ignorance ive seen plenty of indy corps fight back effectively ive seen hundreds of pilots people deny kills for the aggression corp heres a few tips have a merc corp ready and able to ally into wars have safespots undock points dock points scout points around your entire system use alts to watch neighboring systems dont afk mine dont autopilot dont running around in a raven expecting to kill a thorax more so if you an indy invested pilot who has little to no sp in pvp learn how to pvp its a lot to know and you need to know it if you want to win dont be an nitwit and post in an open forum where someone like kane kane of all people will see you or you can sit here and splutter about how unfair it is which will get you nowhere fast and somewhere soon that somewhere is buried with wardecs and probably a few wardeccers who are way too happy with mlp and kane and if kane is there may god have mercy on your souldeletetheweak
danger will robinson danger will robinson
while i dont agree with the op in that he seems to expect total safety to a degree you do have to admit that wardeccers have it pretty easy its incredibly cheap to throw out wardecs like theres no tomorrow and a lot of groups do so to the point that highsec becomes their safety version of nullsec where they have loads of carebears to shoot but never need to worry about those pesky neutrals attacking them then when they get overwhelmed they can dock anywhere they want so imho it does need to be made harder to build up large wardec lists than the way it is now there needs to be more consequences to making that decision and those consequences need to scale up as you enter into more wardecs not to make it impossible but to make it a choice you have to be dedicated to and work forto the op id suggest you go and take a look at what people run wardecs for and take a realistic and balanced look at it from both points of view and come back with a solid proposal for how it could be changed to make it more engaging for all sides
my opinioni dont worry about what or how others want to play their gameit is a game rightif they spend more time and money then they have more isnt that life tooall the power to them and i move on with my game its just that simpleif im not having fun playing a game whats the point
exactlybut theres people complaining what all ruins the game in their perspective as everyone should be on equal footingif you want everyone on equal footing go complain how the t2 bpos are no longer obtainable and how people who have them are making a fortune with little to no effort
i love that this argument is still going onlisten up guys isboxer is here to stay even if the csm championed this idea theres no way in hell ccp are going to go forward with a ban of isboxer aside from the enormous amount of effort it would be to tell if people are using it the loss of accounts that would result from the banning of isboxer would be staggering were talking thousands of accounts here not a handful of disgruntled playersif ccp wanted to ban isboxer they would have had to do it right at the beginning as they havent and people have built whole isboxer armies it would be too devastating to ccps income to go back and remove it nowat the end of the day you just have to live with the fact that it exists accept that it affects most players pretty much to the sum of zero and move on
isboxer makes money for ccp more accounts simply put this is poor idea
come on guys having people read isnt enough get them to add their opinions and other commentsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
1 on this i agree however i am curious for the cost on one of these ships as there are mechanics in game to go around this already from courier contracts
1 pleaseonly been in catch for 2 weeks and its affecting my mental health

if youre actively playing the game youre not going to need this because you can see its full if youre not actively playing you have bigger problems like the fact that youre begging to be asploded because youre not paying attention
lost it was thinking the same thing
if you are fitting a ship to do exploration and also want to pvp then just fit it for pvp replace the scram with your chosen exploration modules an huzzah you are ready to go sure they will be able to warp away but then thats the price you pay for also being able to pve with the same buildand exploration is new player friendly exploration while dual fit to run competent pvp is not so new player friendly
a scram or pointweb does more in a fight than just ensuring the other party does not warp away for most frigate fights range dictation is critical giving up range dictation means the chances of a win are extremely low and as you said even if things do still go your way the enemy can just warp off so you have little to no chances of winning the dps race and even if you do you wont get the kill that is nothing to huzzah about in my book extra modules that gimp your ships pvp ability are not required for fw site farming and fw is the most successful mix of pvp and pve in the game why should they be required for exploration ccp should do away with pvpuseless mids and fold them into either the ship hull attributes or into pvp mids for some reason this game feels we should offer ourselves up as hobbled sheep if we want to explore outside of high sec
because exploration isnt pvp why cant fleets of exhumers strip mine the hull off of aggressors in this game you have to make choices when you fit your ship if you want something fully competent in pvp then do pvp if you want to do pve as well then you have to accept that you have to make decisions that will reduce your pvp effectiveness it doesnt mean you wont win any fight if you need to but it means you wont be able to leap into any battle with the same level of readinesschoice is a good thing to have and we shouldnt take that away by creating more ways for people to do everything at onceedit and 1 module off the mids isnt making you hobbled sheep it makes you less effective sure but it certainly doesnt make you defenseless
so i thought that this would have come up already since the kronos release but the last thread i could find was from 2012 reference old threadit would be nice to be able to toggle between presetsaved broadcast settings vs doing them on the fly in the middle of a fight this mainly applies to hot swapping logistics and dps ships and implementation could range from drop downs to toggle buttons whatever is easier this isnt a big request afaik but would be a nice tweak to the changes from kronos
i always forget to check the settings are correct until the moment before the fight s
yup and then youre stuck following overview if youre set wrong
i agree however the some of the drones need an overhaul on their speed for example web light drones go so slow a bit hard for a webbing drone to keep with a nano cruiser or a frigate
thread closed due to heavy off topic posting and attacks
another bump as the sov thread in f and i is still going strong thanks for the read
i disagree wholeheartedly exploration in low sec and null sec is pvp because jumping a ship into low or null is pvp even if your only goal is to avoid getting shot down by other players its still pvp technically just undocking in high sec is pvp as well you can have a large mining op with multiple ships which implies multiple pilots which means some of those players could be tasked with security however exploration is a solo activity bringing 2 ships in and splitting the already minimal loot between two pilots would be unrealistic does anyone do this requiring a pirate frig at an absolute minimum to protect yourself from even a single pvpfit t1 frigate is exclusionary and screws with the iskreward ratio right now newer players wishing to venture into low or null for exploration face two choices 1 fly more than they can afford to lose or 2 bring a ship that literally any properly fit solo t1 frigate should be able to trounce if ccp wants new players to have fun and go exploring in lownull then they shouldnt require them to gimp their frigate before heading into dangerous territory isnt that exactly when you want to arm up instead they strip down and put on a module that serves no purpose toward a ships defensive or offensive capabilities isnt it enough of a disadvantage to have them distracted by the hacking minigame and having to haul a probe scanner do we really need to strip them of 1 2 or even 3 midslots data analyzer relic analyzer cargo scanner on top of that as the price of admission for engaging in exploration
basically what you want to do is have two advantages on the ship for no disadvantageyou want to be viable in pvpyou want to be able to do exploration sitesseriously dude give it a rest you want to do exploration sites as an alternative money source fine that means youll gimp your pvp fit as opposed to people having ungimped fits which doesnt allow them to earn isk via exploration
o look this thread again
your idea is terrible its so simple to just create a corp with just your own characters in it hell i did that for a while when i started playing this game ccp cannot possibly monitor this regardless of what happens with multiboxing software which will be nothing because this debate has been going for years and nothing ever happens there is no way for them to actually monitor and enforce something like thisjust move on from the fact that multiboxers exist its not that a big a deal really if your systems belts are getting chewed up by a multiboxer move on to another system gank them do anything except whine about it
give it a rest already stop with these sensless threads about multiboxing its a big universe nobody is forcing you to stay in ammamake all your life
the problem i have with mulitboxing and isboxer it gives players an advantage and that advantage is clear when we think of how they are using the accountsa few things are taken for granted when we are talking about gaining an advantage many senarios can be concocted to legitimize the use of this type of gameplay i supposeall isk or ores from any character that is not the main account is sent to the main account and assets across all accounts are assumed property of the main account ie this is not someone roleplaying with 2 accounts and treating them seperatlyisk generated is used to make the life of one highly skilled pilot known as the main much easier than the game was intended to be and much easier than anyone not using isboxerdid you know a 10 char multiboxer can afford to lose a 2bn isk carrier ever 6 hours of mining at only 35m per hourthis didnt have to be done i created a spreadsheet just to show how one human can take advantage of eves economy by multiboxing ive set it up so you can see how much advantage they can get per character up to 10screenshot of spreadsheetif you want to play with the numbers to see how much you can make with other factors u can get the spreadsheet heregoogledrive spreadsheeti like how 1 guy mining at a moderate rate at only 4 hours a day can net over 30bn isk each month i think im gonna give this multiboxing a try
your spreadsheet is awful for many reasons the primary being youre not going to make a solid 35 mill an hour across all characters for 6 hours straight in highsec not even ice miners pull in 35m an hour solid if youre not in highsec then theres a lot more things you could be doing to make better isk per hour on one character last time i played in whs and such i was approaching 500m an hour with two accounts are you going to demand that whs and null be nerfed nowyou should give multiboxing a try youll quickly find out your theoretical income is absolutely ridiculously overly optimisticmake sure to say hi to the gankers when they come
i am not demanding anything be changed as i like the game as it ishere is some crappy highsec income for yanuf saidi dont need to try it as i know people that use it and 35mhr came from them and is a standard 00 anomoly mining income for a t2 mackinaw pilot with fleet boosts using t1 strippers about 1600m3 per 88 secondsas far as wh i dont know about that and yes there is many other things you can do to make more isk per houri know ratting can net u 90m a hour easy in a carrier and military 5 index with only 1 charas to my spreadsheet being crappy haha yea prob a bit yea i didnt go to spreadsheet design school so sry for thatganking yes thats a real threat but is easily paief for with just another hour of mining each daywe can assume if your putting enough effort to multibox eve you can be most likely expected to be putting in more than 1 or 2 hours a day doing your thing
there is nothing scientific or factual with that spreadsheet screenshot you might as well put in random numbersyoure running fleet boosters yet you neglect to include them in your account total you present this as an easy possible income rate for all yet youre using numbers from a nullsec anom youre not accounting for the rent or other costs of keeping said nullsec anomaly either youre like the industry type that doesnt take into account the worth of the minerals they used because they mined them for free meanwhile in highsec your numbers are wildly better then the average miner could ever hope for and you will find gankers in in most systems with good ice or ore granted most of the gankers do tend to rotate across several systems so its possible to avoid them if you move enoughedit  i just wanted to get it clarified that your numbers are bad
it is very simple to trace commands from one ip over several accounts and compare the timestamps for that commands on the server the argument about the lost accounts was also made years back when ccp ignored boting more or less and ignored tons of petitions that i and others did about a 03 system called ingunn with like 200 l4 distribution mission bots in ityes we did petition them we killed them for hours we made vids about them we seen ccp staff in polarises around taking a look on the system and it took over a year to swing the ban hammer plex prices went down big time after it and the player count did stabilize and grow back to the old value over time after the big banccp always will try to allow something that gives more revenue till a point where it becomes a problem or better put more and more people become aware of it and notice it as a problem it was one thing having a couple of bots in the drone region farming in ravens where 12 people pass by during the day it is a different one having 200 in front of you every day it is a different thing if there where some people using it in whs compared to having often more is boxed vg fleets in high sec incs than real player fleets right in front of you it is again a difference between a couple of hulks mining somewhere in a 00 dead end and seeing like 50 skiffs at a gate or station in high sec all with the same name  a number same goes for pvp applications where is boxed bomber or gank fleets become more and more common instead of being the exceptionin the end there will be one day when ccp will disallow the usage people will sell off a couple of chars and everybody will look back a few months later at the game and agree that it was a change for the better and ccp should have probably taken the step rather sooner than later same as with the bots at one point you will rather lose a limb than damage your game further and it is not that every single account is lost forever most people will simply downsize a bit and others will reactivate a few old accounts with the lower plex price so the drop will be a lot less heavy as you think similar to how it was back then with the bot banning
i just want to clarify your complete argument is badmy numbers are easily achieveable with a small time of training your idea and rerefferenceing that highsec is such low income doesnt really matter much as the people not making that type of income prob arent multiboxing you seem to be a very uninformed player andor just a time wasting troll you say youre running fleet boosters yet you neglect to include them in your account total are you talking about heavy water usage why include such small expenses u can run 8 hours a day easy for only a few hundred million a monthi do not count the cost of the toilet paper ill use in a few hours into the meal im eating nowwith all your questioncomments only leading away from the obvious point that really can only be argued with nonsense ill let you insert your awful comments below
otlichnick wrotedid you know a 10 char multiboxer can afford to lose a 2bn isk carrier ever 6 hours of mining at only 35m per hourthis is the flaw that invalidates all that work you put into your argument and every other antiisboxer argument ive seeneula states that there shall be no advantage given to any account nowhere does it say anything about advantages given to players until you can differentiate between the two you wont be able to form a valid argumenton a side note i recently tried isboxer to manage two of my accounts and found the setup time each time i used it and the issues i have with desyncing actually caused my income to drop so i stopped using it the slow plodding method i had to use was far slower
some issueswhen youre running your accounts in their own virtual environment its a small step to have each use a different proxy isboxer users already pay for their tool so its likely theyd be willing to put the additional money for dedicated proxy slots on the tablelarge number of people using the same proxy would result in large comparison overhead opening the door for all kind of node killing shenanigansonline games will rarely process all commands on the server side but rather will compute the effect client sided and send the results of the commands to the server the server will then perform a sanityconsistency check this is why stuff like speed hacks etc exists the client sends updated positions that are wrong but set up in a way that fools the sanity check on the server im not familiar with the details of eve io however to just assume that the client sends something along the lines of player pushed button x at time y seems unlikelyso no its not simple

please clarify how flying a frigate is not playing normally are the controls different for frigates they seemed normal last time i flew one
i fly logi all the time this may help you though as a meantime work around link
simple in theory hard in reality setting up the system to track every single button press and compare every single button press on every single account in existence would suck up so much server power that every system would be in tidi constantly even if you limited those comparisons to just accounts with matching ips youd still have massive overhead from isps with nas setups apartments condos dorms schools etcetcetcplex prices never dropped big time after a banning ever just a quick look at the history of plex prices confirms my statement small time of training youre saying getting into perfect mackinaws with perfect refining skills while being able to setup a pos have a rorqual have a jump freighter and rent a nullsec block is a small time of training you say my argument is bad but your numbers are awful youre ignoring the usage of booster characters youre ignoring time spent moving product to market including the character training time required youre ignoring rent costs youre ignoring all kinds of time and isk sinks involved with getting the income in your spreadsheetim talking about training time for characters costs of ships costs of structures and the costs of running the boost youre all like but brah you can get a carrier in like 6 hours with 5 characters while ignoring the booster alts and the other stuff going onthis highlights your lack of seriousness more then any other statement here rent costs are not toilet paper jump freighter costs are not toilet paper pos costs are not toilet paper boosterjf account costs are not toilet paper i can keep going but if you havent gotten the point by now then theres really no hope in you seeing why your numbers are awful
1 i disagree on the point regarding the super capitals super capitals are an issue period unfortunately dread blobbing or dropping your own supers is the the only way to kill a super at the moment minus of course tackle being hic this leaves ccp to
prior to writing this thread i had no idea how faction warfare sov fights went as i read through fw info i realized how easy it would be to implement the same idea just with different structures timers and multipliers thanks for the read all 5 pages of it
well thats the point and this is actual contest between hunter and its pray if pray stays vigilant and see a warning sign in time than she will be ok thats still implies you will have to press dscan all the time while cloacker still can safely stay in passive afk mode indefinetly that means pressing dscan like for hours in any system you will see someone in local but not in dscan this thing is tedious i mean sometimes you will be distracted sometimes you will just forget thus cloaker will preserve his role of hunter waiting for careless enough victim and you still can disrupt your enemys activities like demonstratively going into active mode conveying to all who cares that the system is now under your and your friends control so they will either will have to look for cover or will gather some meeting party and cloakers will get some content which  as its usually claimed  they are actually afteryou probably missed this piece  according to this idea dscan never will tell you direction or distance to cloaking ship there will only be some additional indicator which will light up when there is cloacking vessel in active mode in dscan range usual techniques like narrowbeaming wont work in this case it will be pretty hard to triangulate it without those in most casesbut in case if you stay at one place in active mode  yes you will be scanned down but if youll be switching spots on regular basis youll be mostly safe even while staying in active mode  thats actually what i intended to achive if cloacker want to really threaten his victims and disrupt all operations in the system he have to be atk in active cloaking mode switching spots to evade cloakbusting scanning equipmentso both these main applications of afk cloaking  disruption of operations and hunting  will still work quite well but now they require active participation from cloacker to work as intended and they allow those victims who are vigilant enough to evade being caught  which actually leads to more content for hunters as numbers of those who will just go out and try their best will increase because as today if you dont have big guys backing you up atm or at all with their jump drives fired up and you see some familiar face in local whom you know as 100 cloaked hotdropper you just safe up and wait or jc somewhere else so no content for hunters and distruption of operations of any entity smaller than you with no actual effort for other partyedited but it will be even more intresting contest if hunter could get some method of checking is his pray diligently scans her surrounding or not like some kind of radar system which registers any dscan attempts in dscan range dscan probably implies active radar system so it should radiate some energy that can be registered by other party lorewise so you can wait for some oblivious victim in passive mode just checking this dscan meter or you can study her dscan pressing patterns and find some holes in them in which you could switch to active mode and get herthis new feature could be made available only to inherently cloaking vessels and mb even only when they are actually cloacked like covops recons etc so hunter can register each victims dscan attempt but victim  cant
actually i am quite good with this and i understand perfectly well what you explained in contextthe additional burden by needing to dscan for protective reasons is exactly the kind of effort we are currently missingi believe both sides need more risk i never meant to imply this idea could not be capable of meeting the needupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked

even if ccp wanted to give a suspect flag to someone bumping another theres no way for the game mechanics to differentiate one bump from another the whole issue is based on the intent of the bumper and game mechanics cant determine such esoteric factsi would like to see the actual bumping mechanic take the mass of each ship more into account and have the bounces more closely adhere to physics but thats just me and i can work around it if it never gets changed
really you manage to shoot yourself because of system lag  really now you want to explain us how a high end computer works and why system lag kills every isboxer concept and you have to do all the commands veeeeeery slow oops first incursion ship is gone because you have to command your logistics veeeeery slow to be honest it is not possible to shoot yourself in any situation with a good overview it has nothing to do with the computer but like you explained your travel problem earlier sometimes you have to understand the mechanics first before you use an optimized methodthird party toolbut anyways isboxer is cool we are discussion right now how bomb damage is calculated by the server maybe it is possible to throw 255 bombs at the same time from the same spot  depends on the damage calculation if the server calculates them in a single time frame who knows should be possible to hit a single server time frame with more than 8 bombers would open the possibility to change complete fleet battles as a single player with a single bomb run
youre welcome to try having 255 accounts synched in a perfect order and bomb a fleet with bombs no really if you can get all your 254 remaining accounts up to bomber t2 status ill even put my entire 8man mining team on the grind for you to bomblet me know when you have the hardware and setups to even try this thinguntil then stop making ridonculous comments with irrelevant numbers that nobody uses if everything is so easy as you portray in your fanatically ridonculous posts why arent there alliances wiping current lownull residentsrenters off the map with the easy mode isboxer usagemaybe just maybe youll sometime in some form realize that isboxer fills a certain niche of gamplay but doesnt in fact replace real people behind the computerbut hey if you cant handle multiple accounts id say you should look at the following two common problemspebkacid 10 t

afk cloaking is a norisk venture you say okay well i guess until he has to uncloak to attack thats the exact moment he becomes at risk the person is also at risk every time he changes systemnow youll say not if he comes in via cover cyno and ill counter with someone has to light that beacon in the first place
i very much agreei would point out that cloaking is quite balanced in fact as demonstrated by the stalemate between it and docked pve shipsto me the problem is lack of resolution to conflicts with both sides having a perfect defensethe defense needs to erode on both sides for balance to be maintainedupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked

i think ill try to post it in these forums tooui for setting pi infrastructure needs some attention desperately this clickfest is mindnumbing four little things would greatly ease life of production planets owners im shure someone already has mentioned all those but cant remember where i saw it and who did it1 stop binding routes to specific type of product manufactured at some factory let it be just generic route going from this factory to some storage  so if you change the product next month for some other it would start to use routing scheme already in place currently we have to go to each factory and set all routes anew every time we decide to go for some other product2 add ability to set a common routes destination for products created in several factories like you select several factories then press some hotkey then select storage  and all the products from all selected factories now are routed to this storage again atm we have to click each factory then click some buttons than click storage  16 times per planet3 add ability to set production scheme in batch like in previous one you select several factories press hotkey select a scheme from dropdown  and all these factories seeded with this scheme now again clickfest atm4 ability to set up routes from some storage to input lines on factories in batch is also in dire need but this one is somewhat more tricky as unlike in case of routing the single output product from factories we have 1 to 3 input lines on them i see the most straightforward way to implement it as that first you select several identical factories at once upon doing this new control panel appearing it has three buttons route output product to one destination set production schematics and route input products to selected factories you click batchset production schematics button dropdown list appears and you sellect some production scheme then you click route input products to selected factories button select source storage facility and select some material which is stored or being routed here  and ui creates routes to all selected factories that has schematics that need this material then you are using route output product to one destination button to finish the setup processby implementing it this way switching to generic route approach as proposed in 1 may become not necessary as reestablishing routes will become much easier but still would be nice to have it tooof course previous one facility at a time way of setting scheems up should be preserved too

the problem is that afk cloacker in most cases is an atacker and other side plays the role of helpless victim a harmless pray in most of the cases  this actualy why most cloakers are here and not in the say goon or nc space  they need easy kills devoid of risks so there is no such thing as afk cloaker risk or defense of victim when victim sits at outpostpos she isnt has taken defensive position she already lost battlefield for cloaker without him contributing any effortssimply because of cloakers presence any ratting activities start to not worth time spent on them you could go do some missions but you can be easly caught on gate as you dont have a slightest hint is cloaker active or not and with current mechanics he can attack anytime almost instantly and even if you have reached mission site in one piece you cant guarantee you will finish it untill combat probes will apear and after youve seen them even once and managed to warp out you have to drop this mission immidiately it isnt safe anymore to return here  because if hunter managed to scan it down you wont see any warning signs next time you will try to return here and continue and will be caught and that also means that you have to stop running missions for an hour at least to bore him off your tail or call it a day or jc to hs to run incursions most probable outcome  you have your operations effectively disrupted even if cloaker went to bed soon after that you either already far away from here or you just dont want to bother and try anymore as you feed up of this games and spending your times for nothing without any gain while losing your standings with agents so again the problem of hunter having all the initiative on his sidewith combat sites it even worse  those can be easly scanned beforehand so you just wont even try if local shows familiar face in best case you will be allowed to spend some time to clear most of the rats and then they will overtake site from you this is so at least for smaller entities which dont have developed logistics and srp to ease their losses loss of ratting ships for them is a big deal and often means hours and days of waiting for another one efforts spent on buying and assembling all the parts by players themselves etc and they dont have any counterhot drop defense parties ready to save them anytime and to create any risks for cloaked hotdroppers thats why my idea from before adds this new preatacking stage when cloaker must transfer from passive to active state to at least issue some warning signs to its pray if i knew that i can at least do something to protect myself after my mission complex was compromised or while running probably prescanned combat site i could actually try to accept the challenge and risk my ship  because in this case i at least have some chance of winning without that i wont even try and jc to empire to run incursions which takes us to current situation in nullsthe problem is not that some people cant tolerate some risk  they can  the problem is that only a few want to participate in fights they have no chance to win at all and by fights here i imply not actual fight between cloaker  his friends against ratting pray  which will end bad for pray almost always  but contest when pray tries to stay vigilant and aware and hunter tries to find a loophole in her awarness they dont want to spend hours and hours on reassembling and delivering new ships and for additional ratting to cover their losses just to deliver some easy fastfood content for other party
this is a gamedrop the mockery of logic being represented by a misplaced survival instinct and think like someone playing a game who actually has nothing to lose by taking a riskdo you feel the game has too much penalty or riskdont blame just one side for both sides to have tactics available that allow both to frequently survive balance existsboring yes unresolved yesnoone said balance made for fun play in the absence of resolving playing a game it just shows a problem with the designthe pve ship needs to be able to not just fight against its cloaked opponent it needs to be confidant the cloaked opponent cant be a cyno equipped wtfwildcard with a fleet inside of itas a miner in null one of the most aggravating things i ever faced was needing to dock up or go into a pos because the expectation that a cyno would make a good fight into a joke  gank was simply too high to ignoreif my mining ship was equal in combat ability to the typical cloaked ship and i knew no ganking hotdrop would happen the problem to me would not existi would actually look forward to seeing a hostile show up in case anyone missed it grinding roids gets a bit dull after a while a nice shootemup would be a great change of pace for a few exciting minutesupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
you missed the most important point while quoting yes this is a game but i repeat again most people just dont percieve a game in which you have zero change of winnig like in a typical situations happen under rules of current mechanics ive descried in my previous post as fun enough to play they just dont want to waste their time because a time is a very limited resource  the most limited resource i would say and this is especially so for eve with its olderthanaverage playerbase if i know for shure that i cant protect my ship in any way possible against this one 100 cloaked hotdropper staying in my local for days aside from stop playing at all why shoud i even spend my precious time trying to do anything what will i achieve i will be granted all expenses accounted for with the same income i could get running lv4 in highs but i will have to spend much much more time on most boring things eve can offer  logistics and mindnumbing clickfest implied by buying and assembling new ships moreover as i need isks for any my activities in eve i need to earn them somehow and i cant do it reliably in nulls because of afk cloakers have upper hand in our contest forcing me to spent more and more time on recovering from these losses both spent on logistics and earning additional isks forcing me to effectively run in circles while filling someones kb so i again have to switch back to do it in empire space or just to drop from game for some time i dont count plex buying as source of ingame income sorry as i could do many other fun things either in different regions of space or in other games or irl and i willyou have fun in the game when you compete and overcome some difficulties when results somehow depend on you wiseunwise decisions you have almost zero fun if you just being smashed every time you try to do something unable to do anything about it so it isnt important was your decisions correct or not you just lose your ship and penalized with additional time you need to spend to recover so only reasonable and wise decision you can make is stop playing in the end or go play somewhere elsei repeat i saying all these from a point of view of solo player or member of small entity as i dont like to be part of bigger ones those entities in most cases because of small numbers and thefore bad tz coverage lack of their own hotdropping forces low level of combat preparness etc expose zero threat for even lamest cloaked hotdroppers and those hotdroppers perfectly aware about it thats why they chose to hotdrop them in the first place i only writing all these as power projection and need to find a place and means for small entities to survive in null became a hot topic recently so i though this could be useful input as afk cloaking is an issue of power projection tooin most cases pve ship cant fight with hotdroppers if hotdropers will think it can they will get more people to enshure it now wont and knowing that its cyno equiped wont help you in cases i described  if there will appear a way to check for this most of them will become cyno eqiped  it needs a couple of weeks to aqure all the skills needed one month alt can be trained to be cloaked cynodropper the battle between cloaker with a powerfull support and member of small entity happens before any shots fired when shots fired its almost always over already for prey party thats why additional safeguards threat indicators and tools for both parties are needed which will allow them to compete with roughly similar chances thus adding some sort of additional gameplay layer which takes place before cloaker will even uncloaks the cases you are describing implies that risk comes with uncertainty wether or not some cloaker is a hotdroper what im talking about is about cases when big enough entity or players with a lot of alts can disrupt opertations in vast region of space by doing effectively nothing 90 of the time you know for shure they are hotdroppers and you know there is zero chance you will evade them if they want to go after you so you stop any attempts as you dont want to engage in thrilling parts of eves gameplay involving recovery from losses without any option all the time
the disadvantages of engaging in exploration include being required to fit a probe launcher data analyzer relic analyzer and cargo scanner this proposal would free up 2 mids out of the 3 mids and 1 high currently required so it hardly removes all disadvantages from exploration in terms of slot usage if you want to do it in low or null then it is also relevant that you are required to be unaligned in a hostile pvp zone while engaging in a minigame ghost sites are a good step toward reducing the overhead of modules required by allowing data or relic analyzers my proposal simply goes one step further and lets explorers keep an effective pvp fit while exploring in dangerous spacei have to wonder if those arguing against it are really just afraid of seeing their supply of kb padding fit explorers armed with a point
dearest csm capsuleers and dustuleersi recently had a topic locked due to it failing to meet a rule about posting chat log of tears outside of the crime  punishment subforum but instead of moving the post to the correct place the isd member aka literally the devil locked the post and posted said rule to then repost in the crime  punishment would be reopening the topic and also break the commandments of thy forum how does the community feel about this can we have a better response or isd appeal system about this how about up voting enough from the community to move the thread or reopen07 fly dangerousoj
among the many forums i frequented eveo has one of the more annoying rules  humorless moderation and this kind of metadiscussion is neither wanted nor allowed so this thread will soon be locked
but they cant do that in the safety of a csm assembly hall  can they
this exact subject can ccp censor metadiscussion in ah has been discussed many times and tbh i stopped caring i used to be pretty active in ah and had high hopes but then ah got nerfed instead and even a previous csm chair declared it dead this leaves us with with fi which is basically a tar pit for improvement suggestions
well rip thanks for the heads up
there already is an isd appeal system its called file a petition so an actual ccp employee ie a gm can take a look at it
petition to have thread unlocked and moved to cpalternatly break another rule instead of breaking a differeng rule and post about you lock in a different section of the forums hoping they dont see it
here is the post that will make you cry forever
problem whenever you group your weapons the icon seems to move to a random open spot solution design it so that when you group a weapon the grouped icon is displayed in the first available spot
ya know when your ideas are shot down on fi its a violation of the forum rules to post it here too
as a college student i have a simple solution for you all or for the ones that are complaining about this in college or at least in american colleges i dont know about other world colleges but if a student wants to get something in the college or in the community changed they have to write a research paper this research paper can be any length though longer and more compelling it is the more likely it will get considered anyways moving on here is what i suggest if you feel that this program isboxer is such a bad problem why dont you collect data on it write a research paper with a compelling argument along with supporting data and facts and submit it to ccp and cms the worst that can be told to you is the same thing that is already happening in this thread and that is they dont agree with your argumentinstead of fighting on the forums and making the thread more and more unlikely to be read why dont you try my suggestion out
these key statements i made already answers your responseto clarifythe point is that the pve ship be made fully capable of an encounter where it could expect a reasonable chance of fighting off a cloaked hostilethis means the pve pilots have an option for practical mining  ratting in a fit that also is competent to fight against a cloaking shiptwo other things also need to happen here1 gatecamps filter out pure frontline pvp ships from being able to penetrate pve space by sheer blocking or intel channel warning this already happens in many cases and simply needs to be maintained2 hot dropping vanishes as a threat potential noone is going to risk a fight against a possible fleet by cynoto solve this i suggest a spool up delay of 30 to 60 seconds where the cyno ship is locked down but no beacon appears except on grid to it until the spool up completes so the systemwide beacon appears at the same time ships can travel to itupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
well concerning my idea i took for granted that dropping mechanichs will stay as they are so tried to find a way for a prey to avoid it before it even happens and before cloaked hunter will be given chance to lock and point her  if she plays proactively and stays aware of surroundingsyour approach will work too shurely if hotdrops will get nerfed i meanbut there are a couple of problems first what do you mean by spool up and locked down will the cynoing ship be totally harmless during this spool up will it be able lock and point use propulsion if it will than how this spoolup will help if you are caught by tanked force recon vessel while flying typical ratting ship hacbcbst3 he will simply point you for a minute than droppers will finish you second it could be easly circumvented by an alt like you first send cloacking tackler to your victim when it gets into position ready to uncloack and point you either fly another character in the system or use prepositioned one and initiate covert cyno the moment beacon appears or local starts spiking tackler locks victim and she is doomed now this approach wont help small entities to evade oppression of large ones in situations i described
can i provide an opinion isnt cloaking in someones system the reward for making it there i mean im a noob but from what i gather from gatecamps interdictors bubbles legitimate anticloaking tactics and the fact that if you are locked you cant cloak and cuppled along with that problem with instalockers and you cant cloak right away when you break gate cloak i would think that making it to someone system out in the back arse no where a great reward the ability to sit there or maybe it just a consequence for those that are unable or simply to lazy to proactively protect their systems
this misconception already is many years oldno it isnt nulls actually floodded with a 2 weeks old noobs doing relic sites to get in particular region is somewhat tricker but no its not even close to hard assuming that any real hot dropper will fly at least covops he wont be stopped even by most tightly camped gates if determined enough  update your clone buy another ship retry but such tightly camped gates quite rare and easly visible on map statistics so you will just find a detour or you will simply jump into couple wh until you will come out 20 jmps from your destination than fly through mostly empty sov space if you choose time right like at day hours or near the dt nothing will stop youand in case of big entities this is all you need when you have one alt with covop cyno here you can flood it with others anytime you want so logistics and getting their deceased if any members back to positions is a piece of cake for them generallyand if you would have read discussion actually you saw that npc nulls were mentioned and from perspecive of smaller entities you hardly can control npc nulls do you especially if you are member of some small entity here you could only evade big threats but in current mechanics you cant do it at all aside from stay dockedat the pos ie afk cloacking hotdropper will disrupt your operations with no effort 90 of the time simply because you have no means to be warned about something cloacked already near you and ready to tackle and when it uncloaked and locked you its already too late to do anything and droppers start to fall from the sky as you are member of small entity you cant have a rescue party all the time ready to save you nearby you also dont have any dropping factilities that constitutes the problem and similar problems drive the sov space to its current stagnation on a bigger picturethats why afk cloaking is a part of power projection problem and should be dealt with if ccp want to give smaller entities some place to live in nulls without joinging blue donat
i honestly dont understand where you are going with this 2 week old alts doing relic sites what does this have to do with cloaking wormholes im pretty sure their wormhole spawn is a bit spastic and shouldnt be used as a way to get into someone elses sov that being said if you have a large corp i guess you can break holes until you get to the place you want something that you see they are changing if you read some of the threads in the suggestions areasbig entities so they hold a lot of sov space so shouldnt that have the people to protect the gates of that sov space if you cant protect it then maybe you shouldnt own it or maybe they own it because of the problem of power projection which has nothing to do with cloaking at all which breaks your argument that cloaking is part of the power projection problem which doesnt seem right that cloaking should receive the blame for power projection power projection seems like a problem with cynos so maybe you should take your beef with cynos instead of attacking a symptom instead of the cause if you are a smaller entity then maybe you shouldnt hold sov space till you are ready to beable to defend what you hold even if cloaking couldnt bring in hotdrops what stopping someone from building a wtf speed fit and just fly so fast that by the time you scan them they are off grid when you get there what stopping them from power projecting right on to your front door and kicking it inyou have so many flaws in your logic that is really laughable to be honest
well you have only one  you try to post opinnions without even caring to study the topic you are postin in or mb have a problem with comprehending a writen text or just dont even intend to and came here for trolling you choose it shows how laughable such arguments are and always were it takes close to zero efforts to get to any part of null space in covops if you can use map and mwdcloack trick period i dont count spending 3060 minutes jumping gates and burning out of bubles as effort significant enough wormhole is a universal way to nullsecs these days all those newbie scanners use them without second thought you find any leading to nulls than you just traverse semiempty systems without any hindrances untill you get to your destination you either dont know the game you are playing or deliberately pretend you dont know a thing
you are pretending to be clueless again no one can create a 247 working firewall on every gate in their sov space its a game no one will care to such extent its reality and single alt with covops cyno will bring in another 100 of them in a minute so cloakers will be in any system of any space in any numbers they wish its a simple reality proven by yearsi wont repeat to you arguements layed out on last 2 pages of this thread you will have to read it yourself at least refrain from answering if you dont even familiar with the ongoing state of discussionmy example concerning npc null space what you would have knew if actually were intrested in the discussion and read at least latest posts but you dont
im sorry i didnt know i was arguing with someone that used so many fallacies clearly from the search of forum topics has already had many people like you complaining about afk cloaking and clearly no one has agreed with you you claim zero effort i claim bullshit there is no such thing as zero effort involved when you are flying such heavily nerfed vesselsyou claim mwdcloak trick that is not the cloaks fault attempting to pass the blame on a symptom without attacking the cause is a tad silly dont you think as for you dont count jumping gates and burning out of bubbles as effort i sure do specially when said bubble full of drones and there is an instalocker sitting on the edge of the bubble ready to lock you so you cant recloak hey i guess that is not effort either mmm silly me i guess my definition of effort is different from yours wormhole is a universal way to nullsec these days according to whom you clearly your experience is much greater then you know everyone else that been saying you are wrong guess thats okay you are some kind of god with god knowledge about topics that we dont understand mmm i did study the topic that is called in question though i fear that because my opinion doesnt agree with your own you attack me and call me a troll because i dont agree with you clearly my own study has result in much different opinion or you studied different data from me which my data says that covops is not very easy to get into the nerfs that a ship receives for being covops able the fact that they cant ever fit a tanki also studied that cloaking was also design to help people make sneak attacks sadly because of local whenever you enter a system everyone docks up making you unable to get a kill so people must sit afk for days to trick people to come out so they can get that kill days of their time is wasted when they could be doing something else to attack a supply line i dont study the system my friend i think i understand the pains that a cloaker goes through all to well a understanding that you seem to lack im attempting to make a point for you a point that you dont seem to understand and that point is that why should my gameplay get nerfed so that your gameplay can be better then mine
no one can make a 247 work force sure you can get people across the seas dont limit yourself in one time zone and a single alt with covops cyno can bring in another 100 of them in a minute so they can bring in another 100 heavy nerfed ships or did they changed it to allow things other then covops only ships able to lock onto a covops cynoi think that was another simple reality proven by years was that only covops able shipsblackops battleships can use covops cynos however if they use a normal cyno other things can lock onto it of course that also means that their position gets broadcaster to who knows whom thus allowing anyone in the system to jump in for beef d repeat the argument i dont need you to repeat it the cause for power projection is cynos itself there really nothing to argue about your example is conern about npc null space i dont understand what point you are trying to make are your concerns about cloaking cynos or 2 week old alts that are doing your relic sites because you were to slow to get there yourself
theoretically its possible to run 6 1000 times in a row on a dice irl it like never happens no ppl wont be guarding all the gates in the sov space 247 its just a game they came here to have fun and no camp aside from those counting dozens of ships and having enlisted pilots well trained in unclockin things will stop a covops most of the timesmore than enough to terrorize smaller entities in npc nulls for example because their members will often find yourself being alone at some time of a day and can be easly overcomed with 24 those nerfed cloacking vessels with blops hotdrop if needed as a support if some friend or two will try to rescue them no power projection is also an ability to buy and subscribe a bunch of expendable cloaking alts and sometimes even share accounts to extend tz coverage using iskies from moongoo or ratting in you well defended home space place them all around constellation and effectively disrupt any activities of any entities in said npc nulls arnt capable to counterhotdrop you anytime while effectively not playing those alts 90 of a time  simply because of the fact current cloaking mechanics wont penalize you for staying afk in any way no risk no lowered combat efficience  you can immidiately swich from tottaly afk and safed up state to fully combat capable and point a victim than bring in others from nearest system so the only sane decision you can make is dont even try to do anything or join some powerblock this leads to the same problem  large entities forming other ppl leaving stagnation rising
well then probably there is still chance you are not a troll and just so bad at this game that even me humble nullsec carebear have absolutely no problem travesring nullsecs and wh space any direction i need and i havent lost even one covops last year doing this i even run relics while at it sometimes when local is not empty there is somethign very wrong with your vision of the game when it was when you logged last timeoh sorry im doing it like hundred times a day and i would say that efforts i spend to do one lv4 mission are much much greater than those while flying covops i dont note any efforts on my side like 95 of a time and in case of camp 95 of them are easly evaded according to like every and each single guide for newcomers on nullsec exploration im myself told the basics to some of them and it didnt take more than a forum post to do so and of course those who pvp and cloaks in nulls dont have like slightest problem with getting here your lack of basic games knowledge is frightening the local actually is the only thing which still allows the like of you to have even those scarce opportunities to kill something if not for it even those hard boiled carebears that still stay there would move out the problem why you cant hunt and get kills without afking for days in local is in awfully plain and imbalanced cloaking mechanics itself its devoid your prey from any opportunities to save yourself because the moment you uncloacked its too late for her and your friends cloaking in neigbouring system come to assist you in their underpowered combat ships because your prey have like zero chance of surviving she wont try to do anything at all and will stay at posstation  no one like to have too many visits at eves logistics and shopping exciting side so you dont have opportunity to attack her at all if she could at least somehow predict that attack is imminent  if she is ready to contribute some effort to it  than she would try to go out and risk more often you dont want to understand other players needs in your selfish pursuits for kills  no one want to be there for your fun if they cant do their thing if they are devoid of chance to survive or win  they will stay out of itno our gameplay should be equalized forcing both parties to stay atk to be affective at what they doing allowing the hunter to catch and its victim  to evade i layed out my concept here
clearly arguing is pointless with you i sall leave it to this if you wish to change cloaking then you will have to change local as they keep each other balanced until local is fixed i doubt we will ever see a change to cloaking  maybe i should of lead with this one
you cant argue with me because you dont care to read what others say thus you cant actually present any arguments and if cloak will be redone the way i proposed i dont mind if local will be removed should we call it a deal
actually i kinda didnt read your last post because of you performing personal attacks if you wish to argue then you should keep personal attacks out of itim not arguing with you im arguing with the fact that people are demanding changes to something that doesnt need to be changed in it current state if you wish to change cloak then you have to change local it really that simple i didnt say remove it but it must be changed if you wish to change next i argue with your claims of cloak is the cause of force projection again that is not true i find that such people using such lack of information to make that claim appallingive read how your cloak will be redone how you proposed and i disagree with it if you are going to change something then you are going to have to change all the systems that it effects and is effected by what is so hard to understand about that im sorry for the all caps but i felt that it wasnt getting through your skull like at all
thats actually example while me calling you a troll isnt a personal attack but merely calling a spade spade in this board you have to post constructively saying you are disagree with something or that something isnt broken when you presented with arguments that it is isnt a constructive at all you have to state your reasons and you have to name those systems which will be irrevocably broken by those changes i proposed i hardly can name one if you dont intend to do that than you are here not to contribute but to tpost and will be reported
i am posting constructively im disagreeing with your implantation or suggested change it called constructive criticism look it up report away just shows how immature you areas for your suggested system there really no need for it you already cant do anything to others cloaked saying you can is frankly stupid and you never flown a cloaker before next adding two modes to cyno again why what function it allows you to be scanned down while having this second mode being activated so basically why dont you just ask covert ops ships cant use cynos it would be so much easier and again you will still run into problems with people having super fast fits that you cant scan down so here what i say about your suggestion it provides no value to the game what so ever thus it should be disgarded it not so much as it breaks stuff as it makes thing more unneededly complex when asking for cloakers unable to fit a cyno would be easier to implementso what does it break covert ops ships ability to be covert ops with a cynoand it still doesnt fix the problem covert ops vs local and it doesnt fix the problem of force projection a interceptor or speed fit ship would just fill the role instead so the real question is my trollish carebear what does your suggestion actually fix
you showed again that you dont care to read or contribute only troll and misguide it was two modes for cloaking not for cyno and it was clearly stated so btw the reason to penalize ability of those cloackers backed up by powerfull entitiy so able to hotdrop significant cloaked forces small entities cant cope with ability to disrupt operations of others while being afk if you afk in active mode you will be scanned and busted if you afk in passive mode than when you will return back to keyboard next morning and will find someone you want to hodtdrop you wont be able as it is now to just come to where he is point him and fire a cyno  you will need to switch to active mode first and if your victim do her job diligently  like dscan surroundings  she will be able to evade you probably if not you will get it atm you will get it unconditionally she will not have any chance to survive so when she see familiar face in local she wont come out of pos protection if she wont see local one day she will leave nullsthe problem wont go if you wont be able to hotdrop you still will have your covertcyno so you can bring enough covert vessels to any system you want beforehand and let them hang there then if you point someone in one system you can bring others from neighboring systems here this is powerprojection as characters and subscription are bought for isks so do assets youll need to cyno covert alts you bought to any system you like thus allowing any large entity to stomp unconditionally on small enough ones
maybe you should reread my post
i read your post intently and its full of it breaks its not needed its bring nothing stuff wihtout a single argument thats why i reported it alreadyyour other concerns answered in my post on this proposal itself no in active mode you wont be scanned right away like you try to imply it says that it would take considerable time to do so so would happen only if you just left eve running and went to bed if you changing your spots regularly you wont be scanned even in active mode and you dont need to stay in it forever to light your cyno you just need to switch to it which will take 2030 seconds and if your victim was oblivious and didnt check dscan now you can do anything you could before  point drop etc then you can finish it and switch back to passive
i honestly dont think you understand the ones that are determain if we should back your ideas should not be the ones that have to bring a supporting argument on why they should or shouldnt change itthat job falls under the task of the person that is attempting to make the change as a player and someone that you know puts money into the game like everyone else my only job is to tell you if i support or dont support your ideaat the moment seeing you havent provide in compelling argument or evidence on why the game needs the change my support is directed to the not supported group any other misconceptions you wish to bring to the drawing board
ill leave it to isd team please delete this useless attempts to educate too
and i clarified my views many times your suggestion has no value at all and i suggest you rethink your suggestion and make something more usable you are like a kid a kid that kicks and screams when he is told no it sad really that people now have to post in the assembly hall to prevent their suggestions threads from being locked because they failed to use the search function in the features and ideas forum section
thank you
hehe yep thats the one
multiboxers arent bots their efficiency is nowhere close to that of a bot and they arent normally grinding isk for rmt like bots often are and bots were never allowed thus didnt become a widely used thing isboxer on the other hand is allowed has been stated as such so a lot of people have them if it was suddenly disallowed thousands of accounts would drop and all for what so a few people can cry a little less while the mineral index doubles
i promise ill read the whole thing later but just skimmed bits here and there is the tldr for this an activity based sov so use it or lose it kind of thingif it is how would you overcome a large group being able to hellcamp a group out of sovalso how would you deal with sitaution where groups just take the key systems and leave the pipes sovless no small group could take that sov since it would be logistically impossible to live in a space between 2 systems owned by a coalition
afk cloacker can rise risks of anyone operating in the area while contributing neglectable effort to the levels those operations lose any sense this happens because current cloaking mechanics wont penalize afk behavior and dont allow to discern in any way can it attack atm or not until he uncloaks which is too late afk gameplay is heavily penalized and made unfeasible in any other pvprelated tactics in eve what makes afkcloaking stand out so much
the part where he cant activate any modules while cloaked besides afk gameplay is not exactly penalized in a lot of situations in eve unless its done so by the players afk mining is only bad because other people will gank you for examplea player who is afk cannot hurt you this is not a problema player who is at his keyboard is legitimately hunting you this is not a problem either the only problem is that people feel entitled to have zero uncertainty to not have to make a judgement call which is to be quite frank tough 
the part it is too late when he uncloaked which means additional tweaks are needed that will create competition after cloaker got to the keyboard but before he uncloakedso its penalized in the end you cant in any way gank afking cloaker while he can at any moment go from afk to combat state with 0 delay in case of sb and neglectable delay in case of force recon and point you then bring a support either from other afkers of from droppers and gank youbut he rises cost of operations in the area  thats the problem if profit doesnt justify the risks than operations stop he does it while staying mostly afk because of huge element of uncertanty he able to create as reiterated many times uncertanty is so big and being ganked if cloaker is atk is so certain outcome that any entity not large enough to have rescue party online all the time will have to stop any operations in the area
lets look into the problem from another levelwhat makes you vulnerable to covops hunters three things combined you cant fight back hunters can easily track you and land in a close proximity to you whilst staying cloaked and without having to use any special tools eg probes you are not aware of where exactly the hunter is located at this very moment and what is he doing those who propose changes to how the cloak functions are addressing the third point however this is actually a minor issue compared to others a pvp vessel or a bunch of them disrupts moneymaking activities having the cloak not having it it doesnt really help knowing where this vesselfleet is and what it is you can try to fight back but odds are you will end up being hotdropped by a larger forcefirst two points can be dealt with using the current mechanics there are tactical and strategical solutionsfirst point the tactical solution use ships that are able to fight back pretty much any cruiser size vessel equipped with 10mn mwd and weaponry that is effective in close range is able to fight back against most covert cyno ships stealth bombers can insta lock you upon exiting the cloak but they are stationary due to cyno paperthin frigates that can easily be popped force recons cant be killed that easily but they have a reasonable recalibration time plus the time they need to lock a cruiser you have more than enough time to overburn mwd and get out of cynos point rangethe strategical solution is the one members of gsf enjoy  no its not about having a large friendly fleet ready to help you this is an option when you want to punish a shiny black ops fleet once but its an extremely ineffective way to protect ratters in long run what im talking about is afktars that are cheap effective and reimbursable so you dont really care about losing them every now and then you can argue that you dont want to join those big coalitions well the game is designed so you need to prove yourself worth of some isk faucets and to prove yourself worth you need to either be an extremely good playeror to join to a large force this is how eve is and whether it is right or wrong is not this topics subjectsecond point the tactical solution move around all covops gankers can confirm that it is very hard to catch a ship that is constantly moving with high enough speed and unpredictable trajectory a cloaked ship has a limited speed and needs to avoid wrecks and other objects again a 100mn ab10mn mwd cruiser is what you need make bookmarks around the system you are ratting in and warp to them first and then to an anomaly at a random range instead of warping directly from anomaly to anomaly if you use an immobile ship to run anomalies  you just ask to be ganked and its not the cloak mechanics to blamethe strategical solution is to switch from beltsanomalies to some other iskmaking activity but its not really relevant in this discussiontldr use the current game mechanics to deal with either the first or the second point and nasty afk cloakers will not be a problem for you no need to change the way the cloak works
the base environment does not exist just because of cloaks or just because of localas diametrically opposed facets of intel they are the key playersa genuine solution to this would require both to be compromisedi find the assumption that hot dropping would remain unchanged or that local being absent would somehow be drastically in favor of gankers to be shortsighted and guilty of assuming too many detailslocal being absent would in fact be far more likely to entrench groups of players like alliances because the second best alternative to local is something they already haveintel channels networked with players able and willing to relay critical informationhostiles entering foreign space do not have anything to replace local that is comparable to this intel networkthe cyno effect is unchanged with the specific exception already describedthe cyno ship cannot move but it can still perform any task the same as any other current cyno shipongrid the field visual and beacon would appear during the spool up period but no ships could travel to it their would be no system wide beacon at this stageif a ship executed a cyno off grid to other pilots noone would know their was a cyno spooling up as the system wide cyno beacon only appears once the cyno is active and ships can travel to it by jumpingnow in theory a cyno ship can put a point onto the target who would then be able to either make a run for it or try to attackif they wanted many ships could possibly run while attackingi specified 30 to 60 seconds for the spool up as a balance point since this would likely need testingmaybe only the force recons could do 30 while all others did 60upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
they used to do this before they removed learning skills that improved attributes when you trained them which everyone did train them as their first thing before actually training other stuffit wont be coming back
so why cant every nonpvp module double up as a pvp module why is exploration so special that you want to have 2 specialties at onceoh i see so miners should have to split their loot but exploration pilots should be able to do everything solo i dont really see why if you are an exploration pilot solo then you can run away from combat nothing stopping you doing that but you dont want that you want to explore then suddenly be pvp fit if someone shows up i honestly dont understand how you cant see why this is heavily biasedor 3 evade combat if you are there for pve you arent there to pvp
first off a cargo scanner isnt required its a choice secondly most exploration ships have an extra high for a probe scanner specifically so you didnt lose anything thirdly you are stating relic and data analysers so you are talking about a dual exploration fit for exploring both types of site so you want to be able to fit for both types of exploration and you want to be viable in pvpno make your choices and live with those consequences
yes tldr  this is a sov based on you use it or you lose itthe mechanic ive included in this scheme is that a larger group trying to take sov from the system owners have to play by the owners rules in this case losing sov points or gaining attacker points can only occur if the attacker participates in activities that are based on the class or sov level of the system sitting with 20 titans and 50 supers blapping everything out of existence does not gain the attacker any points or cause the sov holder to lose any points unless the class of the system supports the owners use of the same ships in that case youd need the titanssupers in order to break the activities of the system owners youll also have to remember the attackers had to get their system sov to the level that they can makeuse supers and titans and if theyve all run off to attack your system then they are defenseless im sure that there are some intricacies that i havent figured out but at least thats the idea id like to see happenas far as pipes are concerned if a group only takes key systems and leave empty space theyll only have a small ability to upgrade the system theyve taken in this way another group could push through the key system to take up residence in an adjacent system this is actually a way to limit a different groups push to increase class sov level because you need adjacent systems at a certain class in order to upgrade the main system to a higher classthanks for the questions and the read
intel channel are useless without local since people moving though a set of systems would be invisible without removing power projection the only thing that removing local would do is kill off pve since nobody would sit around in a ship that wouldnt be able to fight back able to be dropped on in a heartbeat even the interceptor change nuked a massive amount of interest in doing anything noncombat in null since its so easy to get tackled now removing local would be the final nail in the coffin the only reason to be in null after that would be pvp which would be dominated by whichever group can drop the most on people quickly the quality of ratting and mining in any given area would become entirely irrelevant since nobody in their right mind would want to be a pve pilot in that environment hell even id start running around nuking ratters and im an indy pilotwhen you talk about these type of changes your problem is and always has been that you dont take into account the fact that peoples behaviours would change you treat it as both the hunted and the hunters would act exactly the same as they do now thats not the case the hunted would be exposed to increased risk and decrease activity which the hunters would use the advantage of invisibility to increase activity
lucas i believe we would all appreciate polite logic and the ability of all involved to be willing to question their own assumptionsplease keep this in mind as i know you to be quite passionate on certain topicsno they would not be invisiblethey simply would not be known so easily as seeing the name listed in local chatthis is not equal to being invisiblealso it is only easy to be tackled if you let a hostile on grid with youonce you have intel on an approaching hostile a few systems away it is reasonable to expect pilots to align and prepareexpecting a scout to monitor gate traffic is also reasonable and grants more than enough time to reactyou are claiming that peoples behaviors would changeallow me to point out how i agree with this statement1 intel would not be reliably gathered from players docked in an outpostthe changeplayers would instead be needed to sit in proximity to gates most likely at bottleneck points where traffic flow reliably needs to pass this is not excessive effort since it grants leverage to those players downstream who benefit from this intel2 hot dropping loses value when other options exist with comparable resultsthe changesending a ship on grid with a target is one thing especially if you need to hold a point on ithaving a cyno pop especially if a spool up is involved becomes less than optimalyou can bring in the same ships outside of scan range and have them warp to the target insteadthis allows all involved to load the target system and warp togetherit also eliminates the vulnerable period of being locked down by a cyno field while having a hostile on gridupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
power projection  sov mechanic changes etc all those ideas are not nice and limit options for getting the fights that we all search fori have a cool idea i want to disclose here  not sure if this has been brought out yet but here goes my brain fart reduce sbu timing to online to 1 hour cap alliance membership to 4000 members all ships that doesnt belong to the alliance holding sov and aggressor alliance will automatically have their locking ability reduced to nill yes u cant lock anything and bombers will have their bombing modules offlined when they pass within the sbued system cyno jammer doesnt work when a system is sbued solved isk accepted as donation for this awesome idea p general output after patching1 sov will be reflecting alliance military power not the coalitions2 limiting alliance members will prevent all xcoalitions to reform into one alliance3 more fights since small alliances 800 to 2000 members can fight unorganized full alliances4 cyno jamming for sbued system will prevent camping gates by blues to that alliancein short  having more blues will have no effect to sov taking and will be limited only to skirmish fights here and there over pos
sbu your own system with an alt or a blue allianceyou are now completely invulnerable

wont work in npc nulls and in lows too and it has meaning there  like you have set some logistical facilities and keep market full up to your needs but there are your reds around living fence to fence with you and you dont want to sell them weapons they will use against you the same night yes they can still infiltrate your ranks to have access to market but at least this will take some effort and sometimes hopefully can be tracked
two reasons  the simplest is because it would make it far to easy to try to disguise rmt as legitamate market activity making it that much harder for ccp to hunt down now if you want to use the market to help run your rmt operation you have to go to out of the way stations without much traffic and that makes it easier for ccp to findsecond reason is because thats just not how the eve market works its not a store where you go in look around and if you dont like the product the price or the owner you go to a different store it helps to think of the eve market as a commodities brokerage because thats what it is sellers indicate what goods they have and the lowest price they will accept for them buyers indicate what goods they want and the price they are willing to pay the market service acting as a broker matches orders on a lowest price out per station system if two orders have the same price the oldest order wins iircthe system doesnt need to be changed because frankly theres no compelling reason to do so it works and by working the way it does it helps limit rmt potential
ok so say a small group had and levelled a system a large group then moves a fleet in and camps them for an extended period of time surely that act alone preventing the owners from continuing to use their system would reduce their hold on it then again a larger group could just bring the right class of ship for the system just in numbers that blot out the sun and nuke the system into submission they wouldnt then need to hold it they could just cause enough disruption to make sure that nobody wanted to live therei see so it would promote holding clusters of systems i supposed but it would still be pretty impossible for a small group to hold systems between clusters it also then raises the question does that mean that a small group that can only hold a system or two would be unable to grow a system to the max level surely they would be better served to just rent from a group which can push and hold max level much like they do now
true but that can happen in any system even now this sov mechanic isnt designed to remove that particular war tactic its designed to force system owners to use their system in order to own it rather than the current pay for it once and keep it forever mechanicalso true the point here is that if you want to have a small group then you can expect to be able to grow to a certain amount spaceterritory wise if you want more territory then youll have to form a bigger group in order to support the space that will then support youit doesnt bother me personally that goons have figured out a way to run a 12k person coalition it does bother me that theyve gobbled up all the space in the game im in favor of a mechanic that can scale up and support as many people in the system as are willing to work for it

they would effectively be invisible since youd have to treat any presence as hostile meaning that they get hidden within false positives youd be constantly reporting someone in systems all over the place which finely leads onto the next pointintel is only useful if its accurate with the names not showing youd have lots of false positives so youd spend a lot of your time running from nothing in addition youd need people in all surrounding systems since people could bust in from all over the place including wormholes especially with the k162 change and empty systems without people to report intel channels are uselessits a game not a career why would anyone play a game to stare at a gate all day be serious mate the game has to be fun i know you dont care since it wouldnt be you doing it but you cant reasonably expect someone to just sit and do nothing all day as entertainmentso what you are saying is that people would have to turn the game into a career so other people in their alliance can play in addition those people who are sitting on gate would now need to be paid by those not sitting on the gates thus reducing income so your plan is reduce fun and income while increasing risk and you think thats a workable planexcept you could still send in a tackler to lock down the target for the short time it takes for the cyno to spool most targets would be soft targets ratters miners etc holding them wouldnt be a tough taskoverall its just an unreasonable and pointless change that would only serve to move more people out of nullsec pretty much the opposite of what needs to happen people need to be given a reason to go there and not just the people that like to run around and gank everything but everyday players who currently sit in highsec grinding missions because its safe and nearly the same income

oh you have increased the ships needed here for hot droppingor maybe this tackler is still the locked down cyno ship unable to pursue a target for the 30 to 60 seconds needed to keep it on grid for that dropalso you have devalued the pve ship fittings to be described as soft targetsso you have failfit pve ships controlled by players who cant be bothered to listen to intel channels or support their own means of protection  warning eitherand you want to bring more of these farmers into nullwhy exactly would serious players want to be in an alliance filled with these guysupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
your comments make it quite clear you have absolutely no experience running pvp isboxer fleets as stated before if isboxer made you so godly then why isnt your corp running roughshod over everyoneive shot myself with none of my ships being on the overview the times ive done it were when i was in an incursion site killing npcs during all the earlier incidents the overview was setup to show only the sansha npcs and the gate despite this some how i will find myself with a capsuleer combat timer what usually gets me to notice though is the sudden decrease in hp of one of my dps due to a recent run in with a fleet attempting to gank me ive changed my overview to include the typical gank ships filters are setup to only show ships outside of my fleet etc analyzing my setup there should be 0 possibility of targeting myself yet it still occurs even under ideal situations isboxers repeater doesnt place the mouse perfectly in the same spot on every screen add to the misplaced mouse tendencies other problems like internet related lag and system related lag and you get all kinds of unintended actionsnot to mention isboxereve interactions with all the low level drivers and such in windows im pretty sure thats how im targeting myself once every 3 hours of gameplay im not terribly surprised as im sure that when ccp was programming this game they had no plans for people to be running 10 copies of the game on the same machine unintended actions and such are to be expected in such a complicated and unexpected setupas for running incursions theres basically two different ways to target sansha one is to use broadcasts on a non repeater ship and then using repeater to have the other dps target the broadcast i find this method to be slow and very clunky for my setup i personally use the overview and theres two ways to run that you can run with tags which once again the act of tagging means youre not targeting your ships for reps or shooting sansha while youre doing the first set of tags on each wave i personally have filters and a specific sorting method that allows for me to achieve singular targeting at least 90 of the time its much faster then dealing with the hassle of tagging for my setup as mentioned earlier isboxers repeater function doesnt place the mouse perfectly on every screen and systeminternet lag can further exasperate the problem resulting in incorrect targeting so im generally slow and careful when it comes to important targeting fortunately in vgs i can be kind of sloppy when targeting the tamasniarja since they dont require much to explode even so i have to be careful in otas for obvious reasonswatching isboxers run incursions on youtube you can see how they are moving much slower then you would controlling a single client the very design of incursions allows for these slower movements to occur without penalty pretty much every single site has the incursion ships appearing 30 km away which gives time to do targeting if they are closer youre going to have to wait for your webs to slow them down anyway my logistics arent tied to isboxer and ive said that many times over ive also said the reason they arent tied in as part of my isboxer setup is because i like operating them at normal speed also when something goes horribly wrong with isboxer or eve the logistics are unaffected so i can at least keep characters alive till they warp off like ive said many times i prefer my simple setup over the all in one complex setup because its more robust and the logi are much quicker to react with i will say though that the all in one setup is much lazier to usei refuse to humor youre incredibly open ended nonsensical request to explain how a high end computer works if you dont know how the 1s and 0s work or how the electrical pulses flow im not going to sit here typing out a paper explaining it for your stop being lazy io systems always have a limit in capabilities and when youre running 12 clients on one system youre hitting everything hard inevitably there will be some burps on some clients explain how to setup this magical good overview then instead of continuing your usual posts full of vague assertions and outlandish claims how about you actually explain something for once instead of because i said so so it must be true also while doing this keep in mind my earlier statement that i setup filters so that its impossible for my fleet members to appear in the oerview

i think thats what needs to change though for the little guys to stand a chance there need to be some way to make it less worthwhile to troll them out of their space it doesnt really matter if someone owns the space or it is unclaimed if one group can still push everyone else out of it i think this change would lead to people clustering their activity but still dominating large areas of space especially since renters would still be feasible a 30k coalition would have no troubles smashing out the activity to hold all the space they need at the same time as bullying people out of their spacedo you think your idea would change that though the coalitions could still gobble up the space realistically the idea needs to be adapted so that theres no reason to bully people out of their space just off the top off my head and by no means well thought out but perhaps it could scale reward based on average regional levels as well regardless of owner and scale base on the average owner level this way it would encourage people to try to hold all of their space at a high activity level preventing the hold these system at a minimum level to stop others using it issue as well as encouraging multiple owners in the same region to allow each other to prosper that said it would likely just result in those groups being absorbed into the coalitions and creating even bigger blue doughnutsits definitely a tough problem i think force projection needs to be looked at at the same time as any sov change
because its hassle do you want to have to type in local every time you jump eve online is a game a game do you understand what a game is its something you play for fun not to give you work to do between workno you didnt need those people people who happen to be about post in intel and that is all with the change you suggest those people would become a requirement and they couldnt be doing their own thing they would have to be employed solely to run intelno point 1 its a game you are suggesting they remove fun from a game you are smoking something special if you think a game developer is going to seriously consider taking fun out of a game so people are forced into responsibilitypoint 2 and its still a game i really dont get how you dont understand what games are made for you cant honestly expect people to step up and treat the game as a job to be able to progress in the gameif reward in null was scaled up you would never hear the end of the complaints from highsec youd also run into the issue where a group is able to game the system to earn the rewards with minimal risk like what happens rights now further creating an imbalance and the majority of people would have too much increased risk meaning that the level of reward is irrelevant basically null would only be populated by the most hardcore isk generators and thousands upon thousands of gankers looking for easy kills since lets face the truth your suggested change is only going to be positive for that single group of peopleand yes pve is pretty boring and is due a lot of improvements that doesnt mean adding risk to it makes it any less boring all that does is mean you do the same thing but risk losing it all a lot more oftenby perhaps 1 ship yes im sure the hotdroppers will cry themselves to sleep over 1 additional ship in exchange for near invisibility its clear what you want from this change easy kills you dont hide your intentions very well but please proceed to tell me im wrong and thats not at all what you wantand pve ships are soft targets thats a well known fact thats why people gank them you dont have to be fail fit for a pve ship to stand no chance against a pvp ship and the intel channels may show absolutely nothing since theres not going to be a fraction of the population in null if your suggestion went throughand id like to see more people of all types in null thats why i dont support ludicrous ideas like yours which would effectively make null empty why dont you just head off to wh space where you can have what you want and stop trying to nuke the fun out of the game you might consider eve your career but most of us dont
stripping out all the opinions you stated this is the only fact you actually postedyes it is a gamehere are a few more factsgames are the means we have for competing against each othersome are simple and require little effort tictactoe or rockpaperscissors are good examplesbut the degree of effort you put into playing also translates into the amount of satisfaction you feel when you succeed in playingwinning at a chess match against a skilled opponent can be much more satisfying than the same two players playing checkerssure not everyone is up to challenging efforts or complicated strategiesthe sov null section of eve is not for them in many cases unless someone else can shoulder the burden of micromanaging them to compensateif you do not want to work with a group as part of a larger effort null is probably not the best fitoccasional solo play is fine but you must accept that you are still relying on group effort to do this and this lack of group connection during play will always be a weakness others can exploityour opinion that bringing in more players who by your definitions do not seem interested in group play is contrary to what i believe are the games best interests in null sechere are my opinionsjust like we dont all get trophies for participating sov null is not a welcoming place for all play styles eitherotherwise high sec would be nothing more than an extended tutorial and low sec just the buffer areacloaking is not a finished product as in this context the game ends in stalemates too often for player satisfactionupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
lolso everything you posted was fact then just carefully disguised as your opinionsbut you arent talking about more effort you are talking about making it so that someone has to sit staring at a gate in order for their friends to play a game theres a difference between making a game more challenging and making it tedioustotally and utterly disagree your premise here is that chess is inherently more fun and rewarding than checkers which is not the case they are two different games both of which can be equally fun and rewarding depending on tastenot to mention youre not talking about chess and checkers your talking about chess and wall staring if you changed chess so that each side had to have someone sit staring at a wall youd have a hard time finding people to do that part for funi dont think you are the person that gets to decide what type of person sov null is and isnt for until ccp employs you to make such calls youre just a peon like the rest of usand again its not to do with working as a group you want to force people to perform dull tedious tasks to replace a current game mechanic so its easier for gankers to come in and destroy null players thus increasing risk there are other ways to increase risk which dont involve players being required to turn eve into a careerwho said they arent interested in group play all ive said is that the current risk to reward ratios in null and high sec keep them playing in highsec and that nullsec is underpopulated it would be nice for people to be able to make the move into nullsec without feeling like they will instantly lose everything if they try sure players that dont want anything to do with anyone else probably wont like nullsec but then no change short of adding concord would encourage them to move im talking about moving people who are borderline what you are talking about is creating gank heaven and nuking the current population into oblivion forcing null into a state of pvp only
you are spinning this to one perspective of the gameyou are putting forth the presumption that scouting as in maintaining a post is beyond the possibility of being even a part of acceptable playyou are suggesting that any players in a system are all responsible sources for an intel channel despite the fact they may be afk or otherwise too busy to pay attention well enough to report suchone would hope they took at least some form of protective countermeasure in case hostiles did enteryou seem to redefine effort to exclude anything that involved persistent effort such as watching a gateand this in combination with so many examples of players dual boxing with low attention demand tasks like ratting and mining alreadythese are observations of what you have writtenplease feel free to correct me if i missed somethingupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
maintaining a post is beyond the possibility of being part of this game since its boring as sin nobody wants to pay a sub to sit around doing nowt have you ever even remotely been involved in game design pointless mechanics with no gameplay arent a good ideawhere did i suggest thaterm no persistent effort isnt the problem but it has to be gameplay a mechanic that has no gameplay put in just so people like you can feel that null sec players are having to work harder has no placeand you cant build mechanics based around multiboxing multiboxing is not a requirement of the game so they have to treat all characters as individual players and build mechanics for that otherwise they risk blocking out all players who dont multiboxthis is obviously going to go on for all eternity since you are dead set on your idea of tuning null into wormholes with force projection being something amazing so im going to leave this here hopefully ccp arent silly enough to blindly follow ideas like this which would ruin nullsec in the blink of an eye
oh now we are talking about game design bout  time first lets talk about this lets assume you know something about game design first you will know that in many cases it takes more the one game mechanic to make something possible but at the same time it could only take one of these mechanics to make something unfun now if we are talking about afk cloakers have you ever thought that it might be like this not because of the mechanic of cloak but due to the omnipotent intel thus emergent game play has evolved to make that omnipotent intel lie hmmm that the thing about a sandbox game you have to look out for every possibility something you learn about that in game designing just saying while yes developers dont build mechanics around multiboxing they have to look in the perspective of how will someone abuse this mechanic can it be broken by say someone that is multiboxing first i would like to ask how do you know that will ruin nullsec in the blink of an eye if wormhole was all that bad i doubt we would of ever have seen this expansion pack that is purely design just for wormhole sec as for ideas in general the mechanic that is null sec needs a complete rewrite to remove local we need new and better intel tools that while requiring work doesnt have such a steep learning curve that no one but a few can use them intels tools should be like probes almost anyways can do probes but only the good few can narrow down that target in 10 something seconds exaggerated analogy but it there to get my point across next once real intel tools are put into place and local remove then you will most likely see tools design to hunt down cloakers next we need a few other changes as well before such change can take place as well power projection should be looked into i dont feel that moving 10 titans backed up by hundreds or even maybe thousands of ships should beable to be done at a drop of the hat however that is just my opinion until such changes are made these three facts will remain factscloak is broken local is broken by both being broken in direct inverse to each other they remain in perfect balance
i do believe in critical thinking analyzing feedback to identify areas of improvement i have stated many times i am a continual improvement type person and that is one of the many things that make me love eve it is constantly evolving and improving it is possible to get so bogged down in logic and counter logic that you lose sight of the issue cant see the forest due to all the trees analogy first lets stats some facts these can be found in many places on the forums and if you read dev blogs they are in there as welleverything we do at ccp and we are always striving to ensure that every aspect of eve provides interesting choices for players to make ccp fozzie

you dont need to ban isboxer all you need to do is limit how many active accounts can connect from a single machine or ip or both
thats exceedingly a bad idea for so many reasons there are many many non multiboxers that share the same ip everything from a family or room mates that play to dormsschoolsapartmentscondosisp firewalletcetc one of my internet providers actually had a setup that made everyone that used their service have the same ip to those outside of the networkof course defeating your proposal would be easy as mac spoofing is possible and proxy servers exist galore virtual os installs and multiple machines also bypass your one client per machine conceptccp doesnt want to make it one client per machine as theyd lose at least half their subscribers nulllowsec movement for non nullblock members would become a nightmare as cyno alts would be harder to use since few have multiple gaming computers at the same desk
this has already been addressed in this very thread on multiple occasions its a terrible idea
um i am an it guy and you are 100 incorrectandccp already does this if you use a trial account try it it will only let you log onto that one account on the same machinepeople share a subnet mask your ip is unique to your singular connection whether it is a random or static one every time you connect if you hook 2 computers up in the exact same room on a router both will have different ips i should know i have 3 in my apartment as i build them for a living your ip is how the internet determines where to send and receive information fromeach connection is unique it is however possible to get a second computer to mimick the ip of another but this must be done manually and causes a shitload of network issues so you can have 20 computers in one home and each will have a different ipalso the eve server client can determine which machine is hooked up where and how many clients are running on it its how they restrict account that are trial try it open a trial account then try and log in on a normal account it will not let you as long as that trial account is logged in but hop on another computer right next to it and you can log on all of them as long as no trial account is open on that computerif they shared an ip this would not be possible not to mention you can look at the ip yourself of your own computermy specific tech degree is in internet security and network forensics so i know for a fact you can easily do what i suggested with 0 issues and as i stated above
just want to fix something for you mr i have a degree in internet security and network forensicsthe patcher client system you know that little thing you log into can always see that the account you just logged into is a trial account thus it can have a command set into it to prevent you from logging into other accounts on that computer with that client and patcher open of course you can always try to open a different patch but a command can still be stored to read if there is another patcher open and pull data from it that is not something bound by your ip but a simple scriptprogramming put into the client and patcher system itself so mr i have a degree in internet security and network forensics why did you fail to think about that part as for your ip or internet protocol the address assign to your router is provided by your internet provider it specially bound to your modemof course the modem itself can assign it own address to your computer as a way to keep track of the inbound and outbound data but that address cant be seen by the outside world it can only be seen by that routerhubmodem and your computer it also why when you attempt to assign the same internal address to two or more different computers bad things happen because your routerhubwireless sees all inbound traffic and outbound traffic from those two or more computers as the same so in theory if a two computers open up an app that connects to the same server they both will receive copies of the packets from each other thus where the bad things happen my own degree doesnt have special name attached to it according to my college i am a cis major which also stands for computer information systems my side isnt really specialized networking but i do have some general knowledge of it because well i have to learn about it 
this falls along the lines of your claim to be a 7yr bittervet on the thread you started along this same line im not even an it guy but i can give half a dozen ways to bypass any way you can think of to run more clients than you deem to allow me to hell when i was deployed to afghanistan years ago i was able to connect to eve even through all the methods used to keep me from playing gamesim also old enough of a gamer to remember connecting to various mus from university computer labs having to explain that the five characters coming from the same ip were my friends and myself not just me
so did you get that degree after sending 50 to a nigerian university lo and behold the wonder of proxy serversvirtual machines are also an interesting topic when you ponder the question of how in the world those evil hackers managed to crack the top security measures that prevent logging in a regular and a trial account
first off its not about unfun mechanics existing some mechanics are not particularly fun and they are optional the issue here is that with the suggestions placed youd not be able to survive without someone doing the job of staring at the gates since thats the only way you could see people coming people do not want to make a job out of playing gamesand no i dont believe afk cloaking was born out of omnipotent intel it was born out of people realising that they can cause disruption while they are asleep its a joke that people have gone back and tried to make up this backstory to cry about local and you can whine about how strong local is as much as you want but the fact is its been around too long there too many other mechanics that wouldnt work well if its gone force projection mechanics pretty much across the board and would have to be rethought out at the same time and nearly no gameplay benefit to its change basically the only people that would be happy with the change are gankers and wormholers yes you have to look at that as a potential pitfall but go back and read what nikk wrote he wasnt saying that multiboxers might break it he was saying its ok to make a boring mechanic with no gameplay since people just multibox anyway so no you cant build a game mechanic under the assumption that the only people doing it will be multiboxing wormholes are pretty bad their population is quite low theres a small core of people who like it seriously go to fanfest they had graphs and stuffbut then again were not talking about wormholes are we wormholes randomly link so you cant easily get to a specific hole they have no force projection they restrict ships based on class they have no stations you dont have to pay or place modules for sovereignty and when you mine and rat you dont have a public facing index and api stats to show thats happening youre talking about taking one mechanic from wormholes dumping it in null massively increasing risk and expecting that not to just force isk generation back to highsec quicker than you can blink do you actually understand how small the gap is between null and high sec income sure power projection should be looked at as should several other mechanics if you want to turn null into a fixed set of wormholes but consider the benefit gained from such a massive undertaking what would be the result do you honestly think it would be worth the development time over other smaller changes which wouldnt alienate the existing null communityand no those are still opinions not facts cloak and local are working exactly as intended you dont like how they work but that doesnt make them broken i in fact see the good use of cloaks quite often when we are out on an op seems to me the only problem is you try to use cloaked ships as tacklers and get upset because people dont hang around to get ganked use the right tool for the job drop the cloaky nullified tengu and use an interceptor if you want to catch fully aware and prepared pilots

i greatly enjoy cloaking as a blockade runner i get by poorly prepped gate camps and laugh at them some gate camps are a challenge but you will be surprised what a little intel will do and finding a clever book mark to avoid those bubbles places at the back of the gate however im not daft enough to not admit that cloak and local is broken yes you are right they are working as intended but they are still broken  i agree with a few people on the forums that i think cloaking should work very much like submarine combat you either dont know the submarine is there till the last moment and they come and bomb your ass or your always vigilant managed to scanned the said submarine down and either a ready yourself for him to come to you get those smart bombs ready or go to him and attempt to catch him while he as the advantage ie cloaked however that is my opinion on the subject how it should work of course with how the current iteration of omnipotentate local intel power projectiong and so on lots of things need a rework if things will stay the same and that these three no four facts if you include my job will also stay true until many things which will take time and hell of a lot better suggestion quality from the community like you all should be suggesting tools that dont focus on hunting cloakers but help you make local irrelevant if you put in some work into said tool you get a much better reward cloak is brokenlocal is brokenby both being broken they are balancedand i will continue to fly my blockade runner and laugh at poorly prepped gate camps

with the current ice system an is boxer 20 man fleet which seem to be in every single system with ice in it can strip the belt in less then 10  15 minuets meaning no one else can get any ice or very little of itsome might say gank them well that would be a great idea except they are now using skiffs with larger tanks then battleshipsnow while i am fine with 25 people isboxing and mining i think that due to the low quantity of ice in each spawn in each belt something needs to be donesuggestions1 remove the ice belt spawn timer2 put more ice in the ice belts3 limit the amount of accounts you can have logged in from a single machineip at the same time 10 maybe4 go back to the stationary belt system5 126 123anything else anyone suggest which solves this issue i was hoping this would be addressed in the industry update this summer but it wasnt
not every ice site in highsec is full of isboxer fleets get away from the trade hubs and major trade routes and youll find your icewardec them if theyre not in npc corp or report them to the nearest code agent if they arestop mining ice and go do something else to make iskbottom line this problem is your problem you do something about itdont know why i waste my time with these posts not like your going to suddenly grow a pair and actually get that first killmail you just want ccp to fix your imaginary problem for you
actually my main probably has more killmails then you do im 5 year 00 veteran 2 year wh veteran and one of the veterans from the bobtri war during trinitya problem is a problem and many as individuals do not have the resources to gank a 20 man fleet of isboxing skiffs many others do not visit these forums and have no idea who code is or how to contact themfor a blanket issue that permeates the eve universe you need a blanket solution not a pinprick here and there you need a solution that will force them to stop not simply inconvenience them for a few hoursand in case your wondering if you gank their fleet they simply go buy an entire new one an isboxer ice fleet makes upwords of 2030 billion per day with current isotopes prices you ganking them only makes them laugh and shake off what amounts to a tickle this is not an issue that can be solved by force of action in game randomly with the occasional gank unfortunately it is too big and must be delt with at the source which is an individuals ability to connect that many clients from a single ip ccp already restricts your connections if you have a trial account active so this is easily doable
considering your inability to solve this problem or to find people to help you solve this problem without crying on forums im going to call bull on this one post with main or youre just who you appear to bei have it on good authority that 2 oracles can take out a skiff surely someone with all your experience can find enough people to gank a skiff fleetas i see ice fields in highsec empty of miners not to mention all the ones in null that you aparently dont have as much experience with as you claimed prior this isnt a problem in need of a blanket solution what you are asking for is for ccp to forcibly reduce another players ability to make isk for no reason other than it cuts into how much isk you can makeso do it repeatedly their income will drop drastically if they have to stop mining and buy new skiffs a couple times a day you were able to come up with an arbitrary number for how much they can make in a day but that assumes they can mine all day if there is enough ice for them to mine for 235 hours then why arent you in there mining alongside them again you asking for dev intervention in what is a personal probllemhow can a localized issue in one small section of the available game play on this game be so big you must attempt to force an entire segment of the playerbase that spans all the different activities to change their play style simply because you cant think of another way to make isk even with all that experience you aledgedly have
ummm hmmm i was thinking about answering this one nicely but i really cant so basically you are a bitter vet that cant handle someone stepping on your profit margins mmm maybe you should find ways to step on their pofit margins instead of whining on the forums mmmm i would like to get where these numbers are coming from that you know said multiboxer is making 2030 billion isk a day do you have proof of this see the problem we are having with people making please ban multiboxing software like isboxer is that that all it is is a whine thread people fail to provide proof that they are gaining an unfair advantage over other players i mean if you have proof true numbers statistics screen shots and ectra then you may have a working case for you however if you dont have these proof well you are sortasoland this is how the thread will go about you will whine other people will join your whining and then others will join in to whine back then this thread will become nothing more then a whine thread till at some point people get bored and stop whining on this thread and make a new thread with their own whine so if you want to build a strong case vs something make sure you bring your proof at the start claiming you are a 5 year vet experience so what i say is right has the same meaning as me making a claim that my own bitter vet experience makes demands that all neutral objects be protected by concord once again and they take away that stupid fing safety button so i can truely canflip gank noobs again
you appear to be labouring under a false assumptionthe csm doesnt get to make ccp do anything we can ask them to look at things we can give our opinions on things they ask about thats it we talk to ccp nothing more its a useful thing to be able to do but theres no power thereanyone who says i will do this is misguided at best
i never implied that the csm can make ccp do anything save your talking points for election season
i just wanted to weigh in on this tooas far as i know this is done on the pc not on server side when you launch a client it looks at the other running clients and disallows multiple clients if a trial client is running or a trial client if nontrials are running if you ran 2 machines on the same ip you can run both on different machinesyes and no when you connect 2 machines to a single connection they will have separate internal ips the 192168xx or 169254xx addresses among others whether or not they have multiple external ips is based on the network they are connected to with a home network you will generally only have 1 ip and businesses often have a single ip for the general traffic with separate ips for servers and the like larger universities and such may own a large block of ip addresses allowing them to distribute more external ip addresses to individual machines but most smaller universities will be limited on how many they have to the point that they have to share the public use networks they have will often be limited to a fewconsider that under ipv4 addressing there are only 42 billion unique ip addresses and youll see why its unreasonable to think that every internet enabled device in the world would have its own unique addressagain internal addresses perhaps but external generally no and connecting them to a single external ip is as simple as plugging them into a routermodem configured with a single outward facing address when a packet is sent by the router it uses pat not exclusively but lets simplify here to alter the local ports so it knows which internal machine to forward responses toyou might want to check if you took the right class it sounds like you might have accidentally taken a bakery class instead

it cant really be boththe thin is its still your opinion they are broken basically they dont wok in the way you think they should that isnt the same as being broken its just a mechanic you dont like the way it is cloaks are useful for disguising the type of ship from dscan preventing people tracking your movements within a system and for providing on grid intel and surprise attacks thats what they are designed for and they fulfil their purpose very well so well in fact that theres no null group that doesnt use covops cloakersi dont suggest tools for either i think cloaked ships are huntable enough sure afk cloaking provides a little too much benefit to the effort it takes which is why id take a look at the being afk element not just for cloakers but cloaking in general is a good mechanic as is local intel in its current state
clearly and your opinion of my opinion is still your opinion anyways moving on im a strong believer in asymmetrical balance if you dont know what it is then i suggest you watch this video here
lol moving on because you want to deem working gameplay as broken because you dont like the way it worksi disagree i dont think it create perfect balance at all and where you say it results in unsatisfying gameplay is because you are trying to use cloaking for something its not designed for you want to make cloaking even more powerful by further removing cloakers from intel requiring even more work on the part of their victims to evade them in addition to their already powerful benefits thats not producing asymmetrical balance thats taking a game mechanic and buffing it well beyond that of any other mechanic creating a massive imbalance cloakers without local would replace anything else there would be no reason to ever use a noncovops ships for hunting people down solo just like in wormhole space right now where cloaky t3s are the standard choice for anyone nipping into wormholes to score some ganksso in essence your issue is you dont think people work hard enough for what they currently get and yet the parts you would like to change would only negatively affect people wanting to pve in null honestly what gameplay benefits do you think it would have to anyone beside a ganker you want to jam in some sort of chore or a tedious configuration game just for people to be able to get enough information to even begin playing the part of the game they actually enjoyi very much doubt it theyve worked as they have for years several other mechanics are built around them and any significant change to them would likely result in a mass exodus of nullsec and all for what so a handful of gankers that want to tackle with cloaking ships can get their wish grantedout of curiosity who are you since youve chosen to post with an alt its not even clear where you even stand in this entire discussion it certainly comes across like you are someone that has little idea about how people that actually live in null interact which is why you are happy to toss around ideas which would literally destroy and entire class of gameplay to replace it with what effectively already exists in wormhole space
who am i i am a person that has been playing off an on for a number of years i am a person that frowns when people say i have little clue how people actually live in null sec you are right i dont know how other people live in null sec i only know how i live in null sec i am a blockade runner i bring high value but low cargo space costing things down to null sec and sell it to a prem i am a person that has to constantly deal with gate camps seeing i dont exactly have an alt that is fitting with as a blops alt nor do i specially care about setting up a cyno alt when im willing to ship to just about any null sec alliance unless said null sec alliance ends up in my black book i am a person that is bored with their job of doing this constant and no real change to the meta when it comes to attempting to capture covert ops ships i recieve no challenge or even have a reason to step out of my comfort zone where do i stand on the issue i stand in the future i stand in a position that i believe if we can get something really  creative then we can improve game play for both sideswhere do i stand i stand at a position that can look upon a subject and can see that there is more then just four corners to this topic oh so many more and you my friend are literately only looking at one corner my friend destroy an entire class of gameplay im trying to do everything but that it is why i keep trying to suggest to people that maybe it time to take a step back lets not look at the problem as a problem instead lets look at it as an opportunity i am the type of person that will give someone a hint then allow you to develop the solution i am the player that believes with all of their blood and willpower that with all the players that play this game surely there is someone that can come up with a creative idea for the problem that doesnt exist i want to believe with all their might that only a small fraction of them are like you lucas and dont bother to read the entire post the entire subject before forming their opinion i believe that you are only the vocal minority and that the majority want new and initiative ideas for not just this but for all sections of eve online what is my stance what is my opinion who am i why im like you i am a player of eve online and i believe that eve online can be much more then what it is now
lucas i have keep up with this thread i started and i have read each and every post i suggest you do the same you are still missing the point i think you may be arguing for arguments sake the issue raised is that not broken not not working as intended is that current mechanics revolving cloaks and afk gameplay are not fun please do not put more into it than that if you want to argue more please feel free to start your own threadthat being said you do make a lot point that echo others that does not make it a fact it makes it a popular opinion facts are not always popular and sometimes a popular opinion is a good idea most times it is not as it has not looked at the crux of the issue only the symptoms if you go back and read some of your arguments and opinions you will see that you desire a change or lack of change that would make living in null sec easier no one here is suggesting making things like wh spacewe have discussed modifying current intel gathering into something more involved that takes activity to use currently local is local it is used for many things including spam to seeing who is in system to be honest having lived in null for quite sometime i do not see how it is tied to force projection as cynos show on your overview not localin practice even in null when you see new face in local you hit dscan to see what they are in dscan is not ties to locali digress this thread is not about abolishing local nor about new intel mechanics with exception of finding cloaked vesselsthis thread is about how to change existing mechanics to make it possible to hunt cloaked ships in a manner that would dissuade afk playplease stop derailing this thread start your own or stay on topicthank you
so long story short you dont understand how 99 of the null population plays so change your gameplay i receive no challenge mining rocks in high sec so i dont do that i dont leap up and down screaming about how it should be changed for those that do and im not really sure how making it harder to track covops ships would provide you with more of a challengecertainly doesnt seem that way seems like you want to take an enormous dump on anyone that wants to actually live in null perhaps its because you trade in null and are worried that with the industry changes your margins will be cut short but if you push for a change which annihilates pve in null then you wont need to worrylol so you are looking at it from the point of view of a covops hauler not even considering how covops ships are already used in null and not looking at people who live in null every single day and yet im the one whos looking at just a single angleand yes destroy an entire class of gameplay you want things to be the way you want them to be played and everyone else who might i add actually lives in null sec can go die in a hole people dont want to sit around staring at gates all day to be able to report whos about its boring and you dont care because you wouldnt need to do it so if we arent on board with your ideas of turn null in wh space then we arent creative because some of us think of ideas that dont start with nuke local were somehow below you get over yourself mate
this impiles using alts for survival not only scanningscoutin alts you have to control 2 windows in real time one you are ratting with another on some gate if atm you can afford some delay after hearing gate flash from scout window  as whoever initiated it will still be shown in local  now you absolutely have to alttab to this window asap  even if you under the heaviest fire from rats applying tremendous efforts just to survive  or you will lose the intel pieceneed to multibox just to sustain reasonable amount of income in nullswh is what signifies rather twisted game mechanic imo i wont say for wh space but in nulls cooperation with other players which includes delegating scouting and intel gathering to separate party which implies sharing your income with them wont be profitable for you enough to justify ratting here all risks acounted for as you still have hs as a solid and almost riskfree ratting option and lucas kell already mentioned moral ambiguity of game designers decisions forcing people to stare at gates all day long just to allow somebody play his gameif it will be automated function like you just set some option and become visible to all your blues in local  then i agree with this point if you will need to do it manually in every and each system you traverse  this is another bad design decision which contributes to quantity of mindnumbing clickfest activities and we have plenty of those in eve already please dontpoint one if effort is too much you will have mostly empty nulls as of today and anyone still operating here do it mostly only because he at least has a local chat which will allow him to get to safety long before threat will knock to his door which is usually means you are deadman so less targets less content point two by restricting nulls only to team activities you are doom it to stay sparsepopulated again its obvious that many people prefer to play solo or stay out of big entities and they will keep their tastes whatsoever banning them from here you are again devoiding yourself and other null dwellers of content i dont agrue that collective gameplay should be rewarded heavily  i argue your vision of you are either play collectively and in big entity or you will have no chance to survive this is horribly wrong game design imo it should be being a member of small entity will allow you to survive for shure and have a decent income not less than you would have got from incursions in hs but you could got much much more if you have joined something bigger  this is the aproach that will drive more people to nulls making everybodys life more intrestingthats what my proposal of splitting cloak into two modes stems from having it this way you dont need to have 5 alts on all wh exits in the systems to survive anymore you only need one character and you need to stay vigilant which is serious challenge in eves reality taking into account hours and hours of repetitive actions during everyday pve activities now you dont need those infeasible aproaches with delegated human guardians at gates neither you absolutely need to have a big entity backing you up just to survive or become a seasoned multiboxer which again imo is a bane of all mmos and ruins immersion greatly you just have a solid mechanics using which you can play with you character and survive cloackers attacks in most cases if you manage to maintain situational awarness all the time mind the proposed ability for cloackers to monitor dscan activity of a victim which allow them to exploit loopholes in their dscan patternsfrom the first glance one can say it will leave hunters with even less kills then before but you are missing very important point a psychological one most people are reluctant to lose ships  you wont change this take it for granted they know that if cloaker gets close to them they are most certanly busted  aside from the cases when you have backup force always ready to react to your disstress call ie you are member of big entity staying aligned wont help much there are many cases when your actions will be predictable and hunter know them too thats why they will safe up and stay such untill threat are gone if you just give them a hope it will be enough for them to go and take that risk  because of this elusive sensation that their fate is in their hands they still will make mistakes and will lose their ships anyway  no one aside from bots can dscan indefinetly for hours without missing a beat remember proposal to grant cloacker with ability to see dscan patterns of the victim but this will trick them into thinking they can change something if they put some efforts transforming them in their minds from helpless victim to slick and tidy elusive proficient ratter of all belts that is the mindset they need to feel goodthis will stop driving solo players and small entities out of nullsecs and as their numbers will grow your chances to meet some totally oblivious victim or find some loopholes in defenses of less oblivious ones will grow in tandem
i understand what the post is about and ive seen it many times over its not like this is a new concept and yes afk gameplay is a little bit of an issue though less than most claim its solution is simple attack the afk part both with and without cloaks that can be toyed around with without having to mess up any other mechanicscertain people though like to dive into any conversation about afkers with kill local its the only way theyll do it without fail every single time the problem with that idea is that almost every other null mechanic would need to be destroyed and rebuilt to facilitate that and the net benefit would be about zero it wouldnt be any more fun for the majority and in fact would add the requirement for people to have meaningless chores within the game something ccp have explicitly stated they are against just to obtain the ability for their mates to have funwhile it wasnt about that its pretty much turned into that since thats always the argument tied in with adding hunt cloaked ships you arent going to be able to have a conversation about hunting cloaked ships without the usual crowd chiming in with waah local intel must die it just doesnt happen history shows us this
i honestly dont think you yourself know how null sec works just saying everything you say like conflicts with what most null secers do in null sec delete local i never said that i did however say make new tools that might beable to take over for local and even be better with local if you became skilled with it however you know what else i said i said that that would most likely take a lot of time and  effort to even come up with ideas for these tools you recieve no challenge from mining rocks in high sec so i dont do that okay that fine not every game play type is for everyone but clearly someone wanted to make it more exciting just look at the current changes to industry they made it hellova more challenging and more engaging but you know what else they did they made it so that that it still easy to access next i want to get something off my chest cause clearly you also know nothing about null sec local works for both the prey and the predator without local and no true tools to take over for local a predator will have to stop at each and every system that shows activity on the map in the last hour then take time to scan down that system and hope they are still therewhich they very as well might of moved on or not even be there and they have defender advantages you know something called safe spots though hey i know nothing about how null sec work so i clearly didnt know any of that information certain doesnt seem like im helping both sides well because i have noticed that you dont even read the entire subject you just take key subjects out of context and attack me thats fine just shows how much knowledge you have on how null sec works lol so you are looking at it from the point of view of a covops hauler you  right i am and my view seems to be more educational then your point of view of someone that i highly doubt that you even put your big toe into null sec let alone low secfinally so we arnt on board if your ideas of turning null in wh space clearly you still cant read and your lack of comprehension skills is starting to get frustrating once again i never said nuke local what i said was both local and cloak are broken but at the same time because they are broken they are balance what i said was that if you want to find ways to change cloak then you also have to look into ways of change local there is no if ands or butts you may now laugh due to the word butts hahahahahah with your next post in which you respond to my post if you do though i can already see the pattern you will please actually read not only all of this post but also all of the subjects that came before it
like whator are we supposed to just assume from you saying that that you must be right yes i understand you want to replace local with tools which would involve removing local as it currently exists and ends up with people performing tedious tasks just to get a level of intel high enough to do what they actually want to do its like having to play a game you hate to be able to play a game you like they change industry because it was mindnumbingly boring a whole bunch of repetitive clicks to accomplish simple tasks the ideas you put forward for effort based local this is putting in exactly what it is they removed with the industry changes they want people to spend more time actually playing the game and less time fiddling around with the ui to get there the scan probe changes were the same they started off that you had to manually fly around dropping probes around people then they moved it to draggable probes where you could drop more with skill now you can always drop 8 in predefined formations except the predator will not change they have to fly to systems with activity and scan as it currently stands to see if people are undocked and outside of a pos and no you seem to no nothing about how null works im wondering if you know how cloaking works too since you still seem to be acting as if a covert ops ship should be used as a tacklerdoes it seems like that would be an enormous no to me
lol the arrogance is overwhelming here you are in university or college right you still seem to have that obviously i know best attitude that kids tend to grow out of eventuallyand once again no they arent broken they just dont work the way you want them to i dont want to change cloaks and no if you were to change cloaks it could very easily be done without changing local again you just think they must be changed together and thats your opinion
didnt anyone tell you clearly hot dropping works exactly like a tackle ending sarcasm you seem to circle jerk the problem do you have a real opinion on the subject you just argue for argument sake how do you know the predator would not change you clearly are placing all the blame on one side and honestly are not thinking about both sides of the subject sad really im poking holes in your argument and you dont seem to like that you have no value to add to the subject anymore and i shall be ignoring any future post from you you have no clue how null works yourself you also seem to lack understanding in human nature please troll go to a different corner of the interwebs and cry there there is no use for you here
arrogance im sorry i didnt know simple fact was arrogance i am in college you will be correct there also as for my opinion you are right that is my opinion and just about everyone else as well i mean hell if you know how to use the search function you will see that every thread like this dies in roughly the same manner people demand change to afk cloaking because they cant find him or they got hot dropped other people say you cant change cloaking until you change local because cloak is the number one balance to local and the thread dies and a few days down the road a new one pops up and it continues that way over and over again this is why i keep telling people if you want to get something changed then you must be really  creative with the idea you are about to post
ive already said there is nothing wrong in changing it may be you have an actual proposal then or may be at least you want to share your vision of how exactly these connections between local and cloacking you are keep talking about work ie start to be constructive at last yea you made a good point i give you that like 3 or 4 times already i got it so everyone else did now what
now what i gave suggestion a while back it not something i can just whip out of my arse it something im willing to work with others to produce sadly i have a hard time working with others in threads because people comes along and says this is bad and starts trolling disrupting my work basically again ive said once before that if you want to create new intel tools you can to create intel tools that dont just target one group of players they must target all groups of players providing new ways of gathering information be it now this just an example nothing to be taken to  seriously have tools that work based off of your signal type and strength and have certain signal types be a counter for other signal types this is turn can bring in a new class of ships that are design purely to gather intel and a new job focus to gather said intel for example lets take the minmatar ships they tend to gravitate to the ladar sensor strength have it set so that higher your sensor strength is the easier it is to detect other ships around you and in the system with you however higher that strength is the easier it is for them to detect you as well so it will also give new fittings to have as small sensor strength as possible to stay hidden as possible of course the cost to that is that if you are captured ewarfare would wreck you set it up so that the ships can detect other ships using the same sensor type as them much easier to ships using a direct reverse sensor type from them are harder to detect i could give like detail stats on how it could work but i simply threw this idea out as an example something that targets more then just cloaks something that targets all of the player base as a whole
we arent only talking about hot dropping you are talking about flying cloakers around to find targets and i explained why the predator would not change go ahead and read itlol really not you are repeating yourself and when you get yourself lost you seem to just stop responding to what ive actually said and go off on a tangent you are yet to actually poke a hole in anything its not facts though its your opinion restated as if its gospel and generally its the same people its the same reused argument thats been around for years and its ridiculous and no you can very easily change one without the other you bang on about being creative yet you cant even separate those two mechanics
lol grow up in the real world mate people disagree with your ideas from time to time that doesnt automatically mean they are trolling and the fact that you dismiss valid arguments as trolling will not get you far in lifei see so you could give details but youd rather chuck out half an idea then complain that other people arent being creativeat the end ofthe day though your idea boils down to take something that works and replace it with a minigame which aside from being pointless would only really work for small groups of people and would fall to pieces when you had hundreds of people in a system
i want to note something to you regardless of your constant attacks and in fact adding no content on what happening you act like one of those people no i wouldnt even say people as that stereotyping but you seem like a person that just wants to argue for arguments sake you my friend are the classic example of a nullbear you want all of the reward but none of the risk that comes with the reward im sorry but that has to change the ability to gain reward without risk goes ageist everything this game stands for so i provided a suggestion that would increase risk for both sides you provided why predators wouldnt change i clearly disagree with you on that subject but instead of taking my disagreement with thoughtful action you called me someone that doesnt understand how null sec works now im sure a man of 15 years of something experience knows the ins and outs of how every single person lives their life in null sec despite the fact that each corporation technically has different goals they wish to achieve thus will perform and work differently from each other will be structured differently and have different set of rules i myself will make no claim that i understand every single aspect of null sec making such claim is ludicrous and i will not believe someone when they make such claims they do as for the im not poking holes in your argument what making it so hard to respond to you is because even after poking holes into your argument you just throw insults at me how does one argue with insults it pointless and your attempts to continue to throw insults at me arewellrelatively pointless its not facts it your opinion of course rightas for your response to for separating the mechanics yes you are right they are two different mechanics but they kinda go hand to hand with each other i do bang on creativity and game design but hey i have yet to see you listen or you know provide any creative suggestions again the statement still stands if you want to change cloak then you have to change local there is really nothing else to argue about with that topicas for the real world i think you need a reality check yes people will disagree with ideas and im perfectly fine with that it when people disagree with ideas then proceed to insult said person is the part that in reality that will most likely land you without a job specially if you do it to your boss or have a law suit placed on you if you are the boss and other questions about reality that i need to bring you up to speed with as someone that not only goes to college but also works to help put themselves through college oh and finally the last thing oh i want to chew you threw with that comment were you interested in that topic and did i make you mad when i chucked it out did you even read the first part of that post after all i did say that making new intel tools isnt something that one can do at the drop of the hat and expect people to be nice and receptive about it hell look at your response to it you didnt even look at the possibility of said new intel tool you just scream about how it wont work if you have hundreds of people in a system yet i never fully fleshed it out i only provided it as an example to someone that asked now what something to build off of something you didnt do now can you stop derailing this thread and maybe do something useful with your time here i dont know maybe provide a suggestion of your own mr i know how all of null sec works so im the only real authority hereyou call me arrogant yet in turn you make yourself look just as arrogant it funny really
again id ask you to point out where all i have is a different opinion to you you seem to think im trolling and attacking when i dont agree with you thats just simply not the case i think your ideas are ill thought out narrow minded and would be damaging to the game as a whole thats not an attack thats a simple statement of my opinion on the matterexcept theres plenty of risk already an interceptor is now fast enough to catch all but the most prepared of pve players and cannot be slowed down by the usual methods null pve is far from risk free and provides a low enough income that many people stick with lowrisk highsec and no your change wouldnt increase risk for both sides at most an afk cloaker would be able to be caught an active cloaker would still be able to evade as effectively as anyone else can but would rarely be seen comingactually i called you out on lacks of knowledge of nullsec before that and was right about it since you have barely a working knowledge of null you fly a hauler though it thats your entire experience with nullill ask again though currently a cloaker finds activity on the map flies to the system and dscans the system to see if a ship is undocked and out of a pos under your idea the cloaker would find activity on the map fly to a system and dscan the system to see if a ship is undocked and out of a pos how is that any different local is irrelevant to a predator right now since it doesnt tell them if they are a feasible target or untouchable since youd be able to see how many people were in system you wouldnt even lose the ability to quickly spot empty systemsthen stop trying to make suggestions which would fundamentally alter nullsec at a core level if you dont understand nullsec you have no right to make suggestions on changing it and lets face it its not just that you dont know all of nullsec you dont understand even the basic facts about people that live in nullsec have you even considered how your ideas would work with hundreds of players in a system thousands try probing out a specific ship in a populated system and youll understand why being able to scan people out would be less than useless in those situations and thats just the beginning look at all of the things people do in nullsec beyond fly covert ops hauler from a to b and it becomes much more complex lol except i havent insulted you ive questioned your knowledge and rightly so but rather than respond to actual points youve basically just said nope and supposedly thats poking holes in things
they dont have to go hand in hand like at all they are totally separate mechanics and again ill make this clear i dont want to change cloaks i think they work well as is which is evidences by their constant usewell youll need to grow some thicker skin if youve been taking these responses as insults at the end of the day ive explained pretty clearly why i think not only your ideas but the basis of your ideas is flawed and yet you just repeat yourself ans say and these are the facts as if thats suddenly going to make you less wrong you need to take a step back and realistically look at the situation you are putting forward a fundamental mechanic change which negatively affects a large group of people which you are not part of while positively affecting you and you are refusing to even consider another viewpoint worse still you consider your admittedly limited knowledge to be the facts this doesnt even make sense to me is this a response to me or someone elseand no i dont look at the possibility of a new intel tool since theres absolutely no point in turning a working mechanic into a minigame so gankers can gank more and pve players have to do more work just to be allowed to have funmy suggestion leave cloaking and local alone and focus on the real problems of nullsec sov mechanics favouring massive coalitions forming and force projection allowing groups to operate on all sides of nullsec with little effort
clearly your ability to read sarcasm is quite low maybe you train it up a few levels come back another time when you level it to i dont know level 1 maybe im sure all you need to do spend at least an hour in the real world that you claim i know nothing about hahahahahahaha
is this supposed to make some kind of sense or is this just a standard derailment post since you picked out the single paragraph which had nothing to do with the topic of this thread and ignored everything elsei accept your concession of defeat
sure im fine with that if your entire goal was for me to admit defeat world i admit defeat to a internet tough guy take note this person was only interested in defeating some random name found on the screen his goal was in fact not to provide anything useful to this thread at all he set out on a mission and accomplished it now doesnt that sound childish
maria dragoon wrotenow doesnt that sound childish lets see you state your opinion i disagree and state my opinion you ignore what i wrote and restate your opinion with the word fact dotted about i once again disagree and call you out on it you cant figure out how to respond ignore most of what i said and implode with rageyep sounds pretty childish to me maybe next time you might want to consider that opinions that dont align with yours arent trolling and perhaps you wont implode so spectacularly i guess the only upside is you are only embarrassing your disposable forum alt
lucas kell wrotemaria dragoon wrotenow doesnt that sound childish lets see you state your opinion i disagree and state my opinion you ignore what i wrote and restate your opinion with the word fact dotted about i once again disagree and call you out on it you cant figure out how to respond ignore most of what i said and implode with rageyep sounds pretty childish to me maybe next time you might want to consider that opinions that dont align with yours arent trolling and perhaps you wont implode so spectacularly i guess the only upside is you are only embarrassing your disposable forum altimplode with rage you bore me you are boring how many times do i have to say it your opinions they are looped logical fallacies i try to keep atrack of things while you keep attempting to derail hell even the thread owner called you out what more am i suppose to do continue your infinite loop of logical fallacies
lol then point out where they are logical fallacies you keep saying how wrong my opinions are yet when asked for specifics you suddenly cant its because you are talking bullshit and anyone reading this thread can see that basically you are upset because you want to nuke nullsec a place you dont live and occasionally visit and someone with actual working knowledge of null who has lived and breathed nullsec for years has called your idea out for being badly thought out from other angleslets face it though if i bored you youd not be here crying every few minutesand the owner also statedsomething you seem unwilling to drop
proof you didnt read the thread either look at the front guess what else it says so yes a new system is required hey i totally agree with him on that point crying about what want me to point out some of your logical fallacies sure here we go lets dive into the world of fallacies starting with the slippery slope fallacy this fallacy states that if a happens then z will happen as well thus we must prevent a from happening let me quote a few of yours this is a slippery slope fallacy because you assume that in my defense of changing how local works without even provided any infromation on how i migh suggest the change that it will become tedious that is a slipperly slope fallacy as you have no proof that if a happens removal of local and replaced with real and good intel tools that z will happen it will be tedious moving on lets pick another fallacy for you this is a strawman fallacy you have purposely misrepresented my argument which through the use of break quoting to make my statement easier to attack this is called a strawman fallacy never once did i suggest a covops ship would be used as a tackler lets grab another one i want to see how many different types of fallacies you commit this is another fallacy we like to call it the composition fallacy we are talking about two mechanics that are not just including in null sec but also a wide range of different other systems however you assume that because that one part is most strongly represented in null sec that it applies to all of null sec the core of null sec you will this fallacy is also the hardest to explain so let me take a direct quote for you the fallacy of composition arises when one infers that something is true of the whole from the fact that it is true of some part of the whole or even of every proper part for example this fragment of metal cannot be fractured with a hammer therefore the machine of which it is a part cannot be fractured with a hammer this is clearly fallacious because many machines can be broken apart without any of those parts being able to be fractureddo you really want me to continue
lol i cant help it if he changes his mind i quoted him directly go ahead and look on the previous page thats not a slippery slope fallacy at all do you even understand the meaning of that or did you just look at the graphic read the wikipedia page and guess it must be a fallacy you want to replace local with an effort based mechanic which will have the sole purpose of generating the intel that is currently available it wont be integrated into the existing gameplay it and yes it will be a tedious activity its not a slippery slope fallacy to point out the direct result of a given change wrong again i didnt misrepresent anything i simply stated that the predator activity would not change i also pointed out that the steps you claimed a cloaker would need to to are the steps of a tackler wrong again lovely i claimed that it would fundamentally damage the whole of nullsec at no point did i claim that nullsec would be the only part of the game affected i am simply challenging your idea from the point of view of null sec if a lowsec player wants to come in and represent their views they can but i wont because unlike you i accept that a lowsec player knows lowsec i know nullsec so will represent only that view from a nullsec perspective your idea is terrible go ahead though and try to convince us all you were really aiming this at lowsec you can if you want college kids are funny youll pretty much scream fallacy at everything said against you regardless of if it contextually makes sense and the result of your hilarious screaming is what it doesnt suddenly make your terrible idea any better
the post in the devblog on burner missionsmike i agree with you on the whole stable concept and raise you one noctis for those of us with an ocd type need to loot and salvage most everything problem is moving that stable if you end up locking up your local agent is a nightmare how many round trips should we have to do to run missionsmy idea for you to broach to the devs is for a combat transport based on the orca 2530k m3 cargo hold for holding ammo fittings and loot ship maintenance bay large enough to fit 1 bs 1 noctis and enough space for a few frigates no ore hold or fleet hold needed since the ship wont be used for boosting the typical slot layout should give enough options for tank skill bonuses should go towards speed and tank and maybe even combat ability to fight of gank attemptsto use your words is it an extra expense yes but one i am willing to pay for some variety well at least a change of scenerythe floor is now open for accolades suggestions criticizms
dammit dont make me find the ever so excellent concept already proposed and supported by me called the tugboat this idea does not just benefit missioneers but also incursion runners who also like to move stables from ranch to ranchi suppose gankers would like it as well just sayinmedit link
remove ice from highsec problem solved
a lot of good that did you
election seasonyou started that for yourself when you said you were running for 10
dear ccpcould you please implement isboxing in eve onlineccp is not going to act against the use of isboxingso if ccp is not acting against isboxing they should just implement it please let me control 10 characters with one click it will help prevent rsiso if ccp does not implement the use of isboxing they might be held accountable for causing rsi
theres lots of things that ccp doesnt implement that other things do jabber pings and consolidated interregional market data for example theres no responsibility on their part to provide you with that functionality themselves so your choices are multibox manually multibox with a mutliboxing program dont multiboxby the way its not called isboxing its called multiboxing isboxer is a single product which aids multiboxing and you can get it here

1 plex per neural remap would be expensive i would like to be able to convert a yearly remap or a bonus remap into an item and sell it on the market though i dont think you should be able to convert to the ones you start off with
this proposal will cover two interconnected subjects1 sov mechanics2 ratting participant expansionbefore i go on about sov mechanics the topic of individual system player capacity needs to be addressedone of the main reasons sov holders haveneed so many systems is that they need them if they have a larger number of players in their organization currently only a handful of players can be optimally supported pve wise in a single system this causes an alliance to need quite a few systems to support their large group of players optimally this is why this topic needs to be addressed before one can even look at changing sov mechanicsso it has been established that the number of optimally supported players per system needs to be increased what doas i see it there are two different options to accomplish this1 an increase in the number of optimal anomalies in a given system2 create a new type of anomaly that optimally expands with an increase of participantsi believe a combination of the two may be in order first a system may be full of optimal anomalies for individuals or small groups to complete however when an anomaly has too many players in it the rats in the anomaly will receive reinforcements from the other anomalies not currently in use also the rats may call upon the local belt rats as reinforcements which would cause any faction or officer spawns to join the fightall of this would need to be balanced out with server performance of course perhaps the number of optimal anomalies could be viewed as the optimal player saturation pointi view this as an optimal solution to individual system player density this may cause larger alliances to need less space to support their playersalso fun additions could be made to this system as in ways to increase rat bountyquality by adding the option to offer various items to local rats to make them more dangerous and valuable give them a web or ecm mod they just might use it against you and othersnow that topic 2 has been addressed it is time to move on to the true topic sov mechanicsjust like the previous topic i believe a simple and robust solution is in order to change things for the betterso what is the basic breakdown of current sov mechanicsthe answer to this is that current sov mechanics revolve around structures and arbitrary timers as to when confrontation will take place so as to decide ownership of a system this allows for players to play the system by using such structures and arbitrary timers to their advantage i believe the solution to this situation to be fairly simple instead of sov revolving around structures it should revolve around player activity in a system in other words you must use a system to own it i believe the only activity suitable to this would be ratting pve in the old system this would have been seen as monotonous but given the previous topic this could be seen more as a battle than basic ratting as for the subject of arbitrary timers the new system should be arbitrary in the current system timers are used as waiting periods and at the very end of the waiting period hostilities can commence this just wont do for the new systemthe new system will have a simple one week timer within which the two or more opposing parties may compete for a system by actively suppressing the local rat faction when an opposing alliance wishes to compete for a system they must first enter the system and begin suppressing the local rat faction after committing this act the competing alliance will be asked if it wishes to formally compete against the owning alliance for ownership of the system if the competing alliance accepts then the battle begins for ownership of the system which will be determined at the end of the week long timerthe various structures in a system will keep their arbitrary timers and will be disconnected from sov mechanics altogether you will no longer have to take the station first to take the system upon claiming of a system by a new alliance all sov dependent structures will cease to provide their function cyno jammers jump bridges etc and all sov upgrade timers will be reset
this is definitely the first time this has been suggested honestand the issue is still the same group a blobs and camps group b out of their system see the problem with this idea in all the hundreds of times its been raised is that it assumes the the current sov holders first off wouldnt be able to keep up their activity and secondly that they would be too preoccupied with ratting in their own systems that they couldnt come beat up the little guysif this came in the bigger coalitions could simply rat on their own hub systems leaving pipe systems unclaimed and periodically go and smash out one of the little guys claims to sov in other regions anyone trying to claim one of the unclaimed pipe systems would be committing logistical suicide by setting up an actual home therejust a hint mate the reason this subject has been an outstanding issue for such a long time is because its a massively complex situation with a lot of mechanics which will require consideration if you are ever thinking about a solution and your sentence starts with the solution is simple then you should probably just throw that idea in the bin as its not going to work and will be a repeat of a previous simple idea someone put forward
what is the best way to handle a long term cloaked hostile who may or may not be afkpossible options1 a grid buoy like a proximity alarm it notices when something passes through its energy field should a cloaked vessel cross this threshold an alarm goes offmethod a penetration contact with no corresponding signature on gridoptions could have a counter that spoofs itoptions could be an energized particle field that like a nebulae cloud disrupts a cloak passing through it the character trying to use it for protection would need to see the new name on overview before the hostile cloaked againwould a sacrifice be needed here would this require a trade off2 hunter probe launch probe and it begins to take ping style energy burst readingsit would eventually isolate a grid with a hostile on it but be unable to narrow down the location furtherthere is a cloaked ship there somewhere nearby the value here is that you also know where it is not locatedoptions possible to have the probe emit an alarm should the cloaked ship change speed or course or go into warpit may not be able to pinpoint the ship but it can detect the more obvious changes in emissions signaling active navigation eventsoptions the probe may have a limited life expectancy and require periodic replacement in order to maintain this coverage how often and would it need to reestablish a brand new search are balance points3 the hunting module linked in my signature this one is a mirror image for requirements based off the covops  regular cloak itself it is intended to require equal effort to use as the cloak it seeks to locatethis module would be capable of fully hunting the cloaked ship so would trivialize cloaking if local advertised a cloaked presence as freely as it does nowoptions have it unable to pinpoint the cloaked ship the same as the hunter probe above this would tie up an account the same as the cloaked player does in order to counter the cloaked playerdo any of these sound promisingupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
with the addition of the prospect and more ore anomalies in low sec i would like to see the trend of more ships to mine in hostile environments continue by adding a t2 miasmos increase the power grid to where the nereus is at so you can fit a 10mn mwd and use the mwdcloak trick add a high slot and remove the turret hard points and give it the ability to use 2 warfare links and room to fit them as far as requirements and other bonuses i am not sure if its cost were similar to other t2 industrials around 200 million isk then it would be much more viable in hostile space than an orca and it would fulfill the role of boosting mining and hauling ore somewhere else
take a look at the support tug thread i posted mate im sure it wouldnt be too far a cry to allow it to have a loaded industrial on board but thatd be up to ccpi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
cool so it looks like i am not the only one thinking about thisas for having a loaded industrial not sure ccp would go near that i could easily see a player packing as many fully loaded miasmos as possible and using the thing to haul ore using the same restrictions as the orca seems more likelyjust having one blinged out incursion runner in the bay will make the thing a freaking loot pinata hence the need to give it reasonable tank and maybe light combat capability or people will never use itnow for the important questionmike can you sell the idea
not to put words in mikes mouth as i cant account for what he says in closed forums but he supports it also a buddy of mine who helped come up with the idea behind this ship has spoken to other members of the csm who also liked the concept patience and faith will keep this going if you want to help pass the thread about it around and help garner it supporti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
the issue being that they bearly do effect each other apart from the ob in certain game modes and a measly bonus to fw fw pilots have no real reason to use dust mercs
while i dont think isboxer is an issue like at all i think ice spawns could be changed slightly to be a bit more entertaining and a side effect would be marginally decreasing the effectiveness of large isboxer fleets the idea would be to randomly spawn the ice belts instead of them being located in the same system every time the timers would remain the same just the anomaly would spawn somewhere random within the regions of that sec status that contain that type of ice so a caldari ice in otela might be depleted and respawn in ekura after the 4 hour timer the amount of ice in the anomaly would vary based on security status of the systemi think that would make ice mining a little more involved a little less predictable would create variance in supply due to the security status affecting the total volume and as a side effect would make it harder for the larger multiboxers as they would need to move around a massive fleet if they wanted to chase ice which is not as easy as you might think

thread closed
i dont have the numbers but it would be interesting to know how many people pay for alt acounts rather than use isk if ccp would lose money by stopping isboxing then i dont see it stopping
 the point of eve online is for it to make revenue if it didnt it would be a waste of running their servers on yea the prices are lower than they are supposed to be im certain we all agree you should be buying 1 unit of tritanium for at least 50isk not 5isk per unit thats what you get with people multiboxing industry chars the price of materials and consequentially everything built from them dropswhen you next blow up your t1 frigate and laugh at measly 5mil isk price you lost imagine how it would be if the price was 5x higher
this is definitely the first time this has been suggested honestyes i know this isnt the first time this has come upand the issue is still the same group a blobs and camps group b out of their systemblobing is always an effective strategy no matter what mechanic one might implement however how long the blob lasts is another storysee the problem with this idea in all the hundreds of times its been raised is that it assumes the the current sov holders first off wouldnt be able to keep up their activitythis mechanic assumes they will if they want to keep their territory however if they have an extensive number of systems they might be spreading themselves too thing to repel small groups over longer periodsand secondly that they would be too preoccupied with ratting in their own systems that they couldnt come beat up the little guysof course this is not assumed and it would be required of them to beat up the little guys if they wish to maintain their territory and again it is questionable that an alliance would be able to effectively do so over a prolonged time whilst having a large territory unlike the previous two systems structure grinding and blob fights are not required whatsoever this allows evasion and guerilla tactics to be effective strategies to gain territoryif this came in the bigger coalitions could simply rat on their own hub systems leaving pipe systems unclaimedlikelyand periodically go and smash out one of the little guys claims to sov in other regionsif by periodically you mean on a daily basis every week an alliance attempts to contest sov in various systemsanyone trying to claim one of the unclaimed pipe systems would be committing logistical suicide by setting up an actual home thereperhaps and perhaps not as one can not be sure what the future holds in terms of logisticsjust a hint mate the reason this subject has been an outstanding issue for such a long time is because its a massively complex situation with a lot of mechanics which will require consideration or it is the fact ccp has yet to pool resources towards creating a new system as they are still balancing some other things out first before getting back to sov mechanics when they say they are ready to come up with new mechanics the real debate will begin if you are ever thinking about a solution and your sentence starts with the solution is simple then you should probably just throw that idea in the bin as its not going to work and will be a repeat of a previous simple idea someone put forwardjust because a solution is simple does not mean it will not work also its the simplest solutions that are often the most robust making a solution complex can lead to opportunities for manipulation and exploitation apparently there were too many quotes so i just used quotation marks
well im not going to be running quote out but i think you underestimate how much activity a null coalition busts out at the moment we stick to handfuls of systems but only because we dont need to spread out should we need to spread out it wouldnt be difficult to dorequiring activity in a system isnt some magic bullet to resolving the issues all it does is make it easier for people to do without having to have a confrontation and the thing is its easier for a big group to stop a little group being able to run that activity that it is the other way around the end result would be that big coalitions and rental groups have the best sov while small groups are constantly losing and having to reacquire sov in the handful of systems they can get tothe only way to change sov that that the little guys stand a chance is to reduce the effectiveness of force projection and make holding more sov increasingly detrimental
there have been many good suggestions in this thread although it is getting quite lengthy several have taken form of proposals this big deal with most is how to change things to where one side or the other does not get an overwhelming advantage now as to local as explained by ccp and chronicles every pod pilot and ship has a becon similar to the little black boxes on modern jets now concord uses these to find and monitor everything from sec status to aggressive combat and respond accordingly thus local now in every suggestion about changing local has included adding a new form in intelligence gathering system whether automatic or active by player this new intel system has been tied to finding cloaked ships the effect of local on cloaky is that you know he is there in the submarine analogy basicly the cloak does not block the black box thus giving intel that a pilot is in a given system just not his location or ship type past that there is no relation to local and this thread as i have time i plan to go through post by post and make a summery of all the suggestions for changes to the cloaked vrs pve i will post it here at the end of the thread and in the front once i have done that i would hope that those interested would just discuss the pros and cons of the suggestions not get hung up on other mechanics and whether or not they should changei thank everyone for their efforts and time in this thread
i know theres a sort by last updated option but on occasion ive had a number of current open tickets and i noted the strange deviation from the standard threaded or otherwise messaging system it should just be consistent like bolding the lines in the my support tickets window
well maybe they should fix that provide feed back numbers man numbers provide proof ectra
guilty as chargedi had no clue this thread existed when i came up with my own similar concept there are a lot of good ideas here that even i didnt consider
i do have a new suggestionthis is not to take away from the excellent work on the proposed four racial variants but depending on ccp dev thinking a single race tug might or might not be an easier sellsince it cant be ore for all the reasons already mentioned why not soe they are very much involved in exploration and mission running which are some of the people who will use it or as a secondary possibility couldnt concord feel a need to release a ship in order to help combat sansha incursions along with piracy from all the other pirate nations
soe would not directly get involved with the production of a vessel which would be utilized to transport war ships they are one of those entities that likes to maintain their neutrality as for concord they have had bad experiences with capsuleers and would not want to run the risk of allowing movement of war ships en masse in a transport shippersonally i believe they would be best suited to be produced by each racial faction as each race would seek to have a vessel better suited to hauling their unique ship designs and shapes and they would most likely run with a corporation that has an industrial background that could benefit from building things for military application i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
on a personal level i have no issues with where you are coming from i much prefer the four racial variants as it will not make us jump through hoops to obtain onei made my suggestions to give the devs an option that requires far less design and coding work 1 ship is far less work than 4 and therefore may make it easier to get them on board once we have them on board and behind the idea then there is nothing wrong with using lore issues to get the racial versions out of them
to save some work they could even utilize modified freighter hull models as a starting point and then tweak them to make them uniquei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
introduce a new company maby trying to wedge themselves into the ship building business in the freighter department the support tug acts as the flagship of their product line with a couple of modified freighters to round out their sales catalog each with its own faction bonuses  no idea what the other freighters would be geared toward though 
also a good suggestion secondary product could be jumpcapable variants or make a modular exploration platform ship which could effectively serve as a mobile command post which could improve life for wormhole dwellers or dedicated explorersi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i understand that a coalitionalliance can put out a lot of activity in a given time however i dont think they will be able to effectively keep their current territories even with the activity you espouse also i wouldnt call 32 systems a handful and thats just the alliance you are apart of in the new system it would be even easier to spread out as you dont have to deal with arbitrary timers anymore and you would be able to expand in a more natural fashion over timethe main issue seems to be blobing which will always be an effective strategy in terms of fighting ones enemy but it usually is used temporarily during battle and not for prolonged periods and yes a larger group will be able to stop a smaller groups activities and really that will always be the case given both groups have similar knowledge or skill indeed larger groups of active players would be able to keep a greater number of systems also there may be a case for changing how truesec works as for determining a systems quality the only thing that could reduce the effectiveness of force projection would be to remove jump drives and jump bridges from the game entirely anything else is just adding to the cost of force projection which is not a detriment to the larger coalitions due to their deeper pockets as they have stated before as for making sov increasingly detrimental i dont think that should be the case if you are talking about just making it more advantageous to not hold sov than to do so there wouldnt be need for sov mechanics if such was the case now if you are talking about making it exponentially more costly as you gain more space then that is also foolhardy as others have already explained if one implements such a system it is easy to get around as a sov holding entity can split itself up in order to mitigate the exponential effect remember the main points of activity based sov are1 no more structure grinding for sov2 no more arbitrary timers3 blobbing no longer necessary 4 a more organic sov system for a more organic nullsec5 greater group bondagecohesion the idea exists to make sov better and not to somehow prevent blobsblobs will always be there if people wish to use such tacticsperhaps it will be less effective in the future but that requires significant changes to pvp in generali still want something at least similar to empress jamyl sarums super weapon created by the terrans but i could just settle for more remote aoe weapons and modules
no 32 systems isnt a handful but what i mean is currently we dont use probably half of those systems at least for anything other than passing though but only because we dont need to under an activity based system holding those wouldnt be a challenge so what would you expect to change rental space would be kept active by renters so its not like wed need to go there and grind rats short of making the activity bar so high that it excluded small groups anyway you simply wouldnt be able to demand enough activity to push the blobs outso how would yoru solution resolve any of the issues people have with sov other than not grinding structures there seems to be no benefit to the changes and in fact adds a new bar of entry to sov space or having to have ratters in your alliance which not all alliances haveor reducing the range that they can operate and add time between jumps right now you can go across the entire universe in a few minutes so theres nothing to discourage people dominating both ends of the universe if it took you an hour or two to get across it would encourage people to cluster upindeed they could split up to hold the space though that makes it more difficult to run 1 and 2 pretty much the same thing and while it is positive to me as it would mean less grind ops it would also mean that larger groups have less boring stuff to do to bully people out of their space wed just need to turn up ratting and ganking3 while they wouldnt be required mechanically theyd still be required to defeat the opposite teams blob4 im not really sure about that youre just replacing grinding a static structure with grinding red crosses5 not really sure how the idea would change that at all
double post i hate the eve forums
ah i found it i would like to leave this here
i suggest putting the multiple character training feature in the new eden store and having it cost 12 the aurum value of a plexit doesnt make much sense to have it be more expensive for people actually paying to train 2 characters on one account especially when having a character on a second account is both more useful and cheaper or the same price if you are using plexim new but i dont see any true downside to this i am not paying for a second character training slot because of this fact if it was i might pay for 1 or even both of my characters to be able to trainfor anyone saying it encourages things like gankers or using alts  you cant be on both characters at the same time it actually encourages such things by making it more monetarily sensible to have multiple accountson a slight aside i played eve during retribution briefly but it was painfully inaccessible features such as safety the mission drop down menus isis tooltips on the aggress timer and certificates all show that ccp wants to make the game more accessible we all want new blood whether its to gank foster exploit or just because youre tired of everyone elses ugly mug this would in my opinion be a small but important step to making the pricing scheme more available to new playersit is also well shown that the more someone has invested in something the less willing they are to stop investing in it and cut their losses so the more appealing and smaller charges should help new players buy further in to the game faster and make them less willing to leavelook at how successful power of 2 wasthats all interested to hear opinions on this and sorry if my noob speak was painful
no for all the reasons it was no beforeits a niche productit does not remove cheaper choices you already have availableit actually costs less initiallymultiple training was never meant to replace existing choices it is what it is and should remain the same pricedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
though i feel that jita local needs some kind of control i donUFFFDt like tradeable blocklists idea itself is good but i have seen it already been used wrong one day one person made list put it on internet and traded it first free then she asked isks for it which is not problem problem was that she put many honest traders in that list including one of my alts yes yes how many honest traders there is in local heh anyway and it really harmed marketing as there was no way to correct things as being blockedso i believe that tradeable blocklists can become just tool to manipulate and block persons out of chat even without their knowingreal scammers just make new character but if you are honest played with toon long time it really hurts if you canUFFFDt use it on local anymoreit is very easy to block just use that and make your own decisions
based on the tone of his response i am willing to believe he supports this behind closed doorsi think that the burner mission concept from ccp opens the door for the idea of a tug considering one of the main complaints against burners is that most lvl4 mission runners do not always have easy access to a frigate now that i have your link i will happily add it to any posts i make where it would apply
well now i dont understand ccp anymorepeople that died to a character using isbox have their ships reimbursedso what is ccps position on this
citation needed
that does not at all sound like something that would be abused to hell and back if it was even remotely true unless were talking about some kind of rookie protection
sov should not be conquered by shooting npc rats that is terrible while im a huge fan of occupancy altering sov i think it needs a balanced approach we already have a military index for shooting npcs and an industrial index for mining use them to measure system activity then add some additional indexes for pvp player ships destroyed in a system and for logistics jumps intoout of a system these cover the 4 basic flying in space activities and we can add more if we want take the average rounded down of all system indexes that involve flying in space and that is the number of rf timers your ihub will have remove owning the station from the taking a system equation if you dont own the system your station is vulnerable now well have lots of systems with no rf timers on their ihub so their system can be directly attacked reduce the online time for sbus 5 minutes and reduce the ehp of sov structures to 10 of current and suddenly system claims can be quickly destroyed if the system isnt being used creative defining of the pvp and logistic index will prevent abuse of these indexes too ie these could be based on ships killedjumping per hour with a cap on how many ships destroyed andor jumps committed in an hour one of the design goals should be to have pilots flying in space as much as possible and pvping should count just as much as shooting red crosses
i dont agree with this i will now quote you a reason why
i love a good storyas a writer i can easily recognize an arbitrary backstory element like thisi have no doubts ccp can modify the explanation for why local is not available to everyone just concord in regards to this quasi intel functionlike concord ships it gives too much of an advantageupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
yes some of the devs have for years in fact yet it still doesnt change why because it would be commercial suicide to take a fully working feature and nuke it for one of your biggest market groups theres simply not enough benefit to changing it to make it worthwhile the only group that would benefit are people who like to hunt pve players in null in cloaky ships which sorry to say is a small group which offers little in the way of incomeyou can say that but it doesnt make it true there are ways to change each without affecting the other you just arent willing to consider them
i have noted your opinion many times that you refuse to consider anything that would represent a change to the current game mechanics in this contextyou state you believe that far more strictly farming style pve players exist than farm  fight style pve playersbut your line about commercial suicide to take a fully working feature and nuke it for one of your biggest market groups that really does assume far more than we have reason to believeto begin with fully working if the quoted devs are against it and hoping to find alternatives that makes it improvised or simply a workaround at bestyou dont look for a replacement to a system that meets your needs exactly the way you envisioned which i feel should be the implied meaning for fully working in this contextupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
mmm the fact that you cant accept the fact that maybe it is broken and even a dev agrees that the system needs a rework is it a commercial suicide well i have to agree with nick on this now arnt you the one assuming a little to much do you have proof that this will be commercial suicide or is that let me quote and again if it was fully working feature why does said dev agree that they want to take away the intel feature of local they want to keep it as a chat channel not an intel one once again i think your assuming that it will only benefit hunters of pve characters which is a blunt lie if intel part of the channel is removed and real tools are put in place as a replacement thus players have to do work then those pvp players will have to do just the same if not more work then the pve players as with null sec not only do you have defender advantage you know the person that has all their gear in the system extra fits of ships for different hostiles that you can change right off the bat for and far quicker then if someone that is wandering into your system will beable to do short of bringing an entire logistic force with them and if they have an entire logistics force with them and im pretty sure they are out to do more damage then to eat one or two pve bots that are camping around in a belt i dont know if you forgotten this but eve online is a pvp focused game the more chances that pvp will happen the better eve the pve is technically pvp as your corp will still be competing with other alliances and corps to hold that slice of heaven market games are pvp as you have to compete with other players and ectra as for consider changing one without changing the other taking them into consideration sure ive seen many change suggestions by other players most of them targeting cloaks and in turn makes their system safer for them with them while in turn allowing them to do less work im sorry maybe i dont agree with your mind set that null sec you know the most dangerous section of space is suppose to be safer then high sec i out right think this mindset should be change null sec should be the lawless wild west where the players are the one that must do the work to make the laws and do the work to enforce said laws i guess we have different mind sets for each other you may disagree that eve online is a pvp focused game while i look at it as a pvp focused game hell take a look at the recent fan fest their dream is by some point make everything constructed and destructible to the player base
i have no problem with the idea of changing some mechanics about but local is simply not one of them i dont see the benefit in taking a system which has worked for so long and stamping on it just because some gankers want easier kills especially when it would mean a complete revamp of 20 other systems at the same timeand yes in null more farm pilots exist than farm  fight especially since theres very rarely anything that qualifies as a fight people get ganked theres no fighting involved if local were removed and replaced with some other system that would not change people would simply have to do more prerequisite stuff just to get a chance to play the part of the game they like how about we add in a pve minigame before people are allowed to online their turretspvp players are always happy to force pve players to have to play their way but would flip out if the tables were turnedyes the quoted devs are against it and much like how some devs were for wis and some devs were for loot spew that doesnt mean change and it doesnt mean its the only dev opinion officially ccp have made no remarks about it only a couple of devs stating their personal views the fact of the matter is that local was designed the way it works and it has worked that way for a long time you cant say its broken just because you like it its not a bug its a feature that was written into the gamei dont look for a replacement because i dont see any benefit in changing it beyond making it easier for cloakers to sneak up on people i wouldnt consider that as a positive change
thats because it isnt broken you seem to misunderstand that word you not liking a system doesnt mean it is broken it works as it was designed to work ergo it is not brokenas ive said above a dev not agreeing with it does not mean its broken it doesnt even mean it will change its a dev not the whole of ccp there are plenty of devs that have had ideas which dont make the cut in the game you guys claw pretty hard at the couple of quotes from years ago where lone devs have stated their opinions yet it hasnt changed why because its a bad ideatotal an utter bullshit pve players will need to know if there are hostile players around gankers will not the only thing a ganker will need to do is exactly what they do now they will need to fly to a system with activity and dscan it to see if the pilots are in space and out of pos shields let me say again for clarity exactly like they do nowyes the advantage of sitting in a ship incapable of fighting a pvp fit ship and what you want to do is take away their ability to see people coming so by the time they realise they are in trouble its too late to reacti didnt forget that because its not true eve is a sandbox game a virtual universe its no more pvp focused than it is pve focused in fact the nosy gamer recently had a couple of blog posts about this very subjectat the end of the day you want there to be more pvp so you are happy to take away other peoples choices to play the way they like to achieve that some people like to pve some like to pvp some like a mix all valid choices you deciding that theres not enough pvp involved in the pve aspects of the game means less than nothinglol im not sure which part of this is the most wrong the part where you misrepresent my views or the part where you subscribe to the moronic notion that space should be tiered from high through to null newsflash null is not and was not designed to be the most lawless of space its a place where players can own the space and nothing more it was not designed to turn the game into a three tiered system with highsec at the top end and null sec at the lowestthe funny thing is though nullsec players do make the laws and do enforce the laws in null they just do so efficiently enough that you pee your pants and cry like a little girl about it at the end of the day your ideas wouldnt make the game more fun it wouldnt add entertainment it would simply add work i dont disagree that there should be more play in the system more destruction and creation more player control but nuking local and giving gankers an easy time isnt going to do that
an opinion is something that lacks a foundation of provable aspects with which to verify it withit is most commonly associated with statements that may be sincerely held but lack this foundation otherwiseyou can say local is not broken and should therefore remain untouchedwe have no proof of this point claiming it as a fact fails since this test cannot establish a foundation for ita developer does post public comments as quoted above citing an interest to have options to replace this withcan you give us anything solid to support your argument beyond statements which we cannot provide a foundation forthe only statements we have from ccp either admit we have local right now admission of status quo is not meaningful but observational for context or point out they want something betterit could be equally pointed out that any game aspect for which a better replacement can be found is therefore suspect and should be consideredyour effective response that it should not be considered needs something stronger than we are showing in favor of thiscan you help us on this pointupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
its your opinion and the opinion of a developer that it should not work in the way it currently does that does not make it broken perhaps you need to take a look at the definition of the word the mechanic as it is works exactly to the specification of which it was designed you not liking that design does not mean its brokenthe only statements you have from ccp are also personal statements from those individual developers they do not represent the view of the whole of ccp the fact that the game still has local in its current form is evidence enough that theres no serious push to change it within ccpbetter being the operative word you want better for gankers but that doesnt mean better all round ccp want better for business and spitting in the face of pve players probably isnt a wise decision in that regardmy response is that it works as is and that any change that leads off with remove local and yes a replacement to local leads off with that would be detrimental to the game it is simply too much work for very little gain and has too many negative consequencesi dont need anything stronger since like in the past several years of a handful of gankers whining about it its never going to change it would simply be too damaging to simply remove a whole segment of players to support some cloaky gankers and you and a burnable alt arent going to suddenly change that even if you do try to put forward ludicrous claim that you are in fact fighting for the side of more fun pve by making gankers lives easier
i am sorry lucas but i am not representing gankersnor am i pushing to give these types of players undue advantage as you seem to implyyour continued claims that this will mysteriously benefit hostiles in space foreign to them perhaps is one of the points that would need clarificationcould you please address thesehow does a ganker know a target is specifically present in order to be huntedare you using the game map for recent activity here or could you be implying awoxxers provide this to themwhy would the intel channel not be significant in granting local forces an advantageare you suggesting players do not change or adapt and would not be expected to scout or report from gate campswhy would a ganker hotdrop a target if they could bring in the same forces beyond scan range and surprise their target directlyi would find it conflicting to expect a target to persistently scan but noone else who might contribute to an intel channelupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
your idea would have that effect and you seem to disregard any idea that people other than gankers would have a say in the matter so you dont really show this wellthe exact same way they do now they find activity either on the map though the api spied info common knowledge sov levels etc then they fly to said system and run a dscan local is irrelevant to them now as it doesnt mean theres targets since they could be docked in a pos or cloaked up and afkthe intel systems as they are now as sketchy at best there can be misinformation as well as missing information which is the biggest issue your suggestion would make it even harder for people to gather intel so the reliability of these intel channels would go down expecting people to have to sit on gates and constantly scan all day is utterly ludicrous this is a game mate even if you seem to take it way too seriouslyi didnt say they would hot drop a cloaky t3 can easily rip 99 of pve players to pieces solo
you are assuming the ideas here would have this effecti am still waiting for you to demonstrate this point beyond simply making the claim itselfyou make it sound so simple to reach this system just describedare they not forced into using cloaked ships here or some other means of bypassing a gate campi believe it will take significant effort to penetrate a system in sov null where these targets existto ignore this as a time sink and how this ages the intel they used to pick the system i believe should be kept as a considerationactually i treat it as a game i expect that a player cannot get out of the game more than they put into it and you are defending something that keeps player efforts quite lowit also sounds misleading to me suggesting things will be harder as it implies a level of significant difficulty exists alreadyi mined in null quite extensively noticing a new name appear on locals list or hearing an intel channel report was a trivial thingbeing able to avoid these threats became equally trivial as i had made no significant effort for which to rewardthe difficulty in getting something be it a bowl of soup shelter from the storm or protection from a threat is what gives the thing its valuethat which took no effort is replaced equally with no effort and thus has no value in gamea cloaky t3 has two failingsprice these ships are expensive replacing them is no trivial task for many so many avoid using them for that reasoncompromised having the cloaking system in place along with very likely the nullifier for gate camp avoidance leaves little fitting room for both dps and tankingin order to rip 99 of pve as effectively as you suggest they would probably not have room for a meaningful tankand most of all lets not forget players adapt and changehow long do you believe it would take for players to figure out a half billion isk cruiser was poking their alliance before they organized a responseupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
lol aka the nope defense you are the one that wants change the onus is on you to prove that it wouldnt damage the player groups affected it most certainly would make cloaking easier to do undetected and thus would make it easier to sneak up on pve players i dont have to prove the current system works since look around the game still exists and the existing system has been in place for a long time further the one place local doesnt exist is the least populated area of the gamelol gate camps yeah because all throughout null people are just sitting on gates waiting for content right it is trivial to fly through nullsec since gate camps are boring so you never see them the addition of the mobile depot has made it even easier to travel fit your ship until you are deep in enemy territory too the removal of local would make this even easier you seem to be under the impression that people would then be sitting on all the gates because again you seem to not understand this is a game not a careerthat really doesnt sound like the definition of a game to me there a career rewards effort games are designed to entertain game companies that can create more fun with less player effort succeed more than those that cant now i agree that to a degree more effort can be more fun but that isnt a rule more effort doesnt automatically mean more fun its only more fun if the activity itself is fun to do which this would not beand so you mined a bit you made slightly more isk than a highsec ice miner and for that you had to constantly be at your pc and aware of whats going on now you want to make it so that no matter what you do without having alts posted at every gate also being looked at 100 of the time a savvy cloaker can sneak in and win without the pve player standing a chance clearly you dont understand the majority of the population of nullyou are simply pushing for too much extra work with very little gain and an incredibly one sided change since it will be all gain on one side and all loss on the otherfirst off they arent that expensive especially when you consider how powerful they can besecondly you dont need to nuke your fitting to get about but fortunately they can be refitted at a mobile depot so you can be nullified for travel then swap out for ganks once in space if you arent a very good pilot that is if you even see a gate camp which is rare and if you cant bust through a gatecamp without being nullified which is easy with any covops cloakerand thirdly it wouldnt happen people simply dont pursue t3s in nullsec it almost never happens t3s that die are usually due to pilot error if a t3 pilot doesnt want to et caught hes not getting caught pretty much the best way to defeat a t3 is to dock up and go afk since hes only leaving of his own accord

grabs popcornno one will ever give nor has there ever been any fucks givensites who make ccp the most cash via plex will alwaysalways receive preferential treatment and backdoor deals if you have an issue with this then sell moar plex
or people could not rmt and break the tos and eula and if they do we could just let ccp ban them from the game
i would of thought that ccp would of had an official contact for all matters relating to 3rd parties is this not the casei mean if you run a 3rd party site who do you contact for matters relating to promotions and such
just dont use is as a platform to rmt isk its not a hard concept to understand
as doc fury so rightly points out this really isnt the appropriate place for this post the assembly hall is gd can move pretty quickly burying posts into the second or third page meaning its less likely to be seen by the appropriate peopleat least for now fansites are to not conduct promotions and sales sources of income areplex referrals with no benefits to the person buying the plexadvertising as per the rules
talk to who in ccpperhaps if there was a person or team that was tasked with working with 3rd parties and everybody including ccp knew who they were then we might not have the situation we have just had with somer both timesjust a thought
id start with the ccper who manages fansites when you run a fansite you have a contact theres a form on the community site to get started or ccp falcon as community managereither of them should be able to start you talking with the appropriate people long term youll also be talking with legal as ive not tried to form a commercial arrangement with ccp i dont know exactly who the right people are i suspect it depends on exactly what kind of arrangement you want
if members of the community have questions or issues they should come to the community team for answers thats why were herein the most recent case its my personal opinion that we were deliberately bypassed in favor of contacts within the company who have less working knowledge of eve and less working knowledge of the community so that people asking the questions could get the answer they wanted rather than the answer that was correct ad true to lifeif fansites third parties or any other member of the community has questions related to community activities then they can file a support ticket to speak to uscategory other issues  community managementwhile your question has been answered im not one to shy away from civil discussion so long as it remains within the boundaries of the form rules as such ill move this to the csm assembly hall and the community can discuss it if that discussion gives the csm the opinion that this is something that they would like to take further then theyre more than welcome to speak to us during the summit in september where we have time set aside for a community sessionccp falcon  eve universe community manager  ccpfalcon
we can definitely discuss this during the community andor marketing session however this may take all of the time that our csm reps have lets not forget that they are just volunteers and cant spend 8 hours every day on stuff like this
this is interesting i never would have thought i would be compared to a ganker hmmm lets look at something here it has been skirted but lucas brought it to light targets are found by map reporting api ect hmmm where does that information come from  think hard now  you almost have it  yes it comes from local local was intended from the first to be just a chat channel where you had to speak to be seen you also have constellation and regional chats most close them out early on in the game both of these channels work as intel as well a delayed response yes but can be used all the stat reporting is why local has not gone away or been changed ccp has a large piece of work to redo where all the collected data comes from now back to the little black boxes if concord stopped reporting local intel from ships there would be no api checks no map trends exct oh and by the way the map is a minimum of 30 min out of date on a good day as a pve pilot i would not mind seeing would be gankers not see me in local and give me a few seconds more to dock or run or fight however to be fair the intel we use needs to be changed it needs improvementi think this is we well researched and written article
uh what no it doesnt the api and map data is independent of local no it wasnt thats why when they developed it they developed it as is it wasnt an accidental bug that they havent been able to figure out for years its working the way it was designed this argument gets raised every single time and it never ceases to be ludicrousthats not a local thing so what you want is to remove all data sources for any types of intel i assume watchlisting will go along with that tooand you wouldnt be able to react unless you had alts on all the gates the first time you would know a ganker was there was when he deacloaks on grid and points you good luck evading that right so in your mind dscanning 10 systems takes an additional 22 minutes on top of travel time id like to see the math on that for the most part you can dscan enrouteand lol so yes your ideas mean that people have to run multiple accounts just to be able to pve at all and you dont see a problem with thati say it isnt broken because it isnt it is working exactly as it was designed and developed to do it is not a bug understand that it not working in a way you agree with does not mean its brokenas for the qualifications nothing i say you would believe since everyone on the internet is an expert at some thing or another so when i say im a software developer with experience with games everyone simply says yeah right but my main point of reference comes from the fact that ive lived in null for years ive been a member of rental alliances small gangs and now a massive coalitionone thing i know for sure is that the risk of destroying local in null would far outweigh any reasonable rewards that could be implemented without being open to abuse so the pve moves out of null leaving null rather empty all you have to do is cast a glance at wormhole space to see how it would work out and it would be worse in null since theres fixed travel paths through null everyone knows how to get everywhere and theres force projection to contend with too
lol ive explained time and again why i think your idea would be bad you and nikk are looking at this from a single point of view refusing to even accept that other points of view may exist i have to ask have you even considered what large scale combat would be like with the complete inability to even remotely see whos got what in a combat system seems to me like that hasnt even crossed your mindfrom my point of view after taking in all of the ideas that have been presented over the years and looking at the state of the game over the same time period my idea is to not change local or cloaks they both work fine as is your suggestion that my idea is invalid simply because i dont believe a change is required is idioticand nowhere did i say id rage quit but you nuke null pve and theres plenty of accounts that would become completely irrelevantlol like what lack of knowledge they are extremely versatile powerful and can refit in space nearly every null ratting build would be annihilated by them in short order and flown correctly they are virtually uncatchableand yes they would probably get into a bit of trouble against multiple pvpers but then they get to choose who to engage dont they generally speaking most ratters are at the very most in small groups in null being supported by even a single pvp player would put your overall efficiency at less than high sec and flying a massive group of pve players is like screaming hey come gank me at the top of your voice and regardless the design decisions will need to factor around small groups at most otherwise youre basically asking for ccp to stamp a minimum membership count on null sec i tell you what ill continue to say what the  i like wherever and whenever i want this is a discussion forum not an op decides what opinion is and isnt valid forum im not going to just go away because you dont like that i disagree with your insane ideas to destroy nullsec by tuning it into wormhole space i tell you what why dont you just move to wh space that way you get what you want and us real nullsec players can continue to play the game we like
not to mention the fact that most of us meet continuosly seriously we dommike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
nolife4lifebut seriously i do appreciate how you guys have been so very on top of things this year this is shaping up to be a very good csm season i know i wouldnt have been able to do it
i think its more an issue of having an known established standard as stevie explained that there is and having the csm be made aware of any nonstandard agreements as covered by their ndathe csm shouldnt be dragged into daily operations just informedand if any of them objects they have the targets to yell at all the to internal audit if anyone of them would feel it necessarywhich btw is quite exactly as it already isexcept when stuff is slipped behinds the backs of the community team and thereby also the csm
the questions in the op should have been answered after the somer nonsense last year if they had been it is unlikely the latest incident would have occurredthe questions in the op should be clarified openly to avoid similar occurrences in the future
whilst i may be glad and agree that somer should of been  was banned your post suggests that you are trying to past 100 of them the blame at somers feet what i see is a failure of communication within ccp it shows to me that there was no directive to state that all 3rd party enquires should be passed  discussed with x person  teami hope that this has been rectified so we do not have a repeat of this latest fiasco it is a little troubling to think after what happened the last time that nothing was put in place to ensure that issues of this nature 3rd parties having personal  favourite contacts and getting preferential treatment being stopped
unfortunately this is the dark side of companies embracing social networking to talk to their customers as long as people have ccp folk on their skype or their personal email addresses and those people willingly engage with players on matters they ought to channel elsewhere as per somer and lisa in sales this is always going to be a problem where is ccp internal affairs these days the whole iscorps dished out to somer team on the down low got brushed under the carpet and it seems once again nothing was learnt from it as counter intuitive as it sounds ccp needs to learn that directly engaging with third party developers is fraught with risk especially when its casual and informal on external channels like skype email etc there shouldnt be anything being proposed or agreed upon that either party wouldnt want the community knowing about if there is  chances are its another somer waiting to blow up transparency has to be foremost in all dealings and if that means eschewing cool new direct access to the devs tools like skype in favour of communication on forums that at least the csm can supervise if not the community as a whole then so be it i realise though thats probably just a fantasy and devs and other ccp staff that have swapped skype etc details on previous pub crawls are having all kinds of wink nudge you didnt hear it from me but keep an eye out for x convos on a regular basis at least events like somer that seem to keep happening over and over without important lessons being learnt would suggest they arei actually feel sorry for the people that are respecting the rules to the letter or dont have a dev batphone as theyre the ones that seem to suffer most from it through no fault of their own

greetings after playing with drones and loving it i would like to propose a list of improvements to the drone ui which is vitally needed some are simple improvements others are suggestions or ideas pressing f without a target would send all drones do their respective function combat drones would pick a target and engage salvage drones would salvage a wreck and mining drones would mine an asteroid by default each drone would pick a separate target unless the focus fire option is selected the focus fire option should be separate for each drone type combat ewar salvage and mining i want my salvage drones to pick their own separate targets instead of all going for the same closest and wasting time the health bars should show on unrepackaged drones in drone bay undamaged drones should autostackrepack in drone bay to avoid long lists of drones thus reducing the size of the window the drone interface window should autoresize to the list of drones displayed the drone decription tooltip should feature the 24 most important stats for drones to avoid scrolling the attributes tab and comparing which takes so much effort all tooltips not just drones of items should feature the skills affecting said item and how much time it takes to be able to use it or get all to 5 once usable all icons not just drones should feature the meta level of said item rightclicking a target should give two options one to send a drone and another to send all drones to perform the relevant function enemy ship  attackewar friendly ship  logi asteroid  mine wreck  salvage rightclicking an overview wreck should give an option to send aall drones to salvage it a new hotkey to send the most damaged drone back to drone bay icons similar to fleet broacasts for drone deployment commands launch drone shift launches all drones cycle drone  replace this drone with another one from the bay return all drones to bay interact  name changes depending on the target mining salvage attack that performs the drones function a new highslot module that services orbiting friendly drones each cycle services a single drone with either a full refill of shields using cap energy or a moderate armor repair using nanite repair paste new dronespoint defence drone  orbits the ship and shoots down some of the incoming fire these drones can only orbit your ship and cant be ordered to go elsewhere i tried to maintain faction flavour light amarr  used against light projectile and hybrid shots it uses lasers so its best for this medium amarr  used against medium projectile and hybrid shots heavy amarr  used against large projectile and hybrid shots gallente  used against missiles uses a railgun to shoot them down minmatar  lasers uses a shield around the drone to intercept and deflect shots caldari  drones uses rockets to destroy attacking enemy drones tractor drone just like the salvager  it brings whatever wreck to the players shipscout drone  a heavy tech 2 drone can warp to a celestial body and give a report on the local grid based on your overview settings at the time of launch you must warp to it and reconnect lost drone to recover it takes 10 seconds to give the report enterprising pirates can shoot it down before that happensblockade drone  similar to the scout drone above  it jumps through the gate and gives a report on whats on the other side it does not benefit from gate cloaking again  if it gets destroyed on the other side before it gives its report you wont know if its a single troll or a fleetdecoy drone  activate to pretend to be another ship it is equal in every way except physical appearance and healthbars used to fool the scanners of other players since scanning down a players site may reveal a tengu and a catalyst when in reality its just a catalyst with a decoy dronetug utility craft  in the same category as a fighter or bomber so can only be used by carriers  it boosts the target ships speed compensates for webecm burst drone  an expendable drone that projects a very strong ecm burst to briefly break the enemys targets and modules can be used to escape a single ganker the drone is destroyed upon useim a newbro so some things might be wrong or silly sorry in advance
im doing lvl 2 faction missions in a stealth bomber which the main skill is covert fking ops frigate and it says i cant use mt stealth bomber but i can use a covert ops fking frigatechange the fking skill
sure because being a douchebag is going to get anything accomplished other than getting you flamed trolled and the thread lockedi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
or you know you could try buying a covert ops frigate instead
whats the problem here
im suspecting the op was locked out a site that doesnt allow stealth bombers but allows the covops frigate anathema buzzard and he is therefore mad that the covops skill is not the equivalent of flying the covops frigate a different frigate than the stealth bomber frigateor i might be wrong and the op just has difficulty reading
as somebody who often flies a cloaky ship looking for targets to hot drop you would think i would love local to be removed well i wouldntthe reason being very simple the amount of targets would be greatly reduced and in turn the amount of hot drops which do create content will drop off dramatically there is no getting aware from the fact that as people we are all risk adverse to some degree when you ever you perform an activity in eve most people will look at the risk v reward at the moment the risk v reward for mining or ratting in null is okay one of the reason is because of local even if somebody cloaked comes in system you know their in system which gives you a small amount of time if you are paying attention to gtfofor many people local gives them a sense of security which means they are more likely to rat to mine to do their pi etc you remove that security blanket and you will see a dramatic drop in these activities in null because you have increased the risk massively but you have not increased the reward how is that good for the gameas me needing local i dont how many people in system is irrelevant  what is relevant is how many people are in space and in what ships and wherethere could be a hundred reds in system but if the majority are docked up or at a pos then a hot drop can easily be achieved local does not give me any of that information
ok i am unsure as to why this was not made simple enough 1 i have never stated that local is broken2 if you read dev blogs over the past years and csm minutes on the subject of local working as intended yes 3 the same pull for the api check does feed all the sources i mentioned over the last year and a half ccp is making changes on the back end 3 this thread is not about local since i think you have a hard time reading my post i will say it again this thread is not about removing localthere are many many threads about local and intel all that was supposed to be discussed here was how it affects cloaking and afk gameplay we have discussed different methods of changing how we get intel lucas kell this is especially for you you are grandstanding do you want me to look that word up for youit does not matter what our qualifications are we both are stating an opinion i tend to reference where i get my information and use valid sources i have yet to see you actively reference anythingyou look at the headlines of post quoting them maybe you should try reading them firstyou are deliberately trying to derail this thread for subject matter that while discussed here is not what this thread is aboutyou are a forum lurker that does not mean because you have lots of post and likes that you know what you are talking about and yes everyone can tell from just reading your post what you know and dont know post all you want i for one am blocking you therefore i will not have to waste my time with you
you say that but then nikk and maria refuse to accept that cloaking can be changed without local and you yourself keep referencing local as a thing that needs to change lets face it this thread is about local you just dont like that theres valid reasons to keep local just look at prince kobol above hes right with local removed null would be way too empty regardless of whether or not a handful of people found it more fun to have to have 12 alts and a bunch of button clicks to get intel and all of those changes start with remove local you cant have an effort based local intel system without the removal of local as an intel source firstlol you reference sources ive seen you reference other people who share your opinion and you then restate it like its fact but im yet to see you provide anything beyond that and lets face it its not something that a lot of data is around for since wed need to see null with the proposed system in place to see its effect one thing i can cite as a source is wormhole space which is dead thats what you want null to be but a more dangerous version wrong on all 3 counts amusingly theres several points ive mad in many of my posts which youve totally glossed over so who isnt reading herei simply have an opposing opinion to yours and you cant take itand yet youll still read my post or at least parts of it thats right youre reading this right now
sounds like an outstanding idea to me my alt is an orca booster but due to the incredible speed of interceptors nowadays boosting anywhere outside of highsec becomes an offgrid sitinyourpos bore a t2 miasmos would be an excellent option for ninjamining wormholes and even be useful in lownull it would also go nicely with the prospect as a covops boosterhauler cargo should be slightly larger than standard miasmos cargo maybe closer to 8590k m3 so the orca is still much better at hauling 3 high slots 1 for covops cloak and 2 for mining links links should provide boosts that are about 50 that of the orca scaling with skills and implants would still make orca better rorqual still the king but have a third option with the smallest yet stealthy capabilitiessorry if i kind of directed your thread just thought id throw out some options really like your idea surprised nobody has said anything about it in a week maybe were strangealso to piggyback on this right before i read this i was thinking that a rig to add a fleet hangar to haulers might be a good idea so they can be used as legitimate haulers instead of a jetcan cleanup machines
passsimply put what you suggest would eventually allow dreads to engage interceptors and hit with that said this idea is horribad beyond needing more weapon typesi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
even after reading your translation i am not quite sure how a modified skill would help him entering a lvl2 mission with a covert fking bomber
clearly illiteracy is to blame here and maybe just a dash of derpi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
here a damn fact for you a dev would also like to see the system changed so that intel was it on separated mechanic i honestly think i linked this before
yes ive seen that and as ive stated before and suppose i will again since you seem to be unable to read a single dev stating his personal opinion does not mean that ccp as a whole wish for the mechanic to be removedit is clearly a fact that one dev has a personal opinion on the matter it is also a fact that its been whined about by people like you for years and yet still exists thus ccp obviously dont want to remove it that much do the caps help since you are simply repeating what youve already stated as if im supposed to suddenly say oh gosh you must be correct lets destroy nullsec thensure id like to say grow up stop whining about working mechanics understand that you opinions are not facts that you have no clue what you are talking about since you dont even live in the space you want to change and that nothing you say is going to suddenly make me decide that your insane ideas to ruin nullsec in a heartbeat are any goodthe reason you think your ideas are good are firstly because you are an arrogant child that thinks heshe cant possibly be wrong and secondly because you dont live in the space so if it becomes uninhabitable youll just shrug and move on i and many other do in fact live there so until you have a clue what people living in this space actually do take your dumb ideas scrawl them on a sheet of toilet paper using your own faeces and flush theml o lyour bar on proof seems to be a little low for yourself at least according to you a single screenshot of one dev stating his personal opinion is proof enough it should be removed yet its creation and existence for years with no change is not enough proof it shouldnt the proof that local works is simple immediate local already exists and both cloaking mechanics and null sec are widely used give me proof categorical evidence that it will not ruin nullsec to have immediate local removedand seriously grow up kid if you cant have an adult debate and actually bother to read other peoples posts then dont bother responding
the first line is funny considering the context that you are asking for proof of something that requires testing in live conditions to establishnow add to that the idea that we have players complain that x has ruined the game on such a frequent basis that it has the meme about having all their stuff as a given replyand lucas that second lineyou are notorious for cherry picking post elements and not just for shorter repliesmany times in the past i have seen you asking for an explanation which had already been givencan you simply give us a concrete point as an objection rather than a blanket statement implying we have to read your mind and guess what you object toa simple please no change posted once is a rational replyotherwise please specify an objection which can be answered directlyupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
yes of course it does which is why no proof could possibly have been provided yet maria seems to think that enough proof has been provided funny thatand that could be said about a lot of things gankers active mining and concord to name but a few there will always be things that a constant swathe of people are going to complain about but the fact that there are complaints means nothing in itself with the current mechanic ive yet to see a balanced and well thought out proposition which has been looked at from all sides and considers the existing nullsec playerbase and mechanicsimmediate local as it stands does not ruin the game the game is not currently in a state i would consider ruined and things like force projection and sov mechanics will need to be looked at long before kicking everyone out of null so coovert gankers can thriveam i havent noticed that i mean ive noticed you whining about it but coming from a guy that part and misquotes posts and repeatedly fails to answer simple and direct questions it really means nothing perhaps you are misunderstanding often ill ask a question again when the original answer given was complete and utter nonsense you and maria seem to have a small enough amount of knowledge bout the space you want to change that i wonder if you even play eve at all let alone play in null sec yet you think your idea is fine i notice you totally ignored prince kobols response to the ideas tooive stated my objections multiple times you are doing the exact same thing you did in a thread about this before where you completely ignore those objections then ask me for them again then state that i must not have any when i refuse to repeat myself then when i do finally list objections you ignore them again for a few pages then ask once againim not here to play forum games with children im putting my point across plain and simple your ideas are not well thought out they are unbalanced in favour of cloakers they do not consider force projection they do not consider large scale fleet battles they do not consider the effect on pve mechanics in nullsec nor the logistics of holding sov pretty much the only thing youve considered is the point of view of a cloaked ganker and a solo pilot hunting him the current mechanic works well has worked for years and a change would be unnecessary and cause more damage than good
ccp what did you do to my sabre
no no no i needz muh finz
so very very very very very ugly

first they came for the my nighthawk model
bring it back
you dont get it do youicelandic types they eat fins preferably well aged and rotten this has just been a matter of time in coming i tell youtreasure what appendages your ships have left for soon soooooon  we will fly feautureless podsmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
put the fins back please it looks like a load of pony now
ccp pls how will i swim through space now you have doomed me apologize for eating my fins thanks in advance
is this a bug it is a bug isnt it please say its a bug it looks terrible
ccp will never issue that so you might as well forget it just stop ganking miners
i disagree something so valuable as to only come around once a year is expensive at the price of a plex i dont think sonow that on the other hand i believe is a very very good idea one of the better ideas ive seen lately 1
no its a final skill required to fly a ship covert ops allows you to fly the bombers and the scannersbut on the mission screens and guides it says covert ops frigates im saying change the fking skill to stealth bombers so there is no more confusion
this is an english speaking forum
argues with people that provide proof to their pointsprovides no proof of his owncalls others childrenseems like a 10 out of 10 score from me good job golf claps
so show me that proof show me the proof that your ideas wont break null sec all youve shown is that one dev had a personal opinion that local should not be used for intel you seem to think that if you can prove a dev posted that one twitter once that theres no further arguments to be had in your mind thats categorical evidence that your ideas are sound it would be laughable if it wasnt so sadand ive provided proof look around you the game still existing is proof that the existing mechanic worksyou realise people can read the previous posts right you realise they arent just going to take your word for it that im sitting around dismissing your ideas on a whim they are going to look back in the thread and see that all you are providing is your opinion restated over and overand yes you are a child when someone disagrees with you you attack them start shouting in caps repeatedly misquote them ignore what they are saying and restate yourself with no further clarification thats not how an adult has a discussion luckily for me the csm members are unlikely to back ideas when people like you are championing them so your response themselves help guarantee that the bad ideas you push forward will never come into fruitionedit just as a quick thought though exactly what is it you want me to provide proof of you keep whining that i need proof but proof of what since i want nothing changed i need provide no proof that the existing mechanic works since its clear as day that it does you however do need to provide proof that your ideas wouldnt break the meta and show that its been considered from multiple viewpoints i asked you once before and you ignored the question how the intel mechanics would work in a huge fleet battle with thousands of people in the system for example
honestly i hope they do read my previous responces and see ive posted my proof not once but two times that the devs are not happy with the current system as for if my systems working im sorry i dont recall me providing any systems that could replace local infact if i recall correctly i have stated a number of times that such systems take time to create then they take time to testyou are assuming that i just want to see local be snapped out of existence yet you continue to fail to see me post about saying instead of local that provides all the intel on the fly i would like to see a system that instead provides a way to gain more out of it if one is skilled enough and puts in enough work into it or provides less intel if they dont want to even bother familiarize with the system i dont missquote anyone i never have i think you argument is breaking down as we bring more attention to your own flaws infact i think nick already brought attention to your own misquotes next shouting right you mean drawing attention to sections of text it a cool little trick that one actually learns on high school level english classes all capping certain words or sections of a sentence tends to cause the eye to snap to it thus bringing the readers attention to that section of that paragraph faster cant you tell you noticed those all caps now didnt youas for others being called a child i think the only one that is being a child is you you are the only one throwing insults around restating what i said is a great way to reinforce what im saying not only that it also a great way to bring the topic back at hand you have this small habit of derailing topics as for the proof that is required you keep claiming that changing the system is would be commercial suicide we require proof there that would be a nice starthere another one you are saying that the systems are working as intend however i provided proof that it wasnt with this 
that is a dev and its a personal opinion its not an announcement that ccp is behind it if ccp wanted to change it then why have they not made any official mentions of doing soand im not assuming anything youve made your opinions clear you want to replace local which would require removing local in its current form you can dress it up however you want but that is what you want and for what an effort based system would be no more fun for 99 of the playerbase the only people that would enjoy it are those who want to huntyouve misquoted me multiple times often you simply truncate the quote then go off arguing at things i havent saidand typing in all caps isnt drawing attention the fact tat i break your posts down piece by piece shows that im reading them so no further attention is required what is required is for you to read and understand what is being said to you in the response which you have no interest in doing and sure maybe capitalise some of a sentence but i doubt people get taught to ragepost whole paragraphs of text especially when you are capitalising something i have responded to directly with quotes no less than 3 times ill even do it again here that is one dev not the whole of ccp its his personal opinion not the development direction of ccp is that clear enough now you know with the caps the i know you are so what am i response you are completely incapable of accepting that your ideas might be flawed and you respond by getting irate ignoring posts and attacking people im not even the first person in this thread to point this out to you and funnily enough you are posting on a disposable forum alt so you can behave however you want safe in the knowledge you can just burn this one later its patheticso you require proof of something you know full well cant be proven without actually implementing the systemunderstand this i opt for the system to remain as is we know from being able to play the game right now that the current system works so no further proof is required for that you want the system to change so the onus is on you to prove that it wont be commercial suicide and that that majority of null players wont just unsub their ratting alt accounts and move to highseci dont believe any of the ideas presented so far are any good and the main thing i question here is your experience in what you are talking about you want to make a change which would heavily affect null yet you dont seem to have first hand knowledge of how most of the null mechanics work how would force projection be affected how would large scale battles be affected what would be the economic impact of introducing extra risk to miners who obtain the bulk of high end mineralsyou seem to think that people will be willing to sit alt accounts on gates all day to fetch intel prove that being that i live in null i know first hand that most people would find that unacceptable and tedious if its not requiring that and is just skills then its surely just a nerf to noobs how would you ensure that covert ops t3s dont just become the standard pve ganker like they are in wh spacei ran out of space for your link to the same dev from 2012 again but ill just reiterate what i said earlier thats one devs personal opinion some devs thought keeping loot spew was a good idea some devs though keeping drone assist was a good idea some devs even want to work on more wis mechanics just because one dev says it does not mean its the design direction for the game developers on my team disagree all the time but we generally end up working in one direction with some developers ideas not being used you need considerably more to push your case than a nearly 2 year old conversation between a single dev and a guy who rmted all of his isk and quit
what youre missing is that there are many cases to which it is valuable to have multitraining on 1 acct lots of ppl make alts that have a specific role and only need to be trained so far why pay and extra plex or 15month from here to eternity just to keep say my trading alt hauler alt cyno alt etc etc its an excellent deal for folks who really think about how and when to use it
im reposting this in its own thread because were past crius and moving on to the next expansion and this is still broken this was a good feature and shouldnt just be silently cut
bring back the finsdo eeetseriously why would you do this stop this overt malfeasance targeting our beloved space tadpole we forgive mistakes but this is just malice lol really tho bringm back you have 48 hours 
its a bug
 and there was much rejoicing
the real issue here is not people useing 510 accounts its guys like memoryalpha who have 300 and actively use 5080 at a time to both pvp and strip every belt in a system in less then 2 hours and an icebelt in less then 10 minuetsmy alt warped into an icebelt earlier today to mine some ice and he was sitting there with an orca 2 freighters and 40 skiffs all bunched up in a balli dont think isboxer should be banned persay but this is getting ridiculous when one person can control 50100 toons simultaniously there is a severe issuebesides we all know these massive fleets are isk farmers selling isk and rmting anyway40 man isboxer fleet mains i have seen memoryalpha  operates out of yoma lucutusborg  yoma elonaya a few otherscome csms put your collective intelligence together and do something enough is enough
exactly so there is no reason the server or client cant check to see how many accounts your computer is running and if its say more then 10 refuse to allow another one to run
cept it so easily defeatable that it really laughable so why waste the dev time on it
stealth bomber is a subclass of covert ops the mission doesnt support stealth bombers the subclass of ship so fly a covert ops frigate fixt now quit shitpostingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
actually it was fixed with patchrekt
which wouldnt work since virtualisation makes that pointless multiboxing tools could easily bypass a client side check they might already do so to be honest
so stop space lawyering and do something about it he consents to pvp every time he undocks just imagine if those two would be doing that in a rented 00 space nobody would notice and there wouldnt be any complaints from your side so whats the problem
we tried ganking his fleet already he warped in 15 logies and 20 vindis then laughed in local just to prove a pointi dont have a 40 man fleet to engage him with and you cant kill a skiff wihtout at least 3 full dps fit taloss let alone 40 i also dont have 100 billion isk to blow up all the ships i would need to gank his entire fleet just once and successfully kill it its a 40 skiffproc fleet he also has logis and vindies on standbuy when someoen attacks him that he warps inyour essentially telling me i should undock in a shuttle and attempt to kill a battleship with concord on the battleships side since he in an npc corplike i said earlier this problem will require several corporations if not several allainces to simply deal with one single player because he can multibox 50100 toons at a timeccp mine as well introduce admin shields as available on the market and let the carebears have orcas that will strip belts in 3 cycles and are unkillable without an entire alliance backing youbecause thats basically what he isbut its cool as soon as they get greedy and set there eyes on nullsec which they will because more and more of them are apearing and eventually highsec will get too crowded and when the nullbears start loseing space and sov to 100200 isbox fleets daily and hourly the nullbears will demand change and lo and behold isboxer will get banned or some restriction put in that disallows the controll of more then a reasonable amount ofaccounts at a time
i know most of you on the csm council hate highsec and wish it were not a part of the game thats cool but its pretty sad your not willing to help stop a problem until it spreads like a plague into your area of preferred space
oh get over yourself1 you are not that important the guy that pays for a hundred accounts has a hundred times the influence you do because he pays for it hed have the same influence whether he used isboxer a hardware system or old fashioned alttab to multibox that is a fact of life for eve and always will be unless ccp totally bans multiboxing in any way dont like it gtfo im willing to bet the number of accounts run by isboxers outnumbers the number of accounts run by people who hate isboxers2 if youre so certain a multiboxer is engaged in rmt report them ccp has ways to determine if someones doing rmt and they take it very seriously if youve already reported a multiboxer and theyre still there after a while you can probably bet theyre not doing rmt coming onto forums and pointing fingers just puts you into the whiney entitlement set3 there are thousands of systems available in eve that you can fly to limiting yourself to the systems where the evil isboxers work is just inane4 simply because the csm isnt bowing and scraping to your every petty demand doesnt mean they hate highsec isboxers are in every aspect of eve trying to guilt trip the csm is some truly prententious posturing on your part why does it seem everyone hates highsec this is because highsec is represented by people like you you have no killboard no evidence you actually play the game yet you insist your way is the only way to play you refuse to adapt to the game you demand the game adapt to yourantnote i am neither for nor against isboxer i tried it didnt like it what i am against is anyone outside of ccp telling anyone else that they cant play the way they want to
well that can be a problem but really that is extremly rare do you have any idea how much hardware you need to run 50 game instances at once my laptop can run 2 my main pc rig can run 6 without lag if i turn the graphics down if i tried to run 20 or more acounts at the same time my rig would crash while i can agree massive isboxing could be a problem i would say their are mayber 1012 players doing it out of the 600000 or so active accounts not really a big problem the average isboxer only runs 1015 accounts i personally run 4 accounts but not with isboxer i do it all manually but still i really dont see how the problem is big enough to justify the resources that would be required to track and stop it isboxer is basically a keyboard emulator that copies actions across multiple clients there is no way to prove if a client is using isboxer except for maybe scaning the machine running the client for known third party programs but even then the programers responsible for creating those programs could find a way around it besides to do so would require ccp to add a clause to the eula allowing them to scan clients computers activities outside of the eve client that would likely get eve banned by most large countries due to privacy violations it just can not be done at least not legally
i like all of this but i think you are missing one key part and let me know if i simply missed itinactivity in a system should degrade the system back to nonsov after that same 5 day period or the level below whatever it is currently at if that same levels requirements are not met every 5 day period if the sov requirements are not met continuously every single 5 day periodotherwise you end up with the same problem of afk empires simply doing what is needed to get sov 1 in a system and then simply ignoring itthere needs to be a severe threat of losing your system if you are not useing it keeping sov should be a lot of work in every aspect currently its just a joke about who can pay the most isk to the nether gods of ccp
i mentioned in the 1st or 2nd post that the system level is based off of a 5day rolling average of system points gained by activity compared to the max possible number of points that the system could support the max number of points is determined by what leveldependent structures are placed that serve to increase the available content producing opportunities either increasing the value of each opportunity or the total number of opportunities system levels are lostgained by passing certain thresholds of the points gainedpoints available ratioquick example point values are theoreticaltoo early for math and cross referencing my other postssystem level 4 total available points 2mif the system dwellers gain 15m points on average for the 5 day rolling period they keep their sov levelif the system dwellers gain 18m points on average for the 5 day rolling period they are eligible to increase system levelif the system dwellers gain only 1m points on average for the 5 day rolling period they lose a system level and the structures that were placed that depend on the system level are offlined the workers go on strikenew downgraded systemsystem level 3 total available points because structures were forced offline is now 125m pointsif the dwellers can maintain their 1m points per day average then they will keep level 3 if activity continues to decrease then each new day would have a decreased activityavailable ratio causing either maintenance or loss of level without doing some spreadsheet calculations this would cause system level to drop possibly daily over the course of 5 to 10 days depending on how steep the stop in activity is until the system level is 0 and the system is back to neutral this also gives the defender the ability to resist an activity siege as long as activity level is maintained to a necessary minimum the system level wont decrease or will require a bigger investment by the attacker to steal system pointshope this explains things a bit thanks for the bumpced
i like the ideas but it seems to me a little over complicated and would still allow blob warfare to domitate personally i do not see any way of addressing blob or numbers win issue we currenty have in null this is basically how civilization works the most power enities win those looking for security join those enities making them even bigger and more powerful we see this even in the real world in fact if it wasnt for human morality and human rights affecting the powers that be it would continue until there was only one super powerful entity ruling the entire world we do not have those things holding us back in a game we are free to be as evil or imoral as we wish with no morality or fear of punishment eve is a game not the real world people play to have fun world peace thru dominace is not a good thing in a game based on warfare and fighting such a state is not fun in a pvp centric game sov definently needs a rework but i believe smaller steps addressing one issue at a time would work better a massive single change like described in to op would hit current sov holding enties like a huricane causing more destruction and collapse than repair that could be a good thing or it could be the end of eve as players quit after seeing all they worked for collapse however if done in small steps over several updates allowing players to adapt to each change before getting hit by the next would be the best course of action the most crucial step at least in my opinion is the issue of all the sov held space that is not used that is starting to change on its own with more power blocks now renting out unused space but this does nothing to curb the power of those coalitions and does not take the space out of their control why are they able to hold space they do not use in the first place the ops idea could solve this but a much simpler system could be implemented much easier based on a system we already have i believe the last sov rework was a step in the right direction it just needs a few more iterations it is like the changes were never finished we already have a system where indexes degrade in low activity systems but they degrade down to 1 and that is all sov is still held what if indexes continued to degrade right to nothing and once all indexes reached zero all sov structures would automatically offline and sov would be lost these structures would still need to be destryed before new ones could be anchored which brings me to the next point i beleive all structures in the game should have most of their ehp in sheilds not in structure and when they go offline shields should drop to zero how is a sheild maintained without power it shouldnt if you own a structure it is your job to keep it online if you dont it should not be as hard to destroy as an online structure this goes for all anchored structures including starbases if you let your structures go offline they should not auto unanchore or be available to steal at least not without significant effort but they should be way easier to destroy that when they are online with these changes sov holding enties would automatically lose systems they do not use as enties grow and become more powerful they will push to claim better systems as they do so older less valuable system will fall into disuse and eventually sov will be droped sov entities will remain the size needed to sustain their population not the size they can actively defend with their blob fleet the boarders may constanly move as better systems are claimed and useless systems are droped but the size or number of systems they hold will be dependant on their member based and activity as new enities enter null sec claiming these abandoned systems they will slowly grow in size and power and move into better systems they will die off or they will be absobed by larger groups either way those entry level systems will be opened up for new groups to claim it is very true that this would not elinimate the ability of coalitions to dominate these new small enities could be forced to either join a coalition or become targets for their pvp roams however with this system you can not simply join a coalition and go use their space leting your home systems go idle if you do so sov will be lost new groups joining the coalition are not going to be happy staying in these crap systems while their brothers are making 5 times as much in their better systems if they suport to coalition they will want to be rewarded with better space it wil be much more difficult for coalitions to keep underlings happy this will cause a great amount of instability in those coalitions if you want to live an rat in the good systems you will have to earn member ship into the alliance that holds them not just be in the same coalition this will likely cause the size of corportations and alliances in null sec to grow and the popularity of coalitions to fall but no matter how the ball bounces groups will not be able to hold sov in systems they do not use two very simple fixes to make this happen allow sov to degrade to the point of sov ihubs and tcus going offline on their own and slightly revamp structures so sheilds or at least resists are gone when the structure is offline making structure bashing of abandoned strutures much easier this will not sovle near all the problems with nul sec sov but would be a very big step in the right direction at least in my opinion
yes that is possible but to hold these system at a minimum level to stop others using it under the ops idea would require your members to participate in these activities in a lower class system when they could be doing the same with higher rewards in their home system who is going to want to rat or mine or run a pos in enemy teritory just to slow their claim to sov not when they can make much more doing those activities at homenot to mention spending time preventing smaller groups from claiming sov takes time away from the activities needed to upgrade your own systems this system th op describes your activity in you own systems is what keeps those systems at a level that suports your member base if your members are off pesering other smaller groups your home systems will suffer due to the drop in activity there what you say would be possible but you would be hurting your own system by not getting point their while you are off preventing someone else from gaining points in their home system these smaller groups trying to claim systems you have not bothered with will generate a lot of smaller scale pvp which is one thing current null sec is really lacking even if they get stomped out at least the targets will be there as long as you do not stomp to hard it would bring small scale pvp in large volumes back to sov null sec
thanks for putting words to the concept this is a good way of explaining the idea behind my proposal stay at home and make isk in your own systems or spend time and resources harassingattacking another group sounds like content to me 
 bugsymy intention with this idea isnt to eliminate blobs instead it minimizes the need for a blob if you want to harass a smaller group with your thousandman blob go for it unless they also have their system upgraded to support their own equal si
i am all for this eve is too small as it is i should see vast swaths of unclaimed space what i see is 100 claimed and occupied 00 spacewhich is well completely unrealistic space is huge not a tiny finite area of a few thousand systemsbut this might cause an issue with memory and people on lower end computersso eve is a game you shouldnt be playing without a modern rig anyway and if at some point a player has to dedicate an entire 1tb hdd to just houseing and running eve so be it if it fixes the issues and makes space as big as it should be i am aok with that00 should be so vast that when you go deep enough your in a wilderness of space so far away from everything you feel tiny alone and vulnerable and so large that the 10000 man alliance that owns 2000 systems is a particle of dust compared to the rest of the eve universe
many if not most null sec residents make their persoanl isk from ratting who is going to want to give up ratting in the good systems and go to a system several jumps away where they will make significantly less isk for their time it is just not going to happen sure for a large alliance to hold 3540 systems will not be to much of a challenge but some currently hold hundreds maybe not by the main alliance but through holding and renters alliances those things could become a thing of the past could a large alliance with 1000s of members hold hundreds of systems sure they could at least it would be possible but then some members would have to live in those low value systems to maintain the sov there and speading out activity like that would make it very dificult to max out core systems these extra systems can be held by renter corps belonging to a holding alliance much like is being done now but would require a lot more organisation and the renters would be fully responsible for maintaining their own sov with less control by their overloards basically they would just be paying a protection fee old gangster style in order to be permitted to live their with much less control or infocement the point is occupancy sov would require a lot more work to hold onto large blocks of systems than the current system while it is completly possible to do so nobody is going to put in the effort to hold more systems than they need especially if more benifit could be gained by keeping core systems at a higher level someone in another thread commented that sov does not need to be held in these systems they can simply be patrolled and forcibly be kept empty again that is completely possible however the time and effort to do so would take away from the activity in home systems that could contribute to higher levels making the home systems even better groups will have to choose between focusing on improving their home space through focused activity or sacrificing some of that activity to spread out their empire to control other systems they maybe do not even need to control eventually holding extra space they do not use will become to tedious to bother there are a lot of good and some great ideas going around but whatever is done the only chance of sucess is not to try and force groups to hold less space through restrictive mechanics but to implement a change to game mechanics that will make it more profitable to focus on maxing out fewer system than holding more systems at a lower level think of this if we could have the same power blocks and large powerful alliances we have now but say 45 systemsa constellation with enough activity could be upgraded to suport 2500 members at max activity level available upgrades could easily suport 500 members in a single system groups like gsf with 12000 members would need only 2030 systems to suport all members at maximum income holding anymore would mean they would not have enough activity to keep them all at max level they would have the option to spead out but would make far more isk staying grouped tightly together maintaining max levels in their systems at the same time small groups of 50100 members could hold a sov system but would never be able to produce enough activity to max out even a single system encouraging these players to form into larger groups to gain the advantages provided by higher teired systems for this to work a max level system would have to make it possible for players living their to make significantly more iskhr than living in a system even one teir lower plus the alliance would have the added advantage of all available pilots being only a few jumps from each other making home defense very easy and mobilizing for an assult even easier no more planing 3 days ahead to move assets to a deployment system home base could be your deployment system maintaining a max level system would give members the maximum possible income on an iskhr basis the more they spread out the less valuable their systems become as their member base is only capable of so much activity spreading out would result in less isk per hour for that activity upgraded systems would have to be able to suport the number of players required to maintain the activity level at the maximum without putting to much load on the server nodes basically the balance of how many members are required to maintain the maximum level would be completely dependant on what activity level the nodes could handle without the threat of tidi kicking in this would need to be combined with a bottom up finacial suport system for the alliances this could be as simple as an alliance level tax this would be in addition to corp taxes say you could easily make 100m per hour ratting in a fully upgraded system you pay 110 to your corp and an additional 15 to the alliance perhaps add the tax to other things as well if you reprocess anything you pay a fee for the reprocessing it would no longer be free in high sec the fee would be 10 of the value of the ore being reprocessed in sov null sec the tax would be set by the sov holding alliance say this activity index was a 15 like we currently have for each activity a truly maxed system would need all indexes maintained at 5 say that would take on average 500 members living there to maintain easily or whatever number the servers could handle without tidi kicking in the available content would have to be enough to suport those members and would have to provide them enough of an increased income to make players want to live in maxed out systems
i dont beleive making it detrimental is the answer but making it more profitable to focus activity on maxing out fewer systems would allow members to make far more iskhr holding less systems than spreading activity across more systems than they need
this is a coment i have a big problem withyou are in null sec ie dangerous space the threat of being jumped or dropped on is and should be there at all times as far as i am concerned the need for a cyno alt to be able to move a capital ship should be removed let capitals jump to bookmarks with no need for a cyno at all this would be balanced by the fact that you are jumping blind unless you have an alt or freind at the destination cloaked campers are not doing anything to you you say any smart player will not be active in a system where there is a claoked camper i say that does not make you smart it makes you scared as soon as you go into low null or wspace you are consenting to pvp why should you be safe in sov null just because you are ratting or mining you are in a pvp area and are subject to the dangers of unexpected pvp you dont like it move back to high sec that being said i do agree that afk cloaking maybe should be addressed not cloaked camping if a player wants to actively play a character cloaked sitting in a system just watching that is a perfectly acceptable tactic phsycological warfare has its place in eve however back to the true afk cloaky camper all that is needed is a mechanic that prevents players from remaining cloaked while afk i would say remove the ability for cloaks to autocycle you could make the cloak cycle longer say up to 5 minutes if needed but you click it it cycles once and shuts off perhaps a 510 second buffer after the cycle completes before the cloak actually drops allowing an atk player to reactivate it for another cycle before the cloak drops this i believe would acomplish what is needed any afk cloaker will decloak after one cycle eliminating the ability to set your character in a system cloaked up and go off to work or bed while still affecting your enimies even players semi afk would be affected as it is very easy to not alttab back in time to restart the cloak you get busty and just forget or fail to realize the timer is up this would allow for even semi afk players to have a chance of getting caught the only truly safe cloaky camper would be one totally atk and that would be far to boring for most players but would allow for this phsycological warfare to still be used if desired just not while afk
it wont matter anyway have you looked at the blueprints they decreased ineral income through refineing nerfs then double and trippled material costs for tech 2 shipsthen to top it off they stealth modified the bonuses so they do not apply to planetary components required to build things like poss so not matter how high your me is on the print the material cost will always be the same i know i have a 100 me bpo for a caldari pos tower and its material costs are the same as a 0 me one at perfect industry skills on my indy toonthey essentially just insured the your about to pay through the nose in a few months for pos towers and anything that even remotely uses planetary commodities
that really doesnt have anything to do with the issue im posting about but thank you for the reply
uh as far as im aware its still in there its just rolled into the system cost index
really because that doesnt match what ive seen theres a restriction that you cant drop something below 1 unit per run for a material but thats itdo you have screenshots
they were given as 2 different modifiers to job cost in the two blogs i linked and again in the blog about 3rd party api endpoints in crius
and here is the api info on the way it should be calculated spreadsheet this out and compare it to ingame numbers and youll find a giant discrepancy where facility bonuses should be
hi everybody just hoping to see more people express their opinion on thisi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
this is good and if you have multiple or a group then split the monitoralso some decorum would be nice bring able to personalize ones quarters medal case potted plants et ceteraand why not let us walk around our hangargive us something to increase immersion an office or conference room for corporations and alliancesi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i have been thinkingsome points going forward1 you must realize that 80 to 90 of all industry is done in highsec including mining2 people do not want to mine in lowsec or they would this is mostly due to the fact that mining ships are defensless and mining in low sec is a guaranteed death sentence which falls on you pvpers so why would a miner do it they wouldnt3 the eve economy is fueled by highsec miners and industrialists ccp has stated this on numerous occasions without the hoighsec carebears the economy would collapse you would be paying 1 billion isk for a single round of ammoonly 5  20 of minerals ships and goods on the market come from 00 and lowsec according to ccps manufacturing marketing and industry charts4 pvp emergent gameplay is the real factor in a miners or industrialists decision not to go to low or nulllets look at number 1ccp has already confirmed that the vast majority of industry in eve takes place in highsec the goal of the latest industrial patches was to attempt to shift the focus to null and lowsec but failed miserably because industry in and of itself is not the issuethe issue is the emergent gameplay itself specifically the pvpers and the way industry happens from the back end ie mininga miner must get into a defenseless ship in order to have a mineral income sufficient to supply a markets demands for minerals which are then used to build ships ammo etc with an individual with any intelligence is not going to take said ship into a sector of space where the chance of loosing it is almost 100 even if you offered ore that was worth 1 billion isk a unit that an npc station would buy very few would take you up on itwhybecause retrospectively pvpers would 100 camp these materials and gank every single miner who came within 1 au of it making the addition pointless where the focus is concerned getting miners out of highsecso reward has nothing to do with how one should approach this issue because the reward in this case to a miner is never worth the risk due to the multiplier of emergent pvp gameplaythis is why the vast majority of everything is made in an area of space that has a worthwhile risk the occasional suicide gank rather then in an area of space where the risk is you will die almost 100 of the timethe other reason is because mining takes time a long time to gather sufficient minerals to build even a single ship your talking hours if not days depending null and low do not offer the time availability to do this sure you can ninja mine but it will take you 10x the amount of time to gather the same minerals the highsec miner doeswhy again because of emergent pvp gamepaly miners make easy to kill and juicy targets pvpers want easy to kill and juicy targets for the most part if this was not the case there would be a lot less dead minerspoint 2people do not mine in low or null usually because it is time consuming and too risky in lowsec combat and pvp is part of survival so it is asinine to expect someone to go to said space knowing they have no ability to defend themselves in the ship required to mine ore in the vast quantities needed to supply a stable market give miners ships with fat tanks and the ability to pump out dps and miners will start going into low and null to mine but then many pvpers would have an issue with this because then it would be a risk to them to try and kill them it is blatantly clear that many pvpers only enjoy pvp when they are not at riskfor example look at the old battle hulk used by many miners in lowsec and null once it was discovered that it could kill a battlecruiser if fitted properly pvpers sent an outrage of 1000s of posts to the forums demanding ccp nerf the hulk so it couldnt kill them anymore and they could gank in peace againi mean really people really either you want miners in low and null or you dont which is it i think you just want easy killspoint 3the economy in eve is a fluid monstrosity fueled by players from everywhere right wrong80 of everything created built or made in eve is exported from highsec ccp already confirmed this and again was the reason for some of the industrial changes which those of us who are actual industrialist and deal witht he eve economy marketing and such things every day told ccp would not solve the issue we even told them what issues it would create and yet ccp went ahead with it lo and beholdwe told you so never says it enoughwhat did we tell ccp it would not make miners and industrialists move because industry was not at the core the issue stopping them from going to null and low to mine and do such it would cause prices to skyrocket which it has pvpers would still  about how highsec miners need to get into 00 and lowsec which they do f continued
 ccp was told that the main core issue had to do with the way eve handled emergent pvp gameplay and that industry and mining did not mesh enough to allow industrialpvp emergent gameplay to compensate for the differenceie defenseless mining vesselspoint 4the real issue is emergent pvp gameplaywell what is this compared to industry it is when ccp gives industry a boost by placeing better refining rates or materials in more riskier space as a motivation for miners to mine there and pvpers also take advantage of said changes in order to gank gank gankwhich has the effect of making all of ccps work pointless and a waste of time since no miner will care that he or she can get those minerals because its not worth the risk since they cant defend themselvesbut eve is an mmo work togetherits a good idea however 00 and lowsec alliances would rather kill miners then protect them which again while part of eve makes the changes pointless since miners and industrialists will not take advantage of the changes due to suchbottom lineif the player base of eve want miners to go into lowsec or null you need to change your own behavior to encourage them to do so atempting to create game mechanics which force miners into low and null will not work all you will do is cause your ships to cost billions of isk per frigatewhat you do not seem to understand is that industrialists dont care what minerals are available where we can buy every thing we need and you those in low and 00 must accept our prices for such and you also must accept our prices on the market if you choose to buy anythingso all these changes do is increase our prices for your items they have absolutely no other effectbecause industry is not the issue pvp isthat being said give miners the ability to defend themselves and they will move to null and low
and your post shows youre not used to doing that1 because it is cheaper to build in highsec this is the only reason and had you a grasp on how the economy of null works you would know this2 there is nothing in lowsec you cannot get in highsec or null a lot safer this is not the fault of the pvpers this is because theres nothing special to mine in lowsec the day ccp adds something to lowsec that cant be mined anywhere else people will start mining there3 and 4 these should not have been two seperate points as 4 is the point while 3 is just supportive first off lowsec and null are two completely different entities which you would know had you ever left highsec ive already covered why there isnt more mining in lowsecthe reason there isnt more mining in null is really the fault of the coalitions do not take this as a grrr goons post try joining any of the major sov holding alliances as an industrialist and youll know what i mean the main coalitions already have their industrial base and dont want to let anyone else in if you want to mine in null youre relegated to the renter corps which live in the poor systems that are constantly patrolled by neuts and reds that know the sov holders dont care about their rentersoh about you little comment about less dead miners heres some numbers for youhulk 10mackinaw 20skiff 4covetor 14retriever 62procurer 6total 116this is the number of mining barges and exhumers zkill has listed as killed in highsec in the 24 hour period of august 29 2014 this is a bit under half the total number of mining barges and exhumers killed total in the same time period and a minute fraction of the total killsyouve been doing a lot of posting lately trying to get every method of gameplay you dont like banned unfortunatly for you the more you post the more it becomes obvious you really dont know what youre talking about
1 um no it isnt corps and alliances in null do not pay any taxes or anything at all or much for building and can tax minerals and lines themselves it is actually profitable to build in 00 or to simply host a station which allows such for others i should know my mains corp owns several and makes billions a month simply by owning them2 actually you can not mine abc ores in highsec not even from the anomalies however you can in lowsec and with the new changes coming if you keep up with these things youd know lowsec ores are about to be super buffedpeople still wont mine in lowsec however again because pvpers will camp the systems waiting for this which is fine and miners are not going to take defenseless mining vessels into a slaughter despite what many pvpers think about carebears they are not stupidso my point about emergent pvp stands here as valid3 i am aware the few industrial individuals in some of the sov super alliances are perfectly safe however this thread is not about the rare few but about the vast majority that do not4 i have not posted a single thread asking for content to be removed or banned isboxer is not ccp content and therefore does not count it is a 3rd party program which enables a single person to control 100s of accounts at once which a single individual would not be able to do at all without it logistically or feasibly and thus since it is artificially emulated is therefore in my opinion  botting which is against the eula which clearly states that any action which could not be facilitated by a single person at the keyboard without using an artificial program is considered by the eula botting and banable
from that rant its quite obvious you haventdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
you make a lot of assumptions that are laughably wrong
1 now we get to the my main post i call bullst on this post on your main i do ive lived in null both in sov holding alliances and in renter corps something you have no experience in from the way you post then again you also claim to be an it guy2 train another level in reading comprehension note the phrase i used you cannot get in highsec or null a lot safer again theres nothing you can mine in lowsec that you cant get elsewhere this supposed emergent pvp of yours would not stop the intelligent miners if there was anything worth mining in lowsec as for your claim lowsec ores are about to get buffed prove it i read the devblogs and have seen nothing to support your claim3 the vast majority that do not mine in null do so by choice wether misinformed on the danger because they dont want to be in renter corps or simply dont want to live in null it is still their choice and generally not the fault of the big scary pvpers4 since you want to bring in your banisboxer thread know this it is your opinion isboxing is botting since this is ccps game it is their opinion that matters not yours
my point with that post is that if you give mining ships the ability to defend themselves more miners will participate in the whole nulllowsec areasbonuses to defense are not enough it does no good to simply survive until more people show up they need to be able to neutralize their attacker so they can either warp out or continue miningi do not see an issue with that in fact it accomplishes and fixes some of the issues so many complain about and hey the pvpers should be happy as carebears will finally be pvping i mean really its win win for everyoneoh and i am not allowed to post on my main its alliancecorp policy there are obvious reasons for this both strategic and politicalagain on isboxer according to the eulas definition of botting it is exactly that and ccp wrote the eula which defines very clearly what botting is yes it is ccps decision whether to enforce it or not but it is what it is
armed mining barges have already been covered in fi to death so no for all the same reasons as previously posted in those threadsthe reason your alliance doesnt let your supposed main post on forums is because they dont want to be associated with shiptoasts like yours your alliance probably also has a rule saying you cant post with alts either most with that rule dolastly its ccps allows isboxer because what it does can be done with pure hardware this was demonstrated to get isboxer unbanned in the first place bet you didnt know isboxer was banned from eve at one time had you read that entire thread you would know this your whiney examples are the oddities not the norm for isboxer users but thats another thread and since alll of this thread has already been covered in other threads time for it to be locked
isboxer is software not hardware there is no chip you plug into your computer that lets you multibox its a program that automatically launches your accounts through inner space of which you can log every single one of them in simultaneously and then control all of then simultaneously meaning with one pw entry of the keyboard or mouse also with a single clickcontrolling more then one account or character at a time with a single click or press of the keyboard is the very definition of botting according to the eula the eula clearly states all accounts and characters must be controlled independently and individuallyany simultaneous control of multiple characters through nonindependent methods is botting
but back on topic please enlighten me as to why armed mining barges are a bad idea to much of a risk to the ganker poor pvp pilot afraid to lose his ship to a carebear
procurer loltasticdrone damage amplifier iidamage control iimedium shield extender iiadaptive invulnerability field iiwarp scrambler iistasis webifier iistrip miner imedium antiem screen reinforcer imedium core defense field extender imedium core defense field extender ihobgoblin ii x5hornet ec300 x5i use this in lowsec for bait mining which often turns into just mining because few people want to engage this ship by themselvesnow granted the procurer has a narrow engagement envelope but it works way better than it should for a ship that is not designed for combat get 2 or three of these working together and you can give most small gang pvpers a run for their money get a logi ship as backup and you can actually hold the field pretty well against spectacular oddsalso people do mine in lowsec you just dont see them often which is rather the point because if they are seen then people will start hunting for thembut the real reason not many people mine in lowsec is because it requires real effort and vigilance in high and nullsec space you can semiafk while mining and still remain relatively safe
because it is already armed every mining ship has a drone bay what more do you want for a mining ship a skiff can tank so much that some people use it to gank gankers several kills on the killboards to support this many without concord being involved really this thread is nothing more than a now unstealthed nerf ganking threadby the way a pvper is never afraid to lose his ship if he was he wouldnt be a pvper
bugsy while we can agree to disagree on one or two points you will find that we have many thoughts in common however there should also be a mechanic to hunt active targets as well it should be fair but both parties should have an equal base chance of success now as too jumping to bookmarks that would be severely overpowered i am sure there are threads on that specific issue your idea of removing auto cycle of cloaks is sound but has issues as wellgood points please keep posted to this thread as i am working on a summary of ideas to address this and would value your inputthanks
and it still doesnt solve the problem on why cloakers go afk in systems in the first place specially if they are pvp cloakers and that because targets tend to run away as soon as they land on the gate so yahmany times they have to be afk for days to get that target to come back so that they can get a kill
ahh another person who would have her prey sit with all modules off and say kill me please so you would have me believe that your answer to afk cloaking is that everything undocked is instantly scrammed and webbed until such time as you choose to open fire
this proposal would eliminate overview clutter if a lot of ships that are currently not piloted are in your overview this can be the case in wh posses as well as when doing probe scans in a system you can eliminate un piloted ships from showing up and knowing how many hostile pilots are active or at the very least logged in this could be very important for whs since local is does not show anyone
if anything the csm should pressure ccp to encourage more people to use isboxer

saying a mining barge is armed is laughable they have enough dps to kill highsec rats maybe lowsec rats depending on system sec status unless your willing to sacrifice your needed mineral income for about 30 more dps and its still no mach for most gankersa ganking frigate can do about 500700 dpsa mining vessal well go with a skiff can do about 150 topsits not even comparable pvp wise if you flew one and tried to kill someone with it youd know what your saying just isnt true the skiff is the only mining vessel even remotely close to being able to hold its own against frigates and like that other guy posted its window of usefulness is slim and you have to severely gimp your mining capabilities because it is obviously not designed for combat in any way form or fashionccp will most likely eventually add an armed mining vessal simply because it is a role and niche industrial pilots simply do not have access to in game and is one thing the game is really missing to help merge the 2 more fluidly
show me a ganking frigate that does 500700 dps
not even my fullgank enyo goes that much over 400 dps but yeah op should just go with my procurer fit it easily gets 55k ehp and when properly skilled can handily kill battleship npcs in lowsecalso lily procurers and skiffs when fit for combat are doing 200 dps not a lot mind you but nothing to sniff at either its the average dps of a tech 1 frigate with a battlecruiser class tank behind it
what you want a mining barge capable of entry level battleship damage battlecruiser apparently the concept of mining barge simply eludes your grasp what youre asking for is the equivalent of putting this on thisyour errors are further compounded by your apparent lack of comprehension as to how combat works in eve according to you dps is everything and being able to tank incoming damage is meaningless i put shahfluffers procurer fit into eft and my lowest skilled mining alt can get 64k ehp out of it how long do you think itll take a full ganked fit frigate to deplete 64k ehp keep in mind a full ganked fit frigate has no tank to speak of so will be very vulnerable to the flight of light drones unleashed by the procureryes this is exactly right not only that its how ccp  designed it after the most recent change to mining bargesright let me say it again because youre obviously having difficulty understanding this simple concept it is a mining ship not a combat shipno they will not likely add an armed mining vessel the mining vessels currently designed to actually engage in combat are very well done when you consider that theyre not combat vessels
while maria may have meant what you inferred it may also be less drasticwhile i admittedly assume much by this i like to think players want a balanced play experience too much or too little chance of success and the game becomes too predictablei feel a good trade off for cloaked vulnerability would be matching vulnerability on the pve sideboth sides capable of more than compensating for this vulnerability by making proper effortsupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
thank you for you input nikk i was hoping to elicit a response after i re read what i wrote and it was  a little more than i wanted you are right most players desire balanced game play
this is falling back to the wrong idea that cloaked ships should be used for tackle thats not their job people clearly manage to get plenty of kills every single day so if you are finding yourself unable the problem is you and the tactical choices youve made
