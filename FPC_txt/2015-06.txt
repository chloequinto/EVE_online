i just read that cover mining frigate  prospect can jump trough and fitt covert cynosural generator as well as blocade runnersbut there is no ore ship capable to fitt and use an jump portal and i ask myself why the hell miners shouldnt have their own covert mining operation deep in enemy space the basic for the idea is that prospec find a place in for examle deep not used part of 00 space for example trough wh and call for friends but not trough wh that is not so reliable for transport numerous heavy ore ships but refit trough mobile depot to cynosural covert generator and folks jump or bridge trough it mine a bistotcrokite and when full ore bays put a pos and copress ores jump back to empire all operation takes max 30 minutes so is highly probable that nobody would never know about it exept participantsthe ore blackops should have high range to reach such unused deepspaceso there is an idea to remove exploits like using this method to moving modules and resources exept ore all jumpablebridgeable ships should have small cargo and vast ore bay
that would mean killing the cargo bay size of every covert ops ship i am all for new ships and tacticshowever a ship already exists with these capabilities it is called a rorqual it just doesnt use a covert cyno and cant make a jump bridge however you can get the same effect with a rorqual and a black ops battleship
true but you have to admit that a t2 black ops orca would be totally hot
i would add new types of missions something more pictorial and more story driven than the current oneslike thishere we have an example of how eve in stations adds a greater variety and intensity of missions combining game mechanics from the existing core game with new ones it also doesnt have to be linear different ways to get a solution and to end it would be nice
sounds like adding a whole new game to an existing game do you think the playerbase is big enough to warrant creating something like this and creating something which would encourage people to stay docked in the station moar pve sounds more like mass effect style game calm down miner as you pointed out people think they can get away with stuff they would not in rl like for example illegal mining  ima wreckyou
i wouldnt say that missions which are more complex define a new game but they can tell a story which can be continued with every update giving people a reason more to stay or even to jointhe question how such missions which force the capsuleers to fly into space should encourage them to stay docked i cant answer i say its rather the oppositeis the playerbase big enough for that i really dont know i could point to self invented facts like with gambling halls on stations nobody would undock same with quartiers which can be modified for both examples you need isk to get that you have to go out into spaceafter all wis will add definitely a new type of gameplay to the existing game is it per se bad to have more ways to play this game to add more possibilities to spend your ingame money no it isntwill it wipe out the pvp player base and make them docked staying 247 in their corp headquarters no it wontwill it provide eve with a new face or facette of it outwards yes it will is that bad no it isnt
the miner bridge module could have restrictions to pass only ore ships or something like that totaly miner character would notshould not train battleships to lvl 5  they could and should have an alternative like thisit would be a nice addition to high sec miners after the shortage of zydrine an mexallon  not obtainable in high and low sec systems right now
you may have noticed the lower and lower number of pilots online i shouldnt be able to easily get into jita on the weekend or during midday in the week and yet no jita congestion we need to bring those days back but how ive mentioned before that eve players arent likely to go door to door like mormon missionaries preaching the word of eve online and word of mouth by other means doesnt seem to be bringing people inhas ccp mentioned anything about any advertising
maybe we should stop with all the griefing and player harmful behaviour that prevents organized groups of players from expanding into the universeessentially its players ourselves that are guilty for creating a newbie unfriendly environment
pvp is pretty central to eve online however are you suggesting a no nonconsensual pvp area of null or something i think wed see interesting trends from that but itd still be against the grain of eve
might want to add seller names while youre at it of selecting exactly which order to buy from
while i agree with the above statement im afraid that im cynical enough to believe all this proposal would encourage is the creation of yet more marketing alts in solo corps never leaving station and existing expressly to insulate the source corporations from just such shooty interaction
you sir need to stop posing your horribad ideasfirst gather the materials for a station on your own all of them and set it up somewhere after youve done that you can argue about why stations should be destroyable and not a moment before
that and he is trying to push forward an assumption to argue the point that changing security settings triggers said criminalsuspect flagsplease closelock the thread
hello pilotsas some of you already know corebloodbrothers decided to resign from his csmx duties for a number of reasons as per our decision from the last year we have rerun the stv script without corebloodbrothers and it is my pleasure to welcome gorski car back on board  if you have any questions regarding this or any comments please feel free to post in this thread ccp leeloo

welcome backmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
welcome to the csm gorski
takbirrrrrrrrrr
o7 corebloodbrothers and thankso gorski glad i voted for you
very good news 
the only real suggestion i have is to keep submitting bug reports and post in the forums threads relevant to the topic that concerns you if something really bothers you mail the csm directly  every mail we receive is discussed as for feedback from the csm specifically we give ccp a ton of feedback on a wide variety of topics sometimes our concerns are heeded and our advice taken other times its ignored however even when ccp does heed ours or players advice with this new 6 weeks cycle the completion date and release date can sometimes be only a week apart a good example of this is the icon changes as you mentionfurthermore there are certain aspects of eves development that cannot be tested on singularity prior to release a good example of this is the new sov system even with the duality wargames having gone on for three weeks ccp is hesitant to make changes to the system based on the meta that evolved on duality with 100isk ships and modules combat is not the same player density is not the same logistics is not the same it could potentially lead to an issue where you balance a feature for singulariy or duality specifications but the content falls flat on tranquility coming back to the ship icons i personally really liked them until i got horribly confused in my first large fleet fight on tqtldr  i understand where youre coming from but singularity and tranquility have differences that must be respected that being said the majority of stuff can and should be tested on singularity first but its up to those testers to post comments and file bug reports so that the developers can actually see the feedback

in my humble marketing opinion ccp needs to court social influencers aka gaming celebrities to play evei am by all accounts an ftier youtuber i have about 25k subscribers and maybe another 5k fans via other platforms yet by my own analytics at least 5000 players have started or returned to eve via referrals from my contentnow imagine someone like day9 who has 20x my fan base starts playing eve that could be 100k new and returning eve playersnow imagine hiring or incentivizing 100 ftier youtubers this strategy has flaws but is already working for several aaa developers
this is summer time a low time for eve plus a few more possible factors at work like players waiting for the new sov or the removal of isboxers i would not say the current low numbers are too surprising or direefforts to bring new players in should be focused at the start of collegeschool ie september not the middle of summer but imho the main problem is not really about bringing new players in is making those players that come in and try eve to stay if we do not improve efforts toward retention then efforts to bring new players are just a wastefrom the newcomer perspective there are so many systems that favor vets high cost implants offgrid links purple modules fancy expensive techpirate ships existing networks and batphones without mentioning the fact that established powers can so easily spy and collapsescam newer corpsalliances or vet players with multiple accounts paid from the taxes of the many and top down income that most new players cant even dream of unless they stay engaged in the game for a few yearsnew players must be presented with perspectives that they also can achieve something within a few months i believe fozziesov can deliver on this perspective which of course goes against the interests of the established powersplayers this is a very difficult balance to maintain but retention is the core of the subject at the moment more so than acquisition of new players
going way tangent here but you got me thinking of wows whats your game commercials with mr t william shatner etc i was envisioning one with r lee ermey a raid goes into a lair someone messes up and pulls a group early causing chaos then you hear sgt hartman  who the f pulled that which one of you elfkissing twinkletoed commie maggots just signed his own death warrant nobody the fairyfing godmother did it outstandingthen the camera would pull back and youd see a pink haired female gnome in charge and hear im r lee ermey warrior whats your game jackwagonend advertising tangent
i agree they should be removed but at the same time we need a replacementtheyre only reason why i will not go into low security space or wormhole space i simply cannot afford to replace them theyre the most expensive thing i own
thank god you signed your post otherwise we would have never knew who wrote italso gorski hi whatever
a skilled csm replaced by another skilled csm member good luck to bothcsm wins again
thank you for your service coreblood and gratz for making it on the csm team gorski with the new fozzie sov being launched any day now has the csm looked at the companys promises of treaties source

the code for these wasnt completed in time for the dominion expansion release and the feature was scrapped
did the same happen to the mercenary marketplace from the inferno patch  mercenary marketplace for corporations and alliances to hire themselves out for mercenary jobs in a more official mannersource
eve is science fiction that has by nature not such a large fan base like other genres im pretty sure that many people who are into science fiction and online games have already tried eve and decided for or against it for whatever reasonso who are the new players for which kind of player ccp should make advertising this is a question we have to ask ourselvesa shiny tv spot at the prime time sure will get a lot of subscriptions but if the game cant fulfill the promises it is pointless the subscriptions will climb fast and after some time go even so fast back downwhat long term effect has it to pay youtubers or twitchers to play this game already the point you have to pay them to play is an argument against the gamefor me the strength of this game is its diversity thats something that needs more attention not only the pvp elements so eve can reach a broader variety of players and potential subscribersi dont think that eve is too hard for new player to start yes people can be assholes and some of them will always be but in terms of isk i think its easier today if you dont agree with the latter throw your venture away and start mining with an iteron
it would help if we had avatars that could move about past their confines of 4 walls world of warcraftguild wars 2final fantasy xivplanetside 2the secret worldriftlord of the rings onlinerunescape 3star wars the old republicall have avatars that can walk further than 20 meters i hope we can one day to in ambulationdont get me wrong it is nice to fly in space ships across a galaxy but the captains quarters are so restrictive
unfortunately they fired the staff that got 75 of cq done if i read the article from last year correctly think of your spaceship as your confines but you move your confines with you rather than moving out of them unless you get ganked and podded then you move out of your confines mostly and if a corpse collector comes along it gets new confines while you buy or build a different set of confines for your new clone

also ccp should remember how important is the translation of the client in the first hours of user experience one of the reason that make the spanish speaking comunity so small is that it takes greater interest to pay a game that is so hard to play alone when even the basic client is not in your languagewhen tou start playing the game is very different to be pointed to a tutorial on your language and a official spanish channel where you can ask silly questions and get recruited by a spanish speaking corp than making you bother to make the effort of doing it on choppy english somewhere elseimho removing the language channels was a big mistake im sure that player retention of spanish speaking who join a spanish speaking corp is much much higher and corps used to recruit on the spanish channel ccp could ask the community for help on the translation a volunteer could translate a menUFFFD or a mission text with little effort and all that would be left would be a review thats half work misions could be translated to slang for pirate factions woulnt be glorious to have angel cartel speaking mexican slang serpentis speaking porteUFFFDo and guristas speaking gitanillo style
certain subcaps like t3s are overdue for a rebalance but at least some balancing effect is still in play when was the last time a supercap fleet was killed by subcaps alone
several years ago when they announced the up coming implementations of walking in stations some 5 or 6 years ago i think one of the options that someone would have is renting a booth in the bazaar on the station i was looking forward to opening a pub i suppose that dream will never some to pass
the amount of time it takes to entosis a crap end system is 18 minutes5 minute warm up time this is to only to do 1 structure that is the same time it takes me to go play a game in a fun game i gurantee you will lose players over this horrible new sov system which has somehow made even more time
lelob isnt right
i have not read the rest of this thread but your op makes me so angry i just have to reply to it well that is partly the reason why they cost 20 times as much as a standard carrier or 10 times as much as a dread or whatever scale you want to apply have you ever tried moving a sole super somewhere good luck with that they are strong as a group and as a group only erm are you bitter cause you dont have one you know you can just buy them theres a forum for that if you and your friends can grind the isk together what stops you from acquiring these supposed weapons of mass destruction and wrecking havoc to all those poor bastards that cannot afford themi really dont understand what your point is if they are so overpowered why dont youyour corp just acquire a few have you ever actually tried fighting with supers you have to drop all your tank and refit specifically for tracking to be able to hit battlecruisers or smaller and thats with fighters then forget about fbs so you get a lot less dps already many people buy officer items for several billion isk just to be able to max out their tracking are you saying a 50b super carrier with fit is not allowed to hit a  sabre that isnt warping offplease field half a dozen supers and fight actual people and then well see how much that i win button works out for youyou obviously have no idea what it means to commit supers into a fight in 00 otherwise you wouldnt be saying thissorry but you are obviously ranting about something way above your experience so i doubt people will take you seriously
so my main competitor in providence area took my votes to get his csm position and then steps down leaving us both out of it very well done
not as long ccp thinks that people play this game only for shooting at stuffthey are creating a sandbox and giving us mostly weapons to play with that reminds me somehow of this citate from henry ford people can have the model t in any color  so long as its black i know he probably never said that but nevertheless i still want this game more sandboxier with more different toys to play with
the thing is its going to need way more people than just you to want this for it to even have a chance of happening ccp got burned badly by incarnas reception and i highly doubt theyll push for anything like it it again without massive support from their own players simply saying i want this is not enough
true words fortunately the previous 9 pages of this thread demonstrate that it isnt just me they also contain some examples of what to do with it and why it is not just a nice to have thingi understand that ccp is cautious regarding changes to their flagship game investing resources in other projects wod dust valkyrie legion is presumably the easier solution to open new money sources im not sure if this strategy has paid off since incarna
so go play that game be sure to contract me your stuff since you wont be needing it anymore
dont give it to him give it to me i promise to take better care of it
for those of you that are curiousthe council of stellar management is designed to represent the interest of the entire player basewhile i feel that alot of good has come out the the csm i also feel that new players have for the most part been marginalizedas a new player i find it more than a little unsettling that our elected representatives a dont truly represent the actual players and b have on many occasions used their influence to further their personal or alliance goalsi am not condemning the idea of the csm its past or present members i am speaking to the new players and players yet to join eve i feel that we need a voice but to achieve that we need to be proactivemake sure you get out and votei support liam oliphants i believe he will provide a fresh perspective and a new player voice for a new new eden
while a lot of you will look at this thread and wonder why i didnt start it ive actually been on the fence on the whole thing im currently a very new player to eve online i didnt know the csm was a thing until a day or so ago i think lemon is right though all of the voice that is more than likely getting through to ccp is from players who have been here for quite a while just like with any group of representatives stagnation is never a good thing all players need to be equally represented to the best of the csms ability for a more accurate portrayal of the voice of eve onlines player baseso consider this my official campaign for csm ill get back to everyone here on the forums as i come up with what i hope to bring to the table as it comes to me remember i am a new player i need to do some research figure out things my overall goal at the moment is to hope to make eve online even more new player friendly not to say i want to dumb the game down not at all i like the overall complexity of the game and i am for the most part having fun with it the game would still be niche and not for everyone to just be able to pick up and play my goal isnt to flood eve with new players because it becomes too accessibleso yeah umm vote for me for the next elections if you want a fresh voice for the csm
eve is a beautiful and wonderful game maybe new players just need an advocatevote liam oliphants for csm xi
there is no sov in wspace with that you cannot gain any bonus to increase the population generation of relicdata sites combat sites ore fields etc also you cannot gain the benefit of reduced fuel costs to poss which may be null and void when they bring in the citadelsill first off state that i would love to see an occasional ice field pop up in wspace make it a neutral ice field so when you process the ice you get no racial specifically needed isotopes but you could still gain the heavy water and liquid ozone needed by all this would still require the sov holders inside the wh who have a pos deployed to leave and go to the market or friendlies who would have it to be soldtradedwhy cant we deploy a wspace specific version of an ihub make the bonuses for owning sov different too ie sov holders gain shieldarmor hpresist bonus while the invaders do not or industrial ships like transports or even mining vessels can get bonuses to warp core shieldarmor resist etc also there needs to be a change made to the directional scanner if a player brings in a covert ops cloaking device enabled ship the dscan is completely useless most ships initially scanning a wh would be cloaky ops anyways the only chance you have of detecting their presence before they are uncloaking and scramming you is the instant they initiate warp when they jump inside the instant they start moving they are cloaked again with that being said why not make there a device or very intensive maintenance required structure to block cloak im 96 with gallente mainly due to being a noob with the game and running caldari missions which fought a lot of gallente faction ships now when i fly through gallente space they prohibit use of my cloaking devices along with killing any ship remaining in space for any length of time why cant we do the same in our 10 status wormhole why cant we the wh residents deploy an array that blocks use of cloaking devices for everyonepeople will argue but bfe there is a waiting period after uncloak before they can lock onto your shipsure there is and it is still quicker than initiating warp in a skiff strip mineretcbut bfe there are bonuses already in place on the skiff that boost its warp core and you can still add three more modules to boost itsure you can which are all null and void with a bubble sure this is all part and parcel of being in 00 space i understand that however this is wh space separate from nullsec wspace should also act differently
is it april 1st alreadydestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
relevantwhere oh where do i start with this pile of male bovine fecal matter1 no you may not build supers in jspace as to using the various upgrades jspace currently the only place where half a dozen guys can make 500 million iskhr each running the sites that are already there so no you dont get to upgrade that2 without the isotopes to make fuel blocks there is zero point in having ice inside jspace so no3 jspace already get various effects based on whatever black hole pulsar etc that is in the constellation this suggestion is redundant4 why because you would ruin everything it means to live in jspace no one would have the ability to stage fleets large enough to evict anyone because they would never be able to remain cloaked you throw out the term very intensive maintenance as if there are no wormhole entities willing and capable of performing this maintenance 2357 there are larger alliances occupying jspace to whom this would not even be a minor irritation while the smaller groups would not be able to use it at all5 ill combine the last two because theyre really the same thing your inability to properly pilot a skiff or any other vessel it seems does not make a case for changes to a vast portion of the game6 lastly may bob smite thee and cast thee from his domain forever no amount of exotic dancers in the hold of a carrier selfdestructed at the sun will ever make up for this posthave a good day
obviously eve will always be a pvp game at heart and it has so much heartdont ever change eve we love you just the way you are 
vote liam oliphants for csm xinew  and future players need a voice
wrong forum however i see youve already created one in the proper forum therefore i will lock this one
yeah sodo you know who the members of the csm are and what platform they ran on
when i first started eve i thought the same way you did sara however upon analyzing the structure of the game youll start to learn why this is a bad ideamost people claim that eve is a pvp game its not its also not a pve game its a game where pvp and pve combine to create the wonderful universe we live inthe market is mostly player run to have this kind of market you need to have supply and demand supply is carried out by the pve players without whom the game would quickly collapse demand is created by losses mostly by pvp again without pvp this game would quickly collapsethe mechanics of eve work in a beautiful harmony between pvp players and pve players its this aspect plus the camaraderie created by corporations which has given this game the remarkable lifespan it has had and will continue to havenot supported
i would quit eve intermediatelythe only act that keeps pve interesting every plexmissionanomaly can be found in detail on the internet is other players that are praying on you your loot and making obsticals an npc never couldi can have the most fun by getting somewhere in hostile space run a site escalation of plex and get out of there with the loot it gives great satisfaction mostly because it isnt certain outcomeand i create gameplay for the hunters and they for me sometimes i win sometimes i loseit great fun try it
allow me to introduce you to the dersen lowery law of game design any mechanic introduced into a game no matter how badly designed and regardless of the intention behind it will attract people who find it appealing for one reason or another maybe it would be worthwhile to hit some high sec belts and mission hubs and ask people try not to torpedo them first you might get better answersmining is one examplehilmar spent a lot of time mining but heres a better one the giant wall of structure hp that was the signature of dominion sov was intended to discourage people from destroying the structures howd that work out
so the op has had three posts in about three years this one was violated by a goon and likes bondage fashion quality posts all of them
do with what you will with attributes plants and whatever you like really does not mean fck all any wayhowever if this is an attempt to mitigate risk aversion you are flat wrong there is not a damn thing you can do to get the numb nut behind the key board from cringing and rubbing hisherits hands if this is a veiled attempt to close the skill gap between newbies and older players you are an idiot and have no clue what is eve is about
hello fellow playersif you look on the market youll see a wide variety of clothing options available with the art assets already completed and visible however the actual number of those items of variant colors have yet to be introducedtherefore i propose that we introduce those clothing options into the game both in the aurum store and the market eventually by players who purchase it from the aurum store for resale if we had a new eden store option for each type of clothing structure dress command pants etc then allow the viewing and purchase of said color combinations through a dropdown on the detail screen we could introduce these longawaited items into the gamethis would require a bit of code for the dropdown menu and such but since the art assets are already existent no further art work would need to be done this is the main thrust of this postps id also recommend as a side benefit the addition of gloves as an apparel category id really like to see some fingerless gloves or similar items in the storethank you for your review
dont forget silk pyjamas i like that feeling on my whatever thumbs up
no i dont i suppose this is the part where i go study my eve online history so i can see how its changed over the years and see if any mistakes that were made so that i can not repeat those same mistakes or make a similar one let me go do some research and ill get back to you on thisedit after doing a little bit of research into the csm x campaign ive discovered that i dont care i am a new player to eve online and my point in running is to be a voice for the new players i cant say that i will be able to speak on behalf of all of the new players but my opinion as a new player shouldnt be to far off from most of them true i dont care about going pew pew in space but there are honestly a handful of other games that allow me to blow up ships in space if i honestly wanted to do that eve means so much more to me than the combat aspect of it and id like to see the other aspects growim not here to further some secret agenda im here to maybe one day help a game deal with its new player experience with what little research i did into the csm x campaign i noticed that a lot of the people who said they were specifically catering to the new player crowd specifically were not elected that tells me that as long as the general public hasnt changed by the time the next elections come around that i probably dont stand a chance of being elected either it saddens me to see such a great game have a player base willing to stagnate itself by not allowing the game to have a voice from a more recent player base if the bittervets want to keep electing more bittervets into csm thats fine older players deserve a voice just as much as the new players do however when only the older players are getting their voice heard on topics it will skew everything the csm stands for in that direction and the content ccp will release as a result will be likely skewed as wellpeople probably wonder why eve has such a terrible player turnover and i have a good guess why this game has been flooded with opinions and voices from players who want to see the game benefit themselves and players like them and all of the newer players have either quit the game before their opinion can even be heard or their voices have been drowned out by the overwhelming roar or cry if you will of all the older more experienced playershowever please correct me if i am wrong
the entire point of this thread  and associated campaign  is about getting an actual new player on csm xi saying yeah so instead offering any honest criticism or actual debate is the type of attitude that encouraged me to support liam in the first place the csm would benefit from having the voice of a new player in its ranks especially so considering that ccp is very interested in getting new players malcanis better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt3 3 3lemon 
ugh i just hate how its year round campaigning now no break after an election its right on the next one if i wanted a babyfaced infant in charge id have voted for kevin ruddrimshotok where do you stand on the following issuessome say the new player experience does not adequately prepare new players for the harsh realities of new eden i propose that aura returns to the tutorial only this time she is here for vengeance for her unfair dismissal she ganks the player with her catalyst taunts them and tells them to htfu thoughtshave you stopped murdering puppies yes or no answers only thanks i dont want your life storyhow old is too old is chance not good enough for you are you interested in a timely torpedo delivery straight to your hullwhats your life storyhave you accepted james 315 as your personal saviour of highsecwhy should people vote for somebody trying to fill a niche and yet cant be bothered to do some basic research to establish whether or not that niche is already being filledwhat are you actual proposals for the npe concrete proposals enough wishywashy im for the newbie fix the new player experience stuff
why would ccp be so interested in a new player that has no idea what eve is all aboutit would be the same thing as walking into someones business not knowing anything about it or very little and start telling them to change this or that
my role isnt to be some saint or hero to come fix all your problems it isnt to be some villian who came and wrecked everything either my role is to be a voice for change preferably good change but change nonetheless with my little experience from my corp ive joined ive come to the realization that a lot of bittervets like to use a circular logic defense mechanism when you try to talk to them about how eve needs to change youre all sitting on your self made thrones for the empires youve built over time well heres a history lesson for you guys empires dont last they crumble and fade over time some were lucky enough to make it into the history books others were forgotten if people are so adamant on keeping eves player base stagnant then the game is going to die off and everyone loses because eve is such a great game eve would be better if it had the ability to change and evolve with its player base what are you bittervets going to do with all this stuff youve done in eve when you die not your character either im talking about you the player dying everything youve done wont matter i think its in everyones best interest that eve continue to live and evolve over time so that future generations of players have the chance to be able to experience what a great game this is your killboards and amount of isk you earned over your lifetime while recorded for all of history will be just that a record in the history books after we are all gone and future generations pick up this game they wont care about most of the things that we did either some of them might see our records has challenges and try to break them and set new records however none of that will matter if the game stagnates and dies off
removed some off topic posts

better incentivize youtube content im a recent trial account gone full subscriber and it was the this is eve trailer that got me to jump on a longing standing desire of minebut it was the plethora of really great content by youtubers like wingspan hey johnnypew scott manley and others that made me hit that upgrade to full account button
people need good space to find their play style to find their place and excitement in new eden basically revamping npc null and parts of non fw lowsec would give players a place to do thissov even fozzie sov isnt for everyone people want a small gang haven some place with personality where they can actually learn the game at their own pace and get involved in their own stories and happenings npc null and nonfw lowsec just need available and accessible income for newer players sources that will reward their risk taking versus their hi sec cousins the security status tags are a good example sov is still way too impersonal for many as is the security of leveling ones raven in hisec you want people to get involved with the social aspect of the game as fast as possible making places worth living in worth braving in new small groups of people could make peoples game play experience much better to the point where they actually have chances to see what makes eve actually different than other games
now imagine someone like day9 streaming the npe to 600000 viewerscan you think of any reason why that might not end well
people like you are great for getting people to take a look at eve so was the battle of br come to that attracting that initial attention has actually not really been a big problem for eve  its eyecatching it gets news stories in the nongaming media as well as the gaming media and so on so yes by all means ccp should put some effort into attracting some social media types but before they do that they need to think about what is going to get broadcastthe big problem is and always has been bridging that gap between ok i ran the tutorials what now and yeah ill probably be playing this game on and off until tq goes darkccp will need to make good and goddamb sure that those other flisters are broadcasting a decent answer to the what now question or all theyll achieve is to show 100000 potential customers that they shouldnt even bother trying
the problem here is that we have two types of personalitiesthe ones who can entertain himself and the ones who need someonesomething who says what to do most people are of the latter kind even if many of them may disagreeand here we have a problem a youtubertwitcher leads through something same with articles and books but eve is different after the tutorials the player is left alone many of you would now suggest that the newbie should look for a corp to find someone who shows himher how much fun eve really isexactly here we have again the problem that the player has to be active by himself to get to that point he has to look for a corp has to ask to try eventually to leave to try it with a new corp again and so on that all doesnt look like fun for me it also gives a new player a lot of time to think about the differences between selected youtube content a few single battles which made it into the press and the reality of evethats why i would like to see more npc and story driven content or even wis keeping new players busy showing them the diversity and possibilities within new eden and give them more time to get into touch with real peoplesthe end of the story is without changing the game itself youtubers and adds alone wont get many new players
history is a great leson that we all fail to grasp and take lessons fromone thing that is blatanly clear is that everyone is so focused on what is here and now but have not bothered to ask the questions as to how we got here how did eve grow to where it is now and what were the methods for eve to attract and retain new players i mean lets get real for just a moment peak night was at one point 3500 people if you step and look at teh growth something happened to create the growth what was itwhat was it that recently changed that hurt eves growthif you really want to approach this correctly you have to sift through the changes of the game and find the things in the game that held folks like myself for long it baffles my as to all of a sudden we have issues of attracting new players but we had not had a problem really in the past personally my view is that eve has lost some of the cold dark ruthless feel to it and has lost it unique appeal the forcing of a product from niche market to a broader market can spell the end of most products  stephen herfst
dear csmit is weird that a station egg is destructible but a station is notsource
but all of eve is pvp how can you have a pve only server
if you have questions feel free to contact me as i have already said that i will not be running for a position next term i may have been in more elections than any other candidate maybe i would recommend that you go back through last years analysis of candidates to make sure that you are not immediately dismissed it can happen if you start out on the wrong foot mmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
thank you it means a lot to me that you are willing to at least offer help ill be sure to keep that in consideration as time goes on
first off although i have been around a bit i am not a bitter vet not even sure why that term is even used change for the sake of change is not a solution and to make a change is not moving forward a qualified well thought balanced reasoning to make a change is something i can work with even if i do not agree with it i can understand it and work with ityou on the other hand with your diatribe of hate towards anyone that has had any sort of success or has invested in sort of time seems bent marginalizing players that have stuck with this game and ccp through all the frustrations trials and tribulations through out the years actually you should probably thank a bitter vet for sticking with the game so you and others can enjoy it also
i dont even have an official platform as far as what i would like to address as far as actual ingame mechanics and stuff goes the next elections are still quite a ways away from my understanding ive told everyone i would get back to them as i figure things out besides isnt the whole point of the csm to be representatives of the players of eve that makes it a similar function as the house of representatives here in the us to me it seems both systems are flawed because not everyone is being equally being represented without getting too much into religion do some research on the house and youll see that the majority of its members are christian in some form or fashion while if you were to look at the us population not all of us are christian i myself am an atheist im not being properly represented by that fact alone thats all just a small portion of it too the lgbt community isnt being properly represented eitherwhich leads me to the csm new players arent being properly represented well here i am running for csm to represent new players new players arent going to understand everything about eve i dont either new players arent as experienced as the older players im not either new players are going to make mistakes i have and will continue to mistakes no one is perfect
thanks for the informative link one thing i still dont get is reading about incarna is always about the nex store and the price policy about ingame items which dont do anything game breaking only sparsely there are informations about wis between the linesand yet wis is used by many old player as scapegoat for the failure of the incarna release something that doesnt fit in my opinion
so i was and still am very much in favour of incarnawis but even i had issues with the initial release and thus i was part of the people posting on the rage threadnought back thenbut i still want to see the door opened and i know i am not the only one who was raging back then yet wants to see the door openedi only mention this because some people seem to think that everyone who took part in the summer of rage is against further wis development i know thats not truealso when i look at the graphs for new players and peak concurrent users incarna seems to not have done too much damage but the last monthsyears of fixing core mechanics does not appear to work anymore to keep those numbers up as far as i can tell
eve online is a game about meta politics the null sec shitelords saw that the company did the following and changed the perception of ambulation now known as walking in stattions wis to further their cause for flying in space fis1 csm was told by the company no resources were available for at least 18 months this covered the time frame of incarna to be used on any of the csm ideas this would be the internet space ship part  serious businesssince the csm is a player voted organization and null sec alliances having larger constituents this meant the message was delivered indirectly to these peoplesource
i support this also shields take longer than armor if im not mistaken full rebalance of missiles should include rebalancing missile train times
you talk a lot about representation but this requires identification from those who choose to vote for you  i dont see much of an expression of your opinions about the game what are you doing in eve why whats good whats bad why and how it shall go in future in your opinion the alternative is to shine with your actions in game so that people know what you stand for but this requires time and effort of course you dont like pvp thats what i read but is there more
not sure why you brought up lbgt religion or politics this is video game not a platform for your own political and social views now to correct you 764  of the population of the united states declares themselves as christians so your analogy of trying to draw that the majority of the representatives do not represent the majority of the population is erroneous by declaring a run for some representative seat for a video game community and all you spew is change is very disingenuous change for any of us may have different meanings when you actually discuss what change means with in the same group of like minded individuals change still has different meanings and each individual may vote as to what they view as the change the want but when it comes down to it they have been tricked into believing this is what the platform is and becomes quickly disappointed and bitter towards the systembecause the change they voted for was not to be so far you have not presented a single thing that new players are screaming for that requires representation all you will aquire is a bunch of low information voters to make changes to a video game that they have no idea why it needs to be changed except for some emotionally invested ideas that really either been addressed or some veiled attempt to make some changes that benefit a small majority of the player base
the main problem with making new players your base for votes is the fact that a majority of new players dont vote they are not directly represented by their own fault or by ignorance that the csm even exists that is just one of the hurdles you will have to jump but i take offence if you say that new players are not represented go into the rookie help chat and you may come across sugar steve or myself interacting and helping you dont have to be new to represent new players any more than you have to be an animal to support animal rights what you need to be is able to communicate to listen become known to the voting public twitch blog podcastswhatever step 1 is always get known i will amend that with getting knownfamous in a good way there are some notorious candidates who are very well known but unlikely to be elected mmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
thanks to che biko and freelancer117 your comments mirroring pretty much that image i have about incarnaerrors where made but thats human the error wasnt wis itself it was about managing the development process and the communication but thats 4 years ago also this thread shouldnt be about past events its about today and what wis can do for eve in the futureso i still like to express my support for wis as a general project knowing that wis is way more complex than just adding a button or an overview or nerfing a ship thats why i also dont really like the expression wisunder this term there are so many different things starting with apparels stuffing your quartier missions avatar interactions in different places and ways and so on its not about walking around long empty corridors as critics describe iti wont start a discussion again if wis is doable ccp is currently able to develop at least two complete new games valkyrie legion plus working on eve and dust are there any resources to give walking in stations or eve in stations i call it a real try yes and that is what ccp should do not as a big single expansion like incarna but as a new additional line of development step by step parallel to the current oneswe can argue forever if wiseis will be a success or not without at least trying we will never know and miss a big chance to improve the game
and where is he now
lets just call this what this is its a coathanger up the yazoo youre really going to allow your official csm campaign to begin as a post from someone else who started a topic that you happen to agree with and youre going to research eve first to learn more about it but want to run for and be on the csm so you can represent players that are as clueless as you theres a red biohazard bag over there for that coat hanger and its catchings 
liamby the time the next csm campaign season and elections roll around you wont be a new player anymore and will have a very different take on the game the community and the csm if you put in the effort to inform yourself on those fronts before you judge the effectiveness of current and former csm members relating to new player support you might want to do some research into what they are actually doing ingame and out a few relevant examples sugar mike chance cagali cagali and even myself weand othershave been engaged in helping new players and communicating with ccp in various channels on the subject of new player challenges for awhile now incidentally not all good ideas for helping new players or anything else are delivered straight to ccp through the mouths of the sitting csm ccp folks are well tuned in to the community via forums twitter the tweetfleet slack and elsewhere if you want to be in that loop you need to be tuned into and active in those placeswhile more can always be done to help new players get a good start and become invested in the game i dont see ccp as the primary solution for accomplishing that experienced players will always do a better job of helping new players get a good start yes opportunities could be better but they will evolve and hopefully that will happen yes ccp could provide better ways for new players to reliably discover player corps that are a good fit yes ccp could provide tools for more experienced players to use to build custom missions or tutorials for new players this is me dreaming and wishing here but at the end of the day this is an extremely complex highly nuanced metadriven game i believe strongly that only through interaction with experienced players can a new player truly discover all there is to eve in terms of mechanics options careers and moreif youre serious about campaigning on a new player voice platform i recommend you get informed and start doing something very visible and very tangible to gain credibility i could point to chances wingspantt videos mikes operation magic school bus sugars dedication to helping in the rookie help channel cagalis newbro focus in brave and my own corps mission to help new players get started in exploration nova haven pandemic horde karmafleet etc as a good examples of initiatives to help new players just having an opinion wont be enough to get you elected no matter how many words you use to express ittldr action speaks louder than words
gone like active players click source
in addition to wis i would like to have a kind of virtual reality device which my avatar can plug in into his neck while lying in bedwith the help of this little device you can transfer your mind into a station clone on a different station and do there whatever you want maybe with some restrictions because of your security status or reputation it should give you the possibility for player interactions but not replace an actual visit price checks buy and sell stuff etcalso with this device we can implement new types of training missions and tutorialsi like the idea to start the game for the first time and find myself inside a ship right in the middle of a battle between two huge fleets explosions everywhere huge titans dwarfing your own ship the sound of your firing guns together with alarm sirens filling the air after a while your ship explodes and your avatar awakes covered in sweat in his dark empty quartier yes you should be able to switch on and off the lights he then is plugging of his virtual reality device and giving you back the control over himreplaying historic battles or parts of it can be a feature of this device too to show new capsuleers what eve can be eventually as part of a tactical simulation or just for the sake of space battles it also provides a virtual room to train with more and different ships in a controlled environment
thats a very low punch under the belt there malcanis i like a little bit of trolling but this is almost a personal attack on former ccp zulu we all know now that when ccp zulu supposedly wrote the controversial blog in 2011 everybody agreed it was not him behind the pen but rather another higher echelon management figurei would leave a company to if i was forced to lie for another and not be paid at least my weight in gold and get a getoutofhellcard for my soul so far i have left 2 companys because of malpractice towards its costumers and personnelsource
some ideas for what a ambulationwis gameplay could include for content it would naturally be interesting to have npcs in the station apart from those just being there or passing through you could have occasional mission offers when you meet certain criteria like good standings with the corp running the station similar to the storyline missions the agent would invite you to meet personally because of the sensitive content of these offersthere could also be information brokers who could offer you information and coordinates about special asteroid mining fields exploration and hacking sites not able to scan down otherwise because of their location in deadspace more often than not the coordinates would not be sufficently accurate making it necessary to bring out your probes when arriving at the location for this information a reflecting amount of isk would asked from you to get the info some npcs could also be talked to without any particular purpose if anything it would be interesting to see their reactions towards a capsuleer coming up to them it could give an interesting background to how capsuleers are regarded in society they could also tell you some general news or reactions to recent happeningsother players would of course be interesting not only when communicating but just seeing them thereshops with content relevant to this setting of the see and try before you buy type like apparel these would be something for the players who wants to show stylistic imagination selection in shops could maybe vary somewhat between stations and regions buying apparel could not be the only way that would change your appearance a high security status would make you eligible as a concord recognized person offering you a badge or symbol to put on your clothes completing certain tasks would offer other further symbols like it is currently in eve a high standing with one of the four navys could give you similar visual acknowledgementanother possibility of this new setting would be as a backdrop to explore the differences in culture trends and events between the four empires for example depending on which station you were in on the news screens in the common areas you would get some news centered around what is most important to them and from their respective companies in addition to galaxy spanning news from the scope a purpose which i think was one of the things that ccp had in mind for incarna and that would have even more meaning now with valkyrie and legion soon to come is to have ambulation as some sort of ui for accessing and tutorial for valkyrie and legion and eve this would also work as an introduction or starting module for new players being able to present the different game modes as well as new eden but even for existing eve pilots this could be a transition setting or at least a place to try out exploration and warfare down on planets or flying spaceships in different way not using the capsule maybe this would work in some way with your capsule or the vr device suggested by aelavaine to remote control a simple drone test ship with a first person view like in valkyrie and a trial though basic compared to a capsuleer droid soldier in legion giving you a taste of the action before taking the step of getting your own clones for these purposes and before spending isk on the special ships and equipment required this could also be a place to plan shared operations for the features where thats possible between eve legion and valkyriesome things i find interesting from a design perspective is to have the light and play of lights types varying between the four station types it could also change with the seasons making it feel more vibrant and alive this idea comes from evelopedia
its being thought about seriously not necessarily the suggestion given but with a holistic approach
holistic approach okay may i ask you will ccp improve the npe in one push then this is a serious question since we really need new bros to come and stick if we want another 10 years
so im not saying im the hero of newbros or anything but surely there are few people more newbish than me whove ever been elected to the csm i mean i began my campaign when i was just 8 or so months into being a pilotand im sure other csmers can tell you i have a special attraction to noneve players as a target audience
correct though the addition of two new armor skills armor layering and armor resistance phasing closes the gap most of the wayi count a total of 20x training for all subcap nonremote shield skills and 12x for all subcap nonremote armor skills plus 6x for the two mentioned above with the two new skills its 20x vs 18x instead of 20x vs 12xit could be said that the balance lies in that armor tanking relies on the compensation skills 8x total as they affect eanms while shield does not rely on those also 8x for shields and can skip them entirely for hardenerbased fits the major discrepancy in training time lies in the base skillsmechanics 1x5 hull hphull upgrades 2x5 armor hprepair systems 1x5 repair systems durationshield management 3x5 shield hpshield operation 1x5 shield recharge timeshield upgrades 2x5 powergrid need for shield upgradesshield compensation 2x5 capacitor need for shield boosterstactical shield manipulation 4x5 shield uniformity
welcome to the most infuriating and demoralising part of being on the csm
dear council of stellar managementthough i voted for some of you but not all of you or atleast i dont remember who i voted for anymore i would like to bring this up to your attention so you may work with the developers on this is happening here in this community every day and there has been a few posts that talked about it here and there but no action has been made maybe nobody knows what exactly cyberbullying is so here is a definitionsource
please go awayactually better yet post your lossmail and we can probably tell you how to not get ganked next time
i respond thusly
purchase a permit from your nearest agent and you wont be bullied
i respectfully suggest the op might be playing the wrong game eve online is a competitive pvp sandbox universe based on the constant destruction of playerbuilt assets suicide ganking has been confirmed by ccp as an intended mechanic many times and it facilitates the destruction cycle the game has explicitly been designed so your stuff is never 100 safe even in highsec as for other player behaviour that is not a csm matter if you think someone is cyberbullying you you should take that to your local law enforcement also the eula is crystal clear that reallife harassment and personal insults are not allowed so you should make a petition to ccp if you experience that and they take that very seriously regardless of your feelings on the matter this view that ganking is bullying 
counterargument you are playing a game set in a dystopian hypercapitalist society where almost every mechanic and playstyle is generally designed to step on the toes of others and cause conflict chaos warfare and ego driven pissing contestsmoreover the lore is filled with prostitution slavery murder mass murder assassinations torture suicide ransoming blackmail backstabbing corruption genetic atrocities cybernetic atrocities deliberate manmade environmental catastrophes poverty starvation human sacrifice necroresurrections manic psychosis sociopathy and every other shade of grey betweenseriously thoughccp has stated that they take such things on a casebycase basis that clear line you are looking for will never be nor can be clear as any and all interaction between any two people is never clear cut from the startsome people are too sensitivesome people are too desensitizedeveryone has a different range of things that will set them offand because of those things you can never scrub any interaction down to the point where no one is offended someone always will beyou mr op are leaning too far towards the too sensitive range i advise you to harden up a bit lest others start making demands on you offendinginsultingdisregarding us and our playstyles
on the street it is assault and robberyon the pitch it is a brilliant play that wins the gameif you dont want to be tackled stay off the football pitch
youre playing an rpgmmo that is known for its extremely competitive sandbox nature either accept the game for what it is or stop playingdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
its 2015 eves default settings are awful
ill agree with most of the post above meas a consolation prize op would you accept being able to anchor a structure that let you name your wormhole system
lol are the troll coming out of the woodwork againwhat the op describes is null sec without localso the easiest sollution is just to cut local from null sec then the op can have anything he wants in null seco  and the op should learn how to dscan he is clearly  at it 
hahahaha you really did not read the warning on the box did you
hi im afraid youre not going to be particularly persuasive with the two examples youve givennow if there was an out of game event aspect to this inappropriate taunts in channels evemails the forum then youd be covered by the eula could report them to a gm and have action taken but someone blowing up your ship is in no way  as malcanis pointed out its entirely within the rules of the gamewould you complain is someone killed you in a multiplayer first person shooter aside from thatim now thinking this is a troll what with your corporation description of prepare to die
hi all as anyone knows the neural remap is an important function of eve online that when manipulated correctly can reduce the train times for skills by a significant amount i recently set up an alt to train and unwittingly increased the wrong primary attribute for my skill train plan its reasonable to approximate that mistake will cost me weeks if not months of wasted train time ccp is not completely unforgiving for these situations they actually will reset your neural remap if you catch your mistake quick enough within a week but for unfortunate people like me who were too busy to check such details until months after the facti have no choice but to wait out the remainder of my 1 year cool down i would be relieved to know that i could simply use isk or aur to undo this mistake and perhaps purchase a neural remap however how do you account for the value of such a serviceim curious what the community thinksif this were a real thing what should it cost if you disagree that something like this should be included in the gametell us whyor if you like the suggestion say so we want to get a consensus herethank you for any feedback
here is a game more geared to your interests

calling the exploding of spaceships in a game cyberbullying just to push your agenda for a safer highsec is disgusting and you know it you should be ashamed stuff like this just dilutes the term and makes it even more difficult for the person who is an actual target of cyberbullying in the real worldthis topic should be locked it is based on a obvious lie to push the ops agenda
op the simple fact that you let someone hurt your feelings over a video game demonstrates a lack of sufficient emotional maturity to play an adult video game please go back to hello kitty online wizardry 101 or whatever other carebear theme park you arrived here from and let the adults play their game
no
so how did we have the new bros stick for the past 10 years
so the mobile scan inhibitor is broken someone tell me how it make since that it can prevent ships sitting next to it from being seen on dscan but cannot prevent itself from being seen further at a cost of 20m it serves no real use the mobile scan inhibitor should not be able to been seen on dscan
its not broken its intended to be that way gameplay is more important than realism
confirming the mobile scan inhibitor was designed to hide everything from dscan except itselfthe idea is that any anyone that sees a msi will have to assume it is either a bluff only one person is hiding with it or it is a trap there is a group of hostile people waiting for someone to warp to the msiif you want to really hide use a cloak which comes with its own tradeoffs
sadly all we can do is talk talk talk i took a look at star citizen and i am going to give it a tryand to comment further please anyone can go and quote me to ccp i am willing to donate two plex for the beginning for some avatar gameplay and a question some dev maybe answer does team avatar still exist they were supposed to do something about the content we want for eveyeah hate me i want some sandbox fun out of the ship clone contract for team avatar 
hmm better add useless csm staff to the listbetter delete this forum too ccp it achieves nothing
i too am impatient and demand instant gratification on everything
introductionwe are the people of nullsec living for years in this epic and massively rich in conflict environment we set aside our differences to join forces against destructive actions from ccp against sovereignty mechanicsthe new game mechanics called by many fozziesov turned out to be the greatest discrimination against nullsec dwellers in all of eve online history this untested release shouldnUFFFDt build the platform for life in 00 for the most organized united and active part of new eden alliance leaders who signed this statement have collected enormous amount of proof that confirms this statementwe like no one else can see that this release leads to stagnation in 00 and death to nullsec only in a short while since the release we have collected a record amount of negative opinions about the new sov we combined our strengths and analyzed what does it mean to live in fozziesov for the nullsec peopleour opinion is  this game mechanics needs to be tweaked and the shortest time possibleproblems and suggestionsproblem fozziesov in its current state critically reduces chances for large scale fights fights that significantly separate eve online from its competitors large amount of spawned beacons motivates sides to not engage but to hunt down ships fitted with entosis link in one of those cases to defend off 2 structures players spent 6 hours of game time most of which was spent jumping through gates and warping around in systems pilots who took part in all of this were rewarded with exhaustion and emptiness instead of glory from being victorious and enjoyment from the overall process besides that fleet commanding and fleet bonus structure took a hit as well we want massive fights not cockroach racessolution reduction of beacons nodes  to about 13 per system which are located next to a contested structureproblem low skill requirement practically affirms harassment towards any sov owner while new player harassment is subject to a support ticket roaming fleets or interceptors shouldnUFFFDt be able to affect sovereignty the game mechanics shouldnt be a tool to force exhausting actions upon players  a single ship can force entire alliance of players to take part in tiresome and hollow defence currently the entosis link module is a tool for trolls not a key to sovereignty contest solution reduce the amount of tactics that create invulnerable situations which are currently based on shipUFFFDs speed entosis module should reduce speed dramatically up to 0 msproblem ccp didnUFFFDt give the right interface tools for players to engage in sovwars every aspect of ever changing situation has to be memorized written down somewhere and kept up to date this results in quick exhaustion and aggravation towards the game instead of enjoymentsolution introduction of a new sov window similar to watchlist that displays information about structuresnodes that are being defended or attacked using entosis module with pilots nickname solar system structure id and progressproblem fozziesov has a potential exploit in relation to entosis link ii  using this module allows attackers to do a quick 2 minute cycle which sets structure vulnerable regardless of vulnerability period or until the status of vulnerable structure becomes known to its owner vulnerable structure can be noticed after a close inspection this aspect of game mechanics negates vulnerability periodsolution remove vulnerability from such structures at the the end of the vulnerability period but allow owners to entosis structure back up if structure was partially attacked it should be clearly visibleproblem structure that exits reinforce timer doesnUFFFDt regenerate back which in the old game mechanics served as a defensive mechanism against sov trolling attacked systems spam node beacons which can last forever which is discrimination against sovereignty owners  they must defend their space despite the fact that no one will show up to contest itsolution a new type of status  defended if the nodes are not being captured by any attackers during contested campaign for a period of time dependent of defence index then structures change from contested to defendedproblem notifications about attack contain no useful information except the fact of aggression and system solution to this should be inclusion of information about the system structures and nicknames of attackers command node names are too long which obstructs quick overview of the system nodes and forces to expand overview window to 14 of the screen just to see the full list of nodessolution to use abbreviations tcu ihub station and remove command from the nameproblem in dominion sov alliances had means to transfer sov between them however long and inconvenient it was in the new sov this ability was removed which is ridiculous for a scifi gamesolution allow executor corporations to transfer remotely structures via listed sov structures context menu similar in the way it is now with the customs officesconclusionfozziesov is currently a long exhausting and inconvenient sovereignty warfare model sovereignty is absolutely unprotected against sov trolling this game mechanics stimulates unintended usage this situation can no longer exist in its current state we are highly determined and if all our demands and solutions are not addressed in a weeks time we reserve the right to fight back for our game time and fun which we were stripped off by the new game mechanics

i wonder why speed penalty is the togo request to nerf trollceptorlike ships if you aim at trollceptors hitting other ships with nerfhammer seems like unfortunate consequencewouldnt it be better to say do something like this increase pwg usage of t2 entosis to bs levels add role bonus to cbc and command ships that reduces fitting requirements of entosis linkoptional make t1 entosis link into cruiser module fitting role bonus for af add assault into afs at lastits not fun to pilot whats basically gimped brick let people use their ships at their fullest but make sure they arent denying any contentif that is what im thinking it is im afraid its abusablealso this probably belongs to fi
1 for original post
i as bot manager and xwx manager completely agree on this thread and i hope ccp will hear our voice
like i mentioned in other places i agree that fozzie sov lacks the deeper motivation and drivers behind them why own and hold sov why defend it ratehr then evade the fight thr meaningless of activity makes it turn into fw or arranged fights which isnt why we play eve feels like a test server battlepurpose too null unique opertunities and perks for holding sov buidable sov over time with niche oppertunities make those first combine that with fozzie fix bugs and then u revive null and the game we love
highsec carebear posting in page 1 of a potential nulldrama threadnaught
 and lowbear following ready for the summer tears
totally agree with this post

id suggest that gd is possibly not the best place to post this the churn tends to be highwe have asked for feedback hereand possibly into the assembly hall or jita park
agree with all except first pointi not like too much lagging epics where f1 monkeys shooting to broadcasts and no brain orbiting anchors but current mechanics forces trollceptors instead fights of mobile fleets
in its current incarnation my fellow test pilots would rather be playing the dominion sov game rather than this we tried to hold our breath and see what ccp would deliver and while the system shows there was clearly a ton of thought and effort put in to it it is still not ready for primetime while this system does promote fights it doesnt promote battles we tend to see one or two people in interceptors or frigsdessies who run the second you form to defend there are times when you see 4 person omen navy fleets and you fight them there are no real skirmishes anymore over sov as far as i can tell gone are the large fleet battles that we came to nullsec for in the first place it was explained that this would be a system more akin to the faction war style of gameplay i was not fully aware of how deep that meaning would go i strongly agree with the op and feel that ccp needs to pay a bit more attention to this sooner rather than later
hello stevei googled for your platform with great interest
a bloo bloo my rental income
some alliances are recruiting mining corps can you believe it mining corpsnext thing you know well have human sacrifice dogs and cats living together mass hysteria
i need a bigger dish to collect all of this
suck it nerds
what wars have any of these people done with the new sov system that lets them make informed ideas on how to fix a sov system thatUFFFDs just over two weeks old that will affect every single person in null secwhat has any one done in the new sov system other than get some unused systems attackednone of these people speak for me
this is gonna be goodid like to apologize for the poor quality of the post above and sincerely hope you didnt waste your time reading it yes i do feel bad about it

i d like to support the petitionthe situation where whole system can be influenced or better say harassed by 1 small interceptor is not going to bring additional people to claim sectors but in opposite will be drawing them away from claims and from the game as wellanother suggestion is to make the size of entosis links available to use them on battlecruisers and battleships onlyanother thing which can be added is to have a cycle for entosis link similas as a cycle for cyno unit  10 min per cycle and ship can not be controlled and it will become very vulnerable to defendersthe idea of it is to force the attackers to bring some additional vessels in order to protect a ship carrying the entosis link right now there is no fun at all to have a multiple catch my interceptor atta
sounds like an easy enough fix for me or make entosis links remove the interdiction nullified ability from any ship they are fitted on no matter whatid like to apologize for the poor quality of the post above and sincerely hope you didnt waste your time reading it yes i do feel bad about it
problem youre trying to hold more space than you can defend and in some cases rent it out when the mechanics dont favor that anymoresolution stop that
its old more than two weeks its been explained and analysed before and its been on duality where some of the people mentioned won the sov competition and also all of them have hands on experience at this moment which gives them base to be informed none of this people ever claimed to speak for you but for sure they dont need your informed approval to voice their opinion about the tweaks
is collective petition high or lower on the tears scale than open letter
there is no stop solution for thiscause if you want to get a claim  bring your fleetif your fleet wins  you ll get the claimright now it is more like omfglolz type attack on multiple systems with 12 interceptors or even t1 frigs
id like to propose some questions to the above allianceswhat type of systems have you been defending how many pilots are typically active in them what do they do in those systems and how far do they have to travel in order to mount a defense why do you want to retain those systemswhat type of systems have you been attacking what made you want to have sov in those systemsyour goal should be preventing anything from being reinforced in the first place if you cannot do that you do not effectively hold sov of that system and you deserve to lose it or get burned out trying to win the capture events you should stop fighting over those systems you cant hold on to getting burned out is your punishment for trying to operate in the dominion sov paradigminterceptors are perfectly suited for effecting aegis sov  because the only sov they can challenge for is unoccupied sov and unoccupied sov isnt sovereignty at all if you want to hold on to a system but cant be bothered to have pilots in it during its vulnerability window you dont deserve to hold sov therein npc null chasing off a lone interceptor is incredibly easy we simply undock they never stay within 25km the range of a t1 entosis if a hostile interceptor is entosing your outpost undock blap them if they stick around enjoy the view of the stars for a little bit if fly off and ruin their entosis cycle if theyre after a tcu or ihub simply warp a navy vex or caracal or whatever to it if this happens in an empty system four jumps away from anybody you shouldnt have sov there and its your own fault youre burning yourself out you need to adapt that burnout is aegis sov working as intendedand if that interceptor is bait for a 100pilot t3 gang on the other side of a wormhole  theres your large fleet fight youre looking fori do agree that there should be a sort of passive regen of defense index so that simply going after hostile ships without bothering with your own entosis ships is a valid defense tactic that way defenders can put all their pilots into mobile offensive ships if they so desire this passive regen should not happen if there is even a single node being entosed by an attacker so that it does not extend the time of an active attack effort
as head diplomat and alliance command for gentlemensclub we support the reforms proposed by uaxdeath
multiple systems that are so empty you cant even blap a single t1 frig sounds like the very definition of holding more space than you can defend to me even a lone skiff can chase off or kill a single t1 frig
there is here you go1 claim only the space that you intend to live in2 live in it your indexes will rise3 if someone comes during your prime time to troll space that you are actually living in kill them4 profityour days of being an absentee landlord are behind you so are your days of holding an entire region of systems populated by one nullified tengu and a tower adapt
my point is that i am absolutely for a good fighthave your fleets ready and claim everything you can claimi am not against the principlesbut it looks crazy then you start a war with a country gather your troops and next day 1 spy is putting enemy flag on central square and you lose your capitalwtfi want a fight not hide and seek game i have them enough in a kindergarden
no no youre still not getting it claim only what you can occupy it is easy by design to claim something with aegis sov yet its difficult to retain if  unless you live in itno big deal  simply attack a target that is vulnerable during your invulnerability window then they cannot attack you while you are on the offensive
youre joking right i used to live in your neighborhood remember explain to me how what you are describing is any different from planting an afk cloaker in a system 237 hide and seek game rightif you live in the space you can deal with the trolls if you deal with the trolls you will have no timers if you have no timers you will have no problem the only time you will have to actually defend your sov in a capture event is when someone comes heavy looking to take it
when ccp thinks its ready it doneits the same thing with the new icons players just dont like the new icons what happened absolutely nothing ccp will not go back to old icons and so ccp doesnt care about sov anymore it will stay no matter what we dowhats super funny we just took a station and now our alliance owns a station when i try to dock at that station it says youre now allowed to dock and its our station so yea fozzie sov really is stupidanyone with a noob ship or t1 cruiser can now go and take any system they wish in 10min
well if that one spy drove up in a jeep and you didnt have any soldiers for miles to shoot him then yeah that could happenyoure treating this like dominion sov ignore the first attack and defend if necessary only at the reinforcement timer the defender wins by making the attacker do the work 2 or 3 times to win while the defender only has to show once you win battles in this system by having lots of buffer systems and exhausting your opponent it rewards holding more space if only to make it more painful to attack youthe goal of fozziesov is for you not to let them reinforce it in the first place in fozziesov holding space you dont need dont regularly use and dont defend is designed to be painful its to tell you that you need to downsize a little bityou get to select a limited window when you should have your maximum population on as the only time you can be attacked furthermore if you are actually using your systems attackers have to orbit for silly amounts of time uncontested to do anything if you cant deal with it in that amount of time you probably have too many systemsnow certain things i could see certainly fixing any outright bugs like vulnerability timer issues maybe bumping up the fitting or penalty requirements a little bit so that you can clearly counter an entosis ship with its mirror if its undefended but your post just comes as someone basically wanting the entire basis of the changes reversed because they liked the way it was to be expected since many of the alliances on that list of yours paid for lots of space andor made lots of money renting it out this system will no longer work by design
welcome to 2 months ago when the rest of null sec realized how bad all these points that you bring up are
i agree with rusrusreguards iskiesmommiestooniescorpiesgoonies 0707 m8m8m8
also one stupid mechanic that should be fixed is the ability to buzz out of entosis range and make your link cut off so you can warp away much like cloaks show the secondary timer that runs back counterclockwise to note your recloaking timer entosis links should have the same thing although this would be fixed by adding a speed penalty which is exactly what should be donereguards iskiesmommiestooniescorpiesgoonies 0707 m8m8m8
slight alterationmake entosis link reduce speed to under 100ms for all ships make ships available to be repaired by logistics ships or other meansyou will pull more people in to grid and provoke more fightingas attackers of xxdeaths space i will say that we have done a lot to just harass them and its worked nicely but it has been too easysigned
you think ccp will listen think again the have already change to game to iphone mode that interface please do not let me started with the rest
1 5 and 7 maybe some tweaks but over all i support fozzie sovnot signed
yepwe are still cleaning up after domi sovUFFFD thousands of unused systems all over eve that had sov the day fozisov kicked in that needs purging of sov as thereUFFFDs no other way of doing it nowpeople are trying to defend these unused systems for some random resignthere are no real wars going on no one is actively trying to take over some one elseUFFFDs space so they can live there all thatUFFFDs going on at the moment is a cleanup of dead systems and trolling to try and make people fight
we won by dropping titans on everyone making 70 of the people doing it quit in the 1st week and then naping the other 30we took 95 of the systems totally uncontested so i would hardly call it a real test of the sov we did fix loads of problems tho so you all should be happy about thatnot one single alliance in this game has any really proof of anything other than wield speculation on what might happen as not one single active alliance has done anything of note with the new system to come up with any sort of evidence showing anythingUFFFD when a few alliances have had a few wars and real fights over systems then maybe we can start coming up with what the problems areUFFFD the only problems any one knows about so far is everyone hates 4ks entotsis interceptors and itUFFFDs a point in the ass to do the nodes in systems you donUFFFDt even live in thatUFFFDs it thatUFFFDs all any one really knows as thatUFFFDs as far as any one has really got with the systemUFFFD no one has tried to actively take anything people use from any one yet the whole point of the changes was to stop someone dropping 1000 people into one system or in to very few grids and try to fight the point was to make every one split up hence nodes all over and you needing 10 of them to win so you cannot just sit 500 people on one grid and 500 on another and win just having 13 nodes that you have to get is just going back to slowcat fleet on node 1 all supers sat on node 2 and all your blues sat on node 3 and never having to move or do anything yes having 10 nodes you have to defend is hard if you live 10jumps away but itUFFFDs not hard if you live in the constellation and were able to stop them rfing your stuff in your own prime time before it even gets to the nodes most of the time even if they do entosis your stuff there is no real rush to do the nodes if the attackers donUFFFDt come back you can just continue using the systems and slowly do a few nodes per hour on alts also ccp donUFFFDt like the big fights as it kills there servers
see boldno1 shows up to defend but you want to keep itif no1 shows up to defend it means you dont want it bad enough
and if a whole alliance cannot muster up 5 alts in there semi prime time to afk 2 nodes each at 12mins per node ie 24mins per afk alt they dont deserve sovif you drop the nodes down to 3 or something dumb your all going to be screeming when us and nc dot drop out super fleets on 2 of them and then you loose anyway atleast with 10 you have a bit of a chance of defendingyou could also make entosis mods only fit on bss but then you will cry when people drop carriers or dreads on themall thats going to happen by making pretty big changes at this point is when a real big coalition war comes along you will all be crying that nothing has changed and they the system is crap
a its on our list we are bugging ccp for would be nice csm hasnt posted  about what they are bugging ccp about or results they have got from ccp other than the yearly csm reportit would be nice to see something giving us some idea that the csm is achieving anything
