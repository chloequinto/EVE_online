1 glasses if you dont already have them2 run eve in fullscreen at a lower resolution seriously you dont have to run eve at max resolution
not specifically ive just heard rumors through the network that youre for the banishment of ecm in pvp its seemed ludicrous to me but i figured id get my answer straight from you on your position on ecm
i told myself that id wait till the official announcement before putting up this post but eh its at least the right yearim steve ronuken your friendly neighbourhood industrialist and the proprietor of
reserved
steve does good hard work and has no equal on the csm ill be voting for him again this year
whats your take on passive income sources such as moon mining
moon mining isnt exactly passive there can be a bunch of work shifting stuff around to create value and they should require defence the should is the key word there because you end up with diplomats working out agreements not to attack each others moons and so on grrr diplomats ruining peoples funid prefer to see moon mining moved to a somewhat more active process allowing for disruption even if thats not taken to the point of destroying the thing doing it so being able to raid and get some of the output more active than a siphon
if you dont vote for anyone else if you dont even usually vote at all vote for steven ronuken he has brought a wealth of technical knowledge tot he csm and hes been consistently valuable to the players and to ccp hes stayed out of the drama and hes one of the few csm members ive never seen anyone say a bad word about apart from when i told him off for not getting elected the first time he ran dambit stevewhatever you may think about the csm in general getting steve another year on the csm benefits everybody

kelmac for csm ximy name is kelmac of burning napalm in ncdot and also a director in narm i would like to serve the eve community on csm xi in game i can be seen running fleets with nc helping out new bros in narm and occasionally dieing in a fire i play almost everyday religiously i love this game and hope to see it thrive for years to comei have knowledge in the following areasnew player organizations i love working with new players and believe that new player organizations such as brave karmafleet pandemic horde and narm are integral for our communitywormholes while i dont live in a wormhole currently i have in the past i also use them on an almost daily basis to navigate the eve universe in search of good fightsnull sec i spend a good portion of my time in 00 mainly doing pvp but lately ive had to expand outward to mining and pve to help new players low sec i roam through low sec regularly and love the fights that it bringsincursions incursions have been a major source of income for me throughout my eve carrierone of the major reasons for running this year is because of my experience at eve vegas the eve community in vegas this year was simply amazing and it made me love this game all the more i cant wait to go to iceland this year and experience it all over again if you have any questions you can mail me in game
ive flown with joffy on and off over the last 2 years hes a great guy and his knowledge of the game is outstanding hell be a great asset to the next csm and will be getting my vote
ive known joffy for couple months and hes a really great guy and great mainly lowsec pvperhes got very strong advantage over other lowsec oriented candidates  hes independent and not part of any large power blocthis means his perspective on improving things will cover everyones gameplay not only the ones in the interest of his own alliancepower blocvote for joffy as this can really improve eve for everyone
vote for him if not top of the ballot then top threehe has my undiluted supportmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
here is a question that i think anyone who is a current member of the csm should answer during their quest for reelectionduring your time as a csm which game systems or mechanic changes can you say that you had a direct and quantifiable influence on
what new information do you expect to give to ccp in your third term you have already had a couple years to share with ccp what value add do you continue to have for the csm as opposed to some random new person who might have novel opinions to share with ccpie what fresh ideas are you bringing to the table or is ccp so hard of hearing that you need to keep saying the same things you said for the last few years
steve will be on my top 3 endorsed list for his hard work and being drama free  and i look forward to work with him if we both get in for steve
should the improvement of high sec if ccp plans any be related to changes that are not based on simply adding new ways of earning isk 
you have my number 1 vote as always
see you are making a basic assumption that we bring things to ccp we do now and again but steve has excelled at being cooperative with ccp apicrest and the technical sides of eve he also is great at anaysis of industrial changes but he is in constant communication with the devs few of you even know ofhe is not done and i doubt he ever could be losing him would be a real blow to the csmccp dynamicvote for stevemmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
thats a hard one to answer reallyi mean for example i put up a wishlist of things i wanted for a launcher replacement several months before we heard about ccp working on the launcher which has just gone live can i claim credit for that nearly everything on the wishlist got hit after allor an ice mining frigate i asked for it but im pretty sure im not the only oneim asking for rorq changes and were getting some some public some not yet can i claim thoselast term i suggested tying the vulnerability window to the adm its in the minutes but i wasnt the only person to do socan i claim crest i mean they were working on it but ive been constantly asking about it asking for small changes asking for new features and so onyou see where im going with this its not an easy thing to quantify
yesold content should be revisited and revamped every so often as technology becomes available to do so like reworking missions to use the new ai and be more procedurally generated for example

helloi will chuck a few questions your way if you dont mind1 what impact do you see citadels having on fw if any2 if you were ccp what new ship class concept would you work on next its roleclass and why3 what are your thoughts on a four way faction war and how would you envision it working in practice4 traditionally fws interests get represented by a low sec pirate candidate partly because few fw candidates can gather support outside of their own militia how are you going to campaign to break this trend and gather fw pilots outside of amarr militia or ex amarr militia vote what qualities do you have as an individual that would overcome the normal reluctance to put a rival militia officer in front of the developers influencing low secs mechanicsgood luck out there
great guy with lots of experience1
i support this productfor real though this is a good dude that has a good grasp on what is going on in eve at the present moment i have known him for a long while now and would definitely recommend him for the job his knack for questioning the status quo in almost everything eve related has been a welcomed breath of fresh air since he joined my corp and i think he could do the same things to the csm good luck
kelmac is a great dudegood luck m8
pax amarri address all of new eden first and foremost my brothers in the 24th imperial crusade then friends and loyalists of amarr our caldari acquaintances of utility and finally the dirty vile heathens that roam low sec and beyondhaving failed miserably at the amarr succession trials with my dirt n glitter brothers including nikolai agnon  also running for csm xi  please support him if you dont think my campaign is super awesome  i have now turned my attention to politicsthe campaign platform is simple and a little different to the policies and proposals of other candidates different is not always bad the basic outline is1 information is everything  better real time analytics for improved in game decision making2 ecm  make it more interesting less binary3 social integration  in game should be as connected to eve community as out of game4 roleplay  wizzardhatsmatter  make it truly meaningful for the pve experience5 home defense  solo bonuses tied to your high activity systems that degrade with inactivity6 politics  standings  individual corp alliance and fleet level management of political relationships in real time across multiple dimensions fully integrated into overviewthe basic driver behind my campaign is to set eve up to be great for the next 10 years and i believe this is done best by building on the strength of eve as a hard game anyone can play no one can master and very few restrictions on playstyle this is best achieved by enhancing the tools both social and analytical players have at their disposal to navigate this ever increasing complexity with ease and making ecm less boring for everyonethe full text of my policies and campaign announcement are located on my blog thing
the first few weeks or even months after the first ones arrive in the warzones i expect will be pretty turbulent as everyone is itching to try them out after the newness dies down depending on whether there are restrictions on anchoring i suspect mediums will be used as forward staging bases similarly to poses especially as they have at least a full week of action if they survive the anchoring stage i expect the more powerful entities on each side will put up large citadels in their home systems giving defenders advantages for their fortresses it also better allows groups to feasibly live in stationless systemsvery little has been announced about the four way war even the current csm members seem to know little other than that description if i had to guess at its implementation it would mean any fw system could be claimable by any militia in either warzone due to trade hub and hisec access each militia would likely stay near to their main empires though if an amarr group wanted to take a break in calgal or if galmil wanted to live in heimatar they could simply pack up plex up a system claim it and live theremy guess on conquest implementation involves a twophase system capture sequence as long as one militia holds a system any other militias plexing counts offensively when the system reaches high enough contestation itd enter a freeportlike mode where any interested parties would need to compete for their own militiathis is one of my biggest concerns in running for csm for fw and why im also doubling as a lowsec candidate a csms job is more for feedback and precaution for ccp than for direction and its naive to expect that all my dreams will come true by being overly verbose in my ideas on change and rebalance i hope to convince all the militias that i have everyones interest in fun at heart and not just amarrs i want better pirate presence as well cagedbdswcwetc theyre bad guys for us but i want them to have even more chances to be those bad guys and impact our warzonesthis question took me a while actually we just finished getting 13 new ships many of which im still excited about small ships need a little rebalancing mostly the afs and destroyers still dont have navy variants which i find a little odd that said command destroyers and t2 logi frigates filled the two biggest gaps in small ship combat plus we have new ewar frigates asking for more small ships seems a little overkill atm especially since most of the roles are already handled pretty well instead i decided to look towards larger ships and possibly a solution to bringing back bsbc fleetsbses are infrequently used in lowsec these days aside from arty machariels because cruisers simply outperform them and its hard to force any engagement except over structures theres no largesized form of tackle and they warp too slowly to catch anything battlecruisers are a little better in speed and warp time but they still dont offer tackle solutions given that their role as command ships was recently added to destroyers and that the other t2 destroyers are interdictors speedy tackle in null and expensive dessies in low it seems to me the interdictor role could be shared with battlecruisers in null cruiser fleets oftentimes wont even undock without dictors for roaming fleets battleships are usually skipped as they dont have tackle options either because theyre too slow or because theres no way to feasibly tackle ships except in brawling distance which favors cruisers and belowto remedy this and to make bs fleets strong again id suggest a new point interdictor class of support bcs they would have 35 aus warp speed t2 resists and a role bonus of 100 optimal range to wdfgs can only use the scripted version and they would prevent gate usage which would pose valid risks to t3 fleets that can often simply deaggress on a gate and walk away if they decide they dont want to fight in practice they would rarely apply much damage but coupled with other microjump mechanics including the destroyer they could help battleships see more usage outside of exclusively structure opsa point interdictor would be more expensive than a hic with lower scan res and bigger signature radius especially if it tries using mwd or mmjd it would have t2 resists but without the further 20 bonus that hics get for free it could be strong in gatecamps but only as supporttackle as even with sebos bcs take a while to lock small targets the two ship classes would overlap a bit but hics would be preferable or at least equally suitable for most scenarios other than bc and bs fleetsitd be new and could help bcbs fleets see a return in these fleets theyd be preferable over hics and inties though for capital escalations hics would still be ideal i dont personally find battleship fleets all that enjoyable but itd be nice if bcs and bses had their own spot in subcap combat again as right now their engagement options are a bit limited
what is disappointing is the lack of dev responses and comments here sorry to say but it looks like my eve online subscription will end when there is an mmo that shows me the original promise of eve online that of a space simulator that has all the things depicted in any scifi moviestar citizen is close but isnt a true mmo its the masive part that is its short coming so it wont be able to effect historical on a scale like events in gamming as what we have experienced in eve eve has become stagnant its imagination has had its breaks put on were it can only iterate within its core self this was not its original promise and vision it has become a game of disappointments rather than the sandbox that has its box opened to other parts of the beach the sand has become dry and the box claustrophobic many of the old time players are syndical of remembering the old promise they only remember the failure of the over reach by ccp aspiring to have great goals is not a bad thing each year our computers become more powerful and the tech becomes more capable unfortunately fear seams to be the overriding influence to pushing forward and giving the players true reasons to continue to play which is more space and places even if the space is inside of my ship on a planet or in a station with dust514 and valkyrie there was a promise that those venues would be part of a whole game yet that promise hasnt been fulfilled againeve was the original promise and even if the technology isnt there to create in one gameplatform all the gameplay of the original promise it should be the hub that connects all of them eve should be profoundly affected by what goes on on the ground in dust514 and if there are space battles to be won valkyrie pilots should be a force to contend withi do want to see planets defending there space from hostiles space ships by blowing them out of space from the ground i do want to hire dust mercs to help me not just blow someone elses ship up but take it from him by boarding it and shooting the pod jockey in the head i want to have valkyrie pilots at my disposal to help me disable my enemies capital ships so i can land my boarding party and take his stuff being it his pos his planet or his titani do want to get off my ship and hunt creatures on planets for sport or for gain i do want to take a planet over and become its lord i want to build cities and homes that look out onto alien vistas and see my factories billow smoke as they produce the finest ship that will blow up in glorious space warsi do want to call my friends and plan our secret meetings to take over the universe or simply hang out and listen to some music and talk about my new baby girl that was just born all from my home on a planet or on my capital ship or in my stationi thinkthis dream the original dream that sparked this in my imagination is all right with all of you too lets be encouraging to ccp while we wait sooner or later this dream will be fulfilled by someone it would be great if ccp where to do it it will come and ill see you there
loaded language there some csm members believe not the same thing the structure is fine levels of interaction need to change yes but conflating the two is invalidfocus groups are slower than using the csm for feedback because you have to form them and they will be filled with specialists with a narrower view than the more generalist csm that more general view is valuableas for the turn over of members being removed that would be 2 removed and one resigned hardly excessive any csm candidate making promises beyond ill represent this mind set are at best mislead thats all the csm is for its valuable but were not game designers
if the csm is not working ask the ones who are staying why they stayeven the most pessimistic have stayed on doing what they can as they can and then there are we optimists who accept that no pseudo governmental body is going to be efficient or perfect and work with what we have as for there are members of the community that feel that we should be abolished there are also members of the community that think that pvp should be only consensual and flagged that there should be a multitude of servers and that you should start with all the skills including titan v and make the game only about isk and possessionsthe community has a wealth of opinions and quoting them is easy to support any good or foolish ideafocus groups are all well and good and i think there is a place for them in this game although we have not yet found the right way to implement them but there is no beating the personal face to face frank discussion of sitting down at a table in ccp headquarters or even a bar after hours and discussing things accountability who did you vote for what did you ask them to do why did you vote for them what did they promise to do we sign an nda so we cannot talk about a lot of things that cross the table but did you read the minutes did you look at attendance records for the people you think are yours have you made an effortanother election is around the corner will you try to make the council one that does things or vote for some joke candidate in hopes of making this a self fulfilling prophecy that the csm is deadm
ccp can decide to shut down the csm at any time if they believe it to not be useful to their purpose until they do second guessing the role of the csm to them is just rhetoric and agenda driven propagandalike any other democratic process it relies on people that believe in democracy to put their ideas for the game we all share forward whatever they are and other people to pay attention and vote they can vote by blindly following orders or they can educate themselves the choice is up to each one of us in the end like for any democratic process the voters get the representatives they deserve
i could vote for you if i was sure your csm reform imply csm failcascading that bring ccp to burn it to the grounddoes it loyal servent to mother amamake evetetsel
my number 1 vote as well
if no one better pop ups you may be my number one this year
rest in peace my friend
a good man that deserves my vote1hope you get in bro
1 for my babycake sorry bob
when you are young you feel more passionate about things you want to change the world or eve for the better  bobmon spends a lot of time supporting eve online community from his articles in evenews to his presentations in fanfest he deserves our support for csm 
heart is in the right place will do good for the game has my vote
samehe is still enthusiastic and optimistic about the game one term of csm is exactly what he needs to fit in better
bobmon is one of the more passionate people in eve these days take it from me more than anything you want passionate people who also know the game on csm bobmon would be a great csm member for this purpose and he definitely has my vote
i ran into joffs on the tweetfleet slack invites from steve ronukens page here open it from igb innocently enough i asked him a question about how he sets up his own eve i was interested in it because i have issues with input and gui of my own and i was very curious what he did to address his own limited mobilityhes a very open person and in our talking he shared a picture with me of himself i was quite struck by how sincere his expression in the photo seems but more than that i saw a quote written at the bottom that said i just want to help youi think that quote describes joffs very well he is a person who lives a very different kind of life than i do in my opinion a more difficult life but he is always very upbeat and positive and he wants to make a change in the world and make a name for himselfjoffs is a pvper he has quite an ego about his capabilities and i suggest you hit him up sometime for a discussion of fits and combat i think if he were on csm he would give ccp and eve the time and dedicate csm needs unlike a lot of people sitting in csm this year he also knows what hes talking about and is organized and persuasivehe has my vote
ive voted for steve in every csm election since i joined eve i dont agree with everything he believes but he communicative with the player base like mike is he works hard and he knows quite a bit about his own eve niche he seems to have a genuine love for evenot to mention we share a love for abs
ewardecs hisec content creation in generalso ill try doing this one a few bits at a time as it can be a sensitive issue so the complete version of this point may take a few iterations but you are free and encouraged to ask questionsto begin i do not in any way wish to further curtail what is left of high sec criminal mechanics the current set of very limited high sec mechanics goes a long way to explain the why and the how of ganking briefly youve taken away every other way to generate content in hi so of course the antagonist minded players will learn to utilize what they have left to the fullest extent i used to run a ganking corporation and have done a fair bit of it  it is part of the game and you should be able to gank someone the onus of defence lays on every pilot that does not want to be ganked this is how it should be if you want to see more interesting behaviour and better emergent gameplay expand not shrink what people are allowed to do in hi sec it currently has about as much depth as an atari 2600 game i fully believe that wardecs need to have their cost structure inverted a three man corp that wants to wardec a major alliance who should bave the resources know how and pilots to be able to defend itself should basically be free conversely the large wardec corp that just finds the latest new player start up to crush it under its heel that should be the expensive type of war to run if phoebe was designed to let small entities affect sov then why not let small entities actually affect player organizations much larger than themselves in hithat being said you have to ask why uedama  etc are so violent why are the most violent systems in the game in hi sec well obviously their geography explains most of it yes but it really comes down to where are the kids supposed to play null sec is so absurdly safe so remote and so easily to defend that most antagonist minded players can quickly see that the higher isk killed per hour or more feathers ruffled per hour etc are available in hi sec and that basically why bother trying to make content anywhere else when its so much better in hi sec uedama you can literally just undock a catalyst or talos and receive killmail as opposed to null or low where targets are so rare and so skittish basically that antagonists have been in large part pigeon holed into one form of antagonism by the hi sec rules and one place namely high sec by the population density and the target availability that is just not good overallthe mass exodus to null didnt happen in phoebe or with aegissov this is explored in other posts as to why and how however even if it did it still wouldnt change hi sec as being king for naughty players null and low mechanics just make it so incredibly easy to stay safe that many have just stopped bothering with those areas why hunt for a wild caught hulk when you can just snag a factory farmed one in hi sec youd have a healthier game when the best place for most antagonist content generation was not restricted to a few systems in hi sec  put some tools back in low and null so antagonists actually have a reason to be out there give them options part of this means yes making other areas actually worth living in so there are people to antagonize and another part of this means actually letting the antagonists have a chance at being naughty oh and if you think you are reading too much in this thread and theres too much text remember you are supposed to be electing a communicator look at the other threads and make your own calls there people slogans and vague themes alone do not a candidate make while i am doing my best to remain brief rest assured i would not be daunted to actually write significantly more on any given topic as a player of the game i am interested in player opinions of things and would both love to hear from you and in an official capacity love to elaborate those opinions to people who need to hear them yes i do not have a big reddit presence etc but i am at least a little active on the eveo forums
vic jefferson because no one better is going to pop up
i will vote for this gorski car the dank meme operator of my dreams
go bobmon we are with you
kgrrgoonsso last year i ran not endorsed by mind you but ran as a member of goonswarm i have come to see the error of my ways however i do believe there is nothing quite so honest as a reformed goon some of you may think this is horsefeatherrs but i was the 16 top imperium killer in october according to gevlon for what thats worth and apparently 35 in december not bad for a small time operator i dont just say grr goons ladies and gentlemen grr goons is a way of life for me anyway if you are looking for someone who is unapologetically grr goons to balance out all the candidates that are owned by them or will be owned by them 30 minutes after the results are announced   look no further i fully admit that i drank the kool aid and you should too for every blue they put on the map for every conflict they prevent from happening new eden is a more mundane place and for what new eden is supposed to be a veritable maelstrom of conflict large scale organized stagnation does the cluster no good no matter what mechanics are implemented in game to try and spur conflict one thing remains crystal clear goons do not actually like conflict and they will do anything possible to fight changes politically or militarily
csm please petition ccp to clean up all of the dead corps and recycle the namestickers so many dead corps out there of people who are never coming back to this game that are just being usedthat or extend corp tickers to 67 characters
what if the dormant ceo wants to come back and reclaim his corp
your alliance name is offensive
what happened to your last csm11 thread
typical goon strategy their war strategy has always been to never give good fights instead preferring to only completely steam roll or use weaponzied boredom in this case i think we are thinking the same thing where goons wish every voice they cannot get completely lobbying for their empire to be as inarticulate and and ineffectual as possible effectively giving more power to themselves for lack of an opposition analogous to the weaponized boredom where they cannot win overwhelminglythe goon dream for this csm is as many carrier politicians as can be ballot stuffed into power and as many candidates that cannot operate effectively giving them a total monopoly on player voice despite the fact such people are not actually players like you and i they are politicians what business do they have voicing players like us
i will vote xenuria
forgive me but i really dont see how this conspiracy has any root in reality goons and the imperium seem more interested in eve online not dying from my perspective there have been no closed doors to me since my entry into the hegemony nobody has denied me information or access of any kind and profound trust has been placed in me as a consultant and an adviser to a wide range of matters if there was any grand conspiracy the chances are i would have stumbled across it by now that said goons do have a spotty past when it comes to eve online but just the same could easily be said of their greatest enemies let us not forget band of brothers and the very corruption and scandal that necessitated the birth of the csm put down the torches and pitchforks if there was something within goons remotely resembling the conspiratorial pipe dreams concocted by gevlon and the likes of him i would be the first person to stand on a box and holler about it
a its not a conspiracy though you did a nice strawman of the argument b its a hard sell to ask us to trust you and goons when youre a sellout liar and buzzword politician c i dont think the argument against you is any goon conspiracy since there are plenty of reasons to discount you as a viable representative among others youre either barking mad or intentionally acting like an obtuse and megalomaniacal joke candidate to troll
he has some good ideas and seems to support a transparent csm although i want to see all csm no longer given access to propriety information bobmon might not be all the way there yetso thusfar he has my support and i think would make a good member hes certainty going to be much more communicative then past members tend to be
when it gets closer to election season ill be happy to set up some corp ts meetings
updatesstatement on why i think jfs shouldnt be nerfed soon pending somethingwhy i love jump drives also soon
if they havent logged in since 20032005 chances are they arent coming back sorry about your luck but we have subscribing folks that want to have good corp names too
67 chars might be a good option
if you are strolling around your hanger make sure you keep your id on you all all timesthe forum ss will lock you up
no running on the platform that gevlon did was just plain disrespectful and juvenile
incorrect its painfully obvious that they gladly trade the health of the game overall for the health of their empire they would much rather have control over people and ration out content than see their empire weakenedthey have become what they once rallied to stop
i think there is a crucial piece of logic missing from your master strokewithout eve online there is no space empireto the best of my knowledge there is no content rationing happening in the imperium i have never seen anybody stop somebody from participating in a fleet op by saying woah there buddy havent you had a little too much content today sit this one outor maybe you simply dont understand me this process or what is at stake
they dont need eve online to persist once they have cashed in their shares of website ad revenue or kickstarters you have a very naive understanding of high level gooneryof course content is rationed very carefully very calculatingly they keep perfect stasis on 23 of the map such that there cannot be a reasonable threat to their security eve is supposed to be about vibrant byzantine empires rising and falling on the fickle whims of very human gods capsuleers any empire purely devoted to maintaining the past status quo in its entirely is an empire in decline yet they are happy to see such a gradual decline in the game and their empire so long as it feeds more than their in game wallets give karmafleet some fcs have them toss cheap disposable fleets around with no consequence and their fresh crop of newbies is placated and mollified they are rationed out cheap meaningless content  gone is the gravity of actual fights over things that may have meaning they fed a twobit propaganda stream about our people and how joining the imperium is winning when in all actuality it is losing by essentially removing all of the chips from the table what fun is gambling risking and playing when all of these are removed and all conflict is sport with no gravitasthis is the status quo they want to preserve and content rationing is quite effective at it
perfect stasis eh i think a little thing called dotlan would disagree with you but dont let me crush your grandiose conspiracy pipe dream how about you run for csm
this is some fantastic nucleargrade salt right here
ive been subbed nonstop since 2011 quazerknocks is a real thing  lazerhawks hard knocks and the remnants of quantum explosion have banded together to push everyone else out of c6 magnetar space and succeeded then have proceeded to set up rentersalts in those systems to farm the sites
my content isnt rationed colberti know you think youve seen both sides but you are really talking out of your rear end on this subject you are literally arguing with xenuria and looking like the crazy onexenuria for csm
content isnt being rationed by goons there isnt more of it up californiway
on page 4 and im not sure what you are about you kind of just seem like a gimmick to be honest
do you have a question about my campaign
list 3 ways you plan to reform the csm
i already did please check the first page of the thread where i talk about white paper reform and related systems
yeah i did that so your relevant partsreform in the context of the csm would entail overhauling the white paper installing safety measures changing the language used when discussing certain topics advocating and pushing for policy changes that encourage honesty but discourage superficial posturing i suppose the problem is that when i say reform i expect people to know what i mean without me having to list any number of things that are reformativefor me its sometimes difficult for me to explain what i mean without a specific context let me give you an exampleq what are your reformsa uhhh q how would you reform the csm ndaa i would construct a spanning tree rubric with dates and subject tags that allowed for everybody under nda to know explicitly what they are and are not allowed to discuss and with whom 1 overhauling the white paperin what way2 installing safety measuressuch as3 changing the language used when discussing topicschanging the language from what to what4 advocating policies that encourage honesty but discourage superficial posturingdiscourage superficial posturingcould start with your posts

some basicsi am not part of a power block meaning a vote for me means you are gaining a community member not a puppet because power blocks are so great at voting for people that fail so hard at this i feel i have to put this out there under qualifications wait for it i will show up to csm meetings and actually participate in the process in a meaningful way mic dropslowly picks mic back upopen for questions
never met you read a lot of your posts in various locations you have a good grasp of the game and its mechanics particularly in null and low my questions for you 1 how do you entice the players away from the peaceful almost agrarian stagnation that litters much of null everyone talks about mechanics but it is people and their attitudes that have caused the stagnation if people wanted to fight there are plenty of opportunities to do so2 you dont like the phoebe jump changes what do you propose to fix them would you agree that regardless of your personal feelings towards the changes they have in fact meant more capital ships are used ie smaller entities that were always fearful of the nearest nullbloc landing on them now use them as that is less likely3 same question for aegis sov what changes would you propose i was in an alliance that never thought we would play in sov due to the nature of it and our rl first approach but with aegis we had a crack had some fun though inevitably learned that smaller groups need some highly motivated individuals to carry a heavy workload for sov to work under old or new mechanicsappreciate you responding to this look forward to hearing your answers
i mean if people go in and try to entosis adm6 systemsyoure doing it wrong
ive been liken to xenuria in the way i engage people in this game and how i come off and ive been banned from pl services just like him probably also because ive been told i have the aura of digi which i dont necessarily think this is a bad thing as my rl background is similar to his anyways my point of views the way i fairly assess and conduct myself in eve and put people straight on blast as needed no matter who they are in game are similar to xenuria we need this for the csm very badly i will have all my votes for xenuria i will champion him thru my alliance to look past his alliance affiliation and vote for him anyone who knows xenuria knows that he doesnt sell out and there is no changing him you simple love or hate and hes really hard to hate if you do hate him i would say your a bandwagoning circle jerk mindless fool who cant think for themselves and allow others to influence your views on someone you never got to know get to know xenuria try to understand him and see that he is what the playerbase deserves and needsxenuria for csm xi 2016follow me on twitter fr3sh0ps
ah hole squad the last bastion of true goonyness literally the only reserve of those who live for the sting of battle the rush of the dunk and the sheepish sigh of the welp sadly content is meted too you to as well what a world this would be if you could shoot fcon and sma and their ilk you are no better than who you can stomach being blue to i have and it left me feeling blue amazingly this was cured within hours of leaving just not in me but in all who have left your facade you may call me crazy in an effort to obscure the points i have raised yes but you cant call every corp alliance and personality that has left the imperium lately crazy too they have all come to the same conclusion as i and yes very much so have seen both sides people who have left the imperium on their own accord are just plain offensive just the idea that there could be a better play experience out side of our people is anathema to your propaganda being blue to the majority of null is rationing the content available to your members cloud ring one of the few places on the map with the proper people and location to see some the driving principles of aegis sov work was so offensive to your leadership that they had no choice but to burn down the entire region the idea that people could have sov space which fostered interaction among smaller entities was philosophically objectionable to their monolithic ideas of how space should be governed the south and south east of the map hums the way the entire cluster should but goons wont have that they dont want content they dont want anything to change they simply want to cling to their empire lowsec thus becomes the place to find small quanta of content to placate the members to give them purpose in a world where it has been taken away from them and enemies to fight in a world where they have been removed
the goons do have a vested interest in seeing the game thrive however they do often get to the point where they want ccp to do something and ccp doesnt want to or doesnt want to yet so the goons manipulate the feature until they make their point and ccp fix itxenuria is the cfc burn it to the ground method as theyve given up trying to get ccp to listen and are now trying to force ccps hand also xenuria you dont answer questions so theres no point asking if someone has any
if i understand you correctlyi am a bad csm candidate because i am in goonsgoons are bad because they ration contentyou can tell they are rationing content because you know and have seen thingsyou also have knowledge of how sov should be and your way is the right waydid i miss anything
a good post
you mean that my understanding should be worse than yours when your understanding of stv the election process is flawed at every level you couldnt cite a single time you were endorsed by a major nullsec organisation or whether them placing you on their ballot should impact you negatively compared to not being on there at all you lied about your voter base being 90 women and tried to back it up by something irrelevant your ideas from your last csm 11 thread were either meaningless or revealed to be incoherent and your csm reform idea has earlier contained abolishing elections for the csm but without making it ccppicked leaving it an open question how you think it should be because of voter fraud that you couldnt even point to any theoretically possible examples of and of course no empirical eitherthis is before going back to your claims about when the mittani misquotes you or your old election video rants but i think theres a goldmine for an eve standup comedian who wants to parody youin essense there was a reason why you werent elected before not only because of your dishonesty in debating or your idiocy when it comes to election mechanics or csm stuff and the irrelevance or absurdity of your platforms thus far if you get in now its on the back of goon votes either because they vote for anyone from the cfc or because goon leadership places you on their official ballot in which case they do so for a reasonwhen your qualifications as a candidate are reduced to being a troll or honest idiot its still possible it would be a weird reaon to place you on a ballot with other legitimate candidates why would anyone wellinformed do somost likely to either limit other candidates options to get elected or to make the csm a laughingstock now that the whitepaper might be up for reviewin other words we can actually identify possibilities as to why you might become an official goon candidate and neither are good for the game or the csm paraphrasing from a former goon ceo youre not out to ruin the game youre out to ruin our game
do you have any specific questions about my platform or do you just want to keep attacking me
back when i did ask specific questions you ignored them so though its a nice dodge it doesnt really work for someone with your recordbut if you want to you can take a look at this
you ignored my questions too
yup what sibbs said joffy is a genuinely nice guy and just wants to help other people i dont for one second think joffy has a hidden selfish motive hes just genuinely that way and his time in channels such as b4r shows that hes not just there for the glory and self promotionjoffy is the kind of person we need in the csm
i dont know joffy but i live in low sec and i like the view he has on how to make it better joffy has my vote
what would you change about wardecswhat would you do to encourage players to go beyond just highsec
could you clarify what would like to see happen for fw in the future and how you would represent the people flying in fw i think a lot of the people flying in fw were impressed by your input to the fw sessions in last years minutes
on topicand what would your platform be would you be so kind to put it in like 5 more or less clear points
please see the first post of the thread also known as the op or original post
could you answer these questions
no i cannot i am not on the csm yet and thus not privy to the majority of information that would inform the specifics of my platform
judging by your op youre running solely to reform csm and those reforms are outlined by a goonswarm lead diplomat and not youcan you outline your reforms in 5 simple points with clear and concise sentences please
i am sorry if my explanation of my goals is not par with what you are looking for there are simply things that are impossible for me to know i am a csm candidate i am not on the csm my hope is that i have demonstrably proven to as many people as possible that i have the skill set and the aptitude to acomplish meaningful reform
by having no clue by lying all the time by not answering questions or just every once in a while honestly admitting that you have no idea what the csm does under which rules and regulations and how to reform ityou think even less of your voters than i doedit and i am just going to point out that you again failed to answer questions related to your campaigns not disappointed since i knew you dont have any real answers to anything seeing as you are a joke candidate
so basically you have 2 complete sentences written by yourself in op excluding some history lesson about what you want to accomplish if elected and you cant or wont put forth anythin more meaningfull than vague reforms buzzwords lets try a different approach thenwhat problems besides some csmccp drama will csm reform solve
accusing me of being a liar isnt only comical its a personal attack at the very least back up your accusation with some evidence
you mean the evidence that i continually quoted for you in the last thread and continually ask you to respond toif you took two minutes to read my allegations and questions youd know exactly why i know youre lying feel free to add whatever you havent made public if you so desire youd also know why youre continuously deceptive and unreliable you wont even quote when i quote the sources and claims and im guessing its because youd then pretty much have to acknowledge that dishonesty is one of your defining traits
we have to vote the bill in before we know what it saysliterally xenuria
xenuria you have my vote this year i am not jokingafter fozziesov making null sec a more shallow game and those stupid new destroyers which destroyed the frigate meta after years of balancing work you are the candidate that ccp deservesanother reason to vote for you is skill injectors  extractorseve keeps on selling outso much stupid from the same team at ccp
you cant go bobwrong with a vote for bobmon
bobmom will get my vote for csma good man that deserves my vote1hope you get incsm needs you and more important ccp and eve needs you there
i will be voting for bobmon he will take it serious and actually really wants to be on the csm so fair play to him good luck mate
ive worked with joffy quite a bit over the last 12 months he is quite possibly the nicest most genuine person i have ever met in eve his work with b4r does nothing but solidify that i would love to see joffy be a voice for lowsec and disabled players on the csm i cant think of anyone better for the job he would be an asset to have on the csm
im here to say i support erika as well everadio has kept me coming back to this game over the years i am also an industrialist in nullsec so we share a lot of the same goals and interests she is also a great person in real life and has personally helped me out of a tough situation i was in i can never thank her enough for that after reading over her intro posts and knowing the kind of human being she really is i feel she would be a great addition to this years csmplease cast a vote for erika mizune when the time comes

from personal experience last year these cap stable guys treat candidates fairly
the current mechanic just isnt that good its not a fight over anything and the defense has no win conditions other than starving kills to get them to go away this isnt really helping get quality pvp lost of catching solo newbies going to sell ore in their retrievers lets make it worth something for 1 currently small corps are 50 million isk to deck for a week in my opinion concord is going for less than a vegas hooker so just saying that should change to be higher win conditions for both sides so citadels and other structures are a good place to build this off of vulnerability timers im open to everyones views and would love to hold a open meetings about this if elected point 2 getting people out of high secso lets accept there are a group that wont leave high sec regardless of motivation we dont really care about them in this parteveryone else is looking for isk related content content being key to this having lived in null for a few years in various conditions the pvp is interesting the politics is fun and the grinding is relentless i think the easiest way to do this is grow group options adding harder anoms that require small fleets will grow this exponentially now here is where you might hate me might like me the jump changes with fatigue are necessary as it make it do its easier to defend space so smaller groups can move out and take space im of the opinion low sec is the breeding ground for groups looking to do this so again this comes to benefits and content in low sec needs revamping wormholes are proof of this as a concept create more to do make them do it in fleets and they will risk ridiculous volumes of isk for the rewards because of this the pvp is great there also the volume of high sec to null sec wormholes needs to be larger for 2 reasons 1 wormholes are a quick way to set up a supply route without a jump freighter so they are low sp requirements to use also this makes it easier for smaller groups to live out in deeper null sec spaces making the life out there a litter easier having lived in omist for a time i can say its sucks living that far out so logistics made easier in small ways will help with this and of course will build content so in short content options are key to gaining interest to get more people out there alliances do this with pvp but often times players get bored higher level in alliances its more interesting because the player driven content is might more interesting but that is limited to a few
low end prices for wardecs could be raisedbut the top end should be lowered as well however win conditions is fairly vague you also make the mistake in thinking that fair fights are necessary a wolf is going to eat a sheep we dont handicap the wolf in order to give the sheep a chanceyour 2nd point is good i feel as though 00 needs to have a higher ratio of rewards vs highsec
the win conditions allow both sides opportunity to end the war its vague because i think picking a exact example of what this might include without input form interested parties would be a little silly im open to a more user friendly csm that people can access a bit more with events that are publicized a bit more
do you have any links id be interested to read some more

xenuria and i havent seen eye to eye in years past i have blasted him on podcasts and in these very forums however while he was in karmafleet i got to listen to the man behind the character hes actually a decent person and a very good troll i welcome his candidacy for csm 11want to find all the podcasts around eve online visit
csm reform is needed given that every one of the last 10 councils has had similar patterns of communications issues with ccp andor ndarelated drama what kind of reform i dont know given the organizational structure of the institution i sometimes wonder if any reform is possible that would address the most pressing recurrent issueshowever my own experience on the csm plus observable history suggests that a csm reform platform is likely to get at best a tiny slice of time from the scant few devs who overseemanage the csm project if you cant get any attention from them or other council members on your csm reform issues what gamerelated expertise do you bring to the party so that you can be an actively contributing council member the rest of the time
im pretty sure xenuria actually has answered a question like that back in his csm10 thread im currently around page 11 so when i get the exact quote ill get back to youbut back then the answer was that xenuria would listen to the other csm people on such subjectsedit here are the relevant quotes all are visible on page 14quotexenuria1 i am not very experienced with cloaking or camping so i would defer to somebody who wasquotekiryen obannonfinally one other question  obviously the csm will not spend all of its time on your issues what do you plan to advocate for when not dealing with csmselectionrelated itemsquotexenuriai am happy to do whatever else needs doingthe rest of the thread is still hilarious xenuria has perfected the art of not answering questions  several rl politicians could look at this and learn something from itof course xenurias election threads are always a laugh to read through for example xenuria thought that being placed on the bottom of a ballot compared to not being on a ballot at all can hurt a candidates chances xenuria also thought that any nullsec coalition had placed him on their ballots but that is likely born out of ignorance of the voting system to explain why a complete joke and failure like him cant be elected by its own rights  it hurts his ego to have it evaluated by meeting reality or that cfc candidates have been in majority for years or that 90 of his voter base is female or plenty of other idiotic things and he must know hes lying because he gives sources that clearly does not say what he lies about all the timethe only thing in this that surprises me is that gsf have decided to allow him in and now some goons say that theyll support him if xenuria gets elected its because he joined those who have been his best argument for reform namely that the many organised votes of the cfc gets results in elections i find it hilarious that xenuria in order to get elected joins those who he earlier said hed fight against simply because they have the organisation that can get people elected irregardless of a candidates actual appeal or abilities
solid questioni have a really good understanding of player behavioral patterns when it comes to pve and the value of vanity items i have lived in high sec space for extended periods of time and learned a great deal about the mentality of players there i think if at any point csmccp discussions had to do with psychology or behavioral analysis of a particular aspect of gameplay i would be able to contribute insights in a meaningful way
id put that somewhere in dsm  iv  tr range
i approve of this joffy good luck bro want to find all the podcasts around eve online visit
the judge and i met when aba looked for at practice partners so we scheduled a few practicces and started talkingthe judge knows a lot about eve and he is a great guy nice and easy to discuss with so i really hope iUFFFDll be working with him on the csmeven tho he owes me 10b for convincing him to go to eve down under pthe judge for csm
never spit in a well you may have to drink from do not try to put out a fire with gasolineso im going to be blunt here if you are disenfranchised with the csm process the csm candidates etc electing troll candidates who will exacerbate the issues with the csm and it is not the proper way to accomplish things i too am quite sickened with the current csm but attempting to punish players or ccp by electing joke or troll candidates will just make things worse we just havent seen many there are a few you know who you are  actual communicators interested in fostering good playerdeveloper relationships we have a bunch of people who either come to the table with agendas a sense of entitlement a sense of disenfranchisement or other forms of bitter that just prevent progress outright downward spirals are something you have a limited window to fixccp should have the exclusive right to bar candidates from the csm either based on whatever criteria they want or from previous csm performanceselect communicators elect people who know how to listen and to collaborate
this is very true they let the candidates sink or swim themselves vs playing favoriteswant to find all the podcasts around eve online visit

i am a wormhole pi bear a nullsec market trader and the hunted i belong to and help make the small group i have no love for the largest player groupsi believe in the circle of gank the good pvp pilot will defeat the ganker the good ganker will catch the evasion pilot the good evasion pilot will evade the pvp pilotonce on the csm i will encourage ccp to consider gameplay compatible with us they will already be representedeve is already one to the strongest market games real destruction leads to real construction i have some little things i would like to see fixed selling below buy orders buying above sell orders for onefor some controversy i think warp core stabs encourage hunter pilots to differentiate between being a pvper or a ganker i think npcs should do less and players should do more whether it is market seeding or even player faction militia having the rights of npc faction police i like the fragmentation of nullsec created by fozzie sov i am a part time blogger and have a series of posts for those interested in the csm  searchlabelcsm
skype  foo downunder but please mention eve in contact request  reserved for later
i think warp core stabs encourage hunter pilots to differentiate between being a pvper or a ganker all ganking is pvp all pvp to one extent or another or in one area or another is ganking therefore your proposal is just so much more dust on the wind
surprisingly enough  my proposal is to support and encourage existing fitting choices for both the hunter and hunted alikei entered faction warfare on an alt with one of my todo jobs being hunting the stab fit farmer it wasnt that hard i however did not have the fit or player skills to succeed 1v1 against standard fit ships
thank you that is nice to you i can understand the problem with the culture over mechanisms i am not saying mechanisms should not be a part of the csm job but i definitely believe that it is not the core of it
right now i am very happy with faction warfare lowsec the fights have been amazing and the felling of low sec as a warzone has never in my experience been more real black rise is where i know best so what i use for the basses of my opinion null sec still seems to be in a state of flux and semi empty but i have hope that its changing the meta has seen a small shift with command dessies and t2 frig logi how far this will go in low or null sec remains to be seen but they offer players fun options for a fight hopefuly everyone having as much fun as i am an lets get a discussion going about what we as players want to see in game so we can give feedback to ccp about this game that i and hopefully you love to play
see this one i really really disagree with i want to agree with it as cloaky camping its terrible game play but theres literally no way to actually harass people in null sec without cloaky camping them nullsec is absurdly safe thanks to local intel channels derivative tools that use local and intel channels distance fewer wormholes to null territory far away from were antagonists can resupply or escalate and the ability for the defender to escalate infinitely until there is a way to add some risk back to it cloaky camping is really the only way to effectively antagonize sov residents ess was a nice concept but it has largely failed because people either do not use them or have rats to defend them and the best thing to do when a neutral is either in your system or a few jumps out is still simply to dock  avoidance almost every ratting ship out there is capable of leaving a site and getting safe well before being at risk 99 of the time it is not the hunter being good that gets someone caught in null its the ratter being careless game play where one side disproportionately holds every advantage possible is quite boring ie there is still no good way for a roaming gang to cause trouble to the point where defending sov space actually matters basically deep null could be so effectively locked down to the point where there is no risk at all and that is a terrible thing i would be fine with this if local had a delay or there was some other way to actually get to rattersbut there isnt really
my goodness the whinefirst and foremost if you are a ceo and you know that you will be away for awhile pull your stuff and appoint someone to at least director positionsecond if you have been gone from the game for longer than a year do you really have rights to anything in the corp anymore specially things with in hangers that are accessible to corp membersthird  purpose this if you are a person who has been gone for awhile or you are a member of a corp that has inactive leadership and are afraid the ceo will lose out on their items have all corp assests given to the current ceo and give someone else leadershipme personally if i was in a corp with an inactive ceo i would just cut my lose and say  em no matter what happens someone is getting bent over and ed up the tail pipe no matter what happens fire stone if you want an active corp and access to bpos for copying and such divine demise doors are open the lord loosed upon them his fierce anger all of his fury and rage he dispatched against them a band of avenging angels  the scriptures book ii apocalypse 101 npclivesmatter freetheboobs
no all taking him off the ballot shows is that ccp doesnt put up with trolls who outright state they will waste the time and effort of everyone involved in the process just to push an ideological point i think its perfectly fair to expect those who put themselves forward for the csm to actually be interested in doing csm related thingslike malcanis said gevlons platform could be most simply represented by a none of the above button
thanks for your reply i expect that kind of contribution could be very useful indeed
e for effort but the comments you find such a laugh to read through were written by a young person roughly six years ago peopleespecially at xenurias age thentend to mature and change for the better over such a long time might be an idea to give him the benefit of the doubt on that one dont crucify him for mistakes or questionable behavior that occurred in ancient history and confine your assessment of his candidacy to his current platform and how he conducts himself in the here and now that said in reference to his six year old comments im willing to believe that as a csm hell still be on board with listening to more knowledgeable others on given topics and will energetically pitch in where he has skills and knowledge to apply as for his social interaction skills and ability to collaborate effectively he seems to be aware of his own shortcomings hopefully if when he is elected he will make an honest effort to be a productive csm and his fellow council members and ccp will make an honest effort to work with him rather than simply dismiss himdoes this mean i plan to vote for him probably nothe doesnt need my vote to get elected and hey he might end up being a terrible csm i cant predict the future and ive been very wrong about some past candidates however i happen to believe that everyone deserves respectful consideration based on current and relevant information including xenuria
you subtract 20140525 from 20160112 and get 6 years besides xenuria ran for the first time way back and so must be 21  the years since then when someone hasnt changed and still advocate the same idiotic ideas as 1 2 3 or more years ago theres not really any doubtso xenuria will pitch in at no time during his csm tenure and will always listen to the other csm members then why have him thereyou seem to have skipped both this his old csm11 and his csm10 threads check out his history and youll confirm that xenurias issues arent just social interaction its also megalomania and a messiah complex plus inability to ever listen to criticism or answer questions a lot of other people tried to help him in csm1011 and probably even earlier but i cant quite remember but were written off as trolls i still dont get why they ever tried to improve xenurias campaign since i find it futile but they made an honest effort no selfreflection from xenuria so farxenuria is either a troll candidate or a deluded idiot its not really viable to work with him in either scenarioi got to the quote limit i happen to believe that everyone deserves respectful consideration based on current and relevant information including xenuriaas do i its just that xenuria doesnt look too well in such a comparison either and if cfc leadership really does endorse him he stands a real chance of getting in that makes it less fun to watch his csm threads than it was in other years where it was an absolute trainwreck you could enjoy whenever you had spare time
absolute reading fail on my part  somehow i misread csm10 as 2010 and did stupidmath i still stand by my statement that people can change for the better and we should focus on the now and be willing to acknowledge positive change when we see it
bobmon will be one of the guys i vote forhe has put an impressive amount of work into en24 as well as organizing evesterdamif he keeps up his work ethic he will make a great csm
hello ladies gentlemen and fidosi am here to formally announce my intended candidacy for csm 11now of course youUFFFDre probably wondering who i am to be running for csm especially considering the relatively space famous nature of my running mates well as you can see on the top left my name is jinUFFFDtaan and i am a member of cva more specifically however i am an fc within the provibloc coalition iUFFFDve experienced quite a lot of my time in eve through this lens from bombing brave newbies and pl to crafting about as many fits as there are ships in the game for solo pvp or fleet combatbut in addition to that iUFFFDve experienced a good amount of the content that is available in the game iUFFFDve lived everywhere from hisec to whUFFFDs and tried to experience as much as i can in each of those locations diving in with a spreadsheet in one hand and dragging a few friends along with the other iUFFFDve mined iUFFFDve hauled iUFFFDve built iUFFFDve fced incursions in hisec and nullsec iUFFFDve run moon mining poses and strategic deathstars iUFFFDve led oldschool dominion sov wars from both sides and iUFFFDm currently fighting over fozziesov timers with pl and thatUFFFDs just a fine selection of it if youUFFFDve done something i havenUFFFDt chances are you can get me to try it atleast onceoutside of the game however iUFFFDm aaron denyer iUFFFDm a design engineer and work with ge and airbus as a subcontractor whilst i understand and deeply respect some of my fellow csm candidates desire for privacy i think my real life background could be of note iUFFFDm used to attending meetings and utilizing critical thinking within them to help stop one viewpoint from being drowned out plus at the end of the day i intend to come to fanfest so expecting people to not know who i am in real life would be kind of defeating the point as meeting up with the people youUFFFDve known for years through eve is half the point of itif i am elected to join the ranks of the csm i intend to focus on two main things that i believe i have expertise in fleet combat  alternative playstylesthe former is rather self explanatory but i feel itUFFFDs necessary to explain myself with the second part of that alternative playstyles are something that has been typically under represented in the csm with the vast majority of candidates and electeeUFFFDs being nbsi despite the incredible popularity of npsi and an admittedly small nullsec coalition based around nrds oftentimes the minor issues that affect the communities built around these ideas are overlooked such as the original thoughts on removing fleet warps or the relatively small number of standing slots available on an alliance level these are the kinds of things that could seem like inconsequential issues to those who havenUFFFDt dealt with the practicalities of working within them but are in reality a huge pain in the arse for anyone who has to do sothese communities are an important part of the vibrant cloth that is eve onlineUFFFDs society they provide low barrier to entry for new players to try various experiences that are otherwise daunting to try and iUFFFDd say that having some 3 month old character try pvp in spectre fleet or mine ore in providence does more for the player retention rate than anything elseand with that we come to why i want to join the csmi want to join the csm because eve has been a part of my life for around 5 years by the time i am old enough to drink in iceland i will have played this game for a third of my life it is something that i love and something that i have dedicated a huge amount of time and thought towards i want to join the csm because i want to help this game get better in any way i canif you would like to contact me outside of the forum thread for any reason feel free to mail me in game or at jintaanevegmailcomfurther informationinterviews for your pleasureinterview with eveguardianinterview with eventmy thoughts on the battlecruisers at en24guesting on the jeffraider showexamining how topdown economies impact the game

hellomy name is lorelei and i am announcing my candidacy for csm xi i am running on a platform that is focussed on high sec i am a selfconfessed high sec carebear and am proud of it i have analysed the commitments plannedcoming up in my life for the next year and have decided that i can afford the time to run for csm xithis is my campaign thread from last year
theres a 99 way to avoid being ganked and thats being attentive why try to fix what isnt broken at all
steves work is amazing and hes somehow tireless and tirelessly positive definitely has my votethat said steve care to advocate for settlement of new space 
i have been waiting for this thread just to say that i fully endorse steve for csm xi he never fails to impress with his technical ability and a willingness to try and understand anything he doesnt already know as to the relationship with ccp i feel he is one of the guys that will keep it going in the good way should he be successful in reelection
dont know him personally but ive only heard bad things about the group of pompous baboons that he is leading they worship him like a god and rightfully so as they wouldnt be anywhere without himhow could you ever expect someone like that to try to achieve anything that is not beneficial to his corp plus he plays way too much eve to be a balanced person1
so you want some noobcorp spreadsheet online paperpusher type of fellow for csm plz czech yourself and go back to where you came from because it sounds like you are the real baboon
i feel marginalized by these spurious comments
noobman is probably my favorite wh candidate that has ever run for csm also i think that he has a lot of potential to be the best wh candidate that the wh community has had in a long time
me and judge go back to the days of a youtuber and twitch streamer making a full public entrance into eve and a high sec groupallianceneedless to say the war decs were chaos the recruitment was chaos and the welping was real eve was experiencedabove all friendship and honour has stayed no matter what chaos i managed to try to causethe judge for csmlet the court get it judge court have its day
co2 is blue to cfccfc is part of the root cause of a myriad of issuesa real nullsec candidate would only be believable if they were from smaller entities that actually play the game rather than being pawns in a greater sphere of blues why would i vote for someone that only knows how to submit rather than to prosper on their own why would i vote for someone who is grossly out of touch with nullsec by virtue of having thousands of blues
vic has a very good point here npc null pockets in more places gives people a stepping stone to the sov regions nearbyhaving lived in syndicate for awhile now i understand how hard it is to be evicted from npc null its all about will power and true control of space this would allow many groups a chance to get a foothold near sov and eventually try to take a piece for themselves
tightening up ly distances in some areas would be good too there are vast areas of null entry that are impossible to get caps to the unintentional fortresses created by the arbitrary 5ly jump range needs to be addressed oh and vic gets my vote and my hammer
i cut out a lot of vics text here but i only want to focus on a few points barleguet was awesome my old alliances used to fly there expressly to fight brave and we fought there a lot when brave moved to yzlql we would trek out there to fight them as well they were close enough to syndicate to fly their in small ships which of course is another thing vic mentioned space is too big for anything big and slow to get around my battleships have gathered so much rust and dust as i have no reason to fly them as they suck so hardthere was a lot of charm in smashing that venture in the belt his friends would show up to fight shortly afterwards and glorious melee in space would commence the space hornets were stirred up and it was run and gun for awhile until you died or killed enough hornets that they simmered back downhis comments about tishu and oss are very true syndicate has a few decent groups that get form up enough people to fight each other on a semioften basis ive fought both with and against most of the other units in syndicate whenever ive left the region it seems like i would fly 30 jumps to not fight anyone and then fly homei slightly disagree as you can definitely make some isk out in npc null however his main point is to get enough concentration of players to have decent conflict you need enough isk generators in the area to keep people viable enough to stick around and currently there is continually shifting of people into an area of syndicate and then there arent enough anoms and scan sites ratting belts etc to be able to keep them up with enough isk to stay active and then they  out of the area and then we fall back into their not being enough people to get fights very often rinse and repeat adnauseumand just in case people think im too big of a vic supporter
heimotz is also on those kills on vic by the way

hey sorry just saw this now1 i think you entice people out by making fights more available simply by having them become more plentiful thats kind of the number 1 issue in the game right now in all sectors of space and there are some very real reasons for it i joined right into the large scale pvp side of the game as i said by joining test on day 2 of playing but for most well known and respected fcsalliance folksetc there background story almost always starts with so i was flying a drake in high sec and then  im sure there are huge number of folks carebearing away exactly like that in massive null blocks never really being exposed to fleet fights or pvp in general in an engaging way obviously its not going to be everyones cup of tea and some enjoy what they enjoy but i do think theyre the minority all it takes is that one experience to make it click the current advice of go lose 20 frigates in fw sounds good on paper but even just the logistics of that where do you get the isk how do i fit them etc is quite high and its by no means the only way2 to be clear ive never really been in a biggest fish in the pond type group in bl we were always concerned about pl prephoebe the second we put supers on field theres a ticking clock until pl comes just like any other group in the game bar the cfc postphoebe i mean we set up camp right before it 2 mids deep into the middle of their space so yeah we were always the small fishthe mechanics at their core i actually think are okay fatigue seems like a good idea range nerfs dont seem like a bad idea just the combination of the two with the extreme numbers used i think are a problem the consensus ive found at least in the spheres of folks i speak to regularly is reworking capssupers to have the same 8ly range as blops do currently removing fatigue from jfs keep it on nonfreighter industrials to prevent titan bridge chaining abuse and buffing blops to 10ly i personally feel like giving caps regular nonsuper caps a 2550 fatigue reduction on top of that would be a good idea but id want to give those other changes like 36 months and see how that plays out first thats my wishlist on the subjectin terms of increased capital use eh im skeptical a lot of the increased use is stupid stuff like using archons to shoot pocos when you can fit up a 100m talos to do 80 the dps for 5 of the cost what i do think has happened which is good though is a very clear redistribution of r64s to the people who actually live near them ie aridia being owned by lsh in the north and nc in the south instead of bl and pl living 8 regions away and having a permanent cyno chain to get there in 5 minutes if someone tries to hit them3 as i said in my op i think the entosis mechanic is all round bad and has to go you keep the structures the flow of timers and the station freeport mechanic exactly as is but you dps them down exactly as before and use adms to scale the resists of those structures specific numbers would be a longer and nuanced debate but ideally id aim for having it such that an active corp of 20 real people wouldnt have any trouble taking an undefended 1x station system while a max adm staging system would require dreads to rf in a reasonable period of time my goal is less about specific numbers and outcomes and more about gauging it such that what you need to field to get the job done is proportional to how important that system i think that plan i have is the best of both worlds because it still lets groups like yourselves take a couple backend systems if they really want to without increasing the effort involved all that much but brings back the major iskeffort commitment that catalyses large fights
csm watch interviewvideo ver coming soonhello pilotsuriel the dreamy lore guy paradisi anteovnuecci here nows as good a time as ever to announce my run for csm xi theres a lot i know i plan to bring the table within my area and im happy and eager to represent the part of the eve community im involved withfrom day 1 ive been hooked on eve after accidentally clicking an ad on youtube and arriving on eves website i decided to look into it what started as bored exploration turned into many hours of reading background chronicles and every short story on the backstory section of the community page after testing the waters with a few trials i subscribed and ive been hooked ever sinceU266Auriels been around for close to three years now and ive been playing eve for about 3 andahalf in that time ive become deeply involved with the games lore rp and live event crowds ive worked with many players to uncover secrets craft plausible theories and explore things on sisi far before they hit tq in some cases most recently ive been participating in events surrounding the drifters from carolines star which we just found out a whole lot more about to the antikythera element and entosis link to their effect on the jove observatories and the consequently obtained observational logsscope feat uriel the first explorations of the drifter hive complexes finding dr tukosss body as well and the events leading up to jamyl sarums inworld death and the first rounds of the amarr championships following that beyond that ive participated in just about every live event thats happened since ive started playing and ive apparently become known as a walking encyclopedia for just about anything lorerelated and anything at all concerning the jove its certainly a nice feeling when people come to you for help and its always felt great to help anyone interested on their way to finding a good experience in the game ive had an insanely good time in eve so far and id like to do all i can to help others enjoy it just as much through the csm involvements less specifically i support increasing possibilities for players to make their eve experience their own through customization discussing skin price points adding more options better designer skins and working towards customization alliance skins and logos appearing on ships and more unique designs are all things i hope to address in addition i hope to facilitate better communication and transparency between playerscsmccp and create a more accessible and effective means of suggesting features and ideas for the game than the forum provides at this timeive had an amazing time in eve thus far and i hope to continue doing so while doing all i can to let others do the same as a highly involved player irl game major and potential csm member i plan to help ccp continue to improve eve and continue building its unique world while ensuring that it remains the game we all play and love thanks for your consideration i hope youll select me to represent you on the csm urielcontact via eve mail in channel uriel4csmtwitter anteovnueccireddit unickosaurusemail urianteo3gmailcom
while some groups are indeed figuring out how to run drifter incursions as effectively as possible it still stands that they appear unapproachable to many while i believe some of this has already been adjusted doomsday tracking and will possibly be addressed before the csm gets together i plan to voice concerns if the need persistsim all for more clothing options  its not my focus but id love to see more variety and possibilities with avatars
1are you going to represent the hope that ccp makes the drifter incursions an event that players will actually want to participate in from what i understand as they are now the only way to kill drifters is to have someone sacrifice their ship and tha

considering you can shoot concordnavy in missions for pirate factions maybe anomsscannables with these entities could have a place in npc null sectionsits actually a thoughtface the enemy as a solid wall for faith is your armor and through it the enemy will find no breach wrap your arms around the enemy for faith is your fire and with it burn away his evil
a challenge with wis is finding an emote system that makes the environment visually alive and interesting and gives the freedom to express and show what you want also for places where capsuleers can be without suits which i hope that there will be if there is a wis expansionone should not necessarily try to achieve emotes for expressions as for expression emotes a different system maybe with text can be used that can replace them also action emotes for actions that doesnUFFFDt directly influence the gameplay can be replaced by this system the reason i think emotes for expressions and those actions that doesnt directly influence the gameplay should be handled by a text system are that they are so personal that making an emote for them actually hinders interaction even if you have many to choose from one can feel forced to use an emote just because itUFFFDs the closest one to what you want to show or express even if it isnUFFFDt that close and even if it is what you are looking for it doesnUFFFDt have subtleties from person to person therefore i find it very difficult to interact meaningfully using emotes writing your own words allows you to describe precisely what you want to express or what you are doing then itUFFFDs up to the player or players you are interacting with to imagine i did think of a system where you could use something like the playstation move or those controllers for oculus to record movements and make your own emotes to be used in game maybe as an addition to the above
a corporation is owned by a personif there are other shareholders within the corporation then they can vote for a new ceoif you dont like how the company you work for is managed then either start your own or apply for a job elswhereand no you do not get to take the corporations assets
while i agree that people can change im not convinced xenuria has changed enough to actually be a valued and constructive member of the csm i have the fear that xenuria will do what xenuria does and dwell on trivial issues that nobody other than he cares about and will just  off ccp due to him refusing to let it go when they say no his last trivial issue was high heels or something and he abused the ccp staff member on livestreamxenuria absolutely has the passion needed for a csm member but his passion is quite often misdirected to trivial issues and he refuses to accept any questions or criticism instead labelling those people as trolls i myself have been labelled as a troll by xenuria for asking honest questions about his campaignedit apparently ccp are trying to get an e rating for their forums and have censored out some of the most basic of english words
the csm needs changes for sure when i first came to this topic i got actually hooked and thougth this would be the person to vote for sadly while moving thru the last 5 pages  i only saw you basically avoiding all specific questions on how you actually in detail want to reform it this leads me to the belive that your one of the ppl that only scream loudly but have actualy no real clue of the inner workings inside the csmdont come at me with read page 1 you are campaigning for a csm seat to focus on a specifc task during your csm period so give us some informations tell me what kind of processes are in the csm  how they are currently working  and on which points you see potentional for changeif you cant answer that  means you havent analyzed the current csm and its pocesses and cant therefore represent us in this specific task  reforming csm thank you  hope to get some answers
no clue of the inner workingsyou are 100 correct this is because there is something called an nda or nondisclosure agreement that all members of the csm agree too this means individuals who are not on the csm are not privy to insider information its silly to accuse me or being intentionally vague when i have the same amount of access to information that you or any other player does i am no a psychic i cant read minds and i dont have a deep cover infiltrator inside ccp so please lets be reasonable this is not a platform about something all players have granular and specific information about this isnt about wormholes or sov or minning or pve this is a reform platform which means there are black boxes and unknowns
thanks for the reply 
i will vote xenuria and you should toomake the csm great again
you seem to be one of the more serious candidates running for csm xi interesting
thank you i believe the csm is a group that should represent a range of players from the sandbox as wide as possible and the best way to demonstrate what you believe in is to tell on your platform what you would advocate forthere is a new interview of ccp leelo about the csm that is worth reading she highlights that each csm delegate has their own agenda and opinions often they donUFFFDt match not only our point of view but even the point of view of other delegates and the community
if one can be in pl for as long as apothne has been without catching bittervet disease then that is a testament to a positive attitudeas cz editor and colleague i can testify that apothne has true enthusiasm for the game a great positive attitude personal integrity and no strange delusions or pretensions about what being on the csm means that being said dont vote for him or he wont have time to write his amazing tournament reviews for crossing zebras anymore
1for the state for the people for goddeath does not deter i will mine until you surrender
a few questionswhat is your opinion of the current state of fleet combat meta in nullsec is it in a goodbad place whtat is the most serious problem within the game that you think ccp should address in the near future bonus question why are nightmares bad vs supercarriers and trackingtitans
im in two minds on this really its certainly better than it has been in the past with a lot more midscale 3060 pvp taking place between fleets in the south that ive been able to join in on i think the battlecruiser changes were one of main drivers of this providing a great cheap platform for fcs to use in fact the fact that ishtars absolutely hazed bcs was one of the reasons it was so terrible for the pvp meta as they and t1 cruisers have always been the kind of baseline for fcs to fly and making them viable not just in stats but keeping them so in the meta is important to keeping nullsec pvp ecosystem active by ensuring that newer fcs have an option that can have a reasonable chance against all nonstrategic gangson a larger strategic scale fleet combat has stagnated a fair bit whilst we do have the added wildcard of mjd destroyers tech 3 cruisers and faction battleships simply reign supreme however i think the capital changes that are on the horizon have a chance to shake things up by giving us more easily accessible and stronger triage that might make t1 bs doctrines viable from atleast an isk efficiency point of view again its my firm belief that the most serious problem affecting eve is not one specific feature nor one specific issue its the lack of proper iteration on player facing changes that are made to the game ideally balance or feature changes should have a clear and pointed direction and be reviewed to see what impact they actually had after the meta has had time to settle to determine whether they have been effective or not in achieving their goalsi believe that this isnt just something ccp should be working towards however its something the csm is uniquely well suited to help with being ideally active and well connected players who can catch the pulse of the community and the inevitable workarounds that any change causes to pop up presenting an on the ground report to ccp would really go a long way to helping them adjust changes in the direction they want to go at least in my personal opinionof all the battleships one could bring the nightmares are honestly one of the best they have decent ehp and great sustained speed from the ab bonus in fact with their neuts and the incredible dps of pulses they represent a not insignificant threat to a solo or small group of super capitals especially if accompanied by triage or dread support in fact with boosts a tracking titan has an incredibly tiny amount of applied damage to the nightmarehowever when said titans are supported by a fleet of lokis  protepodes who are well coordinated and able to web and paint the targets the picture changes immensely as their combined webs and paints can line the ships up for a one way ticket to the salvage station by utilising their incredible alpha properlythe same applies to supercaps fighter bombers when tracking fit though their fighters are designed to be effective sans said support so with the buffer afforded to them by their hull can fit tracking mods and have an incredibly significant impact on combat without risking themselves getting turned on and quickly burned down like a carrier would in the same situation this means theyre less dependant on subcapital support however they lack the same alpha as a titan and their weapon systems can be disrupted by the affected subcapsin short they do not do well against them if they are being used in a well thought out coordinated and effective manner with subcapital support to enable them to be used as a force multiplier

im sure this thread will only be ravaged by fellow code bros and the like so i figured i would take this chance to talk about ganking as it takes up a large chunk of your platform a little background on me i am a ganker wardeccer scammer and former awoxer and make my living as such i joined eve on a cresting wave of advertising to be the villain in eve online and blogs from criminals and griefers having read through a few of your recent blog posts specifically the one regarding the changes you would like to see for concord random spawning times response times and greater patrols i dont agree that these changes would create better conditions for potential victims rather they would just further complicate operations for gankers creating random within ranges of response times and spawning for concord in different security systems just means that i would need to wait a few days until code bros you know who you are tested the ranges into the ground and determined new ranges from which gankers could effectively gank targets seriously no matter what changes are made as long as ccp doesnt take away our red button we will find a way to gank efficiently as for patrols im still unclear on their effectiveness considering that most gankers dont usually do much ganking within 15 minutes of their previous ganking keep in mind that concord serves the purpose of reactively punishing criminal activity you compare concord to the police but its purpose is to punish not save lives in short i think you want to punish gankers because you see them as a group that has effectively broken the system and currently dont have a hard counter im sure youre going to find some support for your initiative but i dont forsee ccp making these changes i talked to the greatly despicable mike azariah a few months ago about the highsec criminal community in the wake of the news of hyperdunking getting axed by ccp the one thing that stuck with me was him telling me that ganking was something that ccp actually supports as content because it serves a reminder that you are never safe in eve its just a little something that keeps my cold heart pumping as i hold ganking dear as one of the few pillars of highsec piracyi think it was best put by floppiethebanjoclown in his recent post regarding good guys in highsecso why not promote ideas for making highsec more fun by creating new opportunities careers and above all else content what happened to bounty hunters and an actual functional bounty system how about player integration and roles in empire space or even concord i understand that the whole election promises business is kind of a farce for the csm but at the same time members are still giving an input on the development of the game and future plans so no reason to shy away from making suggestionsgood luck but you dont have my vote
yes you can pthat alone gives you my vote
if you are unable to distinguish or see the finer issues and subtle differences within a coalition like the cfcimperium then you are showing a clear lack of political maturity which would in my opinion lead to questions in your own csm thread not mineto assume that all if any alliance agrees with everything done within the coalition or that particular alliances are on the same level or wave length of other alliances you are totally and completely wrong to then accuse me of being out of touch with the political and mechanical nuances of nullsec is absurd my candidacy for csm is partly motivated because i do understand the differences in culture and goals between the entities within a large coalition shouting from the outside pointing the finger underlines a lack of political maturity or dare i say it proves that you in particular are powerless to change the thing you claim to opposeif your argument is grr gons hat gons i would point you towards a condi candidates thread if your goal is to go into every candidates thread to character assassinate them i would say people can make up their own minds on who they would like to represent them i for one stand as a nullsec candidate not a cfc one co2 has historically and culturally and dont take my word for it please have some frank conversations with people who can know a different identity
while i accept that sometimes a small amount of poison can actually be a fairly effective medicine the disease of the cfc is not so easily treatedwhile you easily say that each entity within the imperium is its own thing and that you wish to speak for null sec foryour own reasons it just isnt very believable the north is stagnation where parts of the south hum with activity where your leadership sees the need to bulldoze areas like cloud ring which were healthy examples of aegissov working other entities work hard to bring eve to its best by taking risks in null let me pull up my personal red list as it will be your blue listcircleoftwoclockwork pineappleexecutive outcomesfidelas constansget off my lawngoonswarm federationrazor alliancespacemonkeys alliancetactical narcotics teamthe bastionthe initiativewhole squidbeing blue acting in unison with that many entities does that foster content no if you actually understood the first thing about the health of null you could see how silly you are being null is suffocating because of that and you are part of that its made even worse as its not just something that happened its premeditated designed stagnation if you were some enterprising person from pfr or something then i could see you as motivated for and by your playersbut as a thrall to the cfc i can see you as only deluded every day you remain blue to that you stifle content remove conflict and contribute to the decline of eve on an epic scale you speak of a difference in goals just what is the goal of co2 and how is being blue to the largest bloc in the game forward it how are you really any different from someone in condi it is hard to believe you are as you say historically and culturally different from the rest of those blue hugging megaalliances i have long learned to judge alliances by what they do not by what they say literally an arsonist telling people how to put the fires out i admit that is not an easy sell and good luck and all but so long as your alliance is pawn of the cfc then people are likely going to see you as one too tacitly approving their behavior
you sound like a grumpy and bitter german vic probably because you actually areyou clearly have no clue when it comes to the finer aspects of nullsec politics and to get your response out of the way already neither do ibut please do explain me how you going to iceland will prevent people to work together in a social game sorry to burst your bubble vic but the csm doesnt have the tools to change thator maybe you want to push for a limit on the number of blues a corp or alliance can havegive southern logi double range only against cfc fleets of course you dont want to upset the balance too much rightyou are a onetrickpony vic shout gggggrrrrrr goons as much as you want im not a goon the judge is not a goon co2 are not goons im sure you wont ever understand or accept that  talking about stagnation right  but thats okay i know co2 better than you do and you should do a tiny bit more research before you start shitting up peoples threads also any good firefighter will tell you that often you fight fire with fire does that make the arsonist a good firefighter or the good firefighter an arsonist think about it vic

i have voted for this man twice and he didnt get in at first when he got a position during the musical chairs rearrangement which resulted from others being dropped gorski has proven consistently to be a useful addition to the csm as someone who knows him personally and has talked with him about many issues falling into his platform i can only say i respect gorskis keen mind and sharp understanding of ship balancing issues if you want someone on the csm who can compare to and even outdo fozzie rise and ytterbium on balancing considerations then you should put gorski on your ballot lets see what he can do on a full termalso voting him in is the best way to keep that krab out of your space
there are quite a few viable battleship doctrines out there as everything in eve it highly depends on the situation and the users intention machariels are only one of many frequently used battleship doctrines atmbuffingadjusting a single ship class because you want to see more of them or they should be forces to be reconed with isnt really a thing in eve and leads to imbalances in power in a very hard to balance environmentwhat would you want to change and why pretty sure ccp is aware of that since forever but since alliances are corporations of corporations this is really hard to implement this is not really anything you as csm could change or affect when multiple fleets work together they usually have some sort of communcation link setup already this change would only amplify n1 gameplay which nobody really wants to see this was part of jayne fillons platform last year and even tho ccp mentioned that they have plans in regards to this topic they clearly couldnt devote any resources to it the point about temporary standings is not a big issue for most fleets since1 people usually shoot what a targetcallerfc broadcasts2 fcstargetcallers can already set standings towards other entities3 distinguishing different fleets is not an impossible task and shouldnt be for an aspiring fc4 fcs usually coordinate with each other alreadyhow would this change which is probably a lot of effort to implement affect the day to day buisness in npsi fleets and why should ccp devote resources to this considering that multifleet engagements are fairly rare and it would be only a improvement for a very small part of the eve population
hello friends of new eden i am widget zombie i have been playing eve online for almost 4 years i have watched various csm campaigns happen and i confess it got me more interested in the game my play style has revolved around the players and the communities that are built inside of eve over the last few years i have played the general role of diplomat starting at a corporation level leading to being the head diplomat for one of the larger alliances in the game i have been involved with my alliance community for 2 years and my personal community for 4 years i have met a lot of eve players in rl including hugging many of you at eve vegas 2015 as much as the game mechanics are an important aspect in the game the people are more important its the people that keep the game going its the people that truly help make changes with how the game runs and is played ladies and gentleman i want to be the voice of change the voice of reason as a potential member of csm i will make myself publicly available to yield your comments and concerns i will them turn them into the issues i will bring to the tabletopics of interest structures and their use in highsec lowsec nullsec and wormhole space  over the next year or so the new structures will be coming to the game itUFFFDs important to know about the changes and how they affect everyone in the game questions range from how will citadels or other structures affect the high security lifestyle to those who live in wormholes and the buildingmovinganchoring process the interest of this topic embraces 100 of the player base there is no getting around it the future of entosis mechanics  i am not saying that they are perfect or broken however the theory behind the entosis modules was an interesting idea will the proposed changes to the module affect anyone who uses them in a positive or negative light we wonUFFFDt truthfully know until that time comes team building  i am apart of the second largest alliance in eve at the moment over the past 2 years i have been apart of the building and expanding of a rather incredible alliance i want to take my team building skills with me to the csm to enhance the potential output for the upcoming year in the future i would be open to assisting alliancescorporations with team building assistance capitals  does it have a jump drive count me in on a much personal level i used to the to love sub capitals then one day i flew a carrier it was my world then as i proceeded to fill my cranium with other skill books relating to being able to jump farther conserve jump fuel and engage faster i realized my true calling to the game was the capitals today capitals are rarely used for fleet engagements but more often than not used for pve capitals were made for multifunction use hauling things increased effective hit points and higher dps this rotation of unbalancedness needs diminished i am excited about 6 types of doomsday coming soon i am unexcited about being able to get tackled by a frigate lets get capitals on the same page for once and get new changes to roll out in unison with all races new player engagement  when huge environment changes happen in any game you tend to see huge spikes of members renewing subscriptions or people finding an interest in signing up to play the game in recent years of recruiting i have found that several new players to the game are often lost and confused or they got recruited to a corporation that offered little to no assistance in getting them properly trained aura is a great tool and it walks anyone through the entirety of the game new player UFFFDhelp channelsUFFFD are convenient but often now players canUFFFDt find them language barrier there should be a setting to assist with translation and allow multiple language sets to play within the same corporationalliance as they want to work towards the same goals new players need to be set up to succeed or else they will leave the game and never come back thank you for reading my post i am very excited to be applying to csm xi and hope to be representing you

hi vic thanks for stopping by my campaign thread as i see by your signature you are running as well best of luck with your attempts prove it 99 i would like to see some numbersit is true that with increased grid sizes there is more of a warning but how much do you mine or haul without getting gankednot fix changefor example the concord mechanics as they are just do not seem to make sense at the very least the concord response needs to be adjusted to the new grid sizesdont forget the csm does not dictate to ccp what should or should not be done have you read this blog
thanks for stopping by my threadyes ganking takes up a large part of my platform but there are other aspects to my platform as well code bros did not maul my campaign last year and i am sure that they will not do it this year eitherit is getting late and i will write a more thoughtful response to your post latertomorrow when i am not so tired its nice to have some thoughtful input from the pirate community after all we are all in high sec together and high sec should be fun for everyone or at least subject to rules and conditions that make sense and seem consistenthave you tried mining
i never know if despicable is good or bad when in quotes like thatnice to see someone trying to represent hisec but you may want to watch for the balance of the game and what will and will not pass mmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
thanks for stopping by mikeyes i am aware of balance issues  and i am not wanting to turn high sec into a theme park i am actually trying to think of balance or things making sense when i talk about things like concord and different ice spawning mechanics ccp have already definitively spoken about bumping ganking and stuff like that and i am not naUFFFDve enough to think i could get them to change their mind but those of us who haulminebuild are also out there even if we never read forum threads or participate in discussions or vote in the csm electionswith all the pessimism about csm things being blogged  talked about i am not sure what the future holds for the csm and the role it will play in the future but i will try to fly it like i mean it o7
i was using it humorously
hi good luck in your campaign as wellmore than you would think actually as i have lots to move around it works pretty much the same as most things in this game where the antagonist party basically just has to find some one who gets careless or makes a mistake leaving an opening for a gank theres a reason why red and black frog dont complain about code the same reason extreme nullbears dont really get caught much they know how to mitigate the risks associated with their profession and they know that the only kills antagonists get are the ones given to them use scouts use webbing alts pay attention fit a tank one or more of these will deny any chance of a gank happening honestly its bad game play as there is no real back and forth the antagonist is entirely reactive waiting for a chance to strikeyou want the game and its players to be able to sort out the good behaviors from the bad ones rewarding the good punishing the bad its honestly one of the few things that make the game unique considering a skillful and careful player can maintain extremely high levels of safety i dont think concord needs a buff or a change you do not want to make it too hard to gank in high sec nor too easy to remain safe if anything i personally feel its too tilted towards the latter at the moment but i am willing to hear it from both sides i havent ganked in hs in a long time but at least from the antagonist side here some people refused to be caught while others simply let it happen  safety is a personal responsibility in this game mechanics that do it for you removes part of what makes eve eve basically its already to the point where you can be practically untouchable in hs in my appraisalhigh sec is as safe as its players are informedyes i understand what the csm does and is for i would invite you to stop by my thread
i know i also know that concord are not there to save the gankee from the ganker but having them turn up after exactly the same time and then just sit around strikes a nerve i did not meant to imply patrol as in concord are flying around the system looking for troublemakers i meant it in a more abstract way surely those brave concord ships have better things to do than spend the rest of the day sitting around in the asteroid belts by having them fly off to do other things and getting rid of the prepulling  concord manipulation mechanic was meant to make things simpler for all involved and i do not have to sit in a belt with 1 concord patrol present and see them watch and do nothing whilst the second catalyst ganks meat fanfest last year ccp announced that ganking actually might help with player retention however obscure that might seem to be if ccp themselves said it it must have a basis in fact i am not trying to advocate getting ganking abolished because i know that will never happen i would like to see the mechanics being different i thought about mentioning things like bounties and wardecs in my opening post  but unfortunately i myself dont have any direct ideas on how to make them better whilst there is work going on with wardecs amongst the player community i have yet to hear of anything that would make bounty hunting an acceptable or workable calling i am trying to keep myself away from election promises apart from that pink ships thing if i do get elected i will be trying to represent the interests of high sec ccp has more than once stated unequivocally that high sec ganking and bumping are here to stay  so it would be an obvious and outright lie and betrayal of voter trust for me to say i will try to end ganking the pirate community as you say is well organised and have managed to deal with every nerf that has until now been thrust upon them i just personally think that things should be a little different
the space princess supports you you has my vote good sir
i have played with the juge for 2 years and behind the eve player i can say he is an honest and upright manhe loves this game like all of us and he has good ideas to offer it a great future the judge for csm
vicyou post to quote grrgoons as part of your candidacy you have stated on multiple csm threads how you feel rather verbally going as far as calling goons and the imperium more or less a conspiracy i will not argue sov warfare has slowed however goons and imperium are not the only entity held accountable for this to my knowledge there are plenty other entities in other areas of sov holding space that are likewise in coalitions that are just as stagnantyou seem to press goons as one of your sub topics yet have voiced about them the most in of your posts outside your initial posts on them have been about the imperium you make little to no account for fozzie sov and make of that what you will since the release of almost all major warfare has stopped and all expansions as well or any kind of warfare in the respect of sov grabs since fozzie release there has been little need for it and defending it has been an annoyance to say the least with all that said far be it for me to say your entire campaign seems entirely biased on nothing but the self destruction f the goons let me say again there are other coalitions that are running with just as many blues with just as much spaceto say that the goons are the only bad group that could be detrimental to the health of eve online is so insanely biased and absurd in another thread you recommended co2 to more or less depart the imperium lest we be unable to speak from a culturally acceptable levelso let me ask you this would you prefer the goons and only as you have failed to list the other coalitions the goons to disband under the circumstances that it is hurting eves health as a sandbox where they players make their own choice and do what they will third party or not rules and regulations aside or be forced to disband as part of your candidacy is grrgoons which i assume you would plan to fix or change in someway 
there was a dream that was content ring once an area geographically favored to become the content cauldron that aegissov promised then the goons came and the dream turned into an endless nightmare of empty systems sure some areas may be stagnant but its another thing actively enforce iti have made account of fozziesov i would suggest reading what i wrote about the two dissonant entry bars as this goes through in some depth about how even though the mechanics have changed social structures have not if you want warfare find people who are also interested in that part of the game the imperium is not interested in that part of the game maybe its members are but it is not a much more scary exciting world is out there in new eden but you have to want it bad enough to take risks and there are no risks for member alliances of the imperiumyou could all be swell upstanding people but id never know it since you spend all your time bending knee to the imperium goons have such a huge super majority of players that you cannot compare them to other coalitions its not about how much space someone has but how much of the player base they have locked up true its a sandbox play however you find enjoyment and laughs no matter what mechanics they implement if they are even half sane if so many of the players are locked into a situation where they cannot shoot at each other they wont mechanics alone cannot create content waiting for one feature to deliver you content is just silly aegissov may not be the best but its daft to demonize it and blame all the games ills on it  the games ills are in large part player made and there is no magic game mechanic bullet to magically create large scale wars when the powers that be do not want it if ccp is interested in making the game a more interesting place they should foster smaller alliances as all the keys to newbies right now are in large part owned by large blocs
i have made account of fozziesov i would suggest reading what i wrote about the two dissonant entry bars as this goes through in some depth about how even though the mechanics have changed social structures have not if you want warfare find people who are also interested in that part of the game the imperium is not interested in that part of the game maybe its members are but it is not a much more scary exciting world is out there in new eden but you have to want it bad enough to take risks and there are no risks for member alliances of the imperiumyou could all be swell upstanding people but id never know it since you spend all your time bending knee to the imperium goons have such a huge super majority of players that you cannot compare them to other coalitions its not about how much space someone has but how much of the player base they have locked up true its a sandbox play however you find enjoyment and laughs no matter what mechanics they implement if they are even half sane if so many of the players are locked into a situation where they cannot shoot at each other they wont mechanics alone cannot create content waiting for one feature to deliver you content is just silly aegissov may not be the best but its daft to demonize it and blame all the games ills on it  the games ills are in large part player made and there is no magic game mechanic bullet to magically create large scale wars when the powers that be do not want it if ccp is interested in making the game a more interesting place they should foster smaller alliances as all the keys to newbies right now are in large part owned by large blocsquotelets see where to begin alright you say you made note on fozzie sov yes i did say you had to quote  you make little to no account for fozzie sov that is not none but some to an extent you just however fail to mention its as a potential primary factor in the decrease of sov activity since it came out nobody wants to do warfare at least not on a massive scale hence all the nips and agreements such as in delve for open pvp content with out any soc grab hits due to the annoyances they cause might want to look into that more before you shift all the blame to one placei will level with you i am not against you as a person or specifically because i am a member of co2 i am against you because your entire campaign seems entirely biasedyou mention there is no magic update to just bring content and i would agree with that but again player choice the issue here is that an empire should always look to thrive and if possible expand and most would even look for peace which makes sense the issue being in a game peace is boring i am not disagreeing and trust me when i say i am an advocate of major wars i miss them and i want them back however the imperium is comparable to other coalitions size is slightly relevant but you say space controlled is not you than say this one though is great yet you accuse other imperium runners of not being cultured or understanding the values of which make eve so great you toss them out so to speak as options that are in no way considerable or at least you seem to feel they should not be specifically because they are imperium members regardless of their personal values make sure to remember goons were very much so outspoken for the change in tech moons that of which they controlled almost if not all of them which at the point of the change stood only to benefit everyone else giving them a chancehowever i digress and am out of space on this
lets see where to begin alright you say you made note on fozzie sov yes i did say you had to quote  you make little to no account for fozzie sov that is not none but some to an extent you just however fail to mention its as a potential primary factor in the decrease of sov activity since it came out nobody wants to do warfare at least not on a massive scale hence all the nips and agreements such as in delve for open pvp content with out any soc grab hits due to the annoyances they cause might want to look into that more before you shift all the blame to one placei will level with you i am not against you as a person or specifically because i am a member of co2 i am against you because your entire campaign seems entirely biasedyou mention there is no magic update to just bring content and i would agree with that but again player choice the issue here is that an empire should always look to thrive and if possible expand and most would even look for peace which makes sense the issue being in a game peace is boring i am not disagreeing and trust me when i say i am an advocate of major wars i miss them and i want them back however the imperium is comparable to other coalitions size is slightly relevant but you say space controlled is not you than say this one though is great yet you accuse other imperium runners of not being cultured or understanding the values of which make eve so great you toss them out so to speak as options that are in no way considerable or at least you seem to feel they should not be specifically because they are imperium members regardless of their personal values make sure to remember goons were very much so outspoken for the change in tech moons that of which they controlled almost if not all of them which at the point of the change stood only to benefit everyone else giving them a chancehowever i digress and am out of space on thisquoteur gay pwned
i am not sure how much more explicit i need to be here the only value you have to the cfc is as a vassal state and when this is done this at the expense of potential content for players and alliances in exchange for safety when trading content for safety is tolerated by alliance members as acceptable behavior it speaks volumes about what those members actually value its painfully obvious that member states value ratting and srp far more than getting the content they moan you cannot get because of aegissov content ring was a thing for a good few months let me remind you how well the cfc tolerated that honestly ph could have had a nice sporty war with one of the vassal states of equivalent size but instead it was the prerogative of the cfc to just overwhelm them yes maybe the system isnt the best nothing is perfect it could use some work however in the case of the imperium it doesnt matter what system is in place what mechanics are in the game they will always pick the most boring one that ensures security eve was fresh new inventive and exciting when things were allowed to happen in game but the social structures that be prevent most of this as a member of the imperium you are associated with this behavior or you tacitly agree with it by the nature of being in a coalition whose modus operandi was and still is weaponized boredom which is why i do not find your pseudo claims of having different values than your host coalition credulous if you had different values why be blue to them given them players to wage conquest and defense with either you are very conflicted or you are at the end of the day very content being a pawn to the greater cfc so long as you can rat and get srp
email sent thanks for all the work on this

if all goes well ill be posting the video version tomorrow or friday ill be ramping things up soon and i hope to show that im a worthy candidate during coming events and through interviews answers etc here and in other places
i have decided not to run for csm a major health concern has come up and i dont want to deal with csm campaigning while also having to solve my own personal issuesi am always available via mail if youd like to ask me about anything hauling related pps isd please lock
3 nashh your like an uber bro amongst the uber bros and only have the best on your mind for how to improve eve esports and the community not from just posting your gripes on the forums but having an opinion and then acting on it to make it better for everyonevote 1 nashh hotdogbois4lyf
thank you for your kind endorsements i want an eve revival theres been a steady decline in numbers lets be honest game changing patches have lost many in our community i say we roll back to the preretribution patch as it hurt the numbers greatly and hurt our game that we loveif you havent been playing eve that long it was the suspect timer patch admittedly everyone has gotten used to it but it was a better experiencehave a wonderful daykilling your ships and pods since 2008 killboards dont lie dont get mad get better
i am argoni brinalle one of the directors of the red frog freight alliance in addition to hauling for the three divisions of our alliance i actively manage over 200 freighter pilots and 30 jump freighter pilots throughout high low and null in the past i have also run incursions mined and have pvpUFFFDd in all regions of space with various corps and alliances in addition to learning what changes are expected by service and industry focused players i would like to see work done to make improvements in the following areascontract systemthe courier contract system is old on a basic level it does work but there is a lot of improvements that are long overdue a lot of very good suggestions where given back in april when ccp asked for feedback since then nothing has been done or any suggestions that ccp is planning on working on it to help clarify going forward all hauling corps and most alliance and bloc hauling is done on out of corp characters to avoid wardecs this forces us to use one character the ca to accept a courier contract and another character the fa to haul the contract a currently you canUFFFDt see what is inside of a courier contract like you can with an item exchange being able to see the contents after you accept the contract eliminate secrecy as a reason for this a proposal have courier contracts show the contents before the contract is acceptedb containers currently the contract system doesnUFFFDt allow item exchange contracts to be created if there is a container inside of a courier package this forces in station trading of the contract which necessitates the ca to fly out to the station once at the station the ca direct trades with the fa this also necessitates two separate active accounts a proposal either allow item exchange contracts for courier contracts with a container in them or show a flag like cargo size that denotes the existence of a container in a container c stack size to go along with the containers change a lot of containers are used in courier contract to bypass the 200 item stack size limit a proposal if there must be a limit increase it to something much higher or ideally remove the limit all together and let storage size be the limiting factord contract auto rejection currently freight corporations must manually check the courier contracts issued to them to ensure that the size collateral expirations are correct a proposal allow corporations to set maximum and minimum values for courier contracts to be issued to the corporation if the contract doesnUFFFDt match the allowed values then the contract is auto rejected and the issuer is told why the contract failed to be issued further down the road maybe even allow corporations to set restrictions on security status serviced or systems not delivered to e quality of life setting up contracts currently there are 5 screens you must click through before you can issue a contract a proposal condense the contract screen to a items and rewards screen and a confirm screen easy quality of life improvementthe proposals listed above are the changes i see as critical to the improvement of the contract system there are further changes i would like to see made and would like to hear any further ideas you have as wellchat managementcurrently the management of a large intel or multi corp UFFFD multi alliance channel is to be blunt a major headache as an example red frog freight maintains two such channels one for red frog and one for black frog in these channels we have our relevant corps added as well as over 700 individual characters a ability to search inside of the access listb ability to see if the character is in the corp or alliance without having to manually personal standingsc auto trim once a character or corp is added that entry stays in the channel list until removed overtime this leads to a lot of inactive characters that are no actually using the channel a proposal allow channel admins to have an option to auto remove the character is after a certain amount of time the character hasnUFFFDt joined the channel
igb changesnot much to say here ccp announced that they would like to remove the igb i agree something needs to be done with as it is super outdated and requires special design or websites just to allow its use but the igb is widely used in all manner of in game tasks we need to ensure that before the igb is removed all parties using it have the ability to replace the task in some way as an example for red frog we use the igb to monitor accept and reject all contracts if the igb were to be removed today we would be force to return to the default contract finder which doesnUFFFDt have a lot of the super specific functionality we enjoy ccp is doing a great job on this front with the crest api additions that have been added as well as the eve auth functionalitygankingyes i know the hs carebear is going to complain about gankingUFFFD well not really i think ganking has its place in eve and in high sec honestly without it hauling service corps wouldnUFFFDt be in business except to serve the super lazy not being safe in eve ever unless you are docked in an npc station is what makes eve well eve i think as we look at the ability to gank vs the ability to avoid the gank is in a decent spot for all but the freighter class all other ship types allowed in hs have the ability to counter the bumping mechanics that freighters fall prey to a freighter on the other hand once bumped is a sitting duck there is one way to avoid getting bumped in a freighter external webbing if your webber its self isnUFFFDt ganked first this is the one area that needs addressing tbh no other single relationship in eve is so one dimensional the breakdown that allows this i believe is the ability to continuously bump without repercussion i would like to hear ideas that donUFFFDt break the ganking gameplay itself but do help bring the freighter part inlineproposal make bumping of a ship outside of 100km of a gate or station grant a criminal tag after a certain amount of bumps on a single ship in a certain time period corp historycurrently your time in corp is set to count the time since you last joined to the present day will this is an alright count of corp senority a better way i think would be to count total time in the current corp for all stays in corp maybe have two lines in the character profile one for time of current stay and one for total time in history this would allow players to more easily recognize members of a corp with extensive history without having to manually search through corp historybookmark systemalliance bookmarks the increase in allowed number of corp bookmarks has helped thank you ccp for that but we need to go one step further and address a quality of life issue that affect mostly wh alliances because the path to go somewhere is constantly changing corps are constantly copying their bookmarks and dropping them in space for other corps in the alliance why do we need this extra step to achieve what could be done by implementing alliance bookmarks rights to edit the bookmarks would be tricky since how do you assign rights to edit alliance wide i think a good place to start would be expand the role that allows you to delete bookmarks from corp to be allowed to also copy to and remove from alliance bookmarks
a shade vaguechanges in what directionm
please discuss with ccp the possibility of increasing the speed of this game its too slowtoo much time is spent and wasted warping around from system to system at sub 10 aui propose ccp increase au warp speed by a factor of 10 ex your standard cruiser would warp at 13au not 3ive been playing since 2005 and even with the implementation of the latest warp speed increase modules and ascendancy implants warp speed is still far to slowthis increase would be a big incentive to new players as well when they are informed that it no longer takes forever to get anywherewhat do you think
i am the bridge within the bridge through me distant mountains meet
i look forward to having xenuria locked in a room with ccp
my official application to the csm xi elections has been sent now the wait for ccps confirmation is starting this is the opportunity to bring a refresher on the stv voting system used for this election
i give my full support to joffy on his csm xi campaign in this release i have offered my reason for stepping down my campaign and throwing my full support behind joffy for csm xi
i had the opportunity to sit down with ccp leeloo and discuss the csm
this is actually a very good point hope you make it up to iceland so you can at least get this across to them
thanks for the question apex im open to any and all and do enjoy putting my thoughts into writing no matter how hypothetical a scenario is required for those thoughts to become realisedive been getting a few private mails asking about how i thought the small battlecruiser rebalance went so i decided to answer in a slightly different format and published an article on the what i felt a battlecruisers role was within eve and how these changes affected themill probably write out answers to a few more questions in this long form if there are ones that i can really go deep on in terms of analysing them
sorry perhaps this is just me but i cannot seem to find your proposed changes to concord on your blog could you provide a link or a summary herebut as to your point and has been pointed out above you already have a better than 50 chance of getting away from a gank way more than 50 of the targets i consider ganking escape unscathed either because further investigation reveals they are too tanked paying too much attention a miscalculation on my part or by just dumb luck warping away at the last minute i would even venture to say anyone who knows what they are doing and spends a small amount of effort can avoid over 99 of all highsec ganks i am thinking though you mean to make the criminal highsec pvp encounters themselves less binary i think such a thing is possible while keeping risk in highsec so i am curious about what ideas you might have as to risk what is your current view on the risk vs reward balance of highsec do you think the income levels possible in highsec are suitable for the current level of risk if so do you think this has any consequences for the game as a whole that you are concerned about

have played with the judge for a long time in eve and out can tell you he knows his stuff he has my votethe judge for csm
isnt the csm supposed to be none biased built to improve the game through player feed back so vic you seem very biased against the cfc which are they not called the imperium now it seems you are using the csm elections as a way to spread propaganda about your reds rather than staying none biased as such why should i vote for you instead of someone else that has stuck to the issues and not taken the time to bad mouth other entities in game
there is a healthy amount of grrr goons in my posting but there are lots of other very topics that i cover that are only tangential at best to it while you are free to call me whatever you want so long as the moderators do not get involved i would kindly ask you to center on the issues opinions or perspectives i have posted here which cover many aspects of the gamei surmise that everyone went through a phase as a kid where you liked dinosaurs i mean how could you not they were huge and had big teeth and didnt take smack from puny small mammals when we had huge tyrant coalitions unlike dinosaurs they didnt vie for dominance through brutal contests of strength they turned blue now between phobe and aegissov that was supposed to be the proverbial meteor that wipes out the big ticket sov blocs dinosaurs if you will thing is it didnt we are supposed to be in an age when there is competition between rapidly evolving smaller alliances each clawing gnashing and fighting for their own chunk of sov but the culture of big ticket sov is still dominant and we have seen what that culture does to conflict namely eliminates itas i have written about in other posts a lot of what has prevented this is that established blocs have all the out of game resources to make things work whereas new entities have to do all of this in one step to compete which is exceptionally difficult to do when dinosaurs were wiped out evolution ran riot with the clean slate of a world to work with whereas here not all that much changed the central theme of my campaign is that if you want new eden to feel new if you want to engage newer players with content they can personally get involved with and feel an attachment to the game and have fun with then you have to give players a smoother incline and more choices of how to start that journey right now the choices are leveling a raven or joining a big ticket null bloc

thats just poetic bullshit theres a world of difference between the two anyone thats ever been in a combat rolefleet will tell you thatganking doesnt require skills just greater numbers pvp is 1 on 1 it requires tactical skill as well as the time taken to train skills the only similarity is that pvp and ganking both involve capsuleersanyway i digress i cant think of anyone better to run for a csm position than foo his knowledge of the eve universe far exceeds that of anyone i have metspoken to during my brief time heremost people can and will tell you what to do why you should do it and how best to do it from the many killboards to the forums to the blogposts everyone has an opinion on whats best foo doesnt just do that he goes further he listens to what it is that you are trying to achieve and then explains what it is you need to do to achieve the results you are looking for he has an answer to the question you havent even figured out you need to askin my humble opinion that is a great quality a great skill listening to people and then helping them achieve their goals efficiently isnt that what someone on any kind of council should dolisten to you and liaise with governing bodies
fellow capsuleers omy name is vic and i need your help to fix the csm before we lose our voice foreverabout meive been playing eve since 2009 and have done so solo in a small group and as part of a large alliance i have learned how to lead and how to follow my adventures have taken me from humble hisec beginnings through to null wh space and back again multiple times i have pved pvpd mined researched hauled manufactured and traded i believe i have a pretty good grasp of the concept of eve as a whole and i am passionate about every aspect of gameplay and lore i love the entire eve package there is simply nothing else like itirl i am exmilitary and currently a business owner so ive done grunt work and also steered the ship i am a pragmatist at heart with a low tolerance for ego and celebrity but balance it out with a personable attitude and laidback nature dedicated autz player fanfest pilgrim edu attendee youre next eve vegas bourbon enthusiast scifi fan metalambientedm listener and student of historymy csm role collaboration  the csm can not afford another bad term if it doesnt want to be seen as a complete joke we need to stick to the very serious task of being a voice for the community and sounding board for the devs but at the same time realise that we must work with ccp to improve the eve experience our overarching goal should always be the continuation and growth of eve not competing against each other to try and steer it i aim to use my position to reinforce this view and create a more positive collaborative culture its concerning that this point is mostly mentioned last in other platforms when it is at the moment the most critical perspective  many potential csm members are representing certain parts of new eden null hisec etc or are building their platforms around certain balance changes or upcoming content instead of the production line view of players moving from hisec  losecfw  nullwhs etc or the view that everything should be done towards the end goal of pvp i personally view all of eve as an organism made of symbiotic parts each has their intrinsic value and place none is above or better than the other and each is attractive to a certain type of player and style of play from the basementdwelling nullsec overlord to the marriedwithkids hisec industrialist we need to take into account the factors affecting the enjoyment of all these different people to keep eve balanced and healthy as a csm member i will do my best to collate and find balance in the multitude of specialist views so the maximum number of people can find enjoyment and new subscriptions are constant because eve will appeal to more people instead of catering for the interests of a particularly vocal portion realism  ccp is a business at the end of the day which will affect their decisions some things take time to change and implement in a game with over a decade of history and complexity the maxim of it being infinitely better to take small steps and fix the foundations before you build another storey is as true for eve as for anything in the real world new eden is a dark science fiction universe the lore and feel of the game should reflect this the game is about funhr not iskhr it is a social game my aim as part of the csm is to check each concept and implementation against these ideas and more as they come to light to ensure a grounded and consistent approach to the eve development cycle in conclusioni dont care about being an internet celebrity i dont care about agendas and i am not the delegate for xyz i am in this for the bigger picture i am in this for the survival of eve this year i have sufficient time and effort available to truly dedicate myself to a term on the csm if you want a member who has gone from years of quiet observation and experience to deciding to make a difference to a critical part of the ccpplayerbase relationship then help me make that difference by talking with your vote during the yc118 csm xi electionsa vote for vic is a vote for eve and if you dont vote for evecan i have your stuffo7feel free to post questions in this thread if you have any

not so sure on this for example a neut in local will send the vast majority of ratters to their station a pos or a safe it is extremely one dimensionalyou do have other options here you arent discussing for example you can scout the gate to check for people who would gank your webs or you could use a webbing ship that is harder to gank or use multiple webbing ships thus making you more unattractive to gank as there are easier targets you could even gank the bumping ship or bump it back when you realize that groups that do lots of freighter ganking are very organized and require many characters each doing a very specialized job they should have countermeasures they can take for the preventative measures you take as it is webbing alts are already extremely powerful your one extra hand can already mitigate the efforts of many ganking characters two or three could suitably stall a ganking fleet onto a different target i think your proposal of ship bumps 100km from gate needs some work this negates the possibility of counterbumping by making it criminal and could also get a lot of people concorded for just flying normally i can see where hi sec generally needs better criminal mechanics as the antagonists have no skin in the game at any time and can wait indefinitely until someone makes a mistake which is punishable there is no way to take the fight to the antagonists which is just strange that all the onus of remaining vigilant lays on the freighters and minersits great that as you point out shipping services largely exist due to the risks involved ie contract your stuff the specialists who are used to being good at moving stuff so it does arrive safely making it a rewarding and valuable profession the riskier a profession is the more the game and its players sort out the good players from the bad and the more profitable it can become to those who devote the resources to become good at it
like you said criminal mechanics does need work how do we make criminal mechanics more dynamic and interesting without breaking ganking as a part of eve how do we help the target of the gank stand a chance without making the ganker have no chance how do we balance the cost of ganking a mostly empty ship be much closer to the cost of the ship being ganked honestly i have no good idea for that right now but i think the discussion needs to happen like i said ganking sub freighter is in a decent place but once you start looking at freighters i know a couple things need to change1 cost of a single ganking catalyst is 23mil cost of a ganking fleet of catalysts is sub 100mil compare this to the 125bil cost of a totally empty freighter lets use red frogs operating guideline of only carrying up to 1bil in cargo which is honestly not a lot of isk in the big picture this makes the cost of the freighter 225bil that can be without risk ganked by sub 100mil do i think the player numbers it takes to down a freighter needs to increase no but the isk value being risked needs to move closer the haul value 2 the ability of a single mach to prevent a freighter from warping for an indefinite period of time with very little risk needs to change do i have a problem with the mach being able to prevent a frighter from warping no not really but i do think that there needs to be a mechanic in place that forces the ganking party to act quickly or allow the freighter to pass i have watched freighters bumped for a good hour  with no attempt at ganking it that is broken
naw its good as it is you do not want to raise the bar too high for ganking if you really want a huge disparity look a the people that use thrashers to gank autopiloting pods 5m for a chance at a multibillion isk killmail effort and organizational manpower factor into this equation as well so i am 100 ok with very cheap things enmasse overwhelming very expensive things i dont really if you had one counter bumper you could deal with the bumping its pretty symmetrical the bumper is at risk the entire time if you had a ganking fleet of your own
i dont really if you had one counter bumper you could deal with the bumping its pretty symmetrical the bumper is at risk the entire time if you had a ganking fleet of your own quotei would argue that those interested in ganking the mach are already on the side of the mach if i want to gank i dont go looking for gankers to gank i side with the gankers so really the mach is at little to no risk in this equation
really doesnt the organization whose freighter is being bumped have a strong incentive to gank the bumper to save their associate i mean capitals get tackled and even bumptackled all over new eden leading to frantic calls for assistance and often escalation why is it only highsec freighter pilots who seem to feel game mechanics should save their capital ship from an opponent once a pvp engagement has begunclearly bumping is not the greatest mechanic and one can imagine alternative interdiction mechanics for capital ships in highsec but do you agree that whatever hypothetical changes are made to the mechanic should preserve and even increase the chance for escalation of fights if so do you have any preferred ideas on how to do so something better than the sologetoutofpvpfree mechanic you just proposed above
organizational strength is a big part of eve online why doesnt red frog hire professional counterbumpers surely it is of the size and strength that hiring professional white knights isnt unreasonablegankers take time to set up organize stay supplied and to fill every role to make a gank successful you should have to put in some effort to counter an entire fleets effort in order to stay safe there are plenty of white knight types but as far as i know they are poorly coordinated and even less organized emergent gameplays solution would be to fix this problem before the mechanics do it by themselves the side that is more organized quite frankly deserves to succeed where the less organized side deserves to losebasically the more mechanics do to protect people the less player involvement is required player involvement and identity is the literal lifeblood of this game i dont think the mechanics are unbalanced here at all rather that they remain under utilized and under exploited by one side i remember one time where our freighter was being bumped in high sec he was autopiloting and deserved to be in the situation he got himself into a certain infamous high sec antagonist whom we were blue to at the time literally counter bumped our freighter into warp before it was ganked effectively rescuing it i think this just shows you how one side has done more homework than the other  learning these tricks and effectively integrating them into an organization works and is much healthier for fostering actual game play than heavy handed mechanics changes it is possible to rescue a freighter if you have the tools on hand  you should not expect to counter the efforts of an entire fleet alone though mechanics rescuing that freighter would have made that incident any other game but having one of the most prolific gankers save a freighter that wasnt just a game that was eve
personally i would like to see rewardec timers for miners so if the surrender in a war they cant be redeced the next week by that same alliancecorp it would help with the highsec miningtrade groups if a 1 or 2 week immunity period would not be possible then a higher fee to be redeced by that entity would be something to consider
ok nerf wardecs it is what else do you got any thoughts on mining as a mechanic or changes your would like to see for suicide ganking
o7 melodee everhearti really want to apologize for not responding sooner to your questions ive been having some rl issuesi am new in regards to the disabled player community i see myself being an advocate to disabled players by working with joffy and erika and others to bring the issues disabled players have to ccp i dont see myself running against joffy and erika id like to see each of us get onto csm xi and work together for the good of the communitypersonally i think we need to show a little more focus in bringing the issues we care about to ccps attention and have them respond to the community and set out to make changes in accessibility
for immediate release start release to the capsuleers of new eden csm xi candidates and ccpcsm xi is going to be one of the most important elections of the capsuleer era csm has gone through rough times in the past yes and were going through one right now that means that each candidate working for your vote needs to bring specific things to the table including vision experience and resourcesi believe i have a vision for how our game might be made better and more accessible for differently abled capsuleers but right now we have one other person  joffy aulxgao  running for csm who also has a similiar vision i have come to recognise that a successful political campaign is not just about vision you need resources and experience as well and joffy has those in good measurenow is not the time for fractionalism now is a time to pool our vision resources and experiences for the best effect of making sure our message wants and needs get put before ccp and the capsuleer community to improve the game that is so loved by us all that is why in consultation with joffy today i have decided to step my campaign for csm xi down and merge my efforts with his i urge all of the people with me to join us in this combined battle all of us working together will ensure our needs and views gain a needed seat at the csm xi tablejoffy aulxgao for csm ximy sincere thanks end release 
sorry to you pal the corp that the ceo created back in 200whenever is still the property of that ceo now and forever until the end of time andor until when ccp says differently  not some bitter johnnycomelately who just wants a cool name to useperhaps these new subscribers should be a little bit more imaginative themselves rather than attempting to ride the coattails of those who have come beforeridiculous idea not supported in the least and your attitude certainly doesnt help and id crumple this idea up throw it in a wastepaper bin douse it with lighter fluid and start a conflagration with conflagration if i could
so wanting to keep one of the biggest trolls in eve off the csm makes ccp trolls themselvessure that makes sense
takes me about 30 minutes to cross a galaxy in a travel fit interceptor and a good portion of that time is spent in transition between systemsalso you fail to understand the speeds youre really travelling at the earth is 1 au from the sun as per the definition of au it takes the light from the sun roughly 8 minutes to travel 1 au heres a quick breakdown of how many times the speed of light the ships in eve travelcaps  15 aus is 720 times ccruisers  3 aus is 1440 times cfrigates  5 aus is 2400 times cintys  8 aus is 3840 times ctravel fit intys  112 aus is 5376 times cships in eve are actually very very fast what youre trying to get rid of is the scale of the game the feeling of living in a vast galaxy
aaaaand you instantly get my vote djust kidding ive spent probably around 6 months in tweetfleet slack broadcast4reps channel helping and trying to get helped thats where i met himthis person seems to be honest friendly and a good pvp player hes the person i want to be like in eve o

just quickly on the subject of risk i felt safer mining in provi than i do in high sec earned more as wellwhen i look at courier contracts i sometime think who would move that stuff for so little isk with the increase in plex prices last year they were about 800mill it is getting harder to plex an account by mining the high end of the income levels possible in high sec are i am sure ridiculous but not everyone of us has 8 accounts logging in after downtime to mine an ice field to extinction and then again when it comes back up again the average hisec carebear who wont be reading these forums or sadly voting in the election will not be making that muchi dont think risk vs reward is the only variable to consider fun vs reward is also very important mining an ice belt in a skiff is not much fun there is not much to do except watch netflix or browse youtube the income i get from it is not enough to justify the lack of fun and the risk is relatively minimal
attention pilotsi am brodit i am pleased to announce my candidacy for csm xi i would like to represent you the community from whom i have taken so much consider it pay back i will to the best of my ability represent your needs and desires to ccp for the betterment of us all i will do this with a light heart and a steely resolve i may not be serious about the craft but i am very serious about the community and the need for clear communication both ways to those ends i am not standing on any specific issue but will be available for discussion either directly through the in game public channel broditUFFFDs surgery or indirectly via eve mail i donUFFFDt have a prepared platform to stand on i will simply reflect the views brought to me by the community my view is this if i have an agenda that i want to pursue i go to fanfest and simply grab one of devs from the relevant team and bend their ear if i catch them at the bar i can feed them beer if i catch them in the smoking tent they canUFFFDt even see the exit let alone run for it useful tactics to take forward to the csmbiographyin 2004 my mate described eveonline as a sandbox UFFFDas open ended as any pen and paper roleplaying gameUFFFD a bold claim i was immediately sceptical of sorry baldie after watching him play and extensive research on my part i realised he was probably right and in 2006 started playing i remember reading the dev blog for new players and it saying how it was impossible to be a generalist in new eden at some point we are all forced to specialise never tell me what i canUFFFDt do iUFFFDll move heaven and hell to prove you wrong well itUFFFDs almost ten years later i was right they were wrong admittedly it has taken that long to have the skill set to call myself a generalist but i finally did itmy playstyle is fairly random and dictated by what i want to do at that moment i like mining and donUFFFDt really care where i do it high sec null sec even wormhole i donUFFFDt mine in low sec unless i am bait or ninja mining my career as a miner began in 2006 in high sec until i moved out to null sec where it continued however what is the point of mining all those minerals if you canUFFFDt manufacture stuff with them so studied production skills early on i realised that even if you canUFFFDt fly combat vessels you can still die to them so i trained some rudimentary combat skills and opened up mission running and exploration skill sets i was well on the way to being the pilot i am now in spite of numerous sojourns to null sec i could never find the right alliance with the possible exception of ushraUFFFDkhan unfortunately they were in cascade mode so i returned to empire finally in 2012 with my bucket list thinning i joined a wormhole alliance my skills as a generalist are ideal in this environment three years iUFFFDve been here i donUFFFDt think iUFFFDll ever leave all of new eden is on my doorstep anything i want to do i can anything my corp mates want to do we can wins all round communitylike any society there are bits of this community i love bits i hate and other bits which i neither know nor care about this is a list of some of those things for a game which purports to be all about the pew the alliance tournament is a perennial disappointment it is cumbersome implausible and as far from the daily experience of the player base as you can get whereas the tuskers always come out with something which is entertaining and at least is recognisably part of new eden the event tourney is cool smaller gangs with greater accessibility to the community is another example of a great pvp format for the same reason i really liked the recent rites of succession for the amarr theorycrafting for a match which starts an hour later provides a greater challenge for the participants as well as a making the results far less predictable can i just say UFFFD kador were robbedi love player gatherings been to a few fanfest obviously is always a blast surprisingly good natured considering how vitriolic wars in new eden can get not that iUFFFDm surprised rob a man of his anonymity and you force him to engage his brain before his mouth shame the same canUFFFDt be said of public forums iUFFFDve been to a few local meets which is handy for recognising people when you head to ff i was even at the launch party for dust in newcastle hammered doesnUFFFDt even begin to describe how drunk i got i talked shop with fellow miners talked pew with a couple of guys from pl talked about player gatherings with the guy who organised the 10th anniversary celebration of eveonlineand finally UFFFDi am scottish and all this earnestness is making my teeth ache excuse me while i rip the  youUFFFDll all want to know what experience i have to represent the community none if 10 years as a pilot in new eden doesnUFFFDt qualify me as an expert nothing will i donUFFFDt blog two posts does not a blogger make i write stuff but not as a writer but as a memory aid for storytelling most recently i wrote a bunch of UFFFDjokesUFFFD for a standup routine comedy like storytelling is stylised lying or lying for dramatic effect and i lie like a politician especially when it is unnecessary lying is an art form it requires constant practice because you never know when you will have to deliver an absolute whopper anyone who doesnUFFFDt believe ccp lies needs to look up the phrase commercially sensitive information by extension anyone who thinks the csm doesnUFFFDt lie doesnUFFFDt understand the meaning of nda i do but then i have politkicking to level 5if you like what i have to say i will need your vote i have no bloc vote to rely on nor a blog for selfpromotion if youUFFFDre unsure public channel is broditUFFFDs surgery come talk to me directfly welltldr vote brodit the csm member this community deserves
brodit is a great guy and i am relly pleased to offer my support and vote a great wormholer who is interested and knowledgeable of all areas of space and activitiesa very good csm candidate who will bring a wide knowledge and fair viewpoint and a very good listener too
welcome to the csm xi campaign page of sullen decimuswho am ii am an avid eve player involved in a very broad spectrum of game play since 2012 i have participated in virtually all forms of pvppve in all levels of security space including wormholes in a few years i have twice earned the title of director  in two different corporations with entirely different forms of game play iUFFFDm a director in polaris rising a member of the bastion null sec alliance holding sovereignty in vale of the silent we participate in a vast variety of activities from large scale battles to small roams at the corporate level the sig level the alliance level and the coalition level i have led large scale fleets and faced other null sec entities several times outmatched andor outnumberedi also remain active in a midsized 5year old wormhole corporation living in c2s through c5s which i was a part of before null sec this has a different lifestyle from null sec sov and i still hold a directorship occasionally livestreaming my wormhole adventuresalthough not directly related i am also the ceo of one of the few remaining active dust 514 corporations furthering my investment in a broad range of activities throughout new edenin real life i am an engineer with a security clearance that has worked on virtually every aircraft the us navy operates i currently work on the a10 jet for the us air force that being said if you met me in vegas you would know that i like my rum and coke parties and clubs so i thoroughly enjoy socializing why should you vote for meunlike many players i am heavily invested in multiple disciplines i feel the vast majority of candidates are campaigning for a single form of game play in new eden in my opinion this is detrimental to progression as they will have a natural bias for their goals the individual systems also need to work well together the diversity of game play is important  not just to prevent boredom but also burnout iUFFFDm prepared to advocate for a number of different game play activities and styles at the same time i also would like to change the face of the csm as i am not a member of the UFFFDold guardUFFFD which has been prevalent for years i was at the famous battles for fountain and br5rb however not in a capital ship so my experiences and memories are vastly different than some of the older members i do not have the goal of trying to return to old but rather how to better the futurein recent years there has been a very real deterioration in the csmccp relationship two factors contributing to this are a lack of trust from ccp and lofty expectations of csm members  pushing their agendas to the breaking point as an engineer i am very familiar with not only realistic expectations but also confidentiality of sensitive material one of my goals would be to mend this relationship so that the csm can again be a relevant contributor to the game we all love and play

thank you again i really appreciate the interview it was a great time and a great service to the eve community
here is csm watchs interview for the csm 11 election with candidate nikolai agnon
finally available the interview recorded by csm watch for the csm 11 election coverage kyle aparthos interviewenjoy 
hey bradwhat are your thoughts about any potential impacts positive or negative of the upcoming structure changes and how they will affect wormhole gameplay1 glad to see youre running great player and dude
i believe that the structure changes are going to provide a different kind of game play there is going to be a different kind of risk in wormholes as well as not knowing how many possible people could be online there is going to be a shake up with capitals im excited to see caps getting changed but refuse to accept the whole no refitting while in combat that is ludicrous if ccp follows through with it as it reduces our quality of life as well as survival during any fights but overall i hope these changes someone change and bring more people into wormholes to try and have some more fun itd also be nice if higher classes received dual statics so there are more chances for pvp as well as easier accessthanks proc miss you a bunch edU00A0U00BDedU00B8

hey chitsagood to see you are back in exhale i miss that group and its good to see you taking another shot at participating with the csm i do have a few questions and i see that im late to this party1 during your last term as a member of the csm i never had an issue getting in touch with you chatting with you and getting my voice heard but i will say that toward the latter part of your term you fell off the wagon a bit you got a little crazy with your representation and gameplay and even said at one point that you didnt care although it seemed rather reckless do you feel that your last term was fruitful in terms of supporting and representing the wormhole community and the eve playerbase2 you said earlier that you would strive to make citadels fun and useful and knowing how much experience youve had in wormholes and your understanding of mechanics and gameplay in the wormhole environment what are some things about citadels that you would like to see that you personally would see as fun and useful3 how would you propose making wormholes mysterious again without killing the community or gameplayall the things said in the thread aside ive known chitsa for years and although hes on the insane side of crazy sometimes he is a genuinely great person approachable friendly and has always made time for me and others when we wanted to chat about anything flying with chitsa was always an adventure and i really do wish you the best during your campaign and i hope that if you earn a seat that you use it to the fullest and capitalize on the opportunity
nah hit it with antimatter a conflagration would leave ashes but antimatter would obliterate it
finally available the interview recorded by csm watch for the csm 11 election coverage bobmon interviewenjoy 
i personally vouch for bobmon he is a truly dedicated community member who means well he is not flawless and he has made many mistakes throughout his career but none of them were born of malice his english might not be great either but he is a great communicator in his own way you dont run a major news site successfully if you suck at communicating after all
thanks man my english might not be perfect but i try my best to improve it every day
thanks for the interview
isnt that the point there a significant group of players who claim they run highsec incursions not because the enjoy them but because it has one of the highest iskhr in the game and comes with essentially zero risk thus no losses and only minimal downtime should not the game be structured so that these players can earn a rewarding income in the space they like to live and roam rather than be compelled by the risk vs reward balance to return to highsec to grind an income most efficiently in incursions blitzing l4s afk mining or whatever making the safest space one of the most rewarding also has the detrimental effect of depleting the other sectors of space of activity targets and thus content decreasing the chance of player interaction and interesting gameplay should not the game be structured so that if you like running incursions or afk mining you can but it is not so lucrative given the near zero risk  and no you should not feel more at risk mining in a skiff in highsec as you have almost no chance of being ganked that it incentivizes other players to return to highsec for the sole reason it maximizes their isk or effort per hour while killing their fun per hour
its always nice to see more wormhole candidates a quick look at your killboard shows that you are indeed a miner with little to no pvp experience in the past few years  how do you feel you will be able to adequately represent the wormhole community on pvp issues and wormhole pvp mechanics that you may not even be familiar withone of the most debated issues in high class space at the moment is the potential changes to capital escalations  how will you be able to relate to these issues
your quite correct i have minimal pvp experience that in itself is not a bar to representation as i have plenty of friends who are very knowledgeable who i can pester for in depth information on the subject more importantly if a hardened pvper comes to me with concerns they will have the knowledge and experience to clue me up generally proposed changes within the game are flagged up well in advance of implementation then discussed at length in the forums and beyond so studying those may provide the insight i needthe escalations you mention i read the dev blog and it was particularly light on details very heavy on the tone of the changes ccp want to implement having read up on the forums there seems to be lots of speculation on what this will mean to escalations but without some real numbers to crunch that will be hard all this makes my job easier i poll the most common concerns of the community and take them to the dev teams moreover if pilot a says these changes mean this and pilot b says the changes mean the exact opposite i get the delightful job of representing both views to ccp hopefully we get some clarification i suspect that we both know pilot c will come along and come up with a clever workaround love new edencheers for taking the time to post your inquiries braxus you also raised another aspect i would like just touch on if anyone does come to me with specific areas they want to discuss if they could bring linkage for the discussion it immediately gives us a common thread in which to frame our discussions obviously this extends across the spectrum of eve life not just to wormhole or pew

eve online is not a game or better eve online is not one game in fact it is a pvp game a pve game a traders game a management game a production game etc itUFFFDs is so various that one could say UFFFD eve is realas a proud member of red frog freight i will run for csm xi some of you allready have seen me at gfleet 2015 evesterdam 20142015 or fanfest 20122015 remember last fanfest that bright tall handsome guy with long waving blond hair and a marvelous sweet voice that wasnUFFFDt mei gave the presentation pro space truckers on fanfest 2015 there i told how much i like to be one of the non fighting guys without hating the fighting ones eve is for all and all should be for evefor me this means two thingsfirst about development the driving force is the pvp part the more is destroyed the more the other gamers have to do to fill up the broken parts and for that it is not suprising that a lot of dev work goes into the big explosions the shiny hulls and the dealing of damagebut imho it is now time to spent some dev time too on other parts of eve the exchange and courier contractmanagement in eve isUFFFD wellUFFFD not up to date at the least think in terms of standard contracts standard terms for contracts to you or your corp less clickspages per contract there is a lot to talk about when looking at contractingthe way we can handle our assets in eve is terrible little things like stacking at a distance hangar easy splitting of a big stack in a hangar making easier filters that one can save a total overhaul of the asset window is neededhauling asssets can be a pain containers that need to be station traded why or what to think of the removal of the 200 items per contract limit one could also think about a way to set your destination from a courier packagesecond about the pilotsa big part of the pilots are non pvp one could say UFFFDif they donUFFFDt want to fight let them play another gameUFFFD but who will make then the shiny ships and the tons of ammo you need to blow up things who will haul your stuff while you take down a titan in an economy so complex as that of eve we simply need those pilots big time and a lot of them although i am not saying one must not shoot at them i donUFFFDt think that making them sitting ducks is the way to go we need them and after all they do pay for subscriptions as well so we should not totally neglect them in dev time and when they can do their stuff easier and in less timeUFFFDmaybe you will some day find one of them at your six putting me in csm xi would not give you the man in the csm with the answers i am good but not that good  if i had all the right answers i would post them here and be done with it putting me in csm xi would give you someone there who would made sure these issues will be on the table and talked about and then help the pilots and the devs to come to the best solution for this to make sure there will be time for non pvp related issues and for non pvp player issues to make sure we try to make a better game for all not just for a happy fewbe assured that if we can get population to 50k that means a lot of targets more and more to produce and haul also we need more new players without dumbing the game down it is and should be a game where one has to work to achieve thingsand believe me at the endall will benefit especially the pvp pilots more time for all to spent in space hitting stuff less time clicking in a hangari even have ideas about t4 ships UFFFD regards and good luck to all others running for csm xips you all know that xi in holland is called the fools number who then would suit better then a crazy frog

not a big fan of backstage but i am a big fan of utari onzo very pleasant surprise to see you running youll be on my ballot for certain best of luck theres really only three areas of eve that interest me wormholeswormhole pvp roleplay and avatarsyour stance and ambitions in regard to wormholes and roleplay youve made pretty clear im interested also to hear your thoughts on avatar development im not talking about wis or anything like that more just in terms of encouraging ccp to introduce more items for our characters and spend a little effort on further development surrounding avatars in general though perhaps with an ultimate longterm vision of some form of ingame avatar social interaction or pvp gameplay parttime wormhole pirate U30C4 fulltime supermodel U25B7 worU043CU043Dole dU03B9ary  cU043Daracer U03B9o U25B7 sss
thank you and to all the 1ers so farin regards to avatars the single biggest thing on my wish list is hats seriously its one of those little things though likely not little at all for ccp to make that would add to avatars positively and would be something id be ok with being vanity itemsmy other ambition is for a wider cross selection on hair styles and tattoos right now youre race locked in terms of certain hair styles are only available to certain races once youre a capsuleer youd naturally be exposed to different cultures and styles across the cluster so why not be that bold caldari civire that decides to get dreadlocks or a gallente who gets tribal marks because they look cool this one i think should be easier to implementfinally i hope after weve been in fixing mode for eve for some time now that ccp will find the courage to dedicate some time and resources back into wis weve already seen a basic trip to the bar in action and honestly thats all it needs to start off with a few places to visit then expand from there this one is likely to be on hold till after player stargates and any new space comes out but i would love to see that old door in my quarters get opened even just a littleface the enemy as a solid wall for faith is your armor and through it the enemy will find no breach wrap your arms around the enemy for faith is your fire and with it burn away his evil
this pretty much answered the only questions i had for yougreat to see you running and your focus on lore and live events would be great to have within the csm that plus your support for seeing some more avatar content introduced means youll be on all my ballotsgood luck  parttime wormhole pirate U30C4 fulltime supermodel U25B7 worU043CU043Dole dU03B9ary  cU043Daracer U03B9o U25B7 sss
between gorski apothne and nashh i will be facing a difficult challenge who to put on the top spot thankfully i have exactly three accounts and can switch them around this man pours his heart into the eve community and it shows he is not simply a lowsec candidate but a candidate for everyone who wants to see eve thrive as an environment where people can come togetherthe only caveat i can think of with his candidacy is that i fear he will not have the time to do all the wonderful things he has done to make eve more than just a game but also an environment where relationships are established and friendships are forgedoh and a wife and kids he probably should be there for too 
thats nice and simple and has no impact on the reality that most people are not flying around in interceptors to do everything in the game bcsbss industrials barges etc are the backbone of eveonline and they move dirt slow the only scale that needs to change is the time scale less time moving around more time actually playing the gameno one cares about the au distance in either universe time however is very important in both wasting time moving around eve is a huge turn off for many people i can ask any 00 vet and get the same reply  they hate moving everyone hates moving  because it takes up too much time doing next to nothing we want to play the gamegamers across the globe are no longer interested in mmorpgs that require massive amounts of time to play wow reduced the time to level most other mmorpgs are out of business league of legends is being beaten by their competitors that created the same format of game and have reduced the time of the matches people have to play because that is what players want less time wasted more time playingall that is being asked is for ccp to do something to reduce the time wasted in game moving around at such slow speeds ccp it would help increase the playersubscriber base if you would address the current state of gamers and reduce the amount of time spent doing next to nothing moving around and instead gave us more time actually playing the gametry it youll like it

this was a really well done interview and bobmon did well
when youre looking through the list of csm candidates invariably youll find people with platforms hopefully by now voters should know that is not how the csm works  it isnt game developer junior what you want in a candidate is someone who is active in the game is driven and in touch with the players enough to understand the issues and pain points bobmon not only shows those traits now but he has a track record of showing them its not a gimmick to get elected not a flash in the pan  its just what he does in short hes got the traits of a great csm delegate
1 for bobmon
now that ccp has done a dev blog on selling skill points and we know it is coming in february what is your position on this
apothne will you play a 5 man stack of dota with me thanks
jintaan is an excellent fc with very good knowledge of the gamei like his agenda for this csmso its a 1 from me
i am personally happy with high sec right now i think the biggest misconception is that high sec is the safe zone ccp has never pushed it as a safe zone more a safer area than the rest i have two characters that primarily make high sec their home and travel in it without incident with only the occasional km i think its important to remember the role that gankers serve in the overall eve ecosystem and messing around with that will cause unintended consequences if your getting ganked follow the eve philosophy and get even blow them up
that already exists i have a few experimental haulers and miners that i use to bait ganks to test some ideas one retriever in particular is running well over 50 survival right now its all in preparation and reactionwelp you just forced all of low and null to completely change how they manage their security that you think this sort of idea would ever get off the ground tells me just how poorly youve thought this outhighsec is indeed worth saving but it wont be saved by further insulating residents from having to interact with those around them
greetings fellow pilotsmy name is toxic yaken and i want to represent highsec for csm xii have been playing eve online for the better part of two years almost entirely based in highsec i am a ganker wardeccer scammer and former awoxer and i make my living as such at the moment i am flying with the dickwad squad a small corporation in rabble alliance and losing all my ships in the process has been my specialtythe csm is meant to connect the player base to ccp and so i have been trying to do just that rather than only letting players come to me iUFFFDve been taking time to reach out to players to try and capture better opinions and ideas of issues facing highsec residents while i canUFFFDt make promises for change these are some points that i am interested in raising or continuing in discussion with ccp and other members of the csmnew player experiencefor players who take the time to try every career agent and see everything that eve has to offer the npe is extremely pve focused i know that i and many others would like to see more early game training on concepts such as basic combat tactics fittings and how to use a dscan providing career missions for new players to try pvp combat of some variation would be idealwarsthere are quite a few problems with wars in general and simply changing the cost to declare war on a corporation or alliance arenUFFFDt going to fix them the biggest issue with wars is that a lot of highsec corporations or alliances donUFFFDt want to fight there are also a lot of corporations that have no reason to fight there needs to be better incentives to combatting a war than weaponized boredom or dropping out of corporations and reforming an hour later i know that some players are very adamant that they want to play the game a certain way and have no interest in learning how to pvp and i think that those players will continue to struggle under any wardec system but providing those who simply feel they cannot fight back with more options and incentives could help improve warsnpe iUFFFDm repeating myself but obviously providing those that are interested in learning pvp fittings and so on early in their lives will at least have some idea of how to fight backmercenaries mercenaries have been around for a long time but a lot of them exist far above the possible incomes of newer players  create a board similar to corporate adverts for mercenaries so they can provide services price points where they primarily operate and so on this concept could be used for other services such as hauling as wellsurrenders provide more surrender options for negotiation such as a surrender cost in addition to a surrender offer length of peacetime before any new wars can be declared or even an exchange of assets costs i think that the cost of wardecs could use some review in the case of wardeccing smaller newer players i donUFFFDt want to see new players being farmed for kills and being scared out of the game that said i donUFFFDt want to see new players being protected from pvp because itUFFFDs a huge part of the game that they need to be aware of highsec isnUFFFDt saferedefining wars unless a corporation has structures in highsec to defend or are confident in their pvp capabilities there is usually little reason for them to turn out and fight a wardeccer steve ronuken suggested the idea of attackers setting up structures to declare war that could be destroyed and end the war but against large mercenary and wardec corporations i feel like smaller corporations would stand no real chance to destroy them under their noses similar to the idea of providing corporations with more beneficial structures worth defending it still leaves a lot of smaller corporations who canUFFFDt afford them no reason to fight iUFFFDm also interested in seeing more information about citadels and how they might change living in highsec and if if they might make wars more worth fightingdefender incentives another avenue is to provide defenders with additional bonuses considering there is no real way to win a war as a defender some ideas include an increased insurance payout for lower sp characters to encourage defenders to actually turn out and fight or rewarding the defender with the wardec fee if they come out of the war on top there could also be an incentive given to corporations that promote longevity and activity in highsec so there is at least a reason not to disband a corporation at the momentUFFFDs notice of a wardecmissionsiUFFFDve personally not spent a lot of time running missions but at a recent evemeet i was told that mission runners would love to see a greater variation of missions i guess you can get bored blowing up the same pirate or saving some scientists so many times but also provide some form of scaling difficulties for missions based on how many players would enter a mission pocket so that missions could be more challenging and fun to run in groups cont
corporations  societiesi know that over the last year a lot of fear in my community was generated over the proposed idea of social corporations a construct that would allow players to start a corporation protected from wardecs at the expense of not being able to anchor structures im completely against this concept but i donUFFFDt think enough people know jayne fillions update about the development of this idea to societies and wanted to repost thisthough i think that a better name for societies might be communities hue i am wholeheartedly in favour of the development of societies to provide better crosscorporatealliance communication and organizational tools than the current channels and out of game methods in place currently giving groups such as bombers bar antiganking incursion runners and so on better means to communicate and organize themselves outside of corporate structure can only make the game better it would also be a nice way to show your support and pride for groups such as plex for good and broadcast 4 repsganking  bumpingi have zero issues with the state of ganking in highsec as it is right now i also realize that bumping is a point of contention but bumping still exists outside of ganking and serves important purposes in bumping capitals suspect baiters and others i also donUFFFDt want to see bumping in highsec altered to much because i see freighter ganking as a fun low skill requirement pvp experience that is pretty heavily dependant on bumping iUFFFDm interested in hearing feedback on bumping thoughbounties and bounty huntingin the time that ive been playing bounties havent served much a purpose for highsec criminals they have become badges of honour rather than a cause for concern and unless you catch someone with a decent bounty flying something big and shiny your payout will generally be very small i want to see more incentives to go after the bad guys one option is to give the pilots that put up for a bounty the option to pay out the full amount if they are satisfied with the kill another could be to remove faction police and instead requiring players to handle criminals suspects and faction warfare targets with rewards for doing so this is another subject i would love to hear more feedback onand on a lighter noteUFFFDpiracyi love being a pirate but my pool of activities has grown smaller since i started i would like to see more piracy that doesnUFFFDt break the game but lets me plunder harpoon highslot module because harpoons but alsoUFFFD letUFFFDs say your small gang catches a legal target brings them down to extremely low hull but instead of popping them fires a harpoon into the opposing ship as long as the ship doesnUFFFDt manage to break a certain range reach a speed that would cause the harpoonUFFFDs rope to break or repair its hullarmorshields over a certain amount of time the targetUFFFDs pod would pop out be unable to reboard for some time and allow the gang to board and steal the ship essentially you would need to have the target webbed neuted and nearly dead already but it would actually create some real piracy instead of just blowing up everything that comes by and scavenging the wrecks evemeetiUFFFDm very fortunate to live close to toronto where there is already a decent sized and well organized evemeet and would love to see more of them pop up with ccp support because they are really fun the first one i attended about seven months ago was privileged to have ccp terminus visit us and he gave out some really cool swag in addition to some plex prizes handed out by our local isd member iUFFFDve made a bunch of friends drank a lot of good beer and found a great deal of support from everyone at the toronto evemeet i would highly recommend checking out any evemeets that may be happening near you at
toxic and i have talked quite a bit about the changes hed like to make to highsec i like almost everything he has to say on the subject and want to point out a few things about his platform while his background is more to the villain side of things hes interested in making highsec a more compelling experience for all involved when people like us have run in the past theyve been accused of only wanting to make highsec friendlier to their specific playstyle toxics ideas as i understand them are much broader than that a lot of his focus is on creating more playerdriven content in highsec which is definitely in short supply the changes weve discussed either have no impact on life outside highsec or would benefit all players together of particular note is his model for adding communities to the game that system would be of great use to coalitions and regional organizations in null and wspace
oh my feedback on the subject of bumpingim mostly a fan of it i think its an important mechanic and removing it or heavily modifying it would have sweeping effects on a lot of other parts of the game we simply cant predict what it would do that said i think the ability to permanently tackle a freighter without committing an aggressive act is a bit much i could get behind an idea for something that would allow an attentive freighter pilot nonafk to escape repeated bumps heres an idea i sort of threw together when it came up earlier todaya low slot module similar to a higgs anchor rig but with a burst effect that would allow a quick escape when activated it would act as a heavy web on the activating ship slowing it and giving it increased agility and reduced inertia this would obviously need some stiff drawbacks and a long cooldown to prevent freighters that instawarp on every jump but the design would be such that it could facilitate one quick escape when used properly this would allow a freighter pilot to properly fit and fly their ship in a way that they could escape a prolonged bumping session without directly nerfing bumps or ganking this is just spitballing an idea so dont get too much in a twist over it if you dont like it
wormhole delegates play a very important role on the csm one of the most useful members the csm has ever seen was two step  a wormhole player but having a wormhole player who also understands the growing interaction between kspace dwellers and wspace dwellers thats a double whammy super awesome combo
i support vics csm campaignhe is pragmatic mature and capable of viewing the larger picturei strongly support hs wh and austz players to get behind his csm campaign we will see a long term dedicated player elected with the ability to listen understand and influence a large body of the eveversei understand i am part of the same corp and easily seen as biase but would give him my full backing regardless of thistupac anonymous
greetings all i amdomanark and i have decided to once again throw my hat in the ring for the csm i am sorry about the late entry to the fray but i wanted to make sure i had all my ducks in a row and be able to dedicate my attention and time to the csm i have been playing eve since 2010 i started right off with 2 pilots a pvp and industrialpve pilot a decision i have been very happy with over the years as it has given me the opportunity to experience most of the aspects of this amazing game here are some of the things i have had a chance to do during my time in eve faction warfare UFFFD former member of draketrain and wolfs brigade first attempt at mining UFFFD didnUFFFDt like it moved out to nullsec as a member of sev3rance alliance in the morsus mihi led northern coalition experienced my first large fleet fights subcap support fleets cyno pilot and fleet scout also went through an alliance wide move shortly followed by an alliance wide retreat continued to hone my nullsec play in both pvp and industry with sev3rance in providence experienced the difficulties and fun of nrds joined rvb with an alt and had a great time with that wild bunch of players joined a corporation in test as i was ready to try out flying capitals enjoyed the cap fleets all the way up to and including the debacle of 6vdt corporation left test and we formed our own alliance which gave me the chance to help get a new group off the ground and running great experience and an eye opener as to what the leaders of the large alliances go through to provide a fun experience for their members joined the rifterlings as i want wanted to give lowsec piratey pvp a try and i needed to work on my solo pvp skills as at the time i didnUFFFDt have any skill not much better now joined a friend in a wormhole corp but it was short lived as i am apparently allergic to wormholes and the pills had to take made me grow hair where it shouldnUFFFDt about this time a friend and i created and began recorded an eve related podcast clueless space nerds cluelessspacenerdscom 3 years later we are still going strong having a great time making fools of ourselves i have hosted 2 eve meetups in my hometown i have also been able to attend a couple of other meetups in the region as well as enjoying the chance to go to fanfest 2014currently i am in one of the groups that splintered off the demise of black legion rifterlings and i have my own alliance clueless space nerds alliance the only sovholding podcast in the gamei would love for you all to vote for me and allow me to take my experience positive attitude funloving nature and ideas to the csm xi and represent you and your interests to ccpthings i feel strongly about and feel i have the experience to offer well thought out opinions on are the following nullsec sov corporation management industry not including mining eve community events and support eve media and its role within the game these are some of the items i think ccp still needs to work on in order to continue to improve our experience in this game we all love and i will support trying to get some attention to these items10 security standing pilots are wanted criminals and should be treated as such not being able to dock in highsec stations should be implemented the current system has the faction police looking less effective than a group of blind onelegged keystone cops 10 security standing pilots in turn shouldnUFFFDt be allowed to dock in pirate controlled stations i know this isnUFFFDt as goofy of a problem as the reverse but i am pretty sure pirates donUFFFDt want a bunch of goodietwoshoes hanging out in their station if they arenUFFFDt able to throw darts at them or pummel them until they cry i still think battleships and battle cruisers need another look at their position in the progression tree the gap between bcUFFFDs and bsUFFFDs and bsUFFFDs and dreads feels out of place and needs to be adjusted i love the ship skins and the new variations of some of the ships ccp has provided over this last year but i would like to see some serious thought at adding a new class of ship or two after the balancing pass is complete for the ships escort carriers combat transports i would like to see a renewed effort at ccp supported and ccp controlled live events the last attempts have shown a great many people see the fun in them and they can excite the player base the events just need some attention to the what who where how and when of any given event the decision as to how heavy handed ccp should be when running an event needs discussion as well we have a community of players who spend a lot of time on various media outlets dedicated to eve and the players i would love to see ccp get more involved in supporting these endeavors through ingame advertisement via billboards or mail to get the word out to specially the newer players that there is a place to go to enjoy other different aspects of the eve experiencelast but certainly not least i believe the members of the csm are there for the players and to act as a liason to ccp for the players they should be communicating and requesting ideas and feedback from the players to take back to the other csm members and ccp this shouldnUFFFDt be all about a members agenda or ideas but about what the players want and need from ccp to make the eve gaming experience the best it can bethanks for your time and i hope you will vote for me and give me the chance to give you a voicedomanarkcluelessspacenerdscomdomanark cohost clueless space nerds podcast
finally someone i can actually feel comfortable voting for 3
here is the interview recorded by csm watch for the csm 11 election coverage nameloading interviewenjoy 
this is an idea that crossed my mind after a pretty dark period in my life when i watched a lot of nuclear holocaust films like threads and the day after it occurred to me that there is no weapon system like this in eve the original titan doomsday weapons did a large amount of aoe damage with only the most heavily protected ships surviving they were rebalanced and now only affect a single target albeit with a devastating amount of damage what if there was a weapon in eve that had severe consequences for firing it with nuclear weapons there is the brief intense burst of damage which leaves a city in ruins however the far more horrific effect is fallout radioactive dust that slowly eats away at living tissue and effectively renders large areas uninhabitable its this latter part that i think could be interesting in large scale warfare in evetwo example long term effects that could be used for this theoretical weapon a gradually increasing damage over time effect similar to that found during the recon mission an effect that prevents ships from either warping in system or jumping inout of it effectively rendering travel impossibleit would be interesting to see how alliances would use such a weapon would they use it as a scorched earth option rendering a victory by an opposing faction pointless would the weapon be used on a large scale rendering large areas of nullsec unusable forcing them to concentrate into the smaller still usable regionsneedless to say a long term effect isnt the same as a permanent effect and systems would eventually become liveable once again with the length of the weapons effect its initial damage spike cost etc a matter for balancing i guess im mainly curious to see what people think about a true nuclear weapon in eve and how many people would push that button if it was therenote this is merely a thought experiment  not a request for something like this to be added
the new doomsdays will aoe neut everything around the ship firing them does that countcant jump out if your buddy has just sucked your cap dry
if you dont like how long it takes to move around in large ships dont fly themthis was answered in shahs post above this one it relates to power projection and it deliberateeve online has always been and will hopefully always be a niche game those gamers who want instant gratification can find it elsewhere those gamers who enjoy games on an epic scale can find it hereand what of the gamers who like the fact that eve is an entire galaxy with said corresponding scale why do we have to lose one of the few mmos available that actually has a sense of size to itno i wouldnt i dont like instant gratification games i like games on a grand epic scale allowing me to cross a galaxy in a few minutes in a ship the size of a city kills that scale
so xenuriayou want me amongst others to send you to iceland so that you can reform the csmwhen you were asked to define reform you decided to define the word reform and not how you would reform the processive read through your thread and you know what no i wont be voting for you there are too many smart mouthed politicians in real life without adding you to the listcome up with some actual reforms to the csm and how you would change eve for the better
i am sorry you feel that way
cant wait for fanfest and that csm reveal
i have already taken a public stance on this topic in my campaign platformi do support making skill points another commodity through the recently announced transneural packages and i would also lobby once this feature is implemented to remove the character bazaar entirely so that all pilots history and name remain tied to the player that created them in the first placethe fact of extracting knowledge is very much a part of the games cyber punk roots and scifi inspirations furthermore isnt it that the knowledge as well as the thoughts of all of us capsuleers are copied like mere data banks into new clones every time our pod is destroyed hopefully ccp is already working on an angle to introduce this in the lore of the game and we soon see some new scope video or tickers related to it if this has not already been the casei believe the feature is a great way to bring younger players up to speed faster and is a better way of doing it than buying a character in the market i also listened with interest to those that pushed the ideas of selling specific skills rather than generic skill points but in the end i believe that would be counter productive as like ships not all skills are created equal in usefulness and utilities and being stuck with useless skills would be the same as being stuck with a drake you could not sell before the latest pass on battleships was done i also appreciate that ccp has made the higher sp character still able to milk 150 000 sp out of a package instead of 50 000 as first intended i also hope ccp has a plan to add new high end skills that only the oldest pilots will be able to master skills with heavy requirements that will give the most dedicated veterans new abilities to explore new avenues in all areas i believe the tree skill must continue to grow its latest deepest branches being there for the older players to conquer first if iam part of csmxi this is something i would support actively
i dont know what a 5 man stack is but yes
so you think you should be on the csm because you are used to attending meetings and utilizing critical thinking within them to help stop one viewpoint from being drowned outoptimism i like that buzzwords and synergy speak not so muchthe national council for excellence in critical thinking defines critical thinking as the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skilfully conceptualizing applying analysing synthesizing andor evaluating information gathered from or generated by observation experience reflection reasoning or communication as a guide to belief and actionbuzzwordsnow that ive got that off my chest i have read your stuff in this thread and have to say that a vote for you would not be a wasted vote
im going to ask a question that can altough rather simple say a lot about the candidatewhat are you training right now
hah just logged in to make sure and caldari offensive systems v popped up as completed so i wont have to mention just how i lost a tengu and had to retrain that skillright now im chugging through the slog that is fleet command v and have been on a willcha remap for related skills for some time i dont specifically need to have leadership skills as most of the time i tend not to use command ships in a fleet situation for fear of both getting headshot and also due to my much higher sp alliance mates being able to lend their own perfectly skilled altsmains to the jobi started training these skills again during one of the patches that delegating boosts actually worked reliably as giving fleet warps and being able to use the regroup function are very useful tools available to an fc however right now they seem to be rather random as to whether they work sit and cycle in the changing position limbo for eternity or just flat out fail to function its probably one of the little things id more selfishly try to bring to the attentions of the devs though id want to wait until after seeing the implementation off the antioff grid booster changes which have been years in the coming just to see if the issue would even be relevantfrom an fcs perspective i look forwards to said changes as they will provide a little bit more strategic depth to combat as i will have to choose between killing their boosting ship to reduce their whole fleets effectiveness by a significant margin or taking out more traditional early targets such as recons or logistics this becomes especially interesting when it comes to talking about fleet comps with certain weaknesses exaggerated by certain links such as long range battleship fleets which tend to require skirmish boosts to their recons to extend their web ranges into the medium ranges where sig tanking fleets might be able to operate alternatively compositions with relative low dps being able to kill their opponents siege or armor links early would help give them staying power during an attrition fight where ship for ship trades are occurringanyway to get back on track about 30 days deep into training fleet command 5 because i feel it may be necessary in the future for something i very much enjoy doing in the game fcing
please define significantone could maintain that there are a significant group of players that think high sec ganking should be not possible
yellow discipline
i dont think rkelly would appreciate me taking his move
i would like to encourage people to please post any questions you may have in this thread i am seeing many people viewing but no comments being made the more difficult the question the better if i have to actually think about the response you are doing a good job as a voter i look forward to the challenge
much more indepth and awesome answer than i expectedthanks mr onzo indeed this is something thats been suggested for a very long timecommissar kate hashad a longstanding thread suggesting pretty much this it got a ton of support even from devs shed spoken to apparently yet was never implemented you might find some useful discussion there if you havent seen the thread beforei agree totallyim even of the mind id pay extra for such features even a doublesubscription 1 month pilots license  1 month station pass for example i hope one day we see a feature like this advanced a little despite the cultural resistance im confident theres a huge segment of the playerbase that would get behind it and pay to use itin anycase i love your stance on wormholes rplore and even avatars 15 from me danUFFFD
bump for a good fella
what structures do you have in mind that you think should be either made or looked at or changed in some waywhat ides for new player engagement do you haveand lastly what do you think can be or should be done with the entosis mechanic
can you expand further on this topic
more information please on your topics of interest just the headers in and of themselves does not help anyone to understand your position on those topics
i am curious what your rationale is for these proposals from a game design standpoint it seems quite silly to lock players out of each others space in a pvp game that is at its heart about player interaction how would criminals interact with their victims as well as those that hunt them if they cant operate in highsec conversely how would positivesecurity status pirate hunters chase their targets if they could not base out of pirate stationseverything ccp has said lately the empires are losing their grip suggests that the game is moving more towards a playerdriven one not one with more npcenforced rules it would seem to me that the faction police are more likely to disappear completely rather than securitystatusbased locks implemented which would hurt new players and lowsec pvpers the most is there a good reason that i am missing from a game mechanics standpoint why you think ccp is wrong and that your idea would be better for the game as a whole or are you just basing your proposal on lore
all outstanding ideas naysayers aside as theyre just here to express their impotent rage and the lack of hugs they received as children so they can  on the hopes and dreams of others keep them comingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
here is another idea making a full expansion with a lot of features and content ready doesnt seem likely but if it could start somewhere maybe this is a place to startthe idea is to be able to dock at some exploration structures stations and planet sites and have the possibility to team up and go together with maybe up to three others or more and that the gameplay would be avatar related and involve investigating the structure or a district or facility at a station or in a city either alone or with others there could be several different aspects to this gameplay in order to be successful at the exploring or mission there are challenges like decrypting hacking agility salvaging obstacles and combat requiring a thoughful planning on what skills and items you and your group need to bring it would be possible but hard to take on all the roles yourself encouraging to bring someone with youone reason why i think this is a good idea is that it adds the experiences of exploring and missioning to a dust type of game you can also decide if you want to do it alone or with someone the difference is that alone you cant succeed at all the objectives set for the mission or obtain all the loot from the exploring so the rewards would maybe be about 14 if it is a mission designed to be appropriate for four peoplemaybe it wouldnt be too costly as some of the backgrounds and characters types could be similar to legion and so a lot of the work could be used again there is no need for these areas to be very large eitherit likely isnt possible to make a lot of different missions so they need some things that make them replayable without making them feel grindy so it must make sense to do the missions again with objectives that are reasonable would come up again and to play the missions employing different tactics giving different rewards explorer missions could be tweaked so that random different challenges await you so you never know what skills would be perfect here are some missions ideas that maybe would make sense to be replayableinvestigating the less visited areas of a station the station owner wants your group to find out why there is a power failure in a part of the station you must go there in the dimly lit corridors and get the power back it seems someone has tampered with the systems in order to avoid security in the illegal trading of contraband goods you need the skills to scan for the problem area repair it and deal with those responsible or buy their goods even if you stop the trade it is likely that this is something that will happen againon planets you could have missions in cities not the whole city but small parts of it on the outskirts of a city a mission could be that you have been tasked by a faction or npc corporation to find out if a competing faction or corporation have set up a spy network and if so take it down with the grand vista of a city in the background bringing down the network you need speciality in skills like decryption hacking scanning and security even if you take the network down its not unlikely that the faction will try to set it up again so it makes sense to do the mission againto make the tactics different every time some kind of randomness should be introduced where is the area of power failure where are the spy networks placed and where do the enemies come from you cannot use the same combat tactics every time when there are enemies coming unexpectedly with changing weapons in structures for exploring the challenges could vary from hacking old terminals and getting the power back up to get loot out the cargo doors to be picked up by the npc ship you hired to take you therei think it is nice that you would need a strong versatility in your group to complete the missions fullyalso it wouldnt affect the gameplay in eve at all unless you take part in it as it would be separate and played indepently from eve except with perhaps isk aurum and plex connections it wouldnt be a sandbox yet at least as it unfortunately seems to be restrictions in computer hardware but it could be ready for it at some time as this is just the start it would instead be a small scale multiplayer taking place in the eve setting and be both a collaborative multiplayer and a competitive multiplayer it would influence eve in the way that if you have a character there the items and isk you get can be used therethe way to finance it would maybe be with a subscription like eve but with a discounted total if you subscribe both to eve and thisthe pvp part is a big difficulty in this idea but there needs to be areas for this too not sure how it should or could be implemented thoughsome place for interaction outside of the missions would almost be as important to have like a central hub and market place before missions meeting up with your corp and others in your faction change gear with others planning missions journey to places together particularly i am hoping for areas for sociality
good idea  theres not much you can do without capby long term im thinking the disruption lasting somewhere between a couple of weeks to a month something to really deter people from just popping them off like titans titans are a really good way of illustrating potential problems with nuclear weapons in eve initially titans were rare beasts and seeing one jump in to a major fight was a sign that you had really really pissed someone off the effect of titans has become less intimidating over the years as their numbers have inexorably grown thats not necessarily a bad thing or good thing its just eve changing with timeso if a nuclear weapon was introduced to eve with the possible effects outlined above how could the supply of such weapons be limited i have to admit that i dont know enough about supercapital production or the more advanced research types t3 for example to offer much in the way of input here restriction of the bps would be a good idea similar to the existing system for the revenant supercarrier the other half would be the production of a crucial element in the weapon similar to how uranium enrichment takes an enormous amount of power and time again just some idle thoughts nothing more
so basically youre thinking of noeffort ways to troll the entire game at the click of a button
while the ops thought does make me giggle im going to have to say not supportedthis is a game and some people just want to see the world burn screw the long term consequencesside thought this would make spies in corporationsalliances absolutely deadly just drop a nuke on a rival corporationalliances doorstep and watch dozenshundredsthousands of players be without a home the next day
terribad idea is terribadi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
some people most of the people i know would push the button just because with very capable large exsovpowerblocs now living a much more nomadic life without much space of their own i can already see all of new eden being turned into a nuclear wasteland just for  and giggles with a weapon like thismutual assured destruction will not hold people back from firing these there wont be a cold war situation like there has and in parts still does exist in the real world as its a game and people dont give a damn not that i dont find the idea amusing but i dont think eve would stay playable for long after its release
some really interesting responses here thank you the post regarding a spy setting off a nuke was really intriguing i suppose even if the weapon could only be deployed by having three senior members of an alliance turn the keys so to speak youd still have infiltrators trying to work their way up simply because of the potential damage that could be unleashedas for people setting off potentially game changing weapons purely for trollinggigglessadism on an unprecedented scale suffice to say its thisuniquemindset that keeps me coming back to eve time and again never change folks 3theres one other factor i overlooked while i was running through this in my head  npc factions how stable and safe would highsec remain if the four major powers in new eden suddenly saw capsuleers setting off systemdevastating weapons from what i understand capsuleers are seen as a necessary but unpopular evil by the amarr gallente etc i doubt theyd still be as welcoming if stuff like this was going on in 00 the other side of the coin is if these weapons fell into npc hands would we see a cold war and arms race kick off between the factionsas most folks here have said its extremely doubtful anything like this would ever be added to eve online its fun to speculate on though
thx again for all the support  ive applied as csm so there is no way back now my capstable interview is hopefully out in the the beginning of februaryfly dangerous
to me it looks more like he wants to be on the csm because hes passionate about eve knowledgeable about a major content driving area and knows that he can contribute to a professional discussion which being on the csm is you are an unpaid game consultant instead of throwing things out like hurfblurf i will change this area of the game and stop climate change while im at it a lot of thoose csm campaigns try the thing rl politicians do promise x and y and think they are qualified because they are popular within x group of the game which is dumb and bad and completly misses the point of the csm so id rather see somebody going to iceland that is used to analysing systems finding errors within them and fixing them because he does that for a living instead of some memelord who thinks hes the  because his peers say so
yes hi hello i have a question for the candidate i do a large volume of highsec production which includes in part mining wessels and equipment for mining wessels cross referencing my sales of mining wessels and equipment for mining wessels against killboard statistics reveals that many of my sales are to miners whose mining wessels and consequently equipment for mining wessels have recently been destroyed by ganksi would like to know how the candidate can realistically label herself as a  while simultaneously proposing changes that would clearly be detrimental to highsec industrialists particularly those producing goods in the mining wessel and equipment for mining wessels market segmentsthank you
thanks for stopping by my threadhave you also tried selling something else there are lots of things out there to sell and makebut really i think you might be overestimating the impact i would have on the csm  if elected just because i think something or would like something would not mean that ccp would run their pants off trying to implement iti am a  and i also produce and sell stuff and i would like high sec to get more interesting and attention that is all
yes as mentioned i produce many things in addition to mining wessels and equipment for mining wessels i feel like this is irrelevant to the question however as my my ability to sell all of those things is contingent on the destruction of existing things and the candidate is proposing a significant reduction in destruction across the board furthermore i do not understand how suggesting that you would be ineffectual in convincing ccp to implement your policy preferences makes you an ideal candidate to represent high security players vote for me i will have no particular effect would be an interesting campaign slogan additionally i do not see how the inability to see a policy preference through to implementation is supposed to counteract the fact that your policy preference would in fact be detrimental to many high sec players
of course i dont have the exact number but various people discussing the issue say at least half of highsec incursion runners are alts of players who primarily play outside of highsec and just come back for the income judging from the anemic acceptance of the drifter incursion perhaps over 90 of incursion runners appear to be primarily motivated by iskhr as the new content has been ignored by everyone but a few dedicated groups and everyone else is continuing to farm the sansha risk and effortfree like they have for years now assuming this is correct do you think it is healthy for the game for such a lucrative source of income to exist near riskfree in highsecfurther ccp quant gave us some economic numbers last fall which showed that less than 2 of players on a given day run incursions yet they are responsible for the 3rd largest isk faucet in the game now this may argue that the effect on the overall game may be less a concern than i suggested above but does then raise the issue of whether it is fair to reward these small group of players over 8t isk per monthwhich doesnt include the significant concord lp for running stale pve content without risk certainly it is a concern to me that such easy isk is drawing people away from places they would rather live back to highsec and if i was a smallgroup player looking purely for isk via pve content looking at my options i would have almost no choice but to go with highsec incursions do you share my concerns or do you think i am offbase here
i fired a few questions off at mr ronuken this morning and he was kind enough to send me some answerssteve ronuken  behind the platformhe gets my vote for the first reply tbh
have you ever participated in incursions how do you feel about the money generated how many players actually run them
yes i have actually participated in incursions both in highsec and in null sec personally i feel these are rather broken for the simple reason that they dont match up well with ccps philosophy of risk vs reward to begin with null sec incursions dont pay out nearly well enough considering what a pain in the ass they are to run for starters the rats will scram and kill you easily on gates which doesnt happen in highsec so even joining an incursion fleet in progress can be dangerous they also cant be run with the efficiency of highsec incursions simply due to the likelyhood of being ganked there is nothing your enemy would love more than to catch an hq fleet off guard highsec incursions pay out extraordinarily well despite the relative safety of running them i think this partially because the incursions are always scripted and we as eve players are very good at learning the game when it comes to pve activities i highly doubt when ccp envisioned them that they planned on hq sites being run in under 10 min a site also ccp originally envisioned a pvp aspect in the pve environment with the concept of contesting sites for who would get the reward while contests do happen most of the major incursion groups have noncompete agreements among themselves so that everyone can maximize income the end result is that not many can even come close to the necessary dps to contest sites and other than when there is incursion drama between the major groups it isnt as common of occurrence as originally expected on top of this the lower end incursions nonhq require substantially more isk investment per ship than the hq sites sure people bling out vindicators to the point of absurdity but the fact is you can still take a t1 battleship with barely over t2 mods fitted and make good money with a decent incursion group lower level incursions arent even worth the time for the most part unless you have high value and very specific t3 cruisers the lowest level of incursions barely and sometimes dont even make the hourly equivalent someone could do if they just ran solo level 4 missionsso to answer your question they need a lot of work
how do you feel about being a cfc pet and thereby willfully contributing to the stagnation of nullsechave you ever been part of an alliance that was strong and independent or do you think monolithic megacolations are good for the game
i was wondering when someone would ask a question like that so thank you for getting it out there i do not consider myself my corp or my alliance a cfc pet especially when we have our own doctrines fcs and character from other alliances if anything regardless of coalition standings any status of pet for an alliance was killed with phoebe will we form up for coalition doctrines yes however gone are the days when an alliance could call a fleet and within 10 min have every alliance they are blue with at their battle call strategic battles planned in advance are still a thing but jumping to a fleet while accruing 5 days of jump fatigue isnt useful to any fleet as to your question to whether or not coalitions are good or bad thing i say they are neither they are simply a product of game mechanics presented to us if coalitions are to fight each other then there needs to be reasons currently ccp hasnt given the coalitions a good reason to actually fight each other and little reason to not be a member of one in fact some could argue phoebe actually encouraged mega block coalitions since logistically many regions would be completely inaccessible without having blue status to at least one or two other alliances i dont think coalitions are good or bad theyre simply a product of the game mechanics presented this is obvious by the fact that the large majority of nullsec alliances are in some form of coalition  if you want that to change ccp is the only one with the power to do so simply asking alliances not to be in a coalition for honor is no different than telling an athlete that he is working out too much and that he should tone back so that his competition can catch up
you still are blue to them and aid and abet their bloated empire and stagnation from that perspective you are a pet and alliances like yours are enablers for the imperiums status quo to remain unchanged and unchallenged your culture is pathetic as you either willingly chose to exist as a vassal state or could not actually stand on your own  either is a disgrace in my opinion as both make new eden a more boring place im not sure if you really believe that are using it as a propaganda answer to feign responsibility for it or are just ignorant content ring was a thing  literally the poster child of how good aegissov could be every other constellation had a different alliance in it and the area hummed with activity and content gangs came from far and wide to bask in the spectacle that was content ring alliances brimmed with newbros to train in the fiery crucible of constant battle it literally was an amazing place rival only to the barleguet of yesteryear all of that changed when the cfc could not stand content ring for multiple reasons it destroyed their narrative of aegissov being rubbish cfc players and corps were questioning their own leaderships permanent trade of stagnation for security when they saw how fun sov could be if people embraced it rather than fought it and the desire to have cloud ring as another quiet buffer region for their sov holdings content ring is a reminder to new eden that the cfc does not want and has never wanted fun in this game they will not tolerate it in any form and will burn it to the ground the south and southwest hum with content small alliances and activity these mechanics you speak of only seem to exist when pontificated to you from on high from other players either by your puppet alliance leadership or the leadership controlling them basically there are plenty of entities that choose to exist even prosper outside of megacoalitions just the fact that they do exist invalidates the argument that megacoalitions are the natural conclusion to the game mechanics as they are to blame the mechanics entirely while completely failing to account for the role of politics holding together the cfc is to be at best horribly myopic and at worst a dishonest charlatan intent on ruling through deceit and misrepresentation we already know who speaks for the coalitions who will speak then for the players
hello iUFFFDm sogor and iUFFFDm announcing my intention to run for csm xii have been playing eve for the better part of a decade and in that time i have attempted to experience most of of what new eden has to offer i have tinkered with every aspect of industry from t2t3 production to planetary interaction iUFFFDve lived and operated in every category of space highsec lowsec jspace npc null sov null iUFFFDve been through it all i also participate in pvp daily typically in smallfleet engagements but occasionally in larger fights as well my varied experience in eve combined with my neutral stance and personal background would all make me an ideal csm candidatewho are youingame iUFFFDm currently a member of awayward inc a smaller corporation currently focused on smallgang combat and nullsec operations i joined with these guys about a month ago to fly with some old friends that i had met several years ago before i joined them i was a member of the independent operators consortium alliance and the mildly intoxicated alliance before that formerly affiliated with the red menace coalition and n3 coalition respectively in addition to alliance and coalition affiliations i try to stay active in the broadcast 4 reps group and our little eve lgbt community i think that groups like these that tie together people from every walk of eve are excellent and for b4r in particular that they seem rather unique to eve itselfoutofgame i am a graduate student i studying exploration geophysics with an emphasis on electromagnetic and potential field methods with application to mining and metals exploration iUFFFDve had experience working with geological and environmental chemistry companies in the past as well as on secured national nuclear sites and i feel that the organizational and deductive skills iUFFFDve acquired over my academic career would be useful in the csm setting additionally one core tenant of science though not always followed is a sense of nonbias which i also feel is importantwhy do i want to join the csmeve online is the one game that i have consistently returned to over the years a game that has managed to capture my attention enough that i canUFFFDt imagine myself not playing it the lore gameplay player interaction and complexity are all facets of eve that i donUFFFDt believe any other game has truly been able to replicate and iUFFFDve tried looking believe me for me eve is a game that i try to get all of my friends to at give a shot because i think that what this game offers is utterly unique because of my interest in the game and my desire to ensure that it continues being a quality experience for both new players and veterans alike joining the csm and providing feedback on upcoming changes to ccp developers seems like an excellent way to do thisso what have you done in eve exactlyas i mentioned before i have experience in almost every aspect of eve for the curious here is a full list of things iUFFFDve donehighsec miningindustrymissionsexplorationlowsec huntingexplorationplanetary interaction from basic materials up to p4corporation leadership in highsec and jspacet1t2 production in highsec and nullt3

managementlogisticsreactionssmallgang fcwhy would you be qualified to be on the csmthough recently my corporation joined test alliance in the past i have been heavily involved with much smaller operations even now my corporation is fairly small in scope though we have a high percentage of veteran players my familiarity with smaller entities in eve gives me a perspective that csm candidates that have pasts cemented as part of the large power blocs in eve may lack additionally my wide variety of experience in eve allows me to form an opinion on a wide variety of topics though iUFFFDm not unafraid to say whether or not i am informed enough about a particular topic to give a well developed response this means that i will be able to look at suggestions to many different aspects of the game and be able to give meaningful input on most of themmy position as a scientist outside of eve should be indicative of my ability to provide a critical analyses and to effectively solve problems the combination of my past and present experience in eve online along with the skills that iUFFFDve acquired in my career and education would make me an effective csm candidate able to sort through a variety of suggestions ideas and possible changes to determine which would be the most likely to change the game in a positive direction for the playerswhat ideas do you haveas a long time player there are a variety of areas in eve that i feel could use improvement from potentially major game changes to a variety of smaller quality of life improvements that could be applied to speed along different aspects of the game some of the potential ideas i have include the followingpi interface the interface for pi seems overly complex and i think something like a UFFFDrouteallUFFFD function would drastically decrease the amount of work it takes to set up some of the more complex setups particularly where factory planets are involved this would mean that there would be a button that would make factories connected to storage facilities and launchpads attempt to automatically intake the materials they need from storage to produce items
cloaky camping having spent my fair share of time in nullsec iUFFFDd say that there should be some sort of change to how easy it is to essentially shut down a system it discourages active gameplay from both the campers and the campee as there is no effective way to remove a camper from space nor is there a good way to continue activity in camped space my initial thoughts would be to put a nonrepeating cycle time on cloaks to the tune of 30 minutes to an hour or to create a way to track down cloaked vessels though i hear this may be possible with citadelsgroup industry right now it is difficult to organize large scale industrial projects while the new industry interface is really great compared to the original one it could use something in the way of project management i believe ccp is already considering something like this if the survey i took a while back was any indication an interface that would allow groups to fill UFFFDconstruction ordersUFFFD or something similar to this would help industrial organization similar to filling buy orders in market places for example if building a carrier was split between different people orders for different parts could be accepted by different corporation or alliance members enabling larger amounts of organizationsovereignty value as it stands owning sovereignty in space gives a variety of strategic bonuses but lends little to the value of the space this is particularly true in areas with higher true security status as even with infrastructure upgrades the space is lackluster while there is a definite need for lower quality space to offer lower quality resources it feels like activities namely highsec incursions have the capability to generate much more isk for players than most if not all areas of nullsec since null security space is the least crowded and is where the player narrative really shines i think that more emphasis should be placed on rewarding alliances that take and hold their own sovereignty which would further encourage players to migrate from high security space to the more dangerous sectorshighsec wardecs one large problem with highsec wardecs is that there is a decided lack of participation in the wars by the defending party instead of a mechanic that generates highsec pvp instead it turns into a way for corporations to farm low risk kills from other players one way to make this a more active mechanic is to change the bounty system to further incentivize hired defending corporations to participate in battles this could be an increase on bounty rewards for wanted corporations and individuals but this would have to be carefully adjusted to prevent wide scale fraud using alt characters alternately wardec costs could increase over time instead of keeping the same flat rate week by week and a UFFFDtruce periodUFFFD could be added to surrendering setting a time period where a war cannot be redeclared by the aggressor for a time agreed on by both partiesanother potential addition that may change the aspect of high security wardecs could be the addition of logistics ships on killmails this is a change that many logistics pilots have been pushing for and would change highsec wars because neutral logistics ships will be more easily identified this change would allow corporations to better prepare for a fight if neutral logistics pilots are accounted for beforehand then the playing field could be considered more UFFFDlevelUFFFDoffgrid links replacement with changes to offgrid links coming down the line it is important to both reduce their efficacy in every situation and take care not to nerf them too hard in order to do this links shouldnUFFFDt be set to be effective on grids considering the new grid sizes though the links ship would still be visible to hostile fleets and therefore easily probed down it would still largely be removed from combat smaller fleets would still have trouble dealing with opposing links and may just turn fights into chasing links around a battlefield instead i would suggest an aoe effect with a skill or module that increases the range of the effect this would require links ships to be on grid and would likely phase out the dedicated links ships for those that are fit both for combat and boosting a dedicated combat  boosting ship in a fleet would add an almost flagship like element to fleets using boostsi would note that a caveat to my suggestions is that i am neither a developer nor a programmer i donUFFFDt know what is conceivable to put into the game but i do have a sense on what areas could be improved and some ways that could improve themconclusionmy experience in eve as well as my scientific background outside of the game give me attributes that make me qualified to sit on the csm as i have exposure to such a wide array of topics within the game i have the ability to review and suggest meaningful changes in a variety of areas for example on mechanics such as cloaky camping and the planetary interaction interface additionally my past in smaller alliances and corporations gives me an extra perspective adds another point of consideration to my thoughts and decisions if anyone has any questions feel free to contact me here ingame or on reddit at usogorthefox additionally my primary nonprofessional email is sogortheogregmailcom if anyone would like to contact me there as well thanks

see this one i really really disagree with i want to agree with it as cloaky camping its terrible game play but theres literally no way to actually harass people in null sec without cloaky camping them nullsec is absurdly safe thanks to local intel channels derivative tools that use local and intel channels distance fewer wormholes to null territory far away from were antagonists can resupply or escalate and the ability for the defender to escalate infinitely until there is a way to add some risk back to it cloaky camping is really the only way to effectively antagonize sov residents ess was a nice concept but it has largely failed because people either do not use them or have rats to defend them and the best thing to do when a neutral is either in your system or a few jumps out is still simply to dock  avoidance almost every ratting ship out there is capable of leaving a site and getting safe well before being at risk 99 of the time it is not the hunter being good that gets someone caught in null its the ratter being careless game play where one side disproportionately holds every advantage possible is quite boring ie there is still no good way for a roaming gang to cause trouble to the point where defending sov space actually matters taking cloaky camping out of null would be like taking catalyst ganking out of high sec both are literally the last tools available to antagonists where every other outlet has been solved by the players or mitigated entirely by mechanics
so i grabbed kyle for a few questions which he was kind enough to answerbehind the platforms kyle aparthosedit updated url
have to admit i like bradford he was one of the maybe the only sane person i remember out of syj brad knows his sht good deal glad you are running
an idea of mine was that ccp would make a story driven game within the eve universe which leads the player to different places like amarr or jita there the scenes of action would be inside the stations on spaceships and the homeworlds of the factions it should have a story wich is sad depressive and leads at the end to the final decision of becoming a capsuleer or not leaving the past behind and start a new life as an immortal or whatever creative ccp comes up witheventually some parts of this game can then be ported or somehow made usable in eve itselfdocking and walking on abandoned stations for some exploration stuff alone or with friends as mentioned in the post above for examplehere eve would benefit of maps and game engines which then are already existing it also has the advantage that development costs can be split between different games
as someone whos played in all areas of the game and gotten to know the mindsets of those attracted to the various enterprises available here i can resoundingly not support this ideathere is no question of if the players of this game would nuke vast regions just for giggles merely a matter of how long itd take them to get the logistics of the nuking in place the planning would start the instant such an idea was released to the population and the time to execution would simply be a matter of construction and travel
why dont do thateverbody like eve graphics music possiblities etci love eve the space the ships sometimes i stay hours just looking for nothing or exploringi think a lot of players will come to eve i have 3 friends like me but they hate pvp elsewell is just a simple suggestion i think a lot of other people alredy said thatthanks ans sorry if is in wrong forum and for my language errors
ecm is always going to be a tricky mechanic to balance since it its rng based and its effectiveness scales heavily the smaller the fight gets unlike other forms of ewar like damps which can still be consistently effective in large fights and small fightsin an ideal world i would love to see caldari get a completely new ewar scheme maybe with an antidrone flavor but if that is not up for discussion in terms of ccps roadmap i would like to see eccm as a counter get a bit improved since right now even overheated eccm battleships can be consistently jammed by t1 frigs for example this could involve a numbers rebalancing or even adding some new mechanic like ships that are jammed with an eccm active can still target the jam source
friendly post to move back to front page also blog seems to be having some issues hopefully should be resolve soon from my host provider will be making new blog post when its back up
see my campaign thread from last year the people i am campaigning for are more or less the people that do not know the csm exists and wont vote anyway high sec carebears cant live with them cant live without themand once again i would like to see numbers how many is many is it a majority
well i do not think you are off base but wealth distribution in eve is a big subject high sec incursions are theoretically available to all null sec ratting not necessarily
i have flown with brodit for a long time did i recruit you  until i recently left for a life as a mercenary brodit is a solid calm knowledgable guy with a great sense of humor i have no problem endorsing brodit as csm candidate  to stand as wh representative for the lower holes stand as industry representative for the self made guys and stand as a representative for all of us for whom this game is just that  a game and not a second job or power trip to compensate for a failed career brodit will diligently listen to our questions and with scottish pigheadedness seek answers from the community and ccp brodit for csm despite that we dont deserve him
by your justification any corporation who is blue status to any other corp alliance etc clearly is nothing more than a puppet state of the other if you fail to see how ignorant this argument is then there is nothing more i can say because you are hiding behind a blanket argument by your argument clearly we should just disband nato on the basis its pathetic countries arent willing to protect themselves alone against allit is not my interest or responsibility to argue your view of the imperium however if you dont believe coalitions are just a natural cause of game mechanics i will give you a map again the imperium is not the first only or last coalition new eden will see to ignore or destroy all coalition gameplay would be no less intrusive than destroying all pvp from low sec i take all forms of gameplay into considerationi would also like to point out that my alliance the bastion has never deployed to cloud ring so your interpretation of what every alliance in the coalition is doing is clearly nonfactual you will notice i am not running for the null sec candidate nor am i running for the wormhole candidate for that matter not the industrial high sec candidate or anywhere else where i have active characters i am running for the people of new eden as sullen decimus last time i checked im not getting paid by anyone in game i will be supported by several but do not think for a second i am controlled by anyone
not at all plenty of blues are not only justified but good game play it comes down to what you gain from a blue and what it costs you is it really worth being blue to the largest by a considerable factor collation in the game are they really going to make your space safer are you getting more content out of it than it is costing you look whats happening to sma right now it will be your turn soon enough legitimate blue relationships are based on mutual respect no one respects pet alliances of the cfc its plainly obvious for what purpose they exist and it isnt because the cfc values you highlyeasy to be deceived by pictures take a look at actual numbers of people involved in these coalitions and get back to me comparing the scrappy and funloving coaltions of the south to the bloated and disgusting ones in the north iswell just that night and day like most things in and of themselves coalitions are not intrinsically bad but taken the the extremes of size like the cfc they really just cause stagnation so if an entity whom i was blue with did something sufficiently dishonorable despicable or unsportsmanlike i would reevaluate that relationship that you havent is basically tacitly approving their ways either that or you are just too sheepish or you value your ratting and srp more highly than content the csm needs leaders players and thinkers as part of a pet alliance i question your ability to lead  you know how to follow for sure as a member of a pet alliance i question your ability to play  you know how to work for someone else finally as a member of a pet alliance i question your ability to think for yourself
i question every argument you make considering you were a member of the exact corp and coalition you have been berating not once but twice
i endorse this product or servicealso hes about 50 less douchy than you think as a fact i know that he mines in hs runs missions not often operates in wh space and is part of the cfc imperium nullsec bloc pretty much if it requires autism hes inedit  you need to learn not to copy the whole  thread above you man
edited for your entertainment
i have played with judge for quite awhile now i have come to know him as a very reliable and trustworthy person he is always willing to listen to you and discuss things even after a big discussion he will smile on you and shake hands he works hard to get where he wants to be i think he would make a great csm memberthe judge for csm
you are a joke
do you care to elaborate on that statement or are you truly so mindless a goon
utari does well to note his real life jobprofessional is what he has been and professional is the best descriptor i have for how i would expect him to handle the responsibilities of being a csm member responsibilities being both to the csm and to those who elected him
i approve of and my support is given to this candidate
okay lets start off with some basics herehow do you feel about being a cfc pet and thereby willfully contributing to the stagnation of nullsechave you ever been part of an alliance that was strong and independent or do you think monolithic megacolations are good for the gamethis is a huge negative every click you give to mittens isnt for the game its for his wallet not to mention the dubious quality of the highly opinionated propaganda and drivel that is hosted there tmc is literally one of the most unfair and unbalanced media outlets i can think of  period coverage is hilariously tilted and focused only on goons what goons do and how to be a good goon or how a game change affects goons towing the party like of their erelevance so much happens in new eden on a daily basis so many stories and somehow all the coverage is goonrelatedyeah thats propaganda there simply cannot be eve news if its not about goons willingly aiding and abetting a media empire as crooked as tmc is not only morally questionable but it may also be rather illegal to do as csm candidate  surely someone who wants to be a candidate has read the rules or do you think your mittanigraced goonsent self is above thattmc is absolutely another gaming media outlet what do you have to say about the fact that you may be ineligible for csm some would say that you are merely a yes man of the imperium and when you say reacted to the changes to eve you simply mean fighting those changes all the way to preserve the status quo basically i think you are hilariously duplicitous and two faced on one handso you tacitly admit that super blobs are a bad thing that prevents good sov game play but then on reddit freely admit that
aegissov already did all of these things but the cfc would not tolerate it this year nor will they tolerate it next year regardless of what changes let me now tell a story of cloud ringa new age dawned with aegissov with no region better poised to benefit from it than cloud ring fweddit and ph as well as other alliances eyed it as the new region to live in as it was geographically and culturally poised to be full of content and pvp activity bordering fountain syndicate and black rise gangs could come in from far and wide and bask in the spectacle of battle were alliance logistics were simple and easy thanks to proximity to high sec and jita each constellation was owned by a different alliance existing as living proof aegis sov could work for small alliances and foster the sort of game play it was designed to do content ring was born its residents enjoyed months of sov being just that engaging and fun for everyone involved the cfc could not tolerate this not culturally not politically and it clashes with their narrative of aegissov content ring was promptly burned to the ground what used to be a thriving vibrant microcosm of aegissov at its best was reduced to cinder and ash while you and other cfc people may point to mechanics or stall with other rationales at the end of the day it doesnt matter what mechanics there are you dont want fun mechanics and you dont want other people having fun with sov acting like you do just reveals how duplicitous you are about the whole thing you and your leadership have already made their decisions and assigned blame but people can see how cheap a facade this really is no mechanics change is ever going to be capable of fixing sov for the cfc as the main problem is not the mechanics it is the cfc
whoi am a casual eve player with a loud voice and i have basically touched every aspect of the eve experiencewhy would anyone ever anywhere for any reason vote for a casualbecause casuals exist and furthermore many choose to be casuals for one important reason that needs to changeminmaxing skillpoints inevitably leads to players afking in highsec rather than having fun with their friendsthis is my entire purpose for seeking a csm position is to be the voice for the skillpoint minmaxing crowdso you have a cause but do you have a solutionmy solution is for ccp to offer attribute boosters in the same 1 2 3 4 and 5 classes that do not stack with implants these would have a 24 hour duration can be reapplied early and persist through deathsiting afk in highsec in 5s is great for going on vacation but these attribute boosters would remove any perceived benefit to staying in highsecconcede to succeedfinally i am willing to concede and endorse another candidate with a greater chance of winning if they hold the same values if i dont need to win the popularity contest to see the needed changes make it to tranquility so much the better
i am officially announcing my candidacy for csm xii have played eve for roughly a year so while i may not be the most experienced candidate running i feel that i may bring more of a newbro perspective to the csm i am an industrialist and have worked both high sec and null secfollowing are a few of the things i would like to see happen1 i would like to see some new battlecruisers and battleships enter the tech trees to offset the increase in frigate and destroyer class ships perhaps bcs and bss that are specialized in tracking smaller ships2 either a new bs sized mining vessel perhaps a tech 3 version so as not to replace exumers3 the possibility of giving the rorqual a new role of being able to mine itself perhaps having the option to either have the industrial core or an extraction core giving the rorqual the ability to mine with 67 strip miners as it is now the rorqual just sits in a pos providing boosts with its compression ability not being used generally it would also get the rorqual out from sitting in a pos4 i would like to see some changes to the wardec system as it stands now anyone can declare war on anyone and have no limit to how many wardecs are active perhaps limit the number of active wardecs a corp or alliance can have at any one time or increase the cost to wardec someone while also adjust the cost based on the size of the corp or alliance being wardecd so for example a small corp say 110 members will cost more then a corp with 50 members then at a certain point it would cost more again for larger corps then each concurrent wardec will cost more for example if you have 5 wardecs active if you declare war again it will cost 5x more iskthank you for taking the time to read this vote terandria starsong for csmsend an eve mail i would love to hear your opinions ideas and feedbacko7 fly safe
a couple questionsif you increase mining yields with a new ship or new bonuses what will prevent the increased amount of ore from tanking the markets wouldnt this then hurt new and casual miners who do not have access to these increased yieldsit would seem to me if you released a mining ship that was so much better than the current crop you would obsolete the current ships making it mandatory for any serious miner to fly the new ship would there be any tradeoffs for your superminer so that players would still want to fly the current barges and exhumersif corporations are limited to the number of wars they can declare either by scaling cost or a hard limit how would mercenary corps function how could you profitably declare war on targets for your clients if you can only have a couple wars ongoing at a timeand while i get the rationale for scaling the costs of a war inversely to the size of the corp doesnt that provide a disincentive for corps to get larger it would seem to me to encourage players to stay in small and oneman corps for the protection offered by increased war costs and thus out of the larger corps that are more likely to have a rich social experience that ccp has said keep people subscribed to the game and if you did scale it like that shouldnt a small corp be able to declare war on another small corp without increased costsbest of luck on your csm run
black pedro i appreciate the questions to answer the first a new mining ship or role for the rorqual would definitely have tradeoffs i am thinking something along the lines of a siege or bastion type module in that you can mine more at once but you are stuck in place until the completion of the cycle thus for the greatly increased yield you put your ship in a more dangerous position but again with having it on a larger ship your tank is better which in turn helps with survivability so bargesexhumers would definitely keep their place and not be rendered obsolete as they are still mobile while mining another idea would be to had a tech 3 mining ship where you have module choices similar to the strategic cruisers a ship such as this would simply be another tier in progressionto answer your second question i feel that having a limit or cost increases would make corps and alliances choose targets and have to put thought into it instead of blanket wardecs such a system i feel would be more beneficial to all involved additionally im not thinking being able to only have 23 wars going at once im thinking more then that but i also think that having 100 wars active at once which i have seen before is a bit excessive again though i appreciate your questions thank you
i have updated my post expanding on my personal views 
lex is my vote for csm and not because he is my alliance ceo he logs in and leads us he comes up with new doctrines for us to fly and generally knows what he is talking about lex is the one who drives our entire alliance and the blues we ally with and not some name behind it all so that gets my vote
gevlon stated that if elected he had no intention to contribute anything to the csm he can do that just fine without running for csm
hellonot sure were to post this but can you sell supers with your toon per rules say sell them on open market you cant exactly dock these things and i dont have to trust anyone in the game so
no you are not able to sell any assets with your character during a character sale the exception being plugged in implants which can be stated people tend to sell supers using reliable and trusted third parties like chribba or grendell which have a fee to use
you apparently dont understand the concept of a sandbox as it relates to video gamingyou can do pretty much anything you want in a sandbox including kicking over the castles being made by others playing in the sandboxyour suggestion is contrary to the very core of eve online
this comes up often and im going to lock this down before you get flamed the poster above me is correct in saying that this is a true sandbox game where you can build and destroy sandcastlesi encourage you to give pvp a try at the very least i came to eve with a poor view of pvp as well that came from my experiences with pvp from other games as it turns out i found pvp in eve to be quite thrilling i especially enjoy that no two pvp fights end up the same way and people are constantly iterating and finding new ways to try to gain an edge that being said you can also spend your time away from pvp but you cant avoid it completely unless you never leave a station
so i grabbed joffy who kindly answered a few questions for me interview here
100 of competent industrial players
again that is the point if a lucrative and safe income source like incursions is available to all in highsec why would any individual or small group leave i mean i am well aware how much isk nullsec grinders put into the economy largely via afk ratting which i also think is a major problem but for the individual weighing her options the fully optimized incursions we have today pay a higher iskhr than nullsec anomalies and come with no risk and little downtime i am harping on this because while some parts of your campaign were a little naive i placed you quite highly on the ballot last year highsec players of which i am largely one need representation and you presented yourself as a thoughtful and intelligent candidate you even demonstrated an understanding of the importance risk vs reward for the overall health of the game by providing incentive for players to assume the risks outside of highsec in exchange for increased rewardit is important for me to vote for someone whose interested in the overall balance of the game rather than csm members who just advocate for changes that directly benefit them and their constituency like mike azariah who unabashedly pushed for the incursion income faucet to be cranked open even more csm 9 summer minutes and ccp listened further exacerbating the distorting effects of this income on the economy that ccp quant pointed out in the devblog i linked above therefore i am asking you directly what type of csm member are you going to be do you think highsec incursions are working well in their current form do you support the removal of the minmaxed sansha incursions and their replacement with the more dynamic and difficult drifter incursions or will you be more of a mike azariah successor and not support that because it will ruin someones fun do you think the status quo of a few percent of the players getting so much of the resources generated into the economy each month should be allowed to continue
what type of csm member would i be good questioni am in favor of dynamism as it were not just in concord response times but actually overall in general i think the game could do with more random but i also accept that many of the wouldnt it be cool if ideas that i have will stand exactly zero or less chance of getting implemented or even thought about getting implemented by ccp as a member of the csm my main focus would not be on getting my ideas implemented i expecti do not intend to actively advocate automatic money printing whatever the means because such things damage us allno i do not think that
well i read the entire thread including vic jefferson trying to derail the thread and his thinly veiled attempts to call your candicacy into question i was somewhat impressed by your replies to his snipingim not voting but if any of you out there are you could do a lot worse than cast your vote for this guy
thank you for your support
finally available the interview recorded by csm watch for the csm 11 election coverage sullen decimus interviewenjoy 
thank again for all you guys do was an excellent interview with awesome editing despite my mic cutting out in the beginning
i read your whole threadive read other threads that made my teeth itch yours however didnt make them itch all the timethe only problem i have with you as a candidate is your propensity for going into other candidates threads and bashing thier positions its low and too close to how real politicians operate if i was voting i would vote for someone more interested in eve than being the person with the best sound bite or wittiest retort let your own position stand as evidence of your ability to get the job done at csm
in an ideal world yeah the candidate with the best positions and who is most interested in eve would win sadly the current state of the csm is actually very close to real politicians another way namely that popularity backing and visibility have more to do with it than the raw strength of the platforms at least here ideas are given the time to collide in what sometimes progresses and elevates the discourse between two candidateswhile you may brush it off as bashing i tend to view it as opportunities patience and communicating with everyone not just those of your chosen play style is important it takes a truly skilled person to convince someone to respect an opinion they do not agree with and see no value in
fyi everyone here has been responded to via emailour first analysis show has been posted csm 11 analysis show 1enjoy
just listened to my interview in entirety you guys do an awesome job and its great to have individuals willing to donate their time like this
i have worked in eve with utari as both his commanding officer in pie and as another retainer for senior captain laerise in the amarr championshipscharles surge hit the nail on the head when he emphasized professional both as a a junior fc for our alliance and as a team mate during the champiionships utari often had very different ideas than i did he always made his opinion clear and always made sure his reasoning was sound definitely passionate i wanted to say zealous but people other than me usually see that as a negative about his goals but always capable of seeing other ways to achieve that goal i do call bulls on not serving content on a aplate for people though as while he might not be under duress to create the content i never saw him log in and take a back seat waiting for content he always jumped in and got the ball rolling without being asked utari i suppose your point was that you wont have to split commitments so id have to agree thereadmiral of pie inc praetoria imperialis excubitoris see pie public for recruitment
finally available the interview recorded by csm watch for the csm 11 election coverage aiwha interviewenjoy 
just to clarify something ustainguy on reddit managed to put into word what i tried to blather about
basically all you said is grr goons you shouldnt be allowed to have friends and allies you have to willfully handicap yourself so we have a fair chance
as a fellow csm xi candidate i would just like to say i have read your forum and i appreciate your professionalism you also brought to the front the key problems in several aspects i think you would be an excellent pic for csm xi and wish you best of luck on your continued campaign
not at all basically what i said is that it is completely daffy to wish for or seek a mechanical solution to a social problem when aegissov was working quite well in fact the cfc hated it and continued stewing and bemoaning about how bad it was and the lack of content opportunities it gave while other smaller alliances rejoiced and celebrated new eden style by indulging in unadulterated pew i realize that several of my critics have placed me entirely into a pvp labeled box but war means business functionally working aegissov means more abundant and more accessible industry for allnone of the pet candidates have come up with a response to why burning cloud ring was a good idea none of the pet candidates have even attempted to address what is legitimate criticism of their reception of aegissov vs the reception it had among other entitiesi would rather willfully handicap my chances to have a legitimate chance at fun than embrace the permanent stasis that the coalitions have sold to its members we have seen where this goes for years we know who speaks for the coalitions who then speaks for the players
who am i in gamei am a proud gallentean pilot a late bloomer who started in 2010 after running some training missions and a few epic arc missions i joined the corporation terra firma explorations ltd and begun mining in highsec with a t1 hauler these guys taught me a lot about eve and really got me set up in understanding our gameafter a few great months i needed to find a group that was more suited to my style i wanted to shoot thingsafter seeing the skull and crossbones of i n e x t r e m i s i looked no further a fresh corp just formed by a fellow aussie and looking to wreak havoc across new eden after only 5 months in game i found myself in a rapidly growing pvp corporation with one of our first engagements earning me the title  our corporation is a member of the tactical narcotics team alliance which is a member of the imperium coalition we have lived in multiple null sec regions and have engaged in pvp and all parts of new eden nullsec lowsec highsec wormhole space there is no place we wont fight our corporation has earned the title of top killers in every alliance we have been a member of i may not be the strongest of pvpers but that doesnt mean ill back away from a fight win or loose its the thrill of the fightloyalty is an important aspect of the game 5 years on i am one of the longest standing members of itai and have the unofficial title of coceo our corporation has over 200 members of which i know every member and treat them as family we are a worldwide corp that operates 2357 and i have the privilege of flying with some amazing men and women from so many different cultural backgrounds that all share a laugh and that support and care for one anotherwho am i in real lifei am a 30something west australian graphic designer and musician the last person youd expect to be playing an online spaceship computer game if you met me at the pub we dont have pet kangaroos but i can handle a mouse pretty well i grew up around computers and computer games from beyond dark castle on a mac lc iii to dayz arma2 mod on my current system i have always enjoyed gaming a friend of mine also a gamermusician who knew of my interest in scifi and technology lead me towards eve onlinethough it was the social aspect of eve that kept me playing multiplayer games are one thing eve is another i have attended eve down under twice as well as other player gatherings in australia and have always enjoyed talkingabout the game with others sharing stories sharing ideas and sharing speculations on upcoming features i might not be the loudest one in the room but thats usually because im thinking planning or daydreamingcsm and the csm is something ive heard about but never put any serious consideration into like a lottery where your chances of winning get slimmer with every entrant but its common knowledge you cant win it if your not in it so just like yoloing a freighter through a gate i am announcing my candidacy for csm xi with my graphic design and music comes the skills of communication planning understanding and knowing what the best outcome for the overall project which i feel are skills that make me an ideal candidate eve online has had a huge impact on me and i want to support the game and continue to see it grow and evolveas a member of the csm i want to share the voice of the players i want to find out what drives the players in the game and what aspects they want to see expand i feel there is a great deal that can be done to make this game even greater for me its the visual layout and user experience which i believe there are many ways they can make game more inviting to newer players while maintaining the intellect and integrity of the game i feel like i can take the ideas and feedback of players both new and old present them in a professional manner to ccpthings i want to advocate forcorporation leadershipmanagementuiuxnewplayer experiencenullsec pvpfeel free to shoot me an ingame mail or just shoot me ingame i will shoot back

there is a lot i like in here i must agreebutthere is always a but high sec shouldnt be safer bumping is fine as it is i can agree with that the trouble i see is that high sec ganking is indeed a very low skill pvp but when i see the people doing it they surely aint all low pvp skilled peoplemy guess is that the high sec ganking is a sign of boredom of the player base how can one really say its exiting to sit to kill a ship that will not defend and mostly is even at ap so not against the principle of ganking but think we need more player driven content in all secs to make live more interesting then shooting for 30 secs at a ship that flows in space low sec should be more dangerous and zero even morei am afraid that there are more care bears today there then in high secpand then we can still kill a freighter or two in high sec to sharpen skills or have something to do when we are so drun i mean distracted that we better not fight a titan in lowzero regardsspace
i personally make a lot of my isk through ganking though i know there are also a lot of players that do it for fun over profits i dont think it has as much to do with boredom as it has to do with less options to engage with other pilots in highsec so some may choose ganking im always in favour of more content i think that lowsec being more dangerous than highsec and nullsec being more dangerous than lowsec makes sense but if a pve pilot is considering leaving highsec they may as well move to nullsec or wormholes because the risk of being killed is pretty much the same as lowsec but the payout is higher
more playercreated content in high sec wasnt it important to get people out of high sec into areas of space where they can live out their visions and create their empires so what is it now
the vid is nice  you gotta love the frogs
high sec content again was it not the ideal to make people move out of high sec so shouldnt high sec become more boring less interesting and instead more interesting new mechanics and fun should be added to low secnpc null sec and null sec
thanks for the responses and i would agree that much of it seems quite reasonablegood luck with your campaign
two very important questions before i seriously can consider voting for you do you have a titan will you do a progod with itand one silly the past csms have shown that people with an agenda are unlikely to push through that agenda though your agenda sounds nice and ccp seems to be on some of the same pages youre unlikely to get the chance to actually push your list through any congresslike csm committee in the likely instance where ccp is focusing on stuff that isnt on your list and ignores any attempt of yours to bring up your list who could you see going to for more indepth advice about specific playstyles problems or areasin short where would you go look for your experts and constituents
no i had a super for awhile but that was terrible and i hated it so i sold it while the csm does have ccps ear to a certain degree it is much more about ccp bouncing ideas off them than the csm bouncing ideas off ccp now while i have a pretty good grasp on how to nullsec plus i know a few guys who do even better things like fw and whs i would want to reach out as much as i am allowed to in order to better respond to ccps presentations like dng for fw or some of the quasernocks guys for the latest in wh life i feel like it really depends on what ccp is having the csm examine at that point in time im trying to be an all around candidate that people feel comfortable just firing questions or opinions at so for a short answer i know where the experts are but constitutions are gonna have to come to me with their input
actually what i have learned in the past two years after leaving was what made me a better player being in pl and learning from doomchinchilla overload everything made me grow more as a player and a leader i take syj as my main wormhole experience because it was back when syj was running smoothly honestly pell wasis a good person just mistaken for a crazy guy it honestly was a fun time playing with them i dont like giving up on something even when it dies but realize now that once something dies its best to let it rest then keep trying to resurrect it join  bradfords 3rd party channel for all third party services and check out my thread
hi everyone my name is mouse you can call me mouse i got lovingly told to run for csm xi because i look so innocent i tried to explain that im a cold harded killer with a taste for blood and whisky but it fell on deaf ears my original plan was the trump approach to this thing but eventually decided running a platform based on building a wall around highsec wasnt the best idea though it could make for some interesting changes to the lownull sec market but thats for another time so without further fillerbusting ill present my platform along with a small snippet about each stay with me here as you take a ride on mr mouses rollercoaster of emotionim open to answering any questions you have on here or in evemail you can ask me pretty much anything and ill get around to answering it i know a lot of shaggy dog stories and corny jokes mayberoast me3 mouseps the average north american antelope can jump higher than the average house this is due in part to the antelopes powerful hind legs and the fact that the average house cant jump
whats wrong about csm what would you do to reform csm also what is your expertise field in eve would you still be useful to the csm once youve reformed csm and in which manner details are welcome
didnUFFFDt read lol vote for erika mizunebut in all seriousness great seeing you candidate again as last time very good points that i hope you will be able to implement into the gameyou have my vote
i recorded my csmwatch interview yesterday ill update the op with it when it comes out
now available the interview recorded by csm watch for our csm 11 election coverage apothnes interviewenjoy 
thing is those few percent have made the investment to secure those resources the rest of us have the ability to take the resources for ourselves
of this i am glad i have one final question for you the latest minor controversy du jour is over the impact of the new skill extractors and the ability to trade skill points that will be implemented next month what are your thoughts on this change to the game do you think the ability to trade skill points is a good idea from the perspective of a highsec resident are there any unforseen sideeffects or negative consequences that you are concerned about and if so do you have any ideas on how to mitigate those effects
sorry i agree with you that it is important to get more people out of highsec but making highsec more boring to do so isnt the answer i think that new players that enter the game should be presented with a swath of exciting mechanics and career paths that start in highsec its supposed to entice them into playing long enough to train skills and learn about the risks and opportunities that lay outside highsec sure there are newbro corps for nullsec blocs that are pulling in week old players regularly to go out and join them but a lot of players just arent aware of it or arent interested
you do not need to remove anything from high sec to make it more boring and less interesting than low secnull sec as long as you add new things only to these areas as long as ccp adds every single new mechanic of the game also to high sec there will never be a drag pulling on players in high sec to venture out of the safer space to find new things to do experience unknown mechanics and be able to use something that add activitiesopportunities to your portfolio instead of mere small iterations on already known activitiesin my opinion space lacks distinguishing characteristics something that you can look forward to when you want to move on to other areas of space for instance when i want to have boring isk grind there is virtually no difference between l4 running in high sec and anomaly running in most null sec areas just a thought but what is your opinion on freezing content additions to high sec and concentrate on other areas of space instead
sorry i noticed that you also posted in vic jeffersons thread statingthats where i got the impression you felt highsec needed to be more boring its not that i dont want to see more additions outside of highsec im just making my platform and suggestions based off of my experience and knowledge im totally in favour of space having distinguishing characteristics and offering different benefits and gameplay there should be a better balance of risk vs reward and thus operating outside of highsec should have greater rewards and different fun activities you can make tons of isk from incursions consistently with little risk too which is obviously something that needs some reworking im not on board with freezing content additions for highsec because in my opinion highsec still needs to improve upon its current pvp mechanics amongst other things that aside nullsec seems to be the main focus for ccp for the next little while anyways
i am at least 90 a low and null sec candidate wherever people will play the opposite side of play the antagonist side should be viable  such is what makes eve eve more and better ways to generate content in hi sec is for everyones benefit to be fair finding new content for sovnull is a challenge they are rather inventive and in my appraisal dont want it they solved the siphons with the api malarkey and theoretically the time in to fix this wont be put in because pos are being phased out soon anyway they solved the ess with placing them in fully spawned anoms and theoretically they dont want to put the time into fix this because they are working on revamping rats in their entirety aegissov worked in the areas that it was geographically favored to like cloud ring big ticket null solved that too you can give tools to make sovnull play ball but if they arent interested in content no tool will make them participatethat being said i have the opposite appraisal of npc null residents i dont know how much i can possibly beat the dead horse that is syndicate but lets see so in sept 2015 syndicate produced 18t isk worth of stuff and destroyed 50t this screams a few things its one of the few regions that destroys a significantly larger amount than it creates and for having basically zero good ways to earn income locally there is a surprising amount of conflict there imagine if npc null had stable income streams so living there was actually viable for people people want to live where they control their own content can find risk and reward around the corner and where the hassles of empire space dont inhibit game play more better and more accessible income streams in npc null would empower right sized groups to live there and live the small gang dream i daresay the majority of people that have left syndicate based entities have done so for financial reasons and no matter which group you talk to sourcing income is the hardest part of living there there is a player demand for that playstyle but it is supported less than hi sec give low and npc null residents content seeds and income and content flourishes give every single tool to empire creators who dont want content and we see the result

just yesterday i had the pleasure of interviewing mr hyde for the csm watch coverage the interview isnt up yet but i can honestly say it was one of the better ones ive participated in and i think hes on my ballot now
so xenuria agreed to answer some questions for me for which i would like to thank himbehind the platforms  xenuria
i dont know if you are taking medication or i am starting to be in need of them but if you keep putting out posts like this one then i think you may well win some genuine votes to your sideseeing as how i rather vividly remember one of your strange youtube videos here is a multipart curve ball question with a central theme do try and hit it out of the park please how do you think eve players in general would react to unisex  cross dressing for their characters how do you think they would react to pink ships do you think that walking in stations and other barbie doll development would attract more females to the game do you think that ccp will ever pick up wis and run with it again such as integrating dust social areas into stations or even implement a few things smaller like inviting a friend or two to your captains quarters do you think that ccp would ever make an overt stand for lgbt assuming budget and staff are available and implement the cosmetics in the above questions
in my opinion the best way to make it more enticing to leave highsec is to make people feel more connected to nullsec i can wander around highsec all day every day and never know that nullsec exists unless local chat goes to it if you start up a new account make a character and jump into the game without reading lore and all the rest first youre dropped into highsec with little understanding of the existence of nullsec and the nonempire politics going on out thereso how to draw players attention to leaving empire build it into the lore it should be in agent dialogs and corporation descriptions and on billboards and so on find ways to present the notion of leaving the relative safety to find your fortune make it feel like a gold rush into the wild west
youre a member of the only ustz group that went allin with aegis sov id like to hear your perspective on the sov revamp in that context particularly how it has or hasnt affected your daytoday and whether there are any changes youd advocate for
i wouldnt say it would take cloaky camping out of the equation  just that whomever is doing it has to be at the keyboard once per hour this doesnt remove the idea of cloaky camping it just forces a player who wants to do it to actually be active a few second window once per hour shouldnt be enough to catch a cloaky scout who is actually watching his screen i dont think miners should be able to mine constantly without any interaction why should someone be able to do the same with cloaky camping i do agree that nullsec is probably a bit too safe but i dont think that enabling a mechanic where one person can effectively shut down a system by not actually doing anything isnt the correct answer even now if there is a cloaky camper in a system ill either go to a different area or do something with ships i dont care about i dont think this is an engaging mechanic on either side of the boardi do agree that there needs to be more options available to catalyze interactions between different groups and that current mechanics designed to create content dont appear to be successful as you mentioned with esses few people seem to use them that ive seen and those that do hide them in anomalies full of rats one thing though not directly related to sov that may help stir up content are sites similar to the frostline and blood raider sites that were part of holiday events i saw a lot of fighting in those areas but clashing groups would likely only meet at the edges of held sov space alternatively maybe have some sort of resource or objective that spawns at regular intervals in random held systems or maybe an anchorable structure that disrupts moon mining or ratting bounties something along those lines that will force players to respond or experience a loss in income in an area though if we went this route id also say we need to nerf some highsec sources of income otherwise people will just go to highsec instead namely incursions in this casesorry for the delayed response ive been busy the past few days running pathfinder sessions and pulling assets out of pfr space in scalding pass haha
you know you have my vote aiwha 3ps i miss youcall me maybe

im liking this candidate he doesnt overpromise doesnt have irrational ideas built from a selfserving agenda and has an excellent understanding of the mechanics of the game and so can give ccp solid feedbackalso points for building some great brawling fits that inspire me to build my own
another option might be a reduction in firing speed being able to drop your opponents dps output would be of use across the board it could possibly be applied to upgrade modules as well meaning that drone modules such as damage amplifiers would have their effectiveness reduced as well it works for all levels of engagement i think and is much more balanced in relation to the other ewar types
good guy knows his stuffhas my support
bobmon has the game knowledge and good community interaction for the job he would make a very good member of the csm
thank magyxk for the support 3
erika kindly agreed to answer questions for me 3behind the platform  erika mizune
i doubt that more ways to create content in high sec is good for everyone theres already more than enough ways  so many in fact that people who live in ls00 rather play in high sec than in their home areason the note of isk making in syndicate what about new missions combat plexes even ded 210s exploration sites and anoms being made available only in lsnpc00 as also discussed with ty in his thread new burner missions for example would be a prime candidate for lsnpc00 only as empire control is weaker there and these agents could go rampant more easily that kind of policy would not detract from the value of high sec as it remains the same but gives ls00 an edge in terms of activity variety
not just end the war but win the war for corps without territory the win condition against them could be destroying a certain amount worth of isk for those with territory it could be destroying a couple pos or taking certain territorys goals like this would give both defenders and the aggressor goals they could accomplish to win the war right now there is no way for a defender to win they just have to take it until its over honestly i think something like this would make wars more interesting it would also give you something to accomplish instead of just camping targets into station just a couple of ideas
giving an incentive for defense to actually fight back is key to making the mechanic worthwhile eve is a game of internet spaceships and i think ccp guard said it best killing is just a means of communication ccp guard so lets get the conversation started and talking more often i want it to be know im not interested in removing the mechanic i want it to be more engaging for both sides source for ccp guard quote
ccp guard is spot on so why are you proposing a mechanism that will prevent even the possibility of any more killing taking place how is stopping a war in the middle because one side wins a single battle going to promote more conflictalso wars are the only way to blow up citadels in highsec and as it stands will require two consecutive wardecs and 8 days of reinforcements to explode how would this even be possible if someone can stop the war and prevent you from having the right to try to shoot the structure when it comes into its final vulnerability window
if you have the win conditions set as the citadel that changes things in your equation the benefit of my idea is that its flexible cost likely would be too ill admit that its not a full idea but that is why its important to host town halls and communicate what would be best first is cost i made a joke a few days ago the concord has a lower cost to be paid off that a low quality hooker 50 million isk is a pittance compared to corporate income i pay more than that for corp offices for a month this needs to cost more i know im not making friends saying this but double or triple this would be more reasonable but lets consider a scaleable war dec system where groups with no assets in space can be war decced and given some way to win this doesnt exist currently and not sure what it would look likethe second level of this is a win condition of pos defense win the timer an restront means you won the war same can be done for customs offices and etc forces the fight to be over something then citadel wars you are right they need to be longer to fit all the timers but what if the defense wins the first timer or the second timer should the war continue of there is no hope of finishing in the time frame winning the timer being returning the shields to 50 level to reset the reinforcement window gives defense a purpose to fight at each timer so they can win this is of course only an idea and a rough one at that but starting the discussion on fleshing it out is the more important part and that takes more than one man or even a small group that takes a playerbase to be communicating
isnt the purpose of defending your citadel getting to keep your stuff why do you need to offer more incentive to players to engage in pvp in this pvp game certainly rewarding safety as an incentive to pvp seems counterproductive wouldnt just make more sense to move everything a player corporation has to offer  shared hangers taxing ability industry buffs etc into a citadel and only allow wars against structureholding corporations i mean then players who are benefiting from the bonuses of being in a player corp have a reason to defend to not lose their bonuses and structures and players who are just in a social group but with no structures and thus no benefits above the npc corp wouldnt have to deal with wars it seems simpler than your multiple tiers of wars for various reasons with confusing and changing victory conditions as to cost i dont see why that would work ccp raised them 25fold during the last wardec revamp and all it seem to do was push wardeccers into everlarger wardec alliances to share the costs of declaring war raising the costs again probably would do more of the same making even larger groups further increasing the disparity between professional mercenary corps and your average highsec corp while taking the ability to declare war out of the hands of small corps looking to settle a score with other small corps well its your platform thanks for taking the time to answer my questions and best of luck on your csm run

what are your policies and views on the matter of fun and chill
there is no purpose for war in this game other than for harassment and nonconsensual pvp and by the way nonconsensual pvp is harassment i bring this up because this is the factor that is driving players away from this gamethere is no purpose for war in this game it is only used to circumvent security in high security space thats it it was supposed to have the purpose of providing a method for corporation to contest one another over resources this is absurd any resource worth contesting is out in nullsec or low sec corporations only use it to keep other corporations perpetually in war and harassing them until their members all quit or leave the game if players dont want to pvp they should not be forced into it war forces nonconsensual pvp the only way to get away from it is to leave the game and go play something else war means there is no such thing as high security space corporation who wants fights go out into null sec and get fights easy the fights may not be easy but it is easy to find someone to fightwhy because if someone enters lowsec or null sec they by default consent to pvp get rid of war and increase your player base there are many players who do no want to pvp they want to play cooperatively with others in corporations and do things together as teams and friends they prefer pve content and dont want to be harassed by the idiots who will be flaming this post there are many solutions that could be implemented to change how things are controlled in high sec currently capital ships are not allowed and that model of exclusion could include other structures such as player owned starbasesfor high sec create structures that are temporary or have expirations of some kind or perhaps use something as simple as a licensefor a pos in high sec one would need to use a license for anchoring because it is controlled space the way to acquire a license could be numerous such as rating with the corps who control going through a long harrowing sequence of events and perform a number of tasks ie pve content this license would only last for a duration and cannot be extended pack it up and move it until you acquire another license and get in que for another anchoring locationthis is only one idea for a solution to the problems that war in high sec are supposed to be all aboutget rid of warget rid of permanent player owned structures in high secadd more pve contentget more players in the game

ask me about this in slack this thread is for questions about my reform platform
for the little ive known of a band apart i can say their warm welcoming approach to newbros into pvp and upbringing leads to a better eve experience the whole core of aba aligns to what eve online is about ie to have a good time i think lowsec deserves a major upgrade i remember sugarkyle doing a fine job and i believe joffys contribution to csm will be fruitful to the community you will have my vote and support

im not quite sure what you are referring to when you say allin in terms of the sov revamp the trolling was pretty common in the beginning months but has died down significantly the changes to interceptors limited the constant harassment due to because i can harassment day to day has been relatively unaffected you still get roaming gangs still can get stuff done probably my biggest problem with the current sov system is that it rather hinders the interaction between neighbor groups who dont share the same timezone for example if you have a russian vulnerable alliance directly next to an american vulnerable alliance it is extremely difficult to generate any meaningful content between the two there is really nothing either alliance can do to the other short of ratting harassment in off peak times this was a known flaw before the current sov system came about but they didnt know how to fix it i dont have an answer myself for the problem now but i hope something can be developed
missions i am sort of against what this leads to is one group monopolizing an area or a station or two setting up safe pos in every system a mission can spawn and generally not contributing to good content generation and income opportunities at the same timethe blood raider sites should be a model for active resources in space things that are accessible yet dangerous due to having to search for them and other players contesting them rather than the rats providing most of the challenge furthermore their loot had a harder time devaluing as it expired over time and the demand for it was always going to be out there plexes anoms belt spawns  anything to get people out and moving around such that they can meet people in the area and start playing the actual eve game i have had significantly more player interaction doing blood raider sites or deds than missioning you just have to make it worth the time to do so as i outlined in my exploration post combat exploration is basically dead thanks to aegissov at least in npc null in an isk per hour risk per isk sort of fashion by all means do it if you enjoy it but the effort you have to put in now for the extremely reduced payouts isquite simply laughable you are literally better off making a faction warfare alt an orbiting a beacon in a stabbed venture than trying to explore and take risks in npc null now you can go ahead and say thats a result of player behavior but thats a little derpy  when you double the havens in systems and double the escalation rate did you really think the supply side of null deds wouldnt change so drasticallyfor example if scanned down and escalated sites had different loot tables things would be fine plenty of modules that do not have deadspace versions yet basically yes fill space with things lots of things and make them things that are sought after and resistant to over monopolization by another space type make them accessible so a smaller group of newer players can seek their fortunes in npc null  its a place where they can play eve rather than have eve played on them by big ticket sov entities
i disagree there give aridia special missions and people would want to go there and potentially live there to harvest the special treats many would very likely seek agreements with local powerhouses like lsh or axios in order to run missions in peace but others would not creating a pocket of activity here and there beyond camps in vehan and scap ganks all over the region not to mention that even those who seek blue standings with everyone still open up more targets for hunters and roamers in the area because more people would live there in the first place that would be a conflict driver for low and npc null furthermore pos are attackable moons are occupieable so that they cannot put up their own pos citadells will be engagable as far as i can tell it works fairly well in pure blind with cfc trying to oppose moa and keep them from running mordus missions its merely my personal opinion but out of 40 run gauntlets in querious i have had exactly 1 encounter with another player out of more than 30 frostline sites i have had exactly 0 encounters with other players though some encounters with blues who were of the opinion its their site i thus question the validity of gauntlet like things to bring people out into space these items are already in any exploration or otherwise site to run t1 items everything else is prone to monopolization or oversupply because it is not used as extensively gauntlets also lost their value really quickly as accelerators dropped from 200m in a matter of hours to barely 100m or ofl sites which flooded the market with in my opinion the appeal of npc null to any size of entity in terms of money making are the missions there you have your missions and do not need to worry about having to find a plex 10 jumps away or suitable anoms for your 30 active people in a system i think that is what should be expanded upon
missions justhave conceptual problems im not seeing how these special missions would be different in practice than the current iteration of level 5s where they are totally inaccessible to most players due to standings alts ships locations andor local monopolies on power but are extremely lucrative to a select group l5s can currently if you have extensive knowhow and means can meet or exceed wh level income quite easily i dont like the fact that you can basically just sit in one area indefinitely and never have to wander or leaveavailable and accessible income is what i am after yes if you study whs or l5s or incursions put a lot of time into any of several gimmicks you can make bank but what you need is something where it can start to be utilized immediately after moving to an area so growth can happen rather than the current set of outlets which require substantial investment time to start to see a big payout one of the big things sov has is immediate accessible income that is available and plentiful  you do not need standings etc to do anomalies the general pattern or syndrome i see is a new group starts and doesnt want to do fw or join a big sov bloc they try npc null as they want freedom and content but realize theres no way to support a corp much less an alliance there they are forced to pick fw or sov i direct you again to the production vs destruction numbers for syndicate people desperately love the npc null play style but they have very little way to actually live there not without lots of alts or going to other areas to make their cash it is seriously annoying to players that it is better to go to a high sec incursion on average than to try and scrape a living in npc nullmissions might be available income in that they do not deplete and they may be good income depending on the lp stores but it comes down to accessibility via standings and geography that sort of is a downer for them that and they more or less promote sedentary behavior its one of those entry barrier things where unless your group is of sufficient size and stature and can lockdown the entire mission pocket you are better off running them in hi sec
so ill be the first to say i dont have all the answers i just have a theory i like your idea but give them the incentive to fight to end a war dec and you will get a fight from defense if no benefit you get nothing form a war on either side and really its a net loss to the game to many war decs that dont have any kills at all the reasons to fight from the office are readily apparent pvp income gain from loot income from mercenary work and etc its much better than current mechanics of ditching corp to mine for a week or worse just not playing all together i think this will create fights and we will see less war decs that have no losses on either side additionally it will make it beneficial to run a defense and focus on defensive actions the purpose is to make wars over something not just arbitrary isk amounts of lossesthis means offence needs to bring their a game to each timer and win otherwise well then they loose the invested isk in the war why would the defense fight for anything other than the last timer if there was no benefit to winning an earlier timer as far as high sec goes though all assets can be redeemed at another station so loosing the citadel only costs the amount to replace it from my point of view this would generate a lot more of a fight from defense than we see now having plenty of experience as the defense myself as incentive the aggressors gain massive amounts of loot in the form of what drops form the citadels construction parts of the structure itself and they get to quite literally kick over the other guys sand castle on the cost comment can you afford 150 million isk to war dec a 50 man corp i can im not special either i work for my isk between production incursions and scanning i make more than enough to do that multiple times a week im asking because i can afford that by a lot as for it producing larger and larger groups for war decs that is a quantity issue those groups are looking at war deccing hundreds of groups at one time in order to do that you need income and cost sharing from more and more people i dont argue that that is the case what i can say is maybe this means they have to add a little more tactics to picking a war dec than scanning local in a trade hub pick target rich groups with limited command structure and hit them forces the professionals to view killboards check previous wars and etc prior to starting a war or risk a sum of money as a potential waste tldr the current guess and check method of war decs will go away this honestly will be good for new players and retaining them long enough into the game to actually stand a chance against others this will increase the amount of people out there and by volume increase the space carnage the theory is basically catch and release let the young survive though learn a lesson every now and then and open season on the older ones insuring a population to harvest for years to come side effect concord can earn back a little of its stripped dignity for doing what its done for so cheap for so long just some thoughts i like your ideas though
urieljust got off listening to your interview on csm watch1 you represent very underrepresented segment insofar as the csm is concerned of the eve population2 you were very well spoken3 you were on point4 you had a stable of ideas that were well thought out but you had the presence of mind to realize that would require you convincing ccp of their worth and working with them on things they decided to do you didnt promise anything save that this was what you were interested in bringing to the tablequite simply yours was the very best interview so far broadcastyoure at the top of my ballot sir good on ya alan mathison explorer  industrialist star tide industries

in regards to battleships i simply feel that there should be a tradeoff in deployment versus power and currently it feels that as a class they are overshadowed i did not suggest buffing them because i agree 100 that nerfing the strongest and buffing the weakest just makes us seesaw into different metas one thing i do wish is that battleships had a little bit more of their ehp in resists as opposed to raw hpand as for what temporary standings accomplish it makes the job of an fc easier and honestly i feel that fcs need more tools to make their job easier while also encouraging each fleet member to also fly their own ship it is a hard balance to reach for sureultimately though i understand that as a csm you cant walk in with a list of things you want because your main job is to discuss what is presented to you i wish their was a better way to run for csm based on your ability to think and reason as well as work well with others

still waiting for answers
please read the op and the subsequent posts i have answered these questions already
my csm xi endorsements post is now up
so i asked jintaan to answer a few questions and the results are here linky
sorry for not posting over the last couple of days things were getting so interesting that reading was much more productive than postingi am sure you all understand
and defining competent i do some industry as well and consider myself competentand i do not find what i am saying bad i guess it is a question of focus and priorities
controversy or not it is going to happen and the time to stop it has passed i have not been able to find the opinions of all the current csm on this change  but i would hope that ccp at least tried to get some player feedback now that it is coming and not able to be stopped i guess the priority would be on trying to stop the exploits before they happen and the games economy ends up even more out of whackpersonally i do not think it a good idea and not just because i am afraid that it will influence the prices of the freighter  jump freighter pilots i am training with intent to sell on the forumsthe points that concern me have been raised on blogs out there and some of the points that concern me only concern me since i read a blog and thought oh yeah i do not want to be accused of stealing other peoples ideas but my thoughts have developed out of the stream of conversation that has been going onmy main concern is the new player his credit card plex and maybe rmt i myself have a bunch of skills that i will never use nowadays when i make a new alt i already have a plan a training plan and so on back when i was made primarily interested in hauling and so on i was like astrometric rangefinding coool more than anything i would like to have brand new players protected from spending real money to buy skill points to make senseless characters eve has a hard learning curvecliff but in order to progress past it i think brand new players should have to progress past it did that make any sense i am not looking forward to the first killmail with those skill point thingies in itunforseen side effects are unforeseen i am sure no one really thought of hyperdunking before the bowhead was introduced at least i hope soand as for mitigating other than making sure that the right ccp devs are aware of exploits etc asap i do not have any other specific ideas i am sure the current csm or the relevant focus group depending on what was used with what priority have already worked on that blind faith
the judge is a very dedicated and experienced eve player i know he would do a good job on the csm he has my votethe judge for csm
i have played with the judge for more than a year i can perfectly see he loves what he does and is really motivated on what he undertakes everytime likewise he has very interesting ideas for eve that i am supportinga kind and honest person that i am following and i would perfectly see him as csmthe judge for csminstiink loutte
considering that all of these positive votes are those of goons i decided i would come out of hiding and do something i would never normally do on the forums postjudge has developed a mindset for the betterment of this game and for our enjoyment while keeping his goon hungry appetite at bay before i mention the typical well hes my friend yaddyyaddyyah i would just like to point out the dedication that he puts into everything he does not only inside of co2 but giving back towards the community of eve he is an outstanding candidate and anything short of him winning would be a let down for us as players to be represented appropriately i wish you continued success and best of luck with your candidacynow back to being reds and angry at each other 3
i met judge a couple of years ago when he was in another corp in co2 we used to camp gates together a lot i being a noob at the time learnt a lot from him he helped me a lot with understanding game mechanics he knows a lot about this game and sees the bigger picture not just alliance wise in his position as a diplo but as a whole about the game sometimes when i think something in eve should be changed by ccp he tells me what could happen if certain ships modules or mechanics change he is very knowledgeable and easy to talk toi will be voting for the judge
dunno what server you were playing on but frostlines got me plenty of fights  ganks you could even sit in one in something averageish and people would come to you to gank you maybe you need less blues because youre stifling your own contentvics terrible he has my votes

hello spacefriendsi am here to officially announce my candidacy for csm 11first and foremost i am a community person i believe the community is what makes eve great and what drives me to work for you all as a member of the csm a consequence of this means that it doesnt matter if you live in highsec lowsec nullsec or a wormhole as a member of the community your opinion is important to me and important to the gamethe most important thing to take away from this statement is that i have my own opinion of what i think this game should be however the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few  spock yay star trekif elected to a seat on the csm i will work tirelessly to become the voice of the people and have that voice heard i have always worked well with others and believe the csm is an amazing opportunity for all players to be representedsome of the subjects i support and endorse1 the creation of wealth from the bottom up2 stable nullsec industry with less of a need for importation3 solo and small gang pvp4 ecm rebalancing5 checkboxes in all formsmy personal goal as a member of the csm is to further develop the eve community and esports within evemember of the eve downunder team and founder of oceanic assault
below are some answers to questions i have fielded since i announced my candidacy for csmq what suggestions do you have for your bottom up wealtha i think first you need to look at the way the taxation system works and the way that alliances and larger entities generate their isk i think the best way to achieve that goal and the industry goal is by finding ways to keep resources that are produced in nullsec by making it more profitable to perform the manufacturing and refining processes in null but also work on how the system works in highsec convert moon mining to something more like asteroid mining the moon mining one is more difficult because you need to want to take it out of the hands of a single player operating a pos style but you also dont want to lose that mechanic and the fights that money moons generateq huge amount of isk i would imagine is generated through the refine tax of stations how would you take that out of single player  large groups handsa refining tax is one of the only types of bottom up isk generationthe minerals that are taxed go to the owner of the stationso all the newbies do the mining then refine most of those refined minerals go to the player but a percentage is taxed by the corp or alliancethe player is the bottom doing the work and gets 90 of the profit and the top gets 510 with money moons atm the alliance just mines the moon and nobody gets that isk except the allianceq so why does ccp have to step in for alliance politics and revenue generation a well they dont however i think players should have the ability to mine everything they need to do manufacturing in nullsec as it stands at the moment some alliances just ship their moon goo to jita and sell it there so my suggestion would be something like a land rights tax this tax would be based on planting a citadel on a moon that creates mineralsnumber of minerals that can be mined per hour x 24 x alliance set tax modifier  land rightsthe other option would be to have a mining specific tax instead of for just anywhere so to activate the mining lazor on your citadel you have to pay for a 24 hour license and there is an auto refresh with diminishing returns after say like 510 citadels mining it but a limited amount of resources so like how much dispro can you mine in an hour lets just say 1000so each of the 10 citadels will get 100 in an hour but you have 11 mining each of them gets like 90 or somethingq are you for or against the removal of pos entirely as in the current stick  bubble thinga yes i am for the replacement of poses with citadels i think poses provide too much of a tactical advantagei would think of them as sticks with shields costing 150m and having the hp of a super and thats just dumbq are you in favor of removing the current outposts entirelya and their subsequent replacement with citdels yes replacing both those structures with a new one and subsequently dropping the old pos and station code is a great ideaq so  the history of the game and make way for the new kids on the blocka if the community feels very strongly about keeping history like that in the game they could use them as models in the futureq no im talking about how when they were built they were sold as permanent fixtures of the gamea i guess the real question is what would we prefer to have the same stations and poses with old code which is difficult to maintain forever or to replace them with citadels that is easier to maintain and manageits my belief that with every other major change where something has been removed and item of similar value has been used to replace it i would have to draw the conclusion that the stations would be replaced with a citadel of equal valueq so i invested approximately 10 of the build cost of a permanent fixture on the game and can say for my 3bil isk that i touched the eve landscape how do you replace thata i would think it would be replaced with a citadel i dont have all the answers and unfortunately i can only take your opinion to ccp and attempt to get a response how would you resolve the situationq since eve social recognition is killmail driven how important do you think recognition be given to the logibros who keep dudes alive and in the fighta i think right now being a logibro is a bit of a thankless job as you said you dont get the killmail but you do get to save space lives you can end up playing a pivotal role in a fleet fight i think the believe that eve social recognition is killmail driven is a bit false social recognition can come in many forms performing the functions of an fc or logi anchor as far as pvp goes social recognition is also driven by pve activities but most importantly by the community you belong to some groups do it well some not so well to answer the original question though you could like logis to killmails the ships they rep shootq logibros are the first to die or at the point of being ineffectivea well if you put it that way logibros do get killmails just the sad kind after that its up to the pilots governing body to provide social recognition of financial compensation for the act of flying logi
i dont think the csm could handle chiimera
if elected to the csm i will take that into consideration and play niceremember a vote for chiimera is a vote for you
says a member of the alliance that burned down content ring will fully trading an extremely active small gang sanctuary in the name of politics security or both
and because of my affiliation i cant be a proponent of solo and small gang pvp last year i ran a tournament with over 100 participants called oceanic assault out of my love for the australian timezone and solo pvp its quite disappointing if you cant look past someones alliance ticker when considering their nomination for csm
the big question is are you going to be sions proxy if you get voted in or do you actually for ideas of your own 
the short answer is no and the long answer is nomy candidacy is based on representing everyone who plays evenow that thats out of the way remember a vote for chiimera is a vote for you
1chiimera worked is arse off on oceanic assault and at eve down under in years past when he puts his mind to something hes a machine
wait im running for csm o
id take the following explanationsrationalizations as legitimate of where you can like solo and small gang yet remain a member of one of the largest alliances with outstanding and continuing crimes against the play style even if they are a little two facedagsf has srp im in it for the srp so i can small gang and solo in peace ball my friends are in gsf being part of gsf and saying you are a proponent and enthusiast of small gang is like saying you are deeply concerned for preserving biodiversity yet being on the board of a company with an extremely sketchy environmental record literally saying save the whales while butchering them for cosmetics or save the rain forests while bulldozing them for slightly better profit margins on paper products absolutely someones playstyle doesnt need to match their ticker you can be a ganker without a code tag etc and in such a huge alliance obviously there are going to get more exceptions than an in a small focused one at best it makes you an oddity and a conflicted one at that what does being in gsf really do to further your solo and small gang experience do you even agree with the burning of cloud ring does having blue standings to half the cluster really make your solo experience bettersince you are responding in a productive way ill be quite honest some of the most fun loving and best solo players i know are in gsf corps however you still have to admit it is sort of odd  on one hand relishing the fun and the rush of pvp on a small scale yet tacitly supporting an empire that at best inhibits a ton of interaction in favor of safety and at worst is actively hostile to it when is the last time gsf sported an at team can you really stomach a fickle tyrant that trades pvp opportunities for adrevenue and to expand and secure a grotesquely bloated empire of quasirenters with the cfcs bulldozing of content ring you really cant expect people to cheer and want to shake your hand when you sport the ticker that reminds them of how the cfc at large really feels about good content creation that is why i question explain away if you wish i am listening
i have to say that any representation into csm from inextremis should be void immediately as you are a participatingactive officer inside of inextremis and as someone who bared witness with your involvement with the co2 scandal cowardly hiding when the serious questions got asked i am very judgmental of your capabilities to keep your candidacy honest and true to your intentions good luck

hello guys im rivver and after many years of eve online i felt that was finally time to apply for the csm i am running on no platform i know that sounds strange but i believe my role should be as your advocate rather than to push a agenda speaking as someone who has remained independent since inception i dont have any dogs in the fight i do want to see the csm return to the spirit in which it was intended and that means showing ccp where the problems are and helping them get the player viewpointyou can be anyone and bring something to me im not running to push a specific change im there to report a problem and deliver possible solutions we know that we cant just say that a ship is too strong or that jita station is too small we have to deliver something that can make things work everyone has a different viewpoint or desire but at the end of the day we need to focus on what makes the game thrilling and brings us back for more my personal interests are hauling cargo that is difficult and dangerous and the ingame economy im not much of a combat person but i love the thrill of slipping past camps with precious cargo and i only contract direct with the client special jobs for special needs giving me a small role in a metagame as well as the chance to rub elbows with the movers and shakers of the eve universe in other words i am very neutral because my ingame profession depends on itthese things said i am there for you regardless of who you are ive played this game for over a decade and i would love to play it for a couple decades more thank you for your time
lmao you cant be serious
finally available the interview recorded by csm watch for the csm 11 election coverage gorski car interviewenjoy 
locked for above mentioned reasons if you are serious about being a candidate for csm please apply some actual effort without trying to create a mess we really appreciate it
ummm the game itself is based around and supports nonconsentual interactions in almost every activity which by default makes everythig you do pvp in some formno one the game has any right to be left alone fight for what you want defend what you havenot supported
perhaps you could post with your main coward npc alt and we could harass each other
time and again i read that players who dont want pvp should not be forced into pvp  well  this is a pvp game its like saying players who dont like tennis should not be forced to play tennis tell you what they arent just dont play tennis if you dont like other players shooting at your pixelmeeple dont play a game thats all about shooting other guys pixelmeeplesevery bit of meaningful pvp is nonconsensual heck wars themselves are never consensual  wars are all about conflicting interests player 1 puts a pos on a moon player 2 wants to put his pos there as well so player 2 declares war on player 1 and tries to take that pos down by force with or without consent if pos licenses were temporary people would fight over the grindingspots for those licenses or over the fuel or just because they want to put their pos down right now right here and not once the license has run out of course people do not want other people to attack their  that doesnt mean that people shouldnt be able to attack other peoples  unless invited to seriously  who does that please come and kill my ihub  not going to happen removing non consensual pvp from the game would mean removing every sense of purpose from it silly idea from a player who probably hasnt seen much of this game yetno
eve is a conflict driven game if nothing else is not war conflictthe purpose of war in new eden is asset and trade hub denial i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
thanks for having me on csm watch for all those interested please check out
if your op actually contained any useful information then sure but you havent provided anything of use in your op and refuse to answer people when they ask you for clarificationyour short version is 3 lines your long version is only 6
are the issues you saw with the csm back then the same as they are nowif so have your reform plans changed since then or are they still the same gestapotype ideascan you specifically list a few of those controversies especially the csmrattling kind for those of us who were not playing then and let us know how you would go about avoiding incidents like that in the futureand something you did not mention in your original post do you think the csm has any kind of power or influence on anything these days if yes could you define that kind of influence for those who may not know the ins and outs of space politics and give a few recent examples where the csm did anythingif no do you think you can change that and how
you have my vote also 
im not much of anybody but joffys my man
leeloo interview 2 csm boogaloo
i know its late to join in i didnt join in earlier because i wasnt sure enough i could give it my full 100 looking at the current developments with my own alliance i can give it my full 100 nowmost know me from the marmite collective and the many wars we had the last years but im also very active in lowsec industry running posses 00 pvp and more on my alts i hope you understand i ll keep the names of those alts and their corpsalliances secret  first of all i dont want to be someone who is only complaining about things if you complain about things you should run for csm and try to help out complaining is very easy the csm is hard work my thoughts on war decs like last year i still think ganking needs to be looked at so we get more interaction between attackers and defenders not going to throw in all kind of new ideas to addchange in eve but if you have any feel free to reply here for my thoughts on them im not a native english speaker so keep that in mind when you hear me on a podcast the ideas are there expressing them in proper english is something else typing is easier than live podcastsvote for me if you want a hard working guy in the csm that is willing to listen to what you have to say and be your voicerunning for csm you do as a person not a character you play in eve in real life i help people in eve i want to be evil dont mix them up when you vote as the real life player wants be in the csmtora bushidotwitter  blowfish70

i hope that you have a decent proposal  a decent opinion for the high sec wardec problems good luck with your campaignps any ideas what one can do to make bounties relevantpps posted before tora updated the op
tora i didnt join in earlier because i wasnt sure enough i could give it my full 100 looking at the current developments with my own alliance i can give it my full 100 nowi say you can give it 100 as your alliances is falling aparti vote for tora the man
i want to take this opportunity to clarify my reform stancebeware its not sexy doesnt add ships to the game doesnt promote pvp but politically speaking will reinvigorate the voter base and should increase voter turnoutso heres the idea increase voter turnout via promotion and availability of csm members this can be done in several ways so get out to vote promotion the easy stuff create a option in the help menu with a csm option with contact methods for the csm members based on area of the game they want to suggest changes to billboards in space with csm campaign slidescaptains quarters tv with csm adds simple as a photo with csm logo over itmake elections an icon on the side bar or under the social tab so voting can be done from in game new player mission via aura  opportunities that discusses the csms purpose the goal is to increase voter turnout and increase visibility of the csm while empowering the player base to be involved in the process and so that maybe a day will come when the question what is the csm isnt the first thing everyone asks when you say your running for it
i dont think its odd that a pilot from a large coalition is supportive of small gang and solo pvp at all when i run into a gatecamp in a solo ishtar that has 12 interceptors and 6 falcons i dont scream content killer i go and get another ship and in my opinion its exactly the same when a large alliance takes over a region just because your play style conflicts with someone elses play style it doesnt make it good or bad it just makes it differentwhat happened when the cfc bulldozed content ring did everyone stop playing and now all they do is post on forums im going to assume that what came next was what the sandbox game is all about they adapted moved to another location and continued developing their playstylei have also personally requested that the mittani stop killing the space whales and cutting down the space rainforest
well now youve won my vote
what a reasonable and humor filled responseyou have my vote
the csm is there to communicate the players concerns to ccp regarding real world game development your choice to bring in a completely unrelated issue that is unknown to a majority of the eve community only shows your attempts at defamationi am sorry but you were not at the forefront of this socalled scandal and are simply using whatever information you were fed to hinder my chances of running for csm
its a completely related issue because your involvement with indys scam was for personal gain i have a problem trusting anyone that scams playerscorporationsalliances that wish to represent myself at a bigger table as anyone else should defamation is 100 correct because you are not a fit candidate and anyone who wishes to learn more about his involvement with co2inextremis i urge you to make contact with me before making the mistake of voting for you
huh and i thought it was an endorsementscamming is legal within the game and more than one csm member has in the past run scams beforeduringafter holding office so i took it as a sign of cleverness and people skills rather than a black markmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
fiber you need to grow up i flew with you a short time in the culture and you take everything far too seriously hell im surprised you even logged in long enough to comment on this since when is scamming if even true a knock on somebodys eligibility or competency to be on the csm some of the greatest stories in eve are about large thefts and espionage hell its what draws a lot of people to the game if it is true and was involved in some master scam and theft of a still blue former alliance then im surprised he isnt campaigning on it i would as has been said here already the csms job is to advocate on behalf of the players im not sure how doing something completely within the rules of the game makes somebody unfit for this if you have a problem with him then talk to him personally and dont bring up personal grudges on a public forum thats a cowardly way to do it
i have flown with annex for quite awhile in itai i trust that he will do very well in representing the players i have knows annex to be truly dedicated to the players to his left and right in itai i know he will take those same principles with him when he goes to represent the players of eve
thanks for all the nice messages guysevent website wwweventuk blogUFFFD
hi guys i am still playing with the structure but i wanted to let you know that i will be asking for at least four secretaries from the player base to help field game mechanic issues i might ask for more helpers later but the role of these people is grab the particular issues from their respective neighborhoods this is means a high sec low sec wormhole and null sec person this person can be affiliated with anyone and i am just looking for someone that can take an accurate nonbiased view of their particular area post in my thread if you are interested in helping out i wont pick anyone out until after the election thanks
nope non voters are people who just do not give a shyte about this worthless csm crap simple as that
i really hope that newly elected csm memebers would have more influence on ccp vision of eve future and implementing new features we need more csm members vs current and who are self confidient and more independent from blocs with active position and participation on eveo forumslooks like it is the only way to make eve better
voting for some of them will certainly help achieve this
can you link his gestapostylez ideas 
i was having a rather awkward conversation with a former member of the csm in the basement of the celtic cross in iceland i proposed the idea of term limits and a system to kick involuntary people and she told me my proposals were gestapoesk she has some rather strong opinions and she is perfectly entitled to those opinions we now have a system to kick people who are asleep at the wheel and while term limits arent a policy i dont think they will need to be at this juncture
so does that mean the reforms you are proposing without laying them out in detail have already happened
toxic kindly answered some questions for me interview here
thanks for the interview
i firmly believe that toxic yaken is a solid candidate to represent highsec players in csm xi where others just call for nerfs to highsec content to benefit other areas of space toxic is fighting to keep highsec relevant hes level headed and isnt interested in only benefiting and improving gameplay for his specific nice highsec is what feeds and fuels your players into low and null and is just as important let toxic help us make a better highsec for all of us
i want to thank everyone for their kind word thus far it really does cement my resolve to run as a candidate for csm xi you all drive me to be better and do better i wont let you downvote the judge for csm xi
yes tora you do have plenty of time now that archtype and whats have shut down your alliance 1 tora hes got the timeloreth
think he lacks the alliance members even to get him 1 of the votes of last yearthats right toras alliance is nearly dead and hes got more time on his hands cause he isnt taking contractsbut alls fair in war tora so i wish you luck
welcome back to the csm race torajust a quick question for youin the past three years sabriz adoudel psychotic monk and yourself have all been unsuccessful in capturing a seat on the csm is csm11 the year we finally get a highsec candidate on the csm will toxic yakens more moderate stance help or hinder this
sabriz and monk are both qualified players who i have voted for in the past and i have to admit you have done much better then i expected too this year of course i want to be the guy in the csm but if a better woman with a highsec background wins a seat i would be happy too not sure if toxic yaken running is good or bad you could probably ask him the same question and im also not just running for highsec as i also enjoy low sec industry a lotuntil then vote for me
thanks good to see people can make a difference between evil rp enemies in game and serious rl csm business in hereim running for csm as myself not the evil role playing character i play with
very happy to see this is happening this year tora i made a blog post the day before this campaign thread was started suggesting why i think you would make a great csm not going to repeat it all in here but here is the link if you want a read
thankyou sir i hope your campaign is long and fruitful
best of luck with your campaignare you an official imperium candidate or are you running without any official support
most you of should have never heard of me this is intentional as i prefer to remain behind the curtain i am perhaps the most xenophobic of all the goonswarm directorate and this has manifested itself in essentially a shadow broker persona when it comes to eve i have mostly done everything there is to do with a handful of exceptions whs are not for me for example but hey that is what minions are for rightmy focus is the meta game mechanics economics and empire building i am a soothsayer cartel leader mass manipulator and the transmission of our war machine my platform can be summed up very simply as thisanything that promotes discreet mechanics that build upon each other to form a complex player ran empire or even small businesses i am going to promote anything that is siloed or has little relation to other systems i will lobby againsti see eve as a large organism that benefits from complex interactions as far as i am concerned the future of eve is about territory space meta doomsdays glittering across space sandcastles burning off the gates of ec every story needs a villain i am pretty qualified for that
honestly it wont really matter if anyone outside our organization votes for this guy or not this thread is now a forex appreciation thread
 yes
i support aryth
excellent
you can lie and say your not but it is common knowledge that you are a paid employee and shareholder in tmc you should be blocked from running like sioni have nothing against goons but if the rule applies to one it should apply to all
i endorse his willingness to do the job but not his intelligence good luck holeysheet
quotevic jeffersonwhy doesnt red frog hire professional counterbumpers surely it is of the size and strength that hiring professional white knights isnt unreasonablequotethe trouble is that you would need a 247 20mins  anti counter bumper group covering all high sec where a dedicated bumperganker group can setup in 1 hour where ever they want and only need to be active for 23 hours to do real damagewith about 300 and more contracts a day the costs for a protection team would far exceed the results anyway
not an issue for discussion please read the sticky about issues thank youclosed
many of things i have pushed for in the past ended up just getting implemented when ccp seagull took the reigns as executive producer so yea it can be kinda funny or unnerving when your master stroke that you have had on the back burner for half a year becomes to focal point of a rising stars new game design narrative the next logical step was reform because its not within ccps decision tree or behavioral norm to do that unless prompted toosome things have already happened but as the result of player actions not development practices once inside the csm i will have the data i need to bring about reform

1 for noobman
i have removed an offending post and those quoting it
vic is hands down the absolute worst pilot in the game i support him 100
i flew with vic in another incarnation and hes a top bloke with a lickable face
having just been interviewed by lanctharus and jayne i can say that these guys arent afraid to ask the important questions and the ones that make you sweat a relaxed but thoroughly professional process that gets the answers the community of new eden deserves to know about the people they might elect1010 would be grilled again
at this point in time i am not an official imperium candidate nor did i discuss my candidature with imperium leadership before submitting it however the way that the imperium selects candidates is complex and this may change in the future
i too believe endie eves greatest spymasteryou know he was a great spymaster because he thought xander now thats a lad who knows how to keep a secret
since there are probably dumb enough people out there who believe thatlet just go on record shall wei am not a tmc shareholderi am not a tmc employee or contractori have never signed a tmc ndai am however an axis of evil he got that part right
i have officially declared my candidacy for this years council of stellar management i would like to focus on player decline in eveonline and try to come up with ways to fix our communitys dwindling numbers i think that looking back to when eve was in its golden age 5060k players online at high times would help us work out some of the problem i know some people just get bored of eve or dont have time to play because of jobsfamilyetc but i feel there are other factors too that have contributedthere have been many balancinggamechanging patches some goodothers not so im a big believer that if it isnt broken dont fix it i know these changes are made to improve the gaming experience but some of us like things to stay the same or similarsome of my ideasbring back the old profession system to improve new player experience perhaps sp to allocate so they have a foot to stand on when some of our community have over 200mill sp the game is 13 years old and new players need incentives to feel usefulmore profitable pve creation of more ded sitesa dock timer on logistics ships but no suspect flag except to the war targetdock timer on suspect ganknscoop haulerscheaper war declarationsan interdiction nullified ship that can actually do sites above a 410 or a change to the subsystems slot configurationmake mining more profitableit is the base of our economyhigh sec moons with rarity 8 and 16 moon goomore content the eve gatereopening maybe travel around the sol systemdrop me an ingame mail anytime i also have a ts server for those who want to converse about my campaign have a wonderful day capsuleers of new edenholeysheet1killing your ships and pods since 2008 killboards dont lie dont get mad get better
what do you plan on doing about the growing vic jefferson problem in syndicate region
the way i see it is pretty simple you know what he flies you know what he usually does and you know how to avoid it as much as some people dont like the way he flies if he enjoys it then let him be
