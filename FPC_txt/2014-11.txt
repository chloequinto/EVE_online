"tear jar, i do think that a proliferation of unsolicited corp applications would be very very bad. making the corp joining process take less effort will not help the corp or its people adapt to eve or survive the nuances of its metagame or the nuances of the in-game aggression mechanics.ccp does anticipate us wardeccing all of these people into oblivion don't they?"
"i think just dropping players into a faction corp after 30 days will solve that problem. it'll be either join a corp, or still be a fw target. sure, not everyone wants to pvp...but everyone must be able to protect themselves. this would have problemsof its own though...everyone and anyone in corps with horrible leadership. there are so many corps out there that exploit and misinform their members because, like it was previously mentioned, they either don't know themselves or they are just after the benefits for themselves. these new corps with \"impunity\" will become the focus of mercs and wardeccers all over new eden...and the complaints will roll in like the tide once again..."

(look at samsung, they have wasted billions trying to fight and only have bills and a 1.1 billion usd settlement to pay for it)"

"decent idea. having some way to see how rental rates will be affected by regional and system population would also be useful.a map panel filter industrial index added to the map screen showing where rent/industrial fees are highest would give players a quick glance at where they might want to move their production or overall activity centers to enjoy lower rates.being able to mouse-over a system and see the current rental fee average for offices in the system, and the industrial tax index rate would be helpful."
"for you, eve is about blowing up ships in space. by that argument they shouldn't have industry, because i don't engage in it, and see it as a waste of resources. (you could simply seed the market with npc built ships) just because some folks wouldn't use the feature, doesn't mean it would not make eve a more inviting place for more players.i for one, would like to see new things in the game. as someone with 130+ mil sp, adding \"new\" destroyers to the game is a total lack of development resources imho, nor do i see it as \"new\" content. however, i can see what player demographic ccp is attempting to appease with these additions. i'd just like to see ccp look at adding some content to the other player types (other than pure pvpers). the roleplaying community is huge in the mmorpg community.i'd also bet that as soon as alliances can custom paint their ships, many large alliances will be bucking up to do so, and the rmt crowd will grow significantly."
"in my opinion a large part of the issue is that the complainer's likely don't really learn to play the game in terms of all the possible things they can do during their time on the game whether short trial period or longer. for instance players being booted from an npc corp don't have to join an existing corp, they can form their own corp and if they get wardecced - dissolve and reform etc. and then there is eve uni etc for newer players to look at using if they know about it.if ccp want's to have newer players go into corps thinking that will somehow solve retention issues i think they're missing the point that eve isn't for everyone out there. this was a large part of the attraction for me - it's not wow and the sandbox environment/attitude was and still is a huge attraction for me.eve's problem with new players is that eve itself is big complex and a sandbox that some people aren't quite prepared to deal with. while those aspects are a major attraction to myself and apparently a bunch of other long term subscribers it might can be overwhelming to someone not prepared to deal with it and expecting wow in space.another thing that this particular nerf does is make it much harder for highsec corps to practice pvp on a squad vs squad basis harder in hisec etc.1 - duel requests can get really cumbersome for more than a few parties involved2 - going to lowsec to practice pvp just means the hisec corpies lose sec status and can't jump back into hisec until they're no longer flashy red etc.3 - going to null or a wormhole for pvp practice between corpies is just begging to be engaged by likely better skilled/armed/organized local forces (and a bit of a trek etc).an additional thought to the quote above:make being able to engage corpies a global on/off option, within the corp, for a specific member or role. then the corp could use it as needed for pvp practice or internal discipline etc along with the other options given in that previous post."
"nobody removes awoxing. friendly fire within a corp will wake up concord. thats all.if you read the csm notes you will see that they want to change it to lower the barrier to invite random people into your corp. which might help noobs, since the earlier a noob is in a corp the better for the noob."
"a corp that needs a lower barrier probably isn't a good place to be in, nor would it help the noob adapt and learn eve.just because a noob is in a corp does not mean he is in a good place. and making it \"easy to join corps\" does not help the newbie navigate the social nuances of eve either.in any case, removing awoxing will not make it any easier to join any corp that has a real stake in the game."
"the real issue that ccp needs to be focusing their attention on is the staggering number of corps recruiting new players to sustain their personal tax farm while feeding new players terrible information that keeps them in the cycle until they quit."

"coming from a prior military stand point - positives.during 6 - 9 month deployments can set your skill planner for the time and not have to think about how much time your wasting by not training skills now.sticking to the plan. more complete skills. lots more lvl 5 skillsbetter characters on the bazaar for me to make a profit.less people logged in to eve possibly slowing down servers ( just a guess not sure if it will speed it up or slow it down)negativesless active players due to no longer required to long in.super/titan pilots say safe logged for 6 months get put in to station.taking a major aspect of the game and turning it in once in a will look at it then leave it for 6 month thing.overall i think it is a good thing but to me it feels that ccp is taking away from the aspect of the game.-olgaso yeah like my post. -olga"
"it sounds as if you are suggesting that ccp will lose to much money and inactive players will fully leave. it is a possibility and one that has been considered. however, there are huge positives to this change as well. the question becomes, is forcing you to log in every so often to change skills really keeping you in hte game? it is not motivating you to play except for a casual checkup with your corp. your entire corp, from your wording sounds inactive. if you are not motivated to play now will you be motivated to play later?skill points are keeping you active not the skill queue. we cannot get time back. that is why this change is good. for all of those people who want to plan out their queues and go afk for a few months they can. it is artificial pressure. if the game and your social relationships are not keeping you here i doubt the forced logging in once a month or so is doing any better."

"as you see, someone on the csm has asked ccp to reconsider these changes."
"i'd personally prefer jump bridges not giving fatigue, since they are huge static targets that can be incappacitated by reasonably-sized fleets. nerf it's hitpoints if you want but let people use the networks they have put together and work hard to maintain.on the other side, fatigue for shipboard jump drives seems to be working nicely. this is one of my favourite patches in quite some time and i cannot get behind this knee-jerk proposal."
"there are these things, there called \"gates\" you are allowed to use them instead of jump bridges you know."
"\"ccp - my previous gameplay no longer works identically post patch. i demand that you change the game back to ensure i never have to adapt?\"you guys all suck.especially you corebloodbrothers. then teach your grunts that they need to be at formup with zero fatigue, even if that means, shudder, using actual jumpgates, jump clones, multiple form-up locations or whatever.in-region jump gate spam usage is just as much a problem as long distance multi-jump routes."
"we should not get rid of fatigue for using jbs.some scenarios i'm thinking of:1. a roaming fleet decides to enter a region and harass the locals. without fatigue and a solid jb network, the locals can form up in the matter of minutes. they can then take a few more minutes to get to where the hostiles are and proceed to camp them into a pipe. this forces the hostiles to try to break the camp, usually involving attempting to warp off due to being heavily outnumbered and outgunned since the locals can move heavier ships more quickly than the hostiles can move light ships. the locals get to gank a few of the hostiles and no actual fight or content is created. it's likely the hostiles will bring an even lighter and faster comp next time to avoid confrontation and only search for ganks.with fatigue from jbs, the locals will need to stage closer together or deploy in smaller numbers with a comparable doctrine to the hostiles. this has a much higher likelihood of creating an actual fight and would be beneficial to both sides.2. subcap logistics across the region with jbs before phoebe was incredibly easy. you could clear a full region taking one or two actual gates, and if those were camped by hostiles you could always divert to another route to avoid getting caught. this leads again to a lack of content since there aren't ships in space along pipes for hostiles to catch. the jb fatigue will generate a greater number of ships taking said gates, leading to content for hostiles to catch them (or heaven forbid an escort fleet to engage the hostiles)3. the hostiles bring in an actual fleet comp designed to engage the local fleet. they are looking for content and will regularly allow the locals to form up into a similar comp. since they know they now can't get trapped as easily there will be more willingness from the hostile party to engage creating a greater chance for content.tldr; the only \"content\" lost by removing jb fatigue is that of the locals ganking a small hostile roam. it makes logistics for the locals slightly more tedious (oh no, i need to jump 8 jumps rather than 1). anyone who wants to get rid of jb fatigue is a cowardly, risk-averse, girly-man (manly-girl?)"

"tl;dr wasting my time.i think the tedium is the problem, specifically, the lost time, real-life time. i haven't been around for ages like some people, but small gangs don't seem to be what fcs hunt, and it doesn't look like anyone's gonna form up an especially large fleet to especially blob a small gang, gangs like that get pasted by large fleets as incidental snacks - not always, cos sometimes there's nothing big in providence to meet. i don't know what other places are like... but in providence, small gangs pulled the brakes off the **** train well enough as it was (it seemed to me) ... and plenty make it out alive with loot. and good on em.small gangs in north provi sometimes get a comparable gang to meet them, usually formed by whoever is in system or next door, and do gangs say in local oh we'll let you form up some comparable gang? not much, i haven't seen that very much. has happened, even one on ones, but gah not much... it's kinda \"o7\" but most gangs (defenders/interlopers) are out to cut throats, scoop corpses - not hang about - they cut through, blap whatever, n run.we went rapeyroamy in catch, and got blitzed really nicely by bni, we were in snipey cormies, they in extra snipey phantasms - it was great!! i didn't expect, and never do expect to come home alive, so do people want to just not die or something when they go a-raiding? and how many times have i set foot out of providence n blap, oh i'm in station (le sigh again), can't cry about that... cos it's funny.i don't mind ripping off the big girl's blouse to adapt, but on friendly/own turf, with assets like jbs, isn't it a little weird to make all that setup periodically irrelevant? or at least problematic, and tedious? and what do we do if as the interloper, hardly anyone shows up cos they're miles away, and couldn't form up quickly enough nor could catch us up via their jbs? i mean the interloper is already formed, why hamper defenders? oh! we'll just wait there for you hahaha, fa sure fa sure. is the problem a little deeper than some suspect?quite frankly, the problem that is biggest, is my time. some say eve is a boring game, there is waiting, and it does get boring, this just makes thing's a little more boring. hehe, this is a game of waiting really, and one needs patience, but fatigue is already fatiguing. if i find i have to sit and watch a timer or go yolo into whatever... y'know?jump clones and staging systems are great for avoiding desync'd fatigue timers, but you can only jump once per day (basicallyo r every nineteen hours or whatevs), and if the pod express station isn't some kind of trade hub, or if there isn't one closish, and if you didn't foresee a big fight where you would have had stacks of stuff to reship into, and you can't make effective use of jbs to get the ships or mods you would need to reship, let alone get back to the fight, then no more big great big fun epic fights? just dudes dribbling in from whoopwhoop? are we all expected to run the clockwork orange like rnk, for a bit of the old ultra via uber-timed impeccability re what was simple logistical organistion (and that on friendly turf)? now it's a hassle. problem.fari enouigh, i agree with some things ppl have said about adapting, and that small, interloping gangs might actually get a bit more bang for the possible pod express, but this just bores me. this is lost time. fleets take long enough... this gargles the dog's nuts.phoebe is a goddess for everything but this... really like the squeue change, and the container searches, and heaps more stuff, but please reconsider fatigue... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzimma go brush my bronies hair now n cry."

"i am ok with the jump fatigue on capitals. but putting them on jumpbridges was one step too much. even stops the sub capital ships from getting to the fights. this was supposed to change power projection with capitals, not power projection with subcapitals, or am i mistaken there?remove the fatigue from jumpbrifges"
"yes, it was a power projection nerf.that includes both capitals and subcapitals. take providence. can do a full fleet on a normal day? 2-3 full fleets on a omg all hands on deck cta cta. this will steamroll most groups in the game when you count out capitals.will you let the \"afk empires\" that base out of x system/region be able to control several regions with impunity?\"lolz, a small group is sieging our system 2 regions away, lets form up and run the bridges\". 5 minutes later you nuke those poor suckers.\" doesnt sound very fair now does it?yes, the bigger coalitions can still field capital support, but they will actually have to think about how and when they do it.pre-patch you pretty much had to flip the coin wether or not the skirmish group you engage would pop a cyno if you managed to pin them down. now the odds are; they are not.likewise; in providence pre-patch, if you get a few systems in; you are pretty much guarrenteed to have people coming from every corner converging on your position within minutes=slaughter.post patch: sov owners actually have to make a coherent fleet and give the hostiles a fair chance with scout usage.scouts pre-patch for skrimish fleets where close to worthless due to the jumpbridges. it was more a russian roulette kinda deal.additonally;you got something called; advanced infomoph psycology and infomorph synchronizing. train them and use em."

"negatives: what's so \"active\" about logging in to update a skill queue?supers... with all the capital changes going on, i'd say \"wait and see\" about how things will end up and that is still fairly trivial. i don't think there's been a kill to date with one of them just logging in to update a skill queue.taking a major aspect? missing a n update: a trivial annoyance when i sit at over 117m sp. missing a day of training due to rl travel or what not - that effects junior style pilots far more than someone like myself with mass sp invested. i'd look at this as more a positive than a negative. it will help younger pilots (like your bazaar alt sales) far more than any of us senior types. they need the skills to do things, we're just polishing up skills that are already quite functional."
"harsh but still all true. senior people don't really care about missing a few days here and there. but it was still a thrill of finishing skills and being able to fly that ship or use that gun you wanted to but you had to wait. i feel this just takes away from that.-olgaso yeah like my post. -olga"

"thanks for the comments.maybe my doubts are simply inertia on my part. it is a simple change that has immediate appeal. it will definitely help me over the next 2 months as i will have no access to eve. elsewhere in the forums i have seen players consider it as just another example of the dumbing down of eve due to declining subscription numbers. no idea if that is true.i do not play regularly as i stated. it is mostly due to an inadequate computer. i do not quit as i have nearly 11 years invested in the game and maybe one day it will capture me again. another example of my inertia i suppose :-)"
"this has not been looked at as a community properly for a long time and all the old ones are in skills and all posts are loced so you cant even comment on them. before we lock it down as repetative can we at least discus it. locking the thread stops people discusing it which is what its all about. (unless ccp locks it becasue they just dont even want to consider the option) which in turn means they really dont give a crap about us.i want to know when they will bring about a mass skil point reset. over the years the game has evolved and changed. i have have breaks and each time i come back somwething has changed. they removed skills, they added skills but then made the scanner stuff open to anyone, i worked hard at scanning system to find nothing or stuff already used up. now those skills are dead and wasting away. i just want to keep the ships im happy with retrian all my skills but keep my agents and my stading. im not asing for a full on reset buttom im asking about a one off token that will allow me to just redo my entire skill tree.what are peoples opinions on this. (we know ccp can do it as they have refunded skil points in the past when they chose to remove skills.)this is a token linked to the account. it can only be used on character created on that account not on purchased characters and charaters with skill points reset and not spent could not be sold on the bazar. (you can sell them after youve spent the points) but the token would be limited to one per account and non transferable."

"thank you. the thought of squeezing mains onto shared accounts like sardines made me pretty sad. my only comforts were in knowing i would have reduced sub fees while still getting to visit them, and i was hard-limiting med clone fees by the number of characters i could have out at the same time. it was an equilibrium, but a complete loss of my fanboidom. i'm anxious to have that happiness back at rhea.excuse me for posting such a ragethread in your forum section. i decided to leave my ambien rage post as-is, as a reminder to not do that any more. also, i don't have an ambien prescription anymore, after telling my psych it wasn't working and that i often ended up awake but blacked out. communicating on forums. when i shouldn't be. this thread was one of the biggest factors in my decision to level with him. the new thing he has me using works better, and people don't get it prescribed unless they encounter issues with ambien. if this thread hadn't happened, it would have been a lot longer before i made that change (i enjoyed it too much).i don't feel weird talking about it. it's just insomnia."

"this is by far the worst change ccp has ever made to the game. furthermore, there is no real explanation of why it was done aside from ccp greyscale chuckling as he indulges in obvious ccp groupthink about the evils of hot drops. exempting the impacts to combat cap ships for the moment, the jump fatigue change entirely destroys the ability of players to stock the 0.0 market. i acknowledge that ccp has been trying, in vain, since the original launch to find a way to create or force 0.0 inhabitants to manufacture in 0.0, but it hasn't happened since then and i don't see it happening now. this change basically makes 0.0 worthless.-4 accounts."

"thanks for looking at this proposal and taking the time to reply. this proposal is not intended to replace or even be remotely related to the npe. this proposal is about bringing back and expanding on content that was previously available in the game. content that worked great and could have been easily updated instead of being removed from the game.each of the original 60 'tutorial agents' (wrongly named) were retired and replaced by the aura npe agent. after a short while aura npe became the 'meet & greet' tutorial in the captains quarters. the aura npe agents, located in the various stations previously occupied by the wrongly named original 'tutorial agents', were then removed. now all of those stations are empty and lonely, located in dead-end systems that players rarely ever visit. reviving and expanding the original content could help make those systems more active by offering more pve content for everyone, both new and veteran player alike. these new 'political agents' could even offer burner missions, however that's a topic for another thread. dmc"

"i think that it is inevitable that ccp will have to revisit wis within a couple of years.the reason for this is that players of space games will be socialised into expecting avatars, and given that avatars already exist in eve, the pressure will be to expand on them.players will be socialised into expecting avatar play by the <U+FFFD>competitors<U+FFFD> of eve that are coming out in 2014 and 2015. in december the grand-daddy of eve, elite, is launched as a cooperative multiplayer game, and it already has systems for avatar play. at launch the avatar will be locked into the cockpit, but that doesn<U+FFFD>t mean that the avatar isn<U+FFFD>t there. it is, and david braben has said that the systems has been coded with avatar gameplay in mind. then in 2015 you will, hopefully, also see star citizens launch, finally. it too has avatar play, and it has from the start.space games will see a rennaissance over the next few years, and like elite set the floor for games like eve and wing commander, their pedigree will set the floor for ccp too. with the player churn that goes on always, that floor will make players come to eve with certain expectations formed by those existing standards.i believe that avatars will become standard. therefore, ccp will have to expand on wis.ccp foxfour: \"... the what button... oh god i didn't even know that existed. brb.\""
"i agree.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
"i'm torn. i love the idea of avatars, and i love the idea of bringing eve into stations--bringing stations into the game, really. the potential to make the game much larger and much deeper is huge.however: the avatar in fact is a very difficult thing to pull off, because humans are incredibly diverse things, and so much social interaction depends on things like unconscious cues, body language and tone of voice that are either caricatured as /emotes that you have to type out, or absent altogether. when i played on text-only mushes this wasn't a problem, because my character could do anything that i described (within reason, obviously). in space it's not a problem, because a ship is just a big hunk of metal; nobody expects much individuality or expressiveness out of them--though, in my ideal eve, there would be room for that, too.as a result, much of the communication between players is either done the same way i did it in mushes in the 1990s and through talk and vt100s in the 1980s: text chat--except that the mushes have vastly more sophisticated options than any mmo does, so it's more like the 1980s than the 1990s. the only enhancement, if that's what it is, is that some graphical mmos put the text in a speech bubble over the avatar in addition to updating the chat window.the rest of the communication is out of the game entirely, and much of it is private and inaccessible even if every single one of the people talking are sitting on the jita 4-4 undock.this is not an easy problem to solve. ccp could probably start by really committing to eve voice, which will incidentally become much better when ccp has single-sign-on for all a person's accounts and eve voice at the top level, so that you don't have to leave and come back when you change characters. but making avatars seem alive and human is a very hard problem, and i have to say that, as a veteran roleplayer, i can't get terribly excited about avatar gameplay if it means my avatar standing dumbly in a room looping through his standard collection of fidgety behaviors while i type into a chat window.i can get more excited about avatar gameplay that involves doing things, because running around wielding various items and interacting in specific ways with the environment is a mostly solved problem--at least, game developers have figured out how to fake it reasonably well."

"i just re-read \"foundation\" by asimov, and that got me to re-sub, after some 3 months, eve is an interesting universe after all.it also gave me a few ideas, right now the planets in eve universe are largely ignored.my main idea is to bring planets into focus, as the main source of wealth and power, and the reason for holding space. planetary interaction would change:- add, or allow building of spaceports on planets. a few hundred randomly generated landscapes for all planets greet the players when they land, nothing complex, no terrain generation for entire planets. just a spaceport building and the view around- maybe a random generated map for the planet, with cities - for the inhabited planets - this would be purely aestetic- the planets (the inhabited ones) would be the main reason to hold sov. the sovereign holders would be able to tax the inhabited planets. a planet would have indices: population, industry, raw materials to be mined. the most populated ones, would be the prizes, as r64 moons are now. a corporation or alliance would be able to tax planets - for direct isk. the isk would go to the corp wallet. too much tax and the planet could rebel - requiring a transport of troops (these would be \"clone soldiers\" produced somewhere in space by capsuleers), or a lowering of tax, or something like that. a basic \"civilization\" game, no too complex.this would be done by the corporation holding the space - through a simple interface, where the players with the \"planet management\" powers given to them, see all the planets owned, and their stats. it would be simple, not like the nightmare that is maintaining a pos network right now - for the responsible players inside an alliance. moon goo would still be there, of course.- individual players could also interact with planets - by creating and landing at spaceports, bringing the factories, \"clone workers\", and taking up the raw materials mined by these. this would replace today's pi. or at least make it more fun, more immersive. a planet's \"economy\" and also the tax revenue would go up a little with every player that brings a factory or a mine and \"clone workers\" to a planet. just like the sov indices now. this would be more immersive than the boring pi of right now. individual players doing this kind of pi would also pay tax to the owner of the solar system - if they are not in that corp or alliance.---the isk gained by taxing the planets could get directly to the corp members, to incentivize them to defend or conquer space and planets. right now there is a general tax on players activities - that goes to the corp, also there is moon goo, and from these comes srp. a direct faucet of isk to the players would feel more like a reward for owning space. the isk gained by taxing the planets could get directly to the corp members then, to incentivize them to defend or conquer space and planets. right now there is a general tax on players activities - that goes to the corp, also there is moon goo that goes to the corp, and from these comes srp. a direct faucet of isk to the players would feel more like a reward for owning space. even - having shares or buying shares into a corp could have meaning then."

"ccp has announced there will be an occupancy-related sov mechanic added in the future. they have also asked for ideas and suggestions. thus, within and without ccp, the struggle of ideas so that the best for eve may emerge is on.here is my idea. it will be about armed spaceships and battles in space. it will retain all the existing sov structures (yes, keep those bp<U+FFFD>s), but remove the necessity to grind through their high ehp (you still may, and it will be advantageous). it will still disallow ping-pong sov transfers. the mechanic will scale itself according to the number of subscriptions and to the number and size of ships that will be in use. unused system will be increasingly easy to conquer, heavily patrolled systems will be fortresses. it will reduce the number of tidi fights greatly. and while the mechanic is in principle very simple, it allows for a very varied gameplay. and finally, a seamless transgression from the current mechanic is possible. and i believe it will lead to battles such as the dominion trailer promised us."
"the conceptthe only thing in my proposal that matters for gaining, defending or losing sov will be military ships used in space. greater military presence means dominance and supremacy, the literal synonyms of sovereignty. the basic idea as simple as it can get: if you want to conquer a system, you set its holding alliance to red and fly armed ships into the system. if you vanquish the defenders and / or are the dominant military presence in the system for a few days, the system will be yours to claim.and here is how: every system has a sovereignty index (henceforth called si). players can influence the si by having armed, piloted, undocked, uncloaked and un-posed ships in the system. the larger the ship, and the higher its techlevel, the greater the influence. if you are a member of the sov holding alliance, you influence it positively. if you have set the sovholding alliance to blue, you also influence it positively. if you have set it to neutral, you do not influence the si. and if you have set the sovholding alliance to red, you influence the si negatively. i would think of it as a point counter: points per time increment (recorded e.g. every five minutes) are awarded to or deducted from the si. for every blue ship in the system, according to size and tech, points are added to the si. for every red ship, again dependent on size and tech, points are deducted. simply put: a red force attacks the system, a blue force defends and strengthens it. the more powerful force will prevail and it is or will become \"their\" system.as long as the si remains above zero, nothing happens. once it reaches zero, the alliance with the most points on the next time increment will be new board leader and the si is henceforth calculated with them as the relevant alliance. blue and red points are now applied to the si as the new board leader has been set by the other pilots.if the sov holding alliance does not regain the board leader position within 96 hours (four days) at least once, they lose sov. if they do, the counter is reset to 96 hours. (ccp may deem other time spans appropriate, but the principle is clear.)if no-one holds sov and you are uninterrupted board leader for 120 consecutive hours (five days), you can claim sov.the current si board leader will always be displayed in the system, so in case the board leader de-clines sov or if the si is contested between more than two parties, attackers know who to set to red in order to attempt conquest of a system.the si decays over time (i suggest a 1% deduction every downtime). sov holders have to use or at least patrol a system to keep their si up. little used or unused systems will not drop sov automati-cally, but it will be easier to lower the si if a system falls out of use by the current holder even if it once had a very high index."
"the resultsin this manner, an alliance would have to be the dominant military power in a system over several days to gain sov, and it would have to remain the dominant military power to retain sov. to chal-lenge sov, an attacker would have to maintain a large enough military force to decrease the sov holder<U+FFFD>s counter down to zero over several days. the defender can choose to stay and defend, mak-ing the attacker<U+FFFD>s task more difficult, or even stop him. in the defender<U+FFFD>s main systems, the attacker would have to be a lot stronger or maintain his attack longer to nullify the much stronger sov index.this mechanic would even make <U+FFFD>fights<U+FFFD> between different time-zones possible, albeit in a some-what virtual way: the attacker has his force in system during his times, and decreases the index. the defender logs in during his prime time with his <U+FFFD>defending<U+FFFD> force and egalizes the loss again (or fails at it) by fielding his fleet. the larger force will eventually swing the tide, as would probably be the case if the two alliances actually clashed. and of course, either side can choose to stay up until his opponent<U+FFFD>s prime time to actually demolish the opposing force.the mechanic would still reward having the social skills to organize large forces and being able to gather overwhelming numbers. the existing large blocs will still have a considerable advantage in holding systems, and rightly so as a reward for being able to cooperate.on the other hand, even a large coalition cannot be everywhere (even less so with phoebe<U+FFFD>s jump changes). since you now have to be actually present most of the time to defend sov, small groups can claim the space that the large groups do not care for.and since the sov holders' points decay, even having 51% of the numbers of the nulsec-dwellers would not suffice to actually hold all systems at once."
"the finer pointssi points are still accumulated when you have sov, to make important / much used systems much stronger. an alliance with capitals and supercapitals (in space!) will be able to push the index very high, and thus make important systems super-strong, or literally <U+FFFD>fortresses<U+FFFD>. there will be a reward for having your supers actually logged in and using them, much like a real world navy that has to be unmoored to actually be effective. in return, super caps in space provide content<U+FFFD>opposed to accumulating points, they also very slowly decay over time, so unused / unpatrolled systems are more easily conquerable, and years of holding sov will not make a system unconquerable for years to come. this will also result in diminishing returns for having large fleets in only a few systems. larger alliances will have an incentive to expand and send patrols and fleets around. more content.sov structures will still be there and serve a purpose: they give boni (that is the plural of <U+FFFD>bonus<U+FFFD>) to the sov holder<U+FFFD>s accumulation of points, thus making systems stronger. ccp will weigh the exact amount correctly. once ownership of a system changes hands, the sov structures that an attacker may not have destroyed automatically transfer to ownership of the new sov holder. this effectively means that an attacker may opt to either attack the sov structures, thus making attacking the si easi-er; or he may ignore and inherit them after a more difficult conquest. more strategic decisions to make. and sbu<U+FFFD>s also have a purpose: they grant boni to the deduction of si points. you can still only anchor one per gate, so dead ends tend to be easier to defend, while crossroads offer greater assault potential."
"the difference between si and the present mechanic (or: why all the hassle, we have jump fatigue?!)as it is, sov mechanics need large blobs. even the most worthless system needs a valuable tcu. this and all other sov structures have very high ehp, which need lots of firepower to demolish. the ships that have this firepower attract large blobs like honey attracts flies (even from parties who could not care less who has or will hold sov) <U+FFFD> and to top it off, the honey pot will be there at a time which is precisely known well in advance. in conjunction with repair logistics, this means in effect that the larger group can always hold the field if it so chooses and annihilate the smaller groups<U+FFFD> entire fleet with relatively few, if any, losses. so a smaller group will be foolish to send their fleet to a timer. their fleet will be doomed if the de-fenders do not want to lose their system. and which alliance would willingly lose a system when it can help it? the current sov mechanic prevents battles over territory because the outcome is deter-mined beforehand simply by comparing sizes. less content.if a smaller group can send their fleet and attack sovereignty and actually has a chance to not be butchered like sheep, more content arises. they can send their fleet if the necessity to battle over timers is removed. the si idea does that.timers were introduced, if gather correctly (i started playing long after the dominion patch), to end daily system and station ping-pongs. with the 4-and-5-day-rule (see above) there will not be ping pongs either. the alternative rule removes the need for timer battles, which the current mechanic has, but which makes smaller attackers stay docked or turn around and dock up if they can count. the si idea allows smaller groups to go in and test the battle readiness of the sov holders, and the sov holders, if strong enough, can defend their systems without being subject to the whims of small-ish sneak attackers.also, under the current mechanic you have to grind through massive ehp to flip sov. even if no-one is far and wide who would like to prevent you from claiming sov. which may not be much of an issue since actually a couple of carrier pilots could do it, but it still seems somewhat ridiculous to have to bring capitals or a large fleet of subcaps when not even a single ibis within 10 light years is there trying to stop you from becoming the local lord.with si points, even a small subcap group can take a system if unopposed, just as a single platoon of soldiers can take a village if unopposed. well, maybe not as quickly, but you get the idea."
"other ideas under discussionfellow pilots and theorists have published their ideas. nearly all of them, as regards occupancy sov, include indices based on all kinds of activities possible in a system, from pvp kills over production and trading to ratting, exploration and (asking ccp to introduce it) mission running. i am somewhat uneasy about these, because it means a lot of issues, starting with complex formulas and not ending with weighing those activities fairly against each other. as regards an index based on pvp kills itself <U+FFFD> that would mean your sov<U+FFFD>s stability depends not on how strong you are, but really on how many ships other people send your way, or how many ships flown by alt pilots you deliberately blow up<U+FFFD>in my humble opinion, this would also put too much emphasis on non-pvp activities in nulsec. i found one particular comment in the eve forums on those activity-based indices, which (in words appropriate for the esteemed readership here) said <U+FFFD>the day i have to go mining and ratting to con-quer a system is the day i quit eve.<U+FFFD> ("
"the larger picture that unfoldshaving a huge bloc will still be rewarded with (much) larger and nicer portions of space. the social skills to organize such large entities will still be greatly rewarded. our large alliances and blocs will be here to stay, at least for a long time.having a huge bloc will however not be necessary any more to claim less valuable systems and enter into the sovereignty game. jump fatigue will already make a huge step into that direction. however, as long as timed high ehp structure fights decide sovereignty, the group that is slightly larger will still have a huge advantage. theoretically, your claim to sovereignty is as stable if you have only one more pilot than the other group, as if you had 10,000 more. your n+1 group only needs to show up for the timers, and you are good. to hold sov with the si mechanic, your n+1 group needs to roam the space you want at least as much as the other group, and all of the time. and the n-1 group would actually pose a real threat to your sovereignty claim, as a tiny red group of 2 would tip the scales. or in other words: a group of 1,000 pilots can defend the current sov against two independent groups of 700 pilots. only when the two smaller groups cooperate can they take sov away. under si, the 1,000 could not stand against the 1,400, which to me seems to mirror the power situation better. and actually, the three groups would have to slug it out between them all, as none can claim sov against the other two <U+FFFD> even more content:with si as proposed, each group has several options to plan conquest, mainly: cooperating with one other against the third, and afterwards stay together or turn against your ally, or wage a multi-front war; or sit back and watch the other two and then attack the winner. under the current mechanics, the only option is to cooperate with one other group against the third group, and stay loyal (or else the next attacker will see your allies<U+FFFD> exhaust fumes instead of the holey part of their gun barrels). so the current mechanic will still lean towards very large blocs, which (as we have seen) tend to-wards stagnancy. si would mean vibrancy.also, just in case jump fatigue does not diminish power projection as intended (eve players are famous for finding ways around stuff), the si mechanic would make power projection much less desirable: let an alliance project their power to the far reaches of the universe, and let them conquer a system by simply bridging in their cap fleet: they will have to keep that fleet there to keep that system. having their fleet at the other end of the galaxy means less si points and less defense in their home systems, making it easier to attack. sending the king<U+FFFD>s personal guard abroad now has a higher price than just fuel costs."
"and what about tidi?the si mechanic will also diminish tidi, which is another major drawback of the current mechanic. it demands that you have to be in a certain system at a very specific point of time with as many pi-lots as possible, with the result most nulseccers know and loathe (while remembering that lag was even worse).not anymore, at least not necessarily: si points are gathered and deducted over the course of days and maybe weeks. and if a system is contested and the attacker sends in large numbers and power-ful ships, the defender can choose to go into that system for a glorious large battle to defend the motherland, which will probably cause tidi - or use the opportunity to send forces into the at-tacker's systems, taking advantage of his absence there. or split forces. or make a feign attack on the attacker's home region, and while the attacker in response recalls some of his assault forces to defend home, turn around and kick the remaining attack fleet from the besieged system. the same is true for the attacker, he also has options: instead of going for a single system, he can opt to spread his forces to attack several systems at once, possibly in very different locations, mak-ing the defender have to choose and react this way or that, without the predictability of timers. which in turn affects the way how the attacker continues with his plans. so location of pilots can be much more spread out. and spread out means smoother gameplay. the whole system of nulsec warfare would become much more reliant on strategic decisions - where to have your forces at any given time (again, phoebe will do a lot for this already, too) - and it would give a lot more choices how and where to attack, and how and where to defend, instead of having to pile everything into a single system where the timer is opening a very small sov attack window. sov conflicts would become much more lively, dynamic, and interesting. and with much less tidi."
"a game designer<U+FFFD>s dreamthis mechanic also scales by itself with the fleet sizes that the eve community can muster / will be able to muster in years to come: if fleets will be larger in the future, they can deduct points quicker <U+FFFD> but the defenders will also have larger fleets to build up higher indices. the <U+FFFD>buffer tank<U+FFFD> against sov attacks is automatically adjusted by the size of the involved parties, so the difficulty of taking or defending sov automatically adjusts to subscription numbers and the power of fleets fielded. theoretically, if in ten years titans were as common as battleships are today, then today<U+FFFD>s sov struc-tures (still an important part of today<U+FFFD>s <U+FFFD>sov buffer<U+FFFD>) will be a mere side concern ehp wise if un-changed. or if caps and super caps should fall out of use for some strange reason, then grinding those high ehp will be a greater task than it is now, making them greater obstacles to flipping sov than intended. ccp would probably have to adjust their ehp manually every few years (as they actually just recently did, meddling with hit points and resistances to adapt to changes in the envi-ronment). with an si based on number and size of ships, the sovereignty buffer will, relatively speaking, always be the same. sov holders, sov attackers and obstacles to overcome to conquer a system will always be on the same terms.what else?here are some more details that came along while thinking about the idea:1.) sov holder should always get updates about changes, especially which alliances have deducted points from the indices, and can set automated notifications when certain absolute and/or relative changes occur. 2.) i am not sure if an attacker should be able to see the status of the sov holder's claim and how much more effort is needed to cancel the current si. 3.) station mechanics should stay as they are: difficult to conquer (reinforcement cycles) when belonging to sov holder, easy(ier) when not: in an unstable system, it is quite normal that you wake up and find that the guards are wearing a different uniform. 4.) ships near strategic locations, such as stations, stargates, and sov structures, could be more valuable, i.e. a bonus could be granted by being on grid with them (as in real life, securing strategic locations gives better control of the area). 5.) sov can still be transferred. the transferee gains the si from the transferring alliance, and since both are probably blue to each other, the si develops the same as if the former alliance still held sov. joint conquest and subsequent division of spoils are still possible. renting too, if it survives phoebe. 6.) there is no six. 7.) point counter values might spill over to neighbouring systems, so that a strong system could influence neighbouring systems' counter positively towards the regional hegemon. 8.) migration from the cur-rent mechanic could be done by giving the current sov holders a really high si in the systems they hold to start with under the new mechanic, so no systems will be lost quickly. but with a 1% decay every downtime, unused systems will become vulnerable relatively quickly. a completely unused system will lose half of its index within 69 days (if i am any good at maths<U+FFFD>). sov holding entities thus will have time to learn to respond to invasions, while at the same time serious attackers could relatively quickly gain the undefended systems. of course, a one- or two-month-stasis period for sov could accompany a change in the sov mechanic, in which indices already change, but sov re-mains until the end of the stasis period, giving all parties time to learn and adapt.i am certain there are important points i have missed. i am looking forward to reading any com-ments.i used to call this idea in earlier publications the tug-of-war with military spaceships:"
"so tl;dr is to encourage a roaming blob fleet in over the amount of time needed to take a system unless the system holder shows with a equal or greater blob fleet.also the dominion trailer already happens with systems come under siege and the local fleet pushes back the attackers and starts conducting repairs to stations and such, all the trailer is about is the enemy just shows up with a larger blob after the initial fleet was pushed back. incarna could have been an example of space collapsing as the military came through but the alliance was also driven broke by the traitor (or one seeking revenge).further more i believe if you had a fleet composing of multiple alliance as we have ingame in the big blue doughnut hence forth referred to bbd, how would the system know who is helping taking it back, who is helping in taking the system over instead of being pulled many directions?also what keeps a few people roaming into an empty system from taking it over just because they are there?i vote to keep it the way it is, because it isnt hard for those guys to replace a tcu."

"salutations and a good day to you,my name is radu lupescu and i am officially declaring my campaign for csm10. i have been a citizen of new eden for a couple years now and i've embraced almost every facet eve has to offer. be it intentionally, or inadvertently, i have been exposed to a full array of eve's choices and consequences and lived to tell the tale of some rather unique stories that tie in directly to eve's \"school of hard knocks\". like all of you, i started out very green. took me a while to figure out that a badger 1 isn't the best ship to mine in . but that same badger led to me accidentally becoming a hauler. as a hauler i worked hard to build a name that people could trust and had always made sure to run square deals and stay clean. over time... that will to do well and succeed was recognized by those around me, and especially my superiors. in retrospect it was all rather quick, but, i climbed and was led all the way from base member to director in two well-founded industrial corporations. i have held dual directorship ever since.i have had to problem-solve through all stages of my personal developments. and anyone who's ever been in corporate administration can tell you... there is a significant amount of problem solving up top. it took me a while to get used to the flow of helping run a manufacturing/research and development corporation and a logistics corporation as well, but, all in all i can say i've always given both every bit of honest dedication that i could and can. i have had to: - negotiate with other alliances and corporations- handle issues between my corporation and the customer- find problem areas and propose solutions- implement solutions- review and renovate old policies- craft industrial doctrines and policies- create departments- recruit- teach new playersall the while i have continued working, albeit more slowly, as a hauler. and under no circumstance did i forget where i started from or forget those that i've known since my beginning. because of this, as a director i have always done everything i could to listen to each and all members of my corporations. i careful analyzed all propositions and looked for any way to implement them if they seemed healthy for the corporation. and this entire wall of text ties in directly with why i'm running for csm10.i need to preface with saying that i have no personal qualms with the current or past csm's. i, as the rest of you, am aware that they've tried to do their duty faithfully and done everything they could to help the citizenry of new eden. for that they have my respect. looking at them one can see almost every demographic of eve being amply represented. but... there is a \"but\" though. and that rests with the voices of haulers. i know these voices well and i listen to them every single day. between the various hauler channels, anti-ganking channels, push interstellar industries channels, and local channels, i have read and discussed many concerns. most of them can be traced back to the feelings of, \"nobody cares what i think\" and \"ccp has no idea what living life as a hauler in new eden means\". every time i hear something like that i purse my brows. that is because something doesn't seem right there.now i'm not looking to take away the joys of gankers. obviously it's within the game mechanic and silence from the powers that be does equal consent. so i won't go there. what i am looking to do though is allow every voice in the hauling community to have equal say and representation to other csm members and ccp... directly. i also wish to review what can be done to even the scale between haulers and gankers. and i'll even add that miners could use some attention too. so their voices would be just as well heard to me. my number one goal though is for this gank targeted minority to be able to say they finally have a voice that they, the csm, and ccp can communicate with freely and openly. i realize that it may seem a small thing to some - but to me and them, i am sure, it is something major. given what i have previously stated about myself, and being a director at push industries, means that i am the right person for that job. all i want is the chance to influence and help whatever ideas and positive changes, however small, come to life. also, rest assured, if i feel i have done a poor job of it i will not run for an additional term. further though i would at least expect to not be voted in again. but i feel that if i am elected to be a csm10, as i've outline, good things will follow.thank you kindly for reading and for you consideration ,fly safely,radu lupescu"

"it's not like he's going anywhere.i'd prefer if ccp had a fatigue timer on running and the sort of public transportation options that any huge, sprawling airport offers, so that you don't have to walk or run everywhere if you don't want to. trains are faster anyway, and the equivalent in the far future should be awesome.one of the major irritants for me in any avatar-based mmo is the overcaffeinated jumping-bean guy making a joke of himself because he can't take 10 extra seconds to reach a location--something that's not really helped by the fact that you're expected to get everywhere on foot. but then, i'm the guy who actually turns on the walk option and looks around.and on that note, rather than running everywhere, i'd like to have much more customization of gait and posture. the current everyone-is-a-runway-model default is fine for what it is, but a whole station of runway models is going to look strange."
"i have searched the forums but couldn't find anything from ccp with regards to feedback about the industry teams sniping mechanic they released. (aka team auctions) *updated to clarify for people that can't read apparently think this is for contract item auctions*the current team auction system is terribad, not even an auction really, if you happen to be the current auction leader, the mechanic is such that you are nearly expected to try to snipe your own bid at the last second even if you are winning. then it just becomes a guessing game of blindly throwing money at the auction when you have no idea how much money the other people trying to snipe the auction are bidding.and mostly because this just happened to me, i was even doing my due diligence and staying up a few minutes late to make sure i won the industry team auction. refreshed the screen with like a couple sec to go, nothing changes, auction ends and the email says i lost... but the screen was just showing i was winning. next time i will take a screenshot at the 1s mark. i know, i made the classic mistake of assuming this was an \"auction\" and actually bidding on it instead of just waiting and playing the snipe game.this team auction system is a mess and needs to be changed. add a timer to the auction after the last bid so that the system can show everyone else interested that they just are no longer winning and have a chance to respond, instead of the screen showing they are winning until they see the email saying they lost instead. or since the snipe game is just a very shortened private/sealed silent auction then just make it full out silent sealed auction. either solution would be better than what is currently in place. this has come up in real life countless times, it is not a new issue, and by no means a new solution. implementing this with the design flaw that allows/encourages sniping is a mark of either bad qa, inattentiveness to requested feedback, or complete lack of regard for feedback even after release.but please get this fixed.also: we need a true \"max bid\" value put in, so we can tell the system to put a bid in, and auto bid any other bids on that team until x amount, you know, like every other auction system in existence today."
"take it you dont do ebay auctions? its just as bad there with sniping just before it ends.also the the pings dont hit all computers at once because when someone jumps through a gate or undocks/docks i cant insta lock them meanwhile if i do the same i get instalocked between a cloak dropping as my ship is towed into station"
"if you want to say this is exactly like ebay, well its not. ebay has a max bid feature, this doesn't. the max bid feature helps prevent those last minute snipes as if you try to just penny war the last bid at the last millisecond but the other guy's max bid is infact much higher than the current highest bid, you still lose.good try though, but please do some more homework. and server ticks aren't in question here, the foundation of the auction system is, please stay on topic."
"that's because people would go in debt bidding on an item or someone would over inflate the itemonly bid on auctions with a buy out so if you feel you can't win the bid, then buy it out or just buy from the marketor adapt to the eve mantranot every little thing needs changin"
"you talking about talking about industry team auctions or item contract auctions?pretty sure the first sentence of the original post says team auctions... but your last post about inflating item pricing? and you can't go into debt in eve, the system protects against it unfortunately (well you can if you are bad and ccp takes away your iskies).and team auctions don't have a buy out, so again, please follow the good old eve mantra and read and do your homework."
"surprised this hasn't come up sooner, but what are the chances for some of us active characters to have a shot at renaming ourselves to remove whatever extra filler we had to put on our names because the core name was taken 8 yrs ago but has zero history?

"hi everyone.so you have all noticed that prices are getting abit on the ridiculous side 1 billion isk in jita currently as of this post.now not every person in eve can afford that each month and have isk to spend on doing their own little thing. i have spoken to 100 people plus. and 80% of them agree with me that prices are forcing people to either spend real money via subscription or going to various websites to get 's, now obviously this doesnt effect the people in eve that are established and making multi billions of isk a month. to them i say this doesnt really apply to you.but at one point in the game when you thought prices were hard to reach and it sucked. alot of people i have met on my travel's in eve and i have spoken to have either already or are going to leave multiple accounts to go offline until prices level out at something more reasonable. my idea will upset a massive number of people who thrive on selling 's and selling isk out of game (you know who you are) but ccp seed 's in every market hub at say 500mil each with a unlimited amount so they cannot all be bought out and the same situation happens again or put say 5000 in each market hub and every week rest the buy order to a default quantity of say 5000 to stop people buying them all and making isk which in turn is forcing some players in eve to stop playing and move on. if this was implemented i am 100% sure that people would come back to the game, reactivate accounts create new accounts etc and ccp would in turn make more money from it and more and more people could enjoy the game.i know full well im going to get alot of hate for this post but im not bothered im only speaking for a vast number of people in game or out of game that have left. prices need to be fixed at a reasonable price or people will continue to leave it. fly safe all and start the hatemail ;po7"

"o look this thread again."
"i can afford the 1 bil a month for both my accounts i am just simply highlighting a common topic discussed in eve and a effect that the prices are having on the actual players the people who bring money in for ccp.its not in my interest to cry and moan about such a thing as i do market trading myself but i still believe that as not everyone can afford 1 billion a month or spend all month just to get it to restart again out of all the things that people control on the market shouldn't be one of them."
"the problem with these threads is it the same thing everytime. make a solution for ccp and how to approach the issue. oppose to complaining about it. also this is more of a feedback and ideas thread than anything."
"ccp has repeatedly said that they will not directly manipulate the price of on the market. if they feel the price is changing too rapidly, they will act to control that rate of change, but not the actual prices themselves.personally i just converted my last account over to $$ and am selling off my stored for isk. this thread has degenerated to the point it's become like two bald men fighting over a comb. -- doc fury"
"i would like to make a suggestion about station containers. i currently have 15 containers which the majority is comprised of station containers with smaller for blueprints and some 0.01m3 items. i would like to know if it is possible to put a container in a station container? if it is not i would like to make the following suggestion.allow us to organize station containers and above so lets say 1,000,000.0 m3+ with sections. in real life that is a lot of storage space and a normal person would divide and store things in designated sections (i.e. warehouse) of varying sizes. wouldn't it be just as feasible to be able to set a limited amount of sections in game? it would create better usability in the game play and storage of items, especially with some items being bigger then others and being able to adjust the sizes of the sections to fit our needs each section would be adjustable with a max number of sections of lets say...10. so lets say 10 x sections = 1,000,000.0 m3 or 8 x sections =800,000.0 m3 + 1 section = 200,000.0 m3. something like this would be really useful and handy or just make a range of specific containers that can be stored in an assembled station container. 25,000 | 50,000 | 75,000 | 100,000 | 250,000 and the only place they can be placed, is in \"station\" labeled containers and only if the \"station\" labeled container is assembled. something like this would be greatly useful and accepted by many so that i could condense my long list of containers into just 3-6 station containers and at a minimum of 4 containers in a subsection of that container. i am not a programmer but i can see one of these options at least somewhat feasible in some manner and would win the hearts of many in new eden."

"good evening,unfortunately for me, the campaigning season is opening at the same time as my job is getting busy (run-up to christmas). despite that, i will read every response to my thread... and i will be prepared to answer questions/interviews.is there room for a on the csm? someone that has the well-being of the multitude of high sec pilots at heart?i would like there to be a \"high sec\" platform, for a candidate for the csm. if no one else wants to step up to the plate, then i will. if someone else wants to run for csm for the benefit of high sec gameplay, then i am happy to step down and support them... if they can do a better job.the problem with high sec space is that the players there are all independent. there is no feeling of \"we\". this lack of \"we\" is a problem. the lack of \"we all stand together\" is a problem. the \"apathy of the carebear\" is a problem...this i know. i know that, although numerically high sec has the largest number of log-ins... accounts... players... i know that high sec will probably never be able to gather together enough in order to support a csm candidate. but that is no reason to not try!!come on, high sec! if something is important for you, stand up for it!!!who am i?you have never heard of me. i am a high sec carebear. i am a high sec carebear, and proud of it!high sec carebears tend not to socialize too much, and are only members of npc or small corporations.well, this is not the first character i have created in order to play \"eve\". i have never been a member of a big alliance or coalition. i have never been a member of a big corporation. hell, i have never left high sec space.i gained my love of spaceship games by playing elite... way back on my zx spectrum 48k+ (with a jammed shift key (jammed as in... raspberry jam)). back then it was possible to try docking with a space station and to accidentally line up with the back of the station... and die whilst trying to fly through the back of the station to the entrance. fun times . i graduated to frontier: elite ii on a 486 pc, and spent my time happily flying between barnard's star, sol, and wolf 359. i should have been studying, but flying a (mostly harmless) panther fully loaded with robots was more fun.i kept my eyes open for an online version of a space-sim... and that is where eve comes in.i really enjoy (as in \"really\") flying transports, fulfilling contracts, and, sometimes, mining.what would be my platform:1) high sec is worth fighting for!i want to do what i want to do. i do not want to be a part of massive 1000 ship fleets. i just want to transport stuff, and occasionally mine things. maybe a mission or two. is that too much to ask?griefers, gankers, bumpers, \"content creators\" stop me having my fun, and stop me wanting to play. gankers have been nerfed and carebears have been buffed in the past... but despite everything there is still no \"balance\". if i have to expose my mining/transporting self to the wild and evil whims of others, then i would like to be able to have (at least) a 50:50 chance of winning. at the moment it is not so... this needs changing! you say that you are \"creating content\", but i dont't want your content! i am creating my own content happily flying my freighter/retriever around!2) banhammer!somewhen back in september, a number of players belonging to a griefer community were banned from playing eve. according to what i have read on the interweb, and according to what csm member \"funkybacon\" said on his blog... the banned players never got told what they were banned for! i am all for aggressive banning of griefers and harrassers by ccp, but i feel that anyone that pays for an account deserves to know for what they get banned... especially if they have paid-for ($$) game time still running. on the other side, i feel that having a public list of banned players, and crimes (name and shame!!) would also provide assistance for other players (esp. high sec players), in knowing who to avoid!the central register entry could look something like this:\"player xx, banned for x weeks, for: harassment\"of course, if it is true, that the same \"gm\" that made the ban is also handling the \"appeal\" then this also needs changing.3) new player experiencethe new player experience also needs work, and it needs people (on the csm) that are focussing on it, and representing the needs of the \"new player\". if eve is to continue to grow and develop, (and exist) then new players are of vital importance. i know that ccp have already said that they are working on this... but it should not be allowed to again fall into the background (as it has clearly already done... judging by the state of the npe as i started).4) wardecs.the war dec mechanic is broken. there have already been talks/suggestions about enabling player groups that are not eligible for \"war deccing\" but also not eligible to put up pos or pocos.... this is a central theme to new player retention, and not to be ignored. i am sure that there are many issues that are burning for someone that wants to represent the high sec player base. i am sure that you have enough ideas of other things that need to be said (the above are only the things that are burning for me). if the normal, apathetic high sec resident can get off his/her lazy butt and be bothered to vote, then we can have a voice. it doesn't have to be me.... but someone has to do something... somewhen... for the good of some people!i am also quite prepared to represent/push issues that other high sec carebears have, even if i have not mentioned them above. i think it is all-important that high sec gathers behind a candidate... (even if it is not me) so that our interests do not get swept under the table by the massed/organised nullsec coalitions.thank you,lorelei"
"hello admiral root,pleased to meet you. you say, \"... speaking up for us...\", and as such i take it you are therefore a member of the ganking culture? besides industrialists and societal elites i always enjoy my talks with gankers too because they seem to have a unique perspective. so i'm very thankful for your post.but let's get to the crux of what you said, shall we? if the balance is uneven, one way or another, i believe there should some form of fair equilibrium. so let us look at this more carefully while maintaining an academic objectivity:\"given that ganking has received a string of nerfs over the years without ever receiving a buff...\" you said. i'm somewhat puzzled by this statement. would you please list what nerfs have effected gankers and how? given i'm not aware of them, as i've paid heavy attention to the mechanics that victims have to deal with more, i yield to your knowledge of the nerfs and hope to see how they have slowed down the ganking culture. from there, if possible, i'm sure a somewhat definitive conclusion may be drawn. this is a very important point that you bring up so i hope to address this with you first, admiral root, before discussing further the second half of your statement, \"... tools available to...\".looking forward to your reply, & cheers,~ radu lupescu"
"radu, off-hand, i would say that root is referring to the mining barge and exhumer buffs that came along with crimewatch in the retribution era, and this year we have seen freighter buffs in june, and something called a higgs rig that was just introduced. all of these increase the challenge of ganking. however, we do feel the changes have been rather one sided."
"there's also the decreased concord response time, the sudden declaration of boomeranging being an exploit (hardly the first time ccp has flip-flopped), the insurance nerf, gcc preventing pilots from ejecting / boarding ships and, i'm told, the fact that you used to be able and allowed to evade concord, to name a few. there are nerfs going back years and years, with not a single specific ganking buff, nor a single nerf to the safety of carebears.if you truly want balance there needs to be give and take, not an inexorable march to perfect safety with one more nerf(tm)."
"hello amyclas amatin,i am pleased to also meet you, thank you for joining in. and thank you for your reply, admiral root.i'll begin by making sure my initial statement remains clear here because it seems to be getting lost. in my initial post i stated: (emphasis added)examination of examplesplease keep the following statement and question in mind as we proceed: what was the balance before and where is it now? the underlying question to that question being: is the balance between gankers and their victims even? you bring up points that are more tangible. below i restate them and add comments and or questions:\"... mining barge and exhumer buffs...\"- i have to ask, is it possible that ccp did this because the balance between ganker offensive ability superseded miner defensibility? > if \"yes\", then the next question is: is it now even scale? > if \"no\", then the next question is: why do you believe ccp brought on the change?\"... and this year we have seen freighter buffs in june...\"- again, is it possible that ccp did this because the balance between ganker offensive ability superseded hauler defensibility? > if \"yes\", then the next question is: is it now even scale? > if \"no\", then the next question is: why do you believe ccp brought on the change? \"... came along with crimewatch...\"- crimewatch is rather straightforward regarding what it is. it is first and foremost a documenting system for other players and ccp. as stated by ccp masterplan.\"... there's also the decreased concord response time...\"- is a decrease in concord response time not of benefit to gankers? if not, please explain.\"... the sudden declaration of boomeranging being an exploit (hardly the first time ccp has flip-flopped)...\"- as i understand it, gankers use this so as to draw concord away from a ship being ganked. do they not?\"... gcc preventing pilots from ejecting / boarding ships and, i'm told, the fact that you used to be able and allowed to evade concord, to name a few.\"- how exactly does this hinder gankers? \"... the insurance nerf... \"- i'm not as familiar with this one. could you describe it for me please? and could you also explain how this goes against gankers?\"... if you truly want balance there needs to be give and take.\"- one question (multifaceted) and one statement here: > can a freighter or hauling ship destroy a fighting ship? also, out of curiosity, how or why not? -- purely for fun of thought, would it not add more interesting content to the game if a freighter could destroy a fighting ship? > if a balance is too one sided, as demonstrated with rl liberation movements (it's just an example), then there is usually a lot of taking from one end so as to give to the other. so no, you don't always have or need equal give-and-take to get balance.\"... nor a single nerf to the safety of carebears.\"- are you suggesting that carebears are too safe and therefore that safety should be nerfed?\"... there are nerfs going back years and years... \"- two questions here: > when exactly did it begin? > why did it begin?all in all, besides insurance, none of these are \"nerfs\" in the traditional sense of the term. and this is not me \"picking at hairs\", mind you. given that ganking plights have been brought up, i am listening very carefully to understand the practical and exact nature of said plights. that said, nerfs remain undefined, for the moment. and every question asked is directly pertinent to the attempt of providing total clarity to the subject at hand. only with that can we then begin looking for exact solutions.looking forward to your reply,~ radu lupescu"
"quickly:decreased concord response time means concord responds more quickly, which means more ships (or more waves of ships) are needed to execute a gank;the insurance nerf refers to a change where there's no insurance payout for a ship lost to concord. previously, you did get your insurance payout if concord blew you up;while you have concord's attention, they will now blow up any ship you get into. for example, if you gank a bowhead, pull a fitted ship out of the wreck and board it, concord will blow that ship up, too;the crimewatch revision streamlined things significantly, which eliminated a number of loopholes that gankers had used to great effect, such as having logistics ships get flagged in the middle of an incursion site--as i understand it, being repped by a flagged ship flagged the ship getting reps, so concord would basically show up and blow up a significant amount of the fleet if you did it right. under the new crimewatch, flags don't propagate anymore;you used to be able to tank concord, some years back;edit: you used to be able to outrun concord. that's what boomeranging is. essentially, you gank something relatively flimsy, like a barge, then warp to your next target before concord spawns on that grid, then gank something there, then warp off before concord spawns, etc., for as long as you have targets. now, it's an exploit to leave grid after you've done something to summon concord.there are industrials with various levels of combat capability, from cheap ones like the venture, the nereus and the badger to giants like the rorqual. one of the pilots in my old corp blew up a stealth bomber with a retriever in a wh once. they can't stop any serious effort.there have been buffs which have benefited gankers: the blaster catalyst was buffed from a joke into a face-melting short-range dps platform no fewer than three times in the last three-odd years. the tornado and the talos were introduced. the brutix was buffed into a monster during the bc rebalance. the freighter buff improved their fitting variability, not necessarily their gank resistance. i suppose you could look at the general nerf to cargo capacity as a ganking nerf, but that's stretching it.i don't have a strong position either way--i have ganked (though not in high sec), but i wouldn't call myself a ganker; i have flown industrials, but i wouldn't call myself an industrial pilot--but that's a reasonable start on the state of things."
"anyone with any sense does not use that and still does that last second bid anyway. i was stung once using the max bid feature, never again. in eve many would bid up their own item as they do on ebay, so bad idea.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
"maybe you didn't read either.... \"bid up their own item\"? why exactly would you do that on an industry team auction?so i'll say it again, this is for the industry team auctions, not item contract auctions."
"well, buying with your rl money then selling it on the market is practically rmting. you just used rl money to acquire in-game currency. that's what the raw definition of rmt is."
"that and reversing the flow which as i understand was attempted by another group"

"i'm interested in how you think you would be able to represent highsec when you clearly have no desire to represent some highsec players, specifically gankers, bumpers and other content creators? also, do you think your inability to distinguish bad guys (griefers) from good guys (gankers, bumpers and content creators) would impair your judgement?"
"hey! i even got a response.of course, it was not from a care bear... because we care bears don't normally respond to things like this!sorry for the wall of text. i am new to things like this.surprisingly good question! i expect that the ganker/griefer/content creating community would support psychotic monk, dj funkybacon or someone similar. i am not \"anti-ganker\" (in the sense that i want to completely stop suicide ganking. bumping has been ruled legitimate by ccp, and posted about on these forums). i am pro-carebear. there are a large number of people like me that do not want to be ganked, are not interested in the content that other players are proud of producing, and still want to play spaceship games. eve is, however, a sandbox, and ccp have (in the main) come out in support of \"emergent gameplay\". this is something we carebears will have to learn to live with, and learn to work around, if we want to keep playing spaceship games. like i said in my initial post: i want at least a 50:50 chance of winning!(i would say that my stance on \"bans\" and a clear commentary from ccp about them is something that would interest the content creating community. staying on top of the new player experience is also something that everyone could appreciate.) but let me try saying this, (and see if anyone talks to me afterwards)...the large number of independent carebears making \"tear threads\" on the forums, and lobbying ccp to nerf all high sec game play down to nothing has lead to a large amount of non-connected actions from ccp (eg. concord buffs, bounties, mining barge boosts, low slots on freighters etc) all of which give us carebears \"tools\" with which to defend ourselves from aggressors... but no real plan. concord is broken! if a suicide ganker pre-pulls concord in a system (by shooting a poco in a rookie ship) then they get more time to do damage on their target, before concord warps in.however... if a miner pre-pulls concord in an asteroid belt, but having an alt in a rookie ship fire one shot at their mining vessel... then this is potentially a bannable offense. ccp should level the playing field here.... and either allow (or disallow) concord manipulation on all sides. (after all, organised gankers could pull concord out of the asteroids just before ganking... and awake and aware miners could see concord disappearing from their belts, and warp off or react in time. allowing the concord mechanic to be used by both sides is fair. if the gankers don't pre pull concord, then it is their own fault. and under this system, if the miners don't pre-pull concord, then that is their own fault too.bounties are broken.that page that new players can look at, the one about the different \"careers\" in eve, says something about \"bounty hunter\". what if one could register oneself as a \"bounty hunter\" (for a fee), and then, as a registered \"bounty hunter\" could claim more than the current joke-percent of a bounty? let me say, as i was considering if it was worth my time at all writing here, i read through a lot of james 315's minerbumping blog. the language used by some of my carebear cousins is unfortunate and shocking.i do not think i have an inability (greater than anyone else) to distinguish between griefers and good guys. i can see how you might infer that from my comments above.for example: one reason i want to have more transparency with the banhammer, is to clearly define what separates a griefer and a ganker (for example). if i get ganked 10 times in one day by the same person whilst mining in the same asteroid belt, using the same bookmarks... am i getting griefed or ganked? if i get ganked 10 times in the same day by the same person whilst moving between 10 different systems to try and get away... am i being griefed or ganked? dj funkybacon wrote a very nice post after the banhammer... where is the line? at what point am i being griefed?? how do you define \"griefing\"? how does anyone define \"griefing\" (once they get past the \"my shiny ship got killed\" tear posts)?? i cant imagine that it is much fun for a \"cutting edge\" content creator to not know if he is somewhen going to get banned for crossing some imaginary line!"

"thank you!when do we get to know if you are running again?!?!hi zappity!thank you for contributing to my thread.as you can see above... mr azariah says he \"may run again\".whether or not a \"knows\" about mr azariah... until now there has been no definite declaration of \"running again\".if you wanted to ask: \"how can someone not know that mike azariah is the candidate for high sec\" then the answer would be:he has not yet said that he is \"running again\".if you have any questions about what i stand for... or about something i have said, then please feel free to ask!i read every post, and if they are not obvious trolls i respond! :d"
"sure. i was just responding to the tone of your op which seemed ignorant of the fact that there was already such representation. eg:um, yes, there is. although it is ironic that much of mike's support probably comes from outside highsec.out of interest, have you read the minutes?"
"tl;dr versioncontrary to my first post, i don't actually intend to represent all high-sec players, only those players who conform to my belief of what a high-sec player should be."
"translationi have no clue who or what mike azariah is. is it animal, vegetable, or mineral?"
"the tone of my op was selected for a reason. yes. i read the minutes of the last csm, every page... even the ones that were heavily censored due to nda.do you have a question about them?"
"um.... thank you for trying to summarise my walls of text. i know i need to improve on them.but i don't think you did it correctly. if you have any questions for clarification, or anything you want to discuss, please feel free to post again.ok.i am not interested in splitting \"high sec\" votes. mike has not yet said that he is running again... as you can see from his post above. is he going to declare for csm 10? only time will tell... but even if he does... trying to mobilise the high sec people a bit... well that's not bad! ;)"
"it's worth noting that none of the buffs mentioned by the honourable undesireable gentleman were introduced as buffs to ganking, gankers just picked up some side benefits of those changes. nerfs to ganking, however, were specifically introduced as nerfs to ganking. personally, i think it was pretty silly that we could get insurance on gank ships, but that's far from the only attack on our play style we've seen over the years. now, either ccp are horribly inept at balancing the situation, given that 11 years later they still haven't got it right, or they're increasingly catering to the one more nerf crowd, who think afk mining whilst watching netflix or even doing non-computer things should be perfectly safe to do.it's worth noting that almost every time i pull stats for the same 3 ganking hotspots (uedama, niarja and jita), there's well under 1% chance of ships dying for any reason that the api tracks (wardecs, duels, going suspect, ganks, losses to npcs, etc), even when the new order is swinging the gank hammer at everything that moves.out of interest, if the anti-ganking people (who are frequently vulgar, make rl death threats, etc) want to feel someone on the csm is listening to them, have they actually tried talking to existing reps? if so, how about they share the chat logs?the exact same thing could be said about ccp having no idea about ganking - more so, because while their employees are allowed to go space trucking, they're explicitly banned from taking part in suicide ganking.i've got no particular axe to grind with the op, though i wonder what his less rational, more vocal constituents will think of him the first time someone gets ganked after he's elected?"
"hello dersen lowery,thank you for bringing more exact details to the discussion. i'll have to think about those points a little more before addressing them. admiral root seems quite persistent though so i will address his first. i hope you don't mind.looking forward to speaking more with you though.-----admiral root,as said many times before by current and former csm members, the csm cannot make ccp do anything. and i should hate to imagine you are not attentively reading what i have said thus far, considering that you brought up the topic, or are evading the subject. if i am elected i cannot stop ganking. to imagine as much is naive. but i can represent a body of legitimate playstyle that has ships, missions, is the circulatory system of the economy, doesn't get shot down by concord for doing what they love, and is a staple of eve. i can represent the people that spend countless hours moving an unfathomable amount of m3 because it is what they love and they take pride in keeping eve going. and i can be their voice to other csm members and ccp - and loyal to them in all my decision making because i am one of them and wish to see them fair well. haulers, miners, traders, and all manner of carebear who have been ganked have rights too. and rest assured that i fully intend to do all i can to help them play, as they see fit, in peace, sir. they have in some form or fashion paid to be citizens of new eden and they deserve a direct link to ccp.there is currently an extremist tide growing in high sec. it is a group who wish to force their own version of eve upon the rest and they are attempting to subject the most defenseless group in new eden to their will so as to prove their point. they are around us every day. they blend in to look normal until they are called to kill themselves on behalf of their leaders' cause and will. and currently they have the advantage. i suspected the scale was weighted towards them holding more power before, but now, i'm starting to believe that suspicion is well founded.vs- that means that gankers have benefited. and your chicanery and dismissal does not change the fact.can you please, for once, tell me... admiral root... how is it that ganking is harder than being a miner or hauler? this is essentially a derivative of the question, where does the scale weigh heaviest?and i'll add a series of questions for you to answer as well, given you seem an authority on the matter.*how much time does it take to train a ganker?*how long does it take to pull off a successful gank.. on average? - how long until you can gank again after that?*how long can a freighter be bumped until a game mechanic intervenes?*have gankers been biomassed and new ones made? if so, why?*and why should ccp recognize ganking as a legitimate gameplay? *and further still, and i believe you'll like this one, why doesn't a ganker run for the csm if ganking has been handled so unjustly? - haulers and the like need a voice, hence my standing up. why don't one of your own do the same? - and, please know, i look forward to seeing that candidate stand up and make herself or himself known.logic, reason, facts, details, careful examination... those are things that i hold quite dear. and i hope the academic nature of this discourse may continue as such and that the plain truth of the matter may be fully revealed and further examined. i am here to be a voice for my constituents and this is an example of that voice speaking. regards,~ radu lupescu"
"hello dersen lowery,once again i thank you for the much more detailed picture. i'll reply through your initial post in bullet format.\"quickly:decreased concord response time means concord responds more quickly, which means more ships (or more waves of ships) are needed to execute a gank;\"> given that it is a criminal enterprise i believe that to have this kind of response is called for. the premise being that we're in a future where we can travel entire solar systems in a flash should lend itself to information traveling even more quickly, so this makes sense.\"the insurance nerf refers to a change where there's no insurance payout for a ship lost to concord. previously, you did get your insurance payout if concord blew you up;\"> it also makes sense that the empires, who founded concord and preside over insurance companies, would not want criminals reaping the reward of insurance claims based on criminal actions.\"while you have concord's attention, they will now blow up any ship you get into. for example, if you gank a bowhead, pull a fitted ship out of the wreck and board it, concord will blow that ship up, too;\"> concord is obviously not intended to be a mindless drone but one that is capable of spotting a criminal in all forms of his actions. their getting administered justice, as with the bowhead example, makes sense.\"the crimewatch revision streamlined things significantly, which eliminated a number of loopholes that gankers had used to great effect, such as having logistics ships get flagged in the middle of an incursion site--as i understand it, being repped by a flagged ship flagged the ship getting reps, so concord would basically show up and blow up a significant amount of the fleet if you did it right. under the new crimewatch, flags don't propagate anymore;\"> this also seems a logical system. if the scale is to be balanced then i believe all loopholes should be closed so as to keep things even/fair.\"you used to be able to tank concord, some years back;\"> we have rl examples of police and their vehicles using as much sophistication as possible so as to be able to outmatch criminals. it makes sense then that in an intergalactic age you would get something similar, if not even more so.\"edit: you used to be able to outrun concord. that's what boomeranging is. essentially, you gank something relatively flimsy, like a barge, then warp to your next target before concord spawns on that grid, then gank something there, then warp off before concord spawns, etc., for as long as you have targets. now, it's an exploit to leave grid after you've done something to summon concord.\"> i wasn't entirely aware of this before now. i'm glad it's cleaned up though. what i'm left wondering about now is, i hear that concord can be drawn far away from a future gank victim by another ganker using a rookie ship to pull them away to the other side of the system. i'm curious what can be done to correct what appears to be a loophole.\"there are industrials with various levels of combat capability, from cheap ones like the venture, the nereus and the badger to giants like the rorqual. one of the pilots in my old corp blew up a stealth bomber with a retriever in a wh once. they can't stop any serious effort.\"> i knew before this that you can put a gun on a badger and other indie ships but their effectiveness is rather moot against \"a serious effort\". my somewhat playful question is if a truly effective mod can be placed on indie ships where their attacking power is taken far more seriously. i'm obviously not entirely sold on the idea but i'm curious what the ramifications would be.\"there have been buffs which have benefited gankers: the blaster catalyst was buffed from a joke into a face-melting short-range dps platform no fewer than three times in the last three-odd years. the tornado and the talos were introduced. the brutix was buffed into a monster during the bc rebalance. the freighter buff improved their fitting variability, not necessarily their gank resistance. i suppose you could look at the general nerf to cargo capacity as a ganking nerf, but that's stretching it.\"> now these are some points that i find of particular interest. that is because the catalyst seems to be the ganker's ship of choice but i've heard of talos fleets as well. now i see why. - given all you said, besides adding an additional step in the ganking process i don't see it being slowed down or hindered in any sort of way. rather i see logic and reason being implemented where a series of loopholes once existed. i'm curious as to how many more loopholes exist and if there are other system being abused gankers.\"i don't have a strong position either way--i have ganked (though not in high sec), but i wouldn't call myself a ganker; i have flown industrials, but i wouldn't call myself an industrial pilot--but that's a reasonable start on the state of things.\"> again, i'm very glad you gave a clearer \"state of things\". i can see a lot more productive conversation stemming from it. regards,~ radu lupescu"
"i remember saying two years ago, that the reason high-sec now deals with only fanatics is because it has become extremely difficult from anyone to make a profit from suicide ganking. before you would have multiple casual groups killing a hauler here and there just to see what drops, and maybe make a killing from it. now only the new order and the clusterfuck coalition, who are working together for numbers, have the level of organization to gank sustainably. (and all day long, without stopping to recover costs) the \"extremism\" and toxicity the community faces, in my opinion, come as a result of forcing your average pirate out of business, and you are left with fanatics who gank as a matter of passion and ideology of \"how the game should be played\".a playing field that makes it nearly impossible for smaller casual groups of high-sec pirates to gank will result in only highly organized groups remaining on the board. what you currently face is simply malcanis' law all over again.i have no complaints about actual ganking mechanics, we have always taken them into our stride and adapted our organizations to them. though it seems to me that the mechanics are secondary, what high-sec wants is safety, for the gankings to stop. i dare say the haulers will never be satisfied until they are actually safe.the real issue is that the gankers want your goods and income to be vulnerable to assault. should it take a small army of volunteers drawn from a 50 thousand character coalition just to sink a heavily tanked freighter? when that is the case, your political and social situation becomes high-sec vs the cfc. game mechanics wise, \"one more ehp buff\" will not save any freighter, the new order and the cfc have the political clout and resources to conscript one more dps pilot, one more bumper, one more scout, one more spy, faster than you can say \"change the game mechanics\".on the other hand, i know that hauling is probably one of the most boring jobs in the world, though it is a necessary one. coming from me, i would still cringe to see them asking to be able to fly solo safely. one of the best scenarios would be for haulers to recognize and adapt to the dangers of flying in space - which should go beyond fitting a tank and going afk. your average well-adapted hauler uses cloaks, scouts, exit cynos, spies, and every tool at their disposal. and when people have to drive freighters through places like null-sec, escort fleets are an item, as well as wormholes.i look forward to hearing more of your thoughts on this issue and hope to blow up more of your stuff."
"first of all i'd like to congratulate radu on stepping up and wish him all the best for his campaign.i admit i was a bit surprised that the discussion went right into high-sec ganking as logistics is a topic that for once actually isn't exclusive for any particular security area in eve. its one of the major topics that intertwines so heavily with almost every other activitiy in eve that it's good to see someone taking a step for more representation of it.i am not following the statement of 'fanatics' when it comes to the big organized groups of gankers - all that is just the marketing aspect to sell it well enough to others. every major ops in eve has and will always be fuelled by economical ideas and profits. as long as a certain group will control the 'gank market' it will also control blue-fees and who passes through and who not. face it - this is about large scale market influence and control - not about a philosophy how to play the game. the common pilot in that group might like to blow up things - but the minds behind the overall ops are interested in protecting their own market shares and income primarily.i do agree a lot to the argument though that it has put a entire group of players out of business - the 'original' pirates who would pose a threat on a decent level that could be dealt with equally for both involved parties. and they made the game fun and interesting after all because you had at least 2 choices how to deal with them: buckle up and arm yourself well enough or avoidance of them. the current state of ganking basically leaves only one option: avoidance. so why this change? its not the mechanics - they have not changed that heavily at all when we look honestly at it. its the players level of knowledge that has changed, the acceptance for other player groups and the understanding (or the lack of it) of how much time goes into something. hauling aka logistics is a time intensive process - as is mining and every other industry related activity. a gank just takes a few minutes especially when its setup around a major trade hub where refits are easily accessible - a standard hauling trip easily takes 30 minutes to an hour. so we are looking at a time used ratio of 1:3 here.why is this important as an argument? because its player time - real world time used. not some artificial currency but real value. as calculating isk per hour has become very popular and more and more dominant in players decision process what to choose as activity in eve. the skill investment to fly those levels of industrials plus the time for each trip != the payment at all for a common hauler pilot in eve. ccp has over the years introduced more and more content and abilities to play eve solo - but that doesn't account for industrial pilots. quite the contrary with the current state of ganking.i have stated this in other threads as well - the current mechanics for high sec don't really reflect properly how the empires should react to those kinds of activities in their space. concord right now only reacts - which is great and shouldn't change. but additional standing losses like podding and aggression in low sec should be seriously on the list for high-sec.i do not want a 'safe' high sec - but i want a high sec that acts and performs like i would expect it to do when looking at lore and story. i expect to be evicted after several attempts of robbery , theft and aggression. i want corporations to hate me when i blow things up in their controlled systems - because i scare away their customers."
"dwissi, offhand i'd say you grossly under-estimate the effort and opportunity costs that go into a gank.if you are especially worth ganking, we were probably stalking you since you hit undock, most likely from the trade hubs, with a bunch of neutral alts with passive targetters. your trip in space would be as long as ours.then the logistics of ganking are a thing of itself. sometimes it is outsourced to other haulers, most of the time someone in-house has to grab a freighter and do it themselves.then for the actual manpower of the gank, it is probably a matter of forming up, getting all the timing and coordination together, and then pushing f1. we have to hold you down first, of course. gank fcs are heroes among men. it isn't a time ratio of 3:1. for most of the time the dps spends docked, we are scanning, scouting, stalking, setting up bumps. i've once tornado ganked without bumpers, 8 of us spent 3 hours stalking one 6 billion isk raven, just to warp in, push f1, and make it explode. and then the loot payment came out to something like 25 mil per man. that was probably the last time i ganked with a *small* casual group.on the freighter-scale, chasing down a specific freighter is a crazy hunt from one end of high-sec to the other. you undock with something valuable, everything chases you. it can be rather stressful to be honest."
"hello all,very interesting last few points here. nice to meet you, dwissi. and thank you for joining.amyclas amatin,i must admit, the initial effects of your latest post were quite profound. it combines history, with logic, and addresses reasons. it also draws a natural conclusion. all in all it affirmed a past, current, and future state of things. but after reflecting on it further my mental faculties caught up with me and i realized why there is great fault in your conclusions. you see, irl i'm currently pursuing a masters degree of military history. so whenever i have the opportunity to reflect on history's teachings regarding military based matters, be they the \"artificial\" history of a video game or fiction - or be it rl history, i ask myself \"what is the pattern?\". so although your assessment of the past and current affairs are quite astute, there is flaw in the future you depict. i'll start with a short digression here by saying something that i've wanted to say since the beginning, it is in accord with what you and dwissi have said too. i feel incredibly bad for pirates these days. not that they'd want such sympathy . but i must agree, there was something honorable about piracy and you did have a more clearly defined choice with them, as dwissi pointed out - not the one-sided-ness seen today. i wish to also add that ccp endorsed this class and clearly has a problem of keeping it alive in light of gankers. that is likely harder to resolve than balancing the scale between ganker and gank-victim. with that said, let's go on.according a may 14th, 2013 daily nexus article [an online newspaper by the university of california (santa barbara)] eve online saw a peek in subscriptions, that year, sitting at 500,000. you claim that the cfc has some 50,000 members. code has, according to its membership list of their in-game corporation attributes (8+88+1+164+1+2+24+1 equaling ->) 289 members. and both parties recognize that they are well allied with one another therefore the numbers are as well. none of this takes alts into account but for the sake of keeping the numbers clear we have to pretend they don't exist. this means that the current ruling hs body of gankers can be at its greatest... one tenth of the eve online membership.i will also like to address that the 164 you see in the list above is the \"new order logistics\". of course the cfc has quite a few haulers as well. all in this means that my wishing to represent haulers extends to the haulers in both entities as well *go haulers!*now where does history play into this?given the nature of ganking, as we both agree that it is a sport for extremists - be it religious, philosophical, or political, the \"end game\" is to have things their way. the only way that this can be done is by causing a surreptitious chaos and then, after a period of time, implementing their own form of government. now there are two problems with this. 1) eve's landscape will always change socially, politically, and economically2) a government formed on open tyranny is always met with an ill end (tldr as to why this is true)looking further, your use of malcanis' law also plays against your argument by overlooking the obvious. a small example will help illustrate the point. recently i was recruiting for a corporation in which i am not a director and a goon knocked on my door. it puzzled me because the context was that i was recruiting for a hs industrial corp. like all of you, i had the thought of \"awoxer\". but talking with the fellow revealed some interesting points. he had informed me that in order to make decent money in cfc ns it was necessary for one to have an initial investment with which to create a means of profitability. he pointed to the need of a pos for moongoo, a carrier for ratting, and so on. he further informed me that his wallet hadn't risen above 500mil for quite some time. whether his story was true or not is besides the point. the point is that malcanis' law works for the elite of eve online, not the common man or woman. i am sure it is safe to assume that the majority of both ganking entities are common players. and when subscription payment becomes an issue... the common man walks away to go find money.you also forget to take into account that the cfc can't last forever. and same with code. today it is those entities but in the future it will be others. this is eve, after all.then you have to remember that it is you who are making ganking a common theme that we are all learning from and slowly adapting to. over time the new players of today will use your same weapons against you and the integrity of hs will consist of people running gankers out of town... sooner... or later.thereby when i say i wish to balance the scale i am looking both at the current situation and at the future as well. as a representative for my constituents i will seek to help nature take its course and whatever means necessary to tighten loopholes and balance the tide. ganking is a self generating fad and if you look at what i have said, carefully, you will see that everyone from ccp, to the csm, to the player body will help it go back from whence it came and restore the balance and perspective of ganking being what it has always been... something that people gather for to do whenever they see an occasional - financial - opportunistic - victim. that is fair balance. and a couple years from now (maybe even tomorrow), whether i had a play in it or not, things will change and balance will be restored. meanwhile all we can do is help it along.even though ganking is forcing change that weeds out its cause, the future of eve online is very bright. and i hope to represent my constituents while this happens... perhaps beyond as well, if both they and i see that to be necessary. from null sec to high sec, i'm here to represent them all.regards,~ radu lupescu"
"i'm told a ganker alt can be trained fairly quickly, but i have no idea on the details - as with my posting, i gank with my main.time to execute a gank from the target being identifed to it going boom (or not) varies quite a bit, though in most cases the target has sufficient time to get away.hopefully you already know the answer to your next question, given that you're clearly going to be lobbying for further nerfs to our playstyle. in case your question is serious, the answer is 15 minutes.*if* a freighter can be bump-tackled in the first place, which generally doesn't happen to competent, aware pilots, you obviously know that game mechanics don't kick in at all. one would hope that you're also aware of the assorted ways that a pilot can get out of this situation - they're well documented in various threads on this site and i'm sure someone of your obvious resources can locate them.i have no personal knowledge of any ganker ever recycling an alt. those who do deserve what they get when ccp catches them.ccp *do* recognise ganking as legitimate gameplay.i'm surprised at your final question. gankers are a minority - just how do expect us to get a niche candidate elected? more to the point, why should we have to when you're running as a highsec candidate? we're highsec residents so you should be representing us as much as any other group."
"@amyclas i was certainly not underestimating it - but i consider the 'chase' version more the exception than the rule of ganks. most of the ganks the majority is referring to happens around or in major hub areas - what you describe would be part of a smal"
"...\"i'm told a ganker alt can be trained fairly quickly, but i have no idea on the details - as with my posting, i gank with my main.\"> i believe finding a more exact answer to this question is pertinent so as to show the difference between how long it takes to train a ganker versus how long it take to train a freighter pilot.\"time to execute a gank from the target being identifed to it going boom (or not) varies quite a bit, though in most cases the target has sufficient time to get away.\"> this doesn't answer the question. i'll rephrase. what is the longest amount of time it takes to gank and what is the shortest? that answer should suffice instead.\"hopefully you already know the answer to your next question, given that you're clearly going to be lobbying for further nerfs to our playstyle. in case your question is serious, the answer is 15 minutes.\"> thus far it has been established that ganking hasn't received any nerfs. rather the criminal system has been updated and former loopholes (unhealthy things those) have been closed. so i'll be looking at what are other loopholes and potential abuses and how they can be corrected for the betterment of eve (which is something, i'm told, most gankers say they want, to begin with).> so it takes 15 minutes for a ganker to go from having destroyed a freighter to being ready to destroy another one. as to where it takes substantially more time for a player to replace a freighter. sometimes they have to mine for a week before they can haul again. i wonder what can be done to balance this discrepancy. there's a chance that nothing can be done, but, if there is potential for it i wonder what that would be.\"*if* a freighter can be bump-tackled in the first place, which generally doesn't happen to competent, aware pilots, you obviously know that game mechanics don't kick in at all. one would hope that you're also aware of the assorted ways that a pilot can get out of this situation - they're well documented in various threads on this site and i'm sure someone of your obvious resources can locate them.\"> of course my questions are equally intended to both help inform a public, that may not be aware, as well as having people admit the truth for the sake of clarity which is necessary for proper discourse.> regardless of any \"spin\" the fact remains that there is not a single game mechanic regarding bumping. this means, hypothetically, that a player who flies a freighter is potentially being subjected to not being able to play the game at all because he is stuck in a \"perma-bump\", so to speak. meanwhile, though the bumper is also spending equal amount of time as the freighter pilot due to the requirements of bumping, the bumper can hold a freighter hostage as many hours as needed until a ganking squad arrives to sack the freighter. this is obviously then a loophole and should be corrected for the integrity of the game. again, a point that code and the like make to justify themselves.\"i have no personal knowledge of any ganker ever recycling an alt. those who do deserve what they get when ccp catches them.\"> i agree entirely. i wonder if there has ever been a closer examination into this.\"ccp *do* recognise ganking as legitimate gameplay.\"> can you show me where they have incorporated it into the game lore? or where they state it as a career choice for a new pilot? or point to a ganking mission storyline? or show me a ship tree for it?\"i'm surprised at your final question. gankers are a minority - just how do expect us to get a niche candidate elected? more to the point, why should we have to when you're running as a highsec candidate? we're highsec residents so you should be representing us as much as any other group.\"> by this point in time i have been led to understand that regardless of mechanic change gankers will always be able to produce that \"one more\" pilot that is needed to overcome a mechanic. i have also been led to understand that the cfc has 50,000 people to choose from in order to escalate ganking as they see fit. it is therefore easy to conclude that someone has the entire ganking coalition of the cfc and the code alliance to back them up. that sounds like an ample voting body to me.> as stated i am here to represent haulers first and also the gank targeted demographic as well. logically some haulers must be gankers but not all gankers are haulers. -- though i can represent industry i am not eying for hs. i am aiming to represent haulers in all the sec spaces. therefore i am not strictly a hs candidate but an all-sec candidate for haulers. --- it happens that hs haulers require the most attention, out of the lot, and that's simply because of the ganking issue. in conjunction with this issue are others who are forced to play eve online as gankers wish, gankers' victims. therefore i do not represent gankers. mind you, i am not seeking to punish gankers, i'm simply aiming to close loopholes and help (however i can) to maintain eve's integrity.regards,~ radu lupescu"
"to add something i would generally like to see regarding logistics is an old request actually: drones for industrials. it is beyond my personal comprehension that this has never been pushed for decently on a larger plane. almost every ship in eve has the ability to both be an active attacker and defender - just not industrials. mining ships have a drone bay that allows them to protect themselves besides passive tanking - why not all the other industrials?in a real world that would function like eve that would definitely be the first thing to happen to a logistics hull - a drone bay. i have been a long time in the navy and the concept can be easily applied to eve - at least when it comes to common usage of different ship models. auxiliary ships are the procurer for minor vessels that dont have the storage capacity themselves. these type of ships are capable of defending themselves beyond just being fitted with thick armor plating. they are ill-equipped for a long term fight but can wield enough fire power to scare lesser attackers away.in eve that correlates to a drone bay basically. instead of changing the hulls to provide more effective hitpoints only there should be a way to fit a industrial as flexible as a regular ship - including the ability for active defences like drones. this need applies to every security level in eve - for some areas more tank would be considered necessary where in other areas more active defense would be the thing to go for. a limitation of high slots and turret points would still make them industrials in their main role but would allow for more flexibility for solo players or smaller groups - thus balancing the need for group and solo play."
"if you seriously believe that the cfc as a whole cares one iota about highsec gankers then you've been inhaling way to much carebear propaganda."
"two things here:1) would you then please inform us regarding the nature of the relationship between the cfc and code? i ask this because i have heard several accounts of code saying they are allied with, or however you wish to phrase it, the cfc. your statement thereby does not parallel this claim and therefore beckons that question.2) would you please reply to post #18?regards,~ rl"
"o/ dwissi,i believe this is a very good idea. it directly parallels, albeit more seriously, a comment that i made earlier regarding the defensibility and solo standing capabilities of hauling ships. it makes perfect eve-sense and would help haulers with ganking, i do imagine. i'll also add, why is it that in the mammoth design that a freighter entails, thinking about it realistically, it does not have mid-slots, high-slots, and rig-slots? every single ship in eve has that (including industrial ships, orca, & the like) but freighters do not. granted, one may imagine that for every slot used there should amply be a cargohold reduction of some kind, but these are (if thought about in the real world ramifications as we do with other ships) enormous ships in scale. i believe it would be justified for them to be brought more realistically into the eve ship treeline with the proposed. i also imagine that it would make a big difference in making the scale even between haulers (in this case freighters) and gankers.+1 dwissi~ rl"
"what do you think the \"cause\" of ganking that is being weeded out is then?also i don't quite see how one exam poor struggling goon relates to all of this."

"so you would agree that more needs to be done to help smaller ganking entities? otherwise code and cfc remain the only powers capable of fielding the manpower needed for say, sinking a freighter.also, i don't understand what you mean by \"open tyranny\". everyone in eve tries to vie for power over each other. is slaughtering high-sec miners and haulers part of your definition of \"tyranny\"?"
"mr. amatin,1) i believe that by balancing the scale between gankers and carebears, which up to this point has proven to be in favor of gankers, is what will remove the grip that larger entities hold on ganking. thereby, in curbing the advantage that gankers have you help smaller ganking entities have equal footing with larger ones 2) the declaration from code and its membership insinuates that they are to be responsible of a new government in hs. not only does this go against the storyline of the npc empires being the ones to rule and enforce hs law but it also goes against the nature of hs in general, no player held sovereignty. and given the intention, though they will not be able to hold sov in hs, they would assumed it to be their space all the same, as they already have. yet this perversion of the game is one that would be far more tolerable if the scale was balanced. given what i have just stated, the open tyranny is in effect code's statement and attempt to enforce it. further, as i've already said, the only sustainable means for this is a form of government. once this is solidified, presumably with james 315 as the figurehead of hs, the previously stated precepts-(post #15), of what would follow, take place.if you do not wish to endeavor in replying to post #15, that is quite alright. i get the feeling someone else may venture to pick up that discussion.regards,~ rl"
"but but but, eve online is all about having consequences on other people's gameplay!it's been said to many times i know, but there, i said it again.tell us more about how one more nerf will somehow save you from gankers that are forced to ever increase their level of organization?one solo player will never be able to defeat a small army that's out to get them, not unless you are actually very very good at all aspects of pvp, and are situationally aware at all times."
"good job!"
"it is not about nerfing. it is about having the same chances (see concord).if you have any specific questions, i will be happy to answer them!"
"no. gamemasters confirmed this is legitimate gameplay"
"okay, your main idea is that some sort of balance between miners and gankers must be maintained and that both sides must have equal opportunities for success. fair enough.what i would like to hear is your specific ideas on the issue. what exactly in the game mechanics should be changed to make such a balance work?my second question is: what is your opinion about those of the highsec carebears who make zero effort to ensure their safety, but feel entitled to protection provded by someone else?"
"thank you for your questions.the ganker vs miner/freighter issue is always the one that gets the most attentions on the forums, because my carebear cousins keep on coming here and whining. :( at the moment the opportunities are not equal, because some of the systems in place are broken. i know we will never be able to implement anything that will save us from our own \"stupidity\" (not watching dscan, making sensible fitting choices et cetera). ccp falcon quite clearly stated that ccp are not responsible for our safety... and i am not (yet) stupid enough to stand there and say: but mr falcon, we really want it please! what exactly in game mechanics? well for example, i would like to see a fix to the bounty system, so that players actively engaging in bounty hunting (as opposed to whoring off concord or other killmails) get a better payout than the bad one at the moment. that alone, i think, would make some difference in defences, or finding people willing to sit around in asteroid belts waiting for the other \"good guys\" to show up. i have some ideas that might work better than the current system, but i think that ccp with their knowledge of the game etc should be capable of coming up with functioning, valid changes... and it is up to the csm to not let them forget about the issue.and then there are other issues one could discuss, eg the spawning of ice. monotonous regularity, always the same system... always the same time. if it was a bit more random, then we carebears might have to move around a bit. those trying to gank us might also have to move around a bit. encouraging mobility encourages an increase in interactions with other players and also increases the chances that i might land in a system that doesn't already have its own hard and fast ganker team installed!at this point, i must say that i have done a lot of thinking about these things. i would not be committed to pushing all my crazy ideas through. the important thing is that someone is there (especially if mr azaria is not running again) to see that high sec does get the attention it deserves. this is a complete and utter failure of the new player experience, and that is (in my opinion) one of the biggest problems facing high sec today. the fact that it is possible for someone who wants to play a space ship game to come here and undock, and not know that they have to take care of themselves... and that there are the other \"good guys\" out there that want to kill them. at the moment it is possible to download eve, undock and fly around without actually knowing anything about the game.i also think one of the things that misleads some people is that the space is divided into high security, low security, and null security... changing the names to remove the word \"security\" might also lead to some of us carebears not expecting to be \"secure\" there! (sad but true!)."
"thank you for the correction. i missed that one, for i do indeed know people that say they got warned off... maybe then for the other reasons that gm stated. i shall be bookmarking that post.one of the main problems facing high sec, and why we of the more carebear nature do not ever manage to unite... to do anything... is our complete lack of communication/interaction and sense of \"we\". i am sure it has not escaped my notice that really the only people responding to my thread at the moment are members of \"the other good guys\" that, of course, don't actually want a carebear on or anywhere near the csm!"
"it is disingenuous of you to refer to yourself as a \"highsec candidate\" when in fact you intend to represent only one segment of the highsec community. the same goes for mike azariah, except that in his case calling himself a \"highsec candidate\" is downright insulting, since he has been doing this long enough to know better.if you truly intend to represent all of highsec you need to rethink your platform. concord has already been buffed and ganking has already been nerfed to the point where it takes an absurd level of teamwork and organization to gank anything larger than a rookie ship and making a profit doing it without reimbursement from outside sources is almost out of the question. but guess what? we still do it, and more than ever - if the rumor mill is to be believed. nerf ganking more than it already has been and i promise you this - you will only make the gankers stronger, better and more organized. we will adapt and thrive, and more carebears will die than ever. if you truly wish to represent highsec, you should be advocating for some of the previous nerfs to be rolled back so ganking can return to its former state as a casual distraction as opposed to a primary occupation executed by professional squads with military precision.the other priority for highsec should be rebalancing the corp mechanics/wardec equation. the goal should be for more wars and greater consequences for dropping corp to evade them. give incentives to joining high quality player corps, disincentives to joining npc corps or small pve/mining corps, and reduce war fees across the board.if you are still serious about representing highsec after getting all that done, you need to work on getting ccp fozzie to pull his head out of his ass on the in-corp aggression issue. it is your role as csm to call ccps out when they are pushing forward with terrible ideas.do those things, and you can call yourself a representative of highsec. do the things you proposed in your op, and you are just another entitled carebear pushing for \"one more nerf\"."
"thank you for taking the time to write a response.which segment? there has been some discussion since the op (admittedly not much). what do the gankers want/need? i think trying to get the bounty mechanics fixed, trying to get ccp to be more open with why they ban people (to the people that get banned) and improving the npe so that the people coming here know before they really start, what they are getting into is all good...i have said that a 50:50 chance would be a good aiming point... and i have already said somethings about what i think could do that. having found out that i \"can\" use a dedicated alt (or three) to get concord to spawn in my belt for me (as long as i don't abuse alt-turnover or trial accounts) is a plus point.if every high sec player were to vote on the issues that were discussed... we carebears would get all our wishes passed... because we outnumber everyone else. when choosing to represent a group... it makes more sense to try and appeal to the majority (unless of course the majority are lazy/ignorant and think that not voting is also making a statement! ).i have already stated that i do not believe it makes any sense to try and nerf ganking into the ground. i also stated that i do not believe it makes any sense to try and get ccp to make afk autopiloting completely safe... i have not yet seen an announcement that mr azaria is running, and i did not want to hold off making my own announcement, because the inertia of carebeardom requires as much time as possible to even have a chance of getting things moving. ok. i know there are lots of passionate supporters of ganking that are scared that a carebear on the csm will take away their fun... but it might be more accurate to say it takes an absurd level of teamwork and organization to gank anything larger than a hulk that has been fit by one of my carebear cousins... and there is a big difference between a hulk and an ibis.the concord thing has been taken care of (if you browse the thread up there). i am looking forward to trying it out, if it helps.yes you do. just look at your alliance killboard. james315 will probably be endorsing other csm candidates anyway... that is thing of the dedicated/organised ganker vs carebear. too many nerfs are bad... and buffs are actually useless... because no self-respecting carebear actually understands game mechanics enough to know what to do with them (see my position on the npe).\"high quality\" corporations might even be a question of definition, i don't know. but if we want people to join those \"high quality\" corps, then those \"high quality\" corps have to be out there... and then they have to be willing to take in new players!! an attempt to give an incentive to getting people to join high quality corps is the planned removal of awoxing... which is not the right way to do it. sugar kyle is running an intensive discussion on her blog about wardecs, and i am following it with interest."
"do you not think that players have a personal responsibility to find out the rules of the game?"
"i think it is more important to deal with a \"reality\" that with an \"ideal\".i think that a large number of my carebear cousins would benefit from a good npe... and the rest of the galaxy would benefit from having the carebears properly informed about the way things are.then no one can claim ignorance... the people that think that this is wow-in-space get to learn it right at the beginning..."
"with apologies to dwissi, as i don't really want to make this thread purely about ganking, i'm going to make one more clarification on the points i raised:this is one loophole:so: you're camping a gate. a target comes through. you shoot at them. concord atomizes your ship. you warp your pod back to the farthest station from the gate, dock, and emerge in a rookie ship. concord spawns at the station and atomizes that, too. as there can only be one concord spawn per system, concord is now at a station, not at the gate. so you dock up, wait for your flag to wear off, then hop in another real ship, warp to gate, and either wait for a new target or join a subsequent wave of ships attempting to take down a big target that's been held from warping off by a bumping ship.loophole #2: you have a flashy red undock and warp to sun (for example). concord spawns at sun and blows their ship up. concord is now at sun, rather than at gate.my opinion in this matter is biased, so fair warning, but i believe as you investigate this issue further you will consistently run into the problem that concord is stupid, blind and lethal, which makes it incredibly easy to game one way or another.it goes both ways, too. i believe this has been declared an exploit, but for a while it was a thing for miners to aggress one of their barges with a rookie ship, spawning concord in the belt they were mining. there are ways to draw them off, of course, but it was a trick that got used for a while. obviously, that's not nearly as easy to do if you're piloting a freighter.edit: adding: when ccp calls something an \"exploit,\" that means that there's a problem that they don't have the ability to address mechanically. this goes back to my point about the funhouse-mirror distortion of gameplay that concord represents. it's so stupid and so easily gamed that it will naturally leave lots of exploits and caveats and dark little corners in its wake. something to ponder if you intend to represent high sec.edit 2: recycling alts--that is, creating them, using them for some nefarious purpose, then biomassing them and replacing them with another character--is a bannable offense. ccp traditionally relies on player reporting for such things, but this is less and less true as they gain more and more ability to monitor their game. for what i hope are obvious reasons, ccp are extremely tight-lipped about any methods they use. you will not learn about them in any detail unless and until you make csm, and even then you should be aware that they are volunteering what information they give you; they will withhold whatever they choose to.also, if there is a ganker-friendly csm, it's probably dj funkybacon. he's nominally fw/lowsec, but he has taken up the mantle of champion of high sec criminality."
"most dedicated gank alts tend to be trained until perfection. i have seen very very few disposable alts both the new order and miniluv. we use security tags if we need positive sec status, and we find it more useful to train alts into multiple ships."
"how would you balance things in a way that \"changes the balance\" to help carebears and smaller ganking entities? isn't this as much a social problem as a game mechanics issue?and yes, code and the new order, which extends beyond the alliance framework does exist to control and influence high-sec.as with post #15 i think we both agree that ganking is mainly done by extremists. but how do you think we can go forward in a way that develops both the constructive and destructive elements of the game when each side is highly emotional and seems to be playing a \"zero-sum game\"? the carebear elements push for ever increasing \"safety\" and greater \"balance\" while not adapting to the situation in eve, insisting that they can play in a peaceful manner in a game about blowing up spaceships. the \"griefers\" just get torrents of joy from blowing them up taking their stuff and forcing them to face their own ideal of the game. can this ever be reconciled?"
"i'm glad you sign your posts otherwise we would have no idea who was posting."
"hello gevlon goalposts,thank you for joining the conversation.you bring up a good point for a historical topic that i would like to share with you - briefly. prior to the computers, whenever someone had completed a thought or idea that they were expressing in writing, and with the intent of imparting it to someone else, he or she would put their signature at the bottom of the hand written/typed text so as to identify themselves and also indicate a form of proximity (these writings, often called letters, would go beyond the writer's tangible distance you see). with the advent of technology this tradition was maintained. it was then realized, as you pointed out (and around the construct of the forum) that the author could be seen in some for or fashion towards the top of a post. so as to maintain the socially endorsed standard of a signature and the unique and claiming nature of it, the signature was altered. now you find in all forums a section, usually under your personal settings, where you can prescribe a form of identification \"tag\", so to speak. this section is also called a signature (modernity's way of \"tipping its hat\" to the past). this then updates automatically on whatever post you place on a forum under a solid line at the end of your post. you will notice that admiral root, amyclas amatin, dersen lowery, and dwissi, all have a forum signature under all of their posts. you and i do not. however, i choose to maintain the propriety of both the historical context and the forum format by including my signature (and often times initials - shorthand for a signature) within the text i am writing.this also ties in directly with my campaign ! that is because i plan to use many historical lessons, whenever i can, and incorporate them into modernity at every chance. it's something that i practice \"irl\" as well and i suppose you could almost venture to call that a signature of mine too, but that might be a stretch given that many people do that besides myself . having a historian on the csm is another perk to my being elected.that said, again, thank you for joining the discussion. what do you think about the topic at hand?cheers,~ rl"
"hello mr. amatin,i maintain that closing all loopholes, on both sides, will be a good first step to balancing the power difference. mr. lowery points out a couple in post #27. but this may seem one sided so i'll tell you two, what appear to be, loopholes on the hauler's side that i believe should be done away with as well. they are autopilot and webbing: > autopiloting is essentially a means of playing eve online without having to partake in the game at all. to me it is more understandable to see a freighter sitting on a gate because something has occurred irl (as has happened with all of us) than it is to make the conscious decision of excelling in eve online without having to do the work yourself. it is afk progressive participation and i do not agree with that idea. hence why i believe it should be entirely done away with. > webbing is a means with which a hauler shortens the time it takes to get into warp. the shortening of the align time is something i see no fault with, but, it can/should be achieved with skill training and implants rather than a webber. the webber was not initially intended to be used by haulers as a loophole and therefore webbing needs some attention so as to find a way to bring it back to its original intention. i'll couple this with, if ccp endorses a means by which haulers can shorten their align time (as seen with webbing) then ccp should consider a means by which this can be achieved without the loophole of a webber alt, as used by many haulers.i'm also seeing many complaints along the lines of \"concord being broken\". to me that seems rather unsatisfactory to the rl ramifications of eve online and i believe this game system should be updated as well. between post #27, my two points above, and concord being updated, i believe this will do a lot in the way of balancing the playing field. and yes, the social problem that you bring up seems to be tangible. but society is often crafted around the constraints and freedoms of its environment's constitution. therefore if you alter the environment you alter the society.\"and yes, code and the new order, which extends beyond the alliance framework does exist to control and influence high-sec.\"- as i said, this is not what hs was intended for by ccp.- this then needs to ironed out or ccp needs to revisit what it wants hs to be. they set the rules and constraints, we follow. but right now code et al have demonstrated that there is a problem with the design that either needs to be revisited (either for endorsement or altering the design).how do we settle the difference between constructive and destructive gameplay in hs? that is a very good question. i believe that all i've posted to this point is a good start. fix the loopholes and make sure that mechanically there is a well founded and logical balance. i also believe there can be more developer content that can be introduced in which there is a greater necessity for both sides to work together. after all of this has been exhausted then one can truly claim that the two playstyles, destructive and constructive, are at least in relative balance. and from there all that remains is adaptation which, i suspect, shouldn't be so taxing given that hs will be cleaned up to be played as intended.regards,~ rl"
"since the topic has been brought up already it might be a good idea to extend to the 'history' lessons - but this time into eve history. many older players will recall that high sec was a lot more restricted in many ways compared to today. one particular difference to mention as an example is the requirement of standings to setup a pos. i will extend on that example further down.eve has been blurred throughout the years because players where shouting, crying and complaining. the original story how things should be has been ignored due to those complaints and things where mechanically changed to cater for the crying masses - but without the understanding of the long term consequences of these changes. those changes are basically the same reason why we have an underpowered concorde and why we have a very limited level of consequences when undertaking 'illegal' actions.it has become a sport to claim that any activity is supposed to be a sanctioned core activity - freedom off choice is the most used argument for this. but to execute freedom one also needs rules and limitations - anything without them is just anarchy. this is where we are right now with high sec - we are dancing on the line between freedom and anarchy. with every new ship that has been introduced for the capsuleers there should have been a proper adjustment on the non-player entities as well - which imho did not happen properly.so why did i mention the pos example? to extend into the standing mechanics and why this would be the way to solve many of the problems people are facing. to allow simply everyone to setup a pos has been a very dumb idea - it eliminated the general understanding why we have standings and what they are used for in the eve universe. on the simplest level a player can set personal standings - i don't like you - i put you on minus 5 so i can be warned whenever you enter my home system. how i use the indicator is up to me personally as i have set this standing just on my level. but on the next level things become a bit more interesting - the corporation level. if i act badly towards a corporation chances are high i will get a bad standing with them. on player level that is merely a warning tag or it might even lead to a war declaration if annoyance level is maintained for some time. pos can be set to act hostile towards those people etc etc. but npcs don't follow this picture consistently. i pay fees according to my standing towards that corporation and i get access to their agents as long as i am popular enough. but i don't get locked out from their stations when i behave badly nor is there any form of mid to long term consequences for me. that is one reason for things being far too easy for the 'illegal' or 'aggressive' type of high sec player. standings used to be the carrot and the punishment for certain things in eve. they are a superb mean to steer and control certain aspects according to story and behaviour. standings have been greatly undervalued during the last years changes because many have only pointed towards security status - which is also too easily circumvented when going into a bad direction. risk = reward is not reflected in this area and is a typical topic that mainly affects high sec as well as low sec to some extend since its still regarded empire space. this is a matter that has been completely ignored and needs some serious attention by the csm."
"so... if we unsub some of our alts that run on , they will take notice? also can we push for less npc alts posting incendiary threads in forums? npc corp alts shouldn't have rights."
"nice dodge. :)would you agree that the npe should include being ganked, with an explanation as to what happened and why?"
"one man's dodge is another man's answer.i would personally think that, if the npe continued to be mission based... that it should rather include ganking than getting ganked. getting \"ganked\" by npcs (and it would almost have to be npcs in an organised npe) is nothing like getting ganked by people, especially if you \"know\" it is pre-programmed... (no risk no fun). that would also then work as an introduction to concord... an introduction to blowing things up... and a look at the \"other side\". eve is, after all, a game about blowing spaceships up, and once you have thought about how spaceships get blown up, then you have a reason to think about how not to get blown up. and at least thinking of / being aware of getting blown up would be a great help for my carebear cousins."
"a mission to go gank another player? i'd be so totally down with that. it's the best idea i've heard on this forum all day."
"for all intents and practical purposes, it would probably still have to be an npc... that gets \"ganked\". otherwise there will be too many problems (also with delaying the completion of the npe because there is no other player there...). but confronting the new player with the violence... and waiting for concord to come and blow you up after you destroyed the target... at the moment in the npe there are mining missions... industrial missions... fighting missions... why not pirate missions? on the eve website there was a list of \"professions\"... and letting / forcing new players to try them all is surely a good thing... how else will they know what they find interesting/fun?"
"regardless of whether or not you're elected to the csm, i think you should start an f&i thread on ganking being part of the npe."
"introduction -vf- ....program -vf- i am borat guereen and i officially announce running for csm10 office to represent the little guys, the ones that truly play solo or with a very close knit group of friends.i am one of the alts of a player that has been in the game for more than 5 years, and has been living the solo eve lifestyle successfully for more than a year now, after going through various experiences ranging from living in low sec, null sec and wormholes. i have little experience in high sec, being neither a missioner, industrialist, hauler, trader or ganker. my focus is around regular pvp, i have fced small fleets, explored unknown territories, scanned signatures and flew (and lost at least once) most of the sub-caps. i do not pvp for the killboard, but for the thrill of the hunt. i have been part of the blue donut in null sec twice, and have been one of the lemmings for each of the main sides. i never flew capitals, as i never saw them as the ultimate end-game, and anyway flying caps has little interest for me in the current state of power-blocks controlled null sec. even if i participated to b-r5rb i do my best now to avoid tidi as much as possible, and am not a big fan of very large fleet fights in their current form.playing solo does not mean having only one character. eve does not work that way, and i have a few alts of my own. they are not scattered across new eden, but are all part of my small team to provide some reasonable control over the small corner of space i call home. i do not have any batphone, nor do i have alts embedded into various different groups. within chao3, i am spearheading a new type of players' coalition for new eden, with some light role playing to spice up our actions in game and make it mesh with the lore. as the speaker of chao3, i have chosen to represent the freedom fighters of new eden. as a csm representative though, i would represent the interests of all of you that can identify to some or all of my experiences. as a rl person, i am an open minded american citizen living on the us west coast, and of french origin. i have spent half of my life in europe and the other half in the us. i am working in it and project management and i have my own company. being master of my schedule allows me to have the capacity and organization skills to work for the csm while keeping my rl on track. eve is my main gaming hobby, and has been for these past 5 years. enough said about me and my alt(s). i believe the csm is a valuable interface with ccp, and i believe ccp has recently shown great boldness in the steps taken with the last releases. my only agenda is to help the game cater to solo or small groups more, without breaking the dynamics of the sandbox which makes eve the unique game that it is.here is my program."

"hi. i<U+FFFD>m running for csm again. as i said last year, i<U+FFFD>m not running on a platform, i<U+FFFD>m running on a skillset. i<U+FFFD>m still a goon. my experience and space resume remains largely the same, albeit a year more of it. the only difference between this year and last is that i<U+FFFD>d add to it my time as csm. but what a difference a year makes. if you<U+FFFD>ve read the minutes, you<U+FFFD>ll know that i have a wide variety of opinions on a wide variety of subjects. i<U+FFFD>ve written on tmc about the intersection of mechanics, player motivation, and psychology. i<U+FFFD>ve done some investigative journalism, and i<U+FFFD>ve also been party to public criticism directed at ccp. i<U+FFFD>m still committed to the idea that eve is about relationships. at this point, anyone voting for me should know what they<U+FFFD>re getting. in the immortal words of popeye, <U+FFFD>i yam what i yam and tha's all what i yam.<U+FFFD>in my campaign thread last year, i expressed hope that ccp had a plan for 0.0 and an understanding of how nullsec works. while there are a couple singular exceptions, ccp lacks both a plan and understanding. this is why i<U+FFFD>m running again. i<U+FFFD>m quite sure they<U+FFFD>re all well intentioned, but nullsec is a unique and complicated ecosystem. i understand it far better than they do, and i<U+FFFD>d rather they not introduce cane toads.when i started my term last year, i had certain expectations of how the csm worked and what it meant. for a hardened space politician, i was unfortunately na<U+FFFD>ve. that na<U+FFFD>vet<U+FFFD> is gone. after hearing the csm called a <U+FFFD>pr tool<U+FFFD> by one of ccp<U+FFFD>s public relations people, i know where the csm stands. after many of the disparaging comments made to me directly, i know where i stand. the new release cycle makes it harder than ever for the csm to have input and be heard. the institution requires strong, professional voices from people with the confidence to, if necessary, fight. because that<U+FFFD>s what it takes, not sycophantic ccp apologists, not rabid anti-ccp detractors. it<U+FFFD>s a tough balance to strike, and the people you vote in dictate the effectiveness of the institution itself. vote wisely.i<U+FFFD>m a straight shooter. you might not always like what i say. ccp certainly doesn<U+FFFD>t. but you<U+FFFD>ll always know what i think, and why. you<U+FFFD>re quite welcome to mail me about various matters, but if you have any nuanced platform questions, please drop them here in thread as i<U+FFFD>m not going to respond to eve-mails asking for multi-paragraph explanations. it<U+FFFD>s nothing personal, i simply don<U+FFFD>t have the time to write a thousand mini-essays. i can also be reached ."
"hi! thank you for running again!two questions:1) i know that the goons are a large group, and take care of their own. do you have any opinions about the development of the new player experience?2) i read some posts on themittani.com, and some other places... and the thought that ccp might, just might ban me for no apparent reason... not tell me what that reason is... and be \"wrong\"... keeps me awake sometimes at night (especially when i have to get my credit card out for something...). what can we do to better this situation??"
"i wholeheartedly support the re-run of sion to csm x.there are few in the game with the level of calmness, experience, and greater understanding of the game as a whole. do not let the age old grr goons sentiments cloud the facts of him being a solid and reliable member that will fight for the best interests of the game as a whole. sion is honed in on the key topics right now and with eve in such a critical phase of developments right now, we all will want someone in the team that knows what they are talking about, has the years of experience, and has access to data through the wealth of resources within his alliance to ensure ccp are full aware of their decisions. for what it's worth, there are also few people in this game that i value on a personal level as much as sion. he may be on csm but he remains very much down to earth and approachable, unlike (some) other csms present and past vote for sion kumitomo"
"hello dwissi,these are some really good points. there is a reason why we have the eve universe divided into the varying sec statuses. and essentially you remind us of the drive behind it. besides being a voice for haulers - eve wide, being a point of contact for gank targeted minorities, wanting to push for equal balance between aggressor and victim, i believe a cleaning up of the many loose ends that exist in eve is in order as well. > why are standings not more important?-- if i have bad standing with a an npc entity should i be allowed to dock at the station they own?-- should all of my actions in a certain sec space not only be reflected in my security status but also with my standings as well?-- risk equal reward, so, should i not be forced to rat - get tags - clean up my sec status before being allowed re-entry into hs?--- if that is the case, should i not have to repair my standings before being allowed to dock, once sec status is cleared?keeping in mind what i said in post #32, i find it reasonable to attach this to what was said there as well.we must also keep in mind that the players of eve effect the longevity and player retention of eve online. the new trailer that recently came out was a great boost for eve. but i keep hearing that it's the veteran's game and that is highly problematic. and the people that join eve today may not stick around when they realize the rules of the developers don't matter because you can easily overcome them, in the context of what we're talking about. if there are rules in place, that supersede all the players, then we have a balanced environment. if we focus on eve being harder to play in order to achieve success, then we're looking on raising the bar on player quality and longevity. currently we're seeing the new generation, literally, enter eve online. we're talking people that were far too young to play it 4+ years ago because they didn't have the maturity to understand and appreciate eve. but now they do and as eve gets older we have to be ever-conscious of this factor. how can we expect to keep them for 10 years if we don't provide an environment that caters to the now and future of eve? they will come in, find the loopholes, and ruin eve online (unintentionally), get bored and leave, because they don't have the same appreciation as the older players who had to deal with a real environment, survive, adapt, succeed. again, good points, dwissi. i'll be adding them to my list of things to review and help.regards,~ rl"
"no, you just used real money to acquire game time."
"you're asking ccp to give away free game time & in the same sentence saying that ccp would make more money for doing this."
"only if we can also take the same rights away from the elitist bell ends that live out in nullsec. this thread has degenerated to the point it's become like two bald men fighting over a comb. -- doc fury"
"thanks for admitting that npcs are bad for the forum. if you don't like something someone in a player corp says, do something about it in-game."
"actually... you have it reverse. if you sell isk for rl money you are rmting. if you buy isk with rl money, you are soliciting rmt (it is basically the same paradigm as prostitution). was designed to fight rmt by offering an alternative that...- would be legal- would create a \"closed loop\" between players and ccp in terms of money and in-game effortsin this respect, has greatly succeeded.however it seems that some players have come to depend on as some sort of lifeline... which it was never designed to be.honestly... is a \"nice to have\" thing and should never be a \"i need it to keep playing\" deal. if you cannot afford a piddling $15 a month sub then you have more pressing issues in rl than a game.not supported."
"once again, coming polling day, i'm looking for your votes as with the last time i ran, my platform has two main legs; industry, and third party development. there's a generous helping of other pve interest in there as well. i spend most of my time in highsec, so i'm sure you'll understand a degree of self interest there.for those of you who don't know me:i'm a industrialist, doing relatively small scale t2 manufacturing in highsec, doing so trade to feed the industry, along with being an additional revenue stream. i'm also a third party developer, responsible for:"

"the 'carebear' issuethere's definitely people that want to see highsec made safer, and for it to become an area where players can safely generate wealth, sometimes even totally afk, that they can either hoard or use in fights in lowsec or nullsec. i utterly reject this idea.these 'carebears' claim that they mind their own business. this isn't true. a multiboxer running 10 skiffs stripping asteroid belts floods the market, undermining the ability of regular miners to generate income. a mission blitzer running sisters missions in safety in their shiny paladin directly harms the value of every other player's sisters probe launchers. and an incursion farmer pumps tens of billions of isk into the economy each month, increasing the plex to isk conversion ratio and devaluing the concord lps owned by other players.these actions are every bit as much a form of pvp as shooting someone's spaceship.i want to see players able to set the level of risk they are comfortable with within some limits, and obtain very low rewards for putting low value assets at low risk, medium rewards for putting high value assets into low risk situations or low value assets into high risk situations, and high rewards for (sensibly) putting high value assets at high risk.i would strongly advocate rebalancing those parts of eve that provide high income at minimal risk. sometimes i would advocate direct nerfs (for example, to the liquid isk paid out for incursion sites) and other times i would favor indirect nerfs (for example, providing more sisters level 4 mission agents in lowsec and introducing level 5 ones).in addition i would lobby for in-game rewards for highsec miners to join player corporations of at least a few people, and actively defend themselves from any predators that come after them <U+FFFD> or to outsource this protection work to others. presently miners are encouraged strongly by game mechanics to remain in npc corps or to form one player corporations; changing this will generate conflict, opportunity, destruction and excitement.a series of changes over the last few years to highsec combat mechanics <U+FFFD> from the increases to wardec fees in inferno, to the replacement of 'can flipping' with the much harsher suspect flag, the banning of the 'boomerang' strategy, removal of insurance on concordooken losses and the tolerance by ccp of wardec avoidance (which was once declared an exploit) have made <U+FFFD>carebears<U+FFFD> safer and made it harder for new players to have the sorts of experiences that broke me from the <U+FFFD>level up your dominix until you quit eve<U+FFFD> path. the thing that has kept highsec competitive gameplay alive has been the increasing organisation and seriousness of our community. it's a problem that this is necessary, as it adds a barrier to entry for rookie gankers, mission invaders and wardeccers.the 50 million isk minimum fee to carry out a wardec is one of the most destructive of these changes, as it forces wardeccers to band together into large alliances to reduce costs. small groups of newbies should be able to experiment with wardeccing more cheaply, rather than having to join a larger group like code., marmites or the like.new playersi want to ensure new players <U+FFFD> both trial accounts and subscribers <U+FFFD> are exposed to what makes eve great, not just to level 2 and 3 security missions. the first half of the ship tiericide initiative was a mixed bag <U+FFFD> it made new players more powerful in pvp engagements in frigates and cruisers (a positive), but it also increased cruiser build cost significantly and made it much more crippling for a new player to lose a ship. this is a significant issue <U+FFFD> when i was a rookie, a vexor cost 6 million isk, or about 3 hours of running level 2 missions with low skills and little game knowledge. now it<U+FFFD>s 11 million, or about 5 hours, despite the mineral price index being about the same.i want to see changes that soften the blow of losing a ship for rookies, so that rookies get into the mindset of seeing ships as consumables early in their career.whether elected or not, i intend to make a series of video tutorials oriented at rookies explaining things like the basics of tracking and why this makes small ships more than just a stepping stone toward larger ships; basic fitting and the various effective types of tanks; refitting ships for specific purposes; avoiding predators in highsec and lowsec; and suggestions for skill training. i also intend to include advice on getting into predatory play as a newbie.most of all, i want to teach new players that they can be effective in the game *right now*. this isn<U+FFFD>t world of warcraft where you need to get to 2 or 3 levels below the level cap before you can even scratch a veteran player. i have known new players that have destroyed missioning battleships solo before their character has a quarter million skillpoints, and two hour old characters that have earned ransoms of a quarter billion isk."
"sovereign nullseci<U+FFFD>m aware that csm 10 will deal with a lot of built up issues related to the stagnation of sovereignty mechanics. my csm pitch on this issue is simple. i<U+FFFD>ll let the experts do the talking.members of sovereign null blocks that have the support of their respective alliances will likely comprise 30-70% of the csm. these people understand these issues better than me, and i will listen to their expertise, offer any suggestions that i think might be a brainwave, and not push the point if the experts tell me i<U+FFFD>m wrong.ccp<U+FFFD>s attempts to fix sov null will probably be the most important single issue the csm discusses this year. this doesn<U+FFFD>t mean that every person on the csm needs to be an expert in it.my suggested voting platform:1: sabriz adoudel2: tora bushido3: steve ronuken4-14: fill all of these out with candidates of your choice that are not mike azariah. if you do not have enough candidates you care about, pick ones at random or pick ones you think have a chance of being elected but that you feel are unremarkable.the reasoning:ideally i'd like to get voted up on my own rights. however, if i am not elected, under stv a 1 sabriz 2 tora vote is (almost) equivalent to a 1 tora vote. i feel tora is the second best highsec predator candidate and would be a huge asset to the csm whether i am elected or not, and if preferences flow as i hope and i am eliminated from contention, my voters might help put tora over the line. steve r probably doesn't need help getting over the line but i don't think this should be left to chance. the csm needs someone with his unique skillset. he's also not a carebear but an industrialist who understands how to defend himself.mike azariah was instrumental in providing feedback that led to incursion changes. while he presented these changes as 'quality of life' changes, they have been major balance changes that have further damaged the (already seriously bad) risk to reward imbalance present in highsec incursion farming. eve was made actively worse by these changes. regardless of any positive qualities mike may have as a person or organizer, eve would be better if his feedback on game balance issues is marginalized or ignored.it may seem that his feedback is irrelevant if you do not participate in incursions yourself, but the enormous amounts of liquid isk poured into the economy by incursions transforms the game economy considerably. this is true of nullsec ratters as well, but null ratters do at least drive small gang fights and occasionally larger conflicts.under stv, it is an optimal voting strategy to fill your ballot with candidates that have a fringe chance of being elected if you wish to reduce one particular candidate's chance of getting elected."
"here's my candidate interview with cap stable podcast."
"you have my votes!"
"glad to see that you're running again, sion. i commend you to the players of new eden as someone i think should certainly be returned to the csm.eve down under - a community for players in the autz"
"1. goonswarm has a long history of bringing in newbees and in general being a newbee friendly organization. what we've found largely mirrors what ccp's statistics indicate: people who get involved in the social component of the game stick around longer. so while there are mechanical aspects that can be changed to flatten eve's vertical learning curve, the biggest single factor is getting new players involved in the community. my focus is therefore on ways to get players the tools to help make that transition from npc corp to player corp as smooth and intuitive as possible. 2. i've yet to encounter a case where someone was arbitrarily banned for no reason whatsoever. and if you ask, everyone who is ever banned will say that they're innocent. that doesn't mean that ccp doesn't make mistakes and that there isn't room for improvement. but if it legitimately keeps you up at night, go find some truly innocent people and make a case study out of it, push loudly and publicly for reform. offer some practical solutions, don't just toss rocks or concern troll.thanks for the endorsement dude, it's great to see you back in game too. hey bam, thanks for the kind words. i'm still hoping you're kicking around that conversation you had with me and others in vegas, just sayin'."
"there's nothing wrong with a little prostitution."
"depends on where you live. selling and buying is illegal in most of the us.selling and buying is illegal in china, but enforcement is (at best) lax.selling is legal, but buying is not in sweeden.selling and buying are more or less legal in germany."
"i live in a civilized modern society that doesn't oppress women."
"it was great talking to you in vegas and finding out that you also have a lot of diverse and constructive opinions outside your main jam of 3rd party tools and industry. the amount of progress that ccp (particularly foxfour) has made in the last 12 months with the api is pretty obvious even to me.eve down under - a community for players in the autz"
"steve is pure awesome and i fully endorse him for another csm term."
"i'm better known as a destroyer, but i do a *lot* of production and invention too. it may surprise you, but i encouraged people in the minerbumping community to vote for you last year.so a question, steve. how do you feel about the balance changes that happened to production as a result of crius and phoebe?my feeling is that the reduced amount of player input required for inventing and building modules, ammo and ships, and the (general) reduction in production hours required for most goods has led to increased overproduction and a fairly unhealthy economy.this has real advantages (it's cheaper for newer players to buy those tech 2 modules they can fit) and it's certainly made ganking cheaper, but it's also problematic in that newer players taking up production see less of a return on the capital they invest in things like module bpos.also, why aren't our alliances at war? i need to get a director to fix that."
"absolutely. producing things is rewarding, but making isk while doing so is better. ;-)"
"my general feeling is that the time for most t2 modules and ammo has fallen too far, so the market is swamped (though you have people moving to the next thing, letting it drain a bit. i'm not a huge fan of that being a requirement)the lower prices are nice and all, for the consumer, but the market doesn't exist to make mass production /really/ worth it.as for war, well, i'd prefer you didn't. i'd have to relocate production from the pos to a station, and contract people to move my stuff. (and turn the pos into a dickstar) and that's just annoying."
"i don't understand this need for reform. if the null blocs make up a large portion of the active player base, using many, if not all the mechanics in the sand box then what exactly is the problem with them having many members on the csm? or are you suggesting that the csm should be made up of insular mission runners who couldn't care less about sovereignty or in fact anything outside their level 4 mission or incursion."
"reform is a good thing, it means change with the end goal of increased efficiency. in the case of the csm i feel strongly that the process needs to be overhauled. a very small portion of the player base even knows what the csm is. eve is about the players, the csm can only be comprised of players. to that end the process needs more transparency and fluidity. the members of the csm also need to be held to a higher standard, one that precludes them from using politics as an excuse to advocate for their constituents."
"ccp's lacklustre promotion of the csm is the reason for that, nothing else. voter apathy is different but it isn't linked to any one particular cause. it's a bit like quality assurance - if you've worked in software based product development - no one is interested in talking to you unless something bad is happening. right now ccp isn't screwing up, so no one gives two hoots about their virtual union reps. although i'm sure certain csm members will be the first to tell you it's all their doing in a horribly smug self important post. i don't mean mynnna or sion either."
"i know and i agree with you about quality assurance. i think you will agree with me when i say that just because there is no sign of rain in no way means all efforts on flood prevention should cease. ccp is doing amazing right now because of ccp seagull and her unprecedented vision. the csm is still a valid and relevant mechanism. just because ccp is being guided by some beautifully androgynous genius doesn't mean the csm should stop restructuring itself for better function."
"are... are you santa?eve down under - a community for players in the autz"
"could you expand on how the wardec mechanic is broken? i agree with you for the record, but i would like your view on what can be done to make wardecs more fun and meaningful for all participants.do you agree that central to this problem of wardecs is the fact that there is not much difference between npc and players corps, so there is little to motivate players to stay and fight? if so, which concrete changes would you support to improve the desirability of joining, and fighting for, a player corporation? do you think nerfing npc corps, or buffing the income of player corps is a solution to this problem?"
"well, i can try (but please remember i am a carebear).i find it absurd, that simply by disbanding, a 1 man corps can avoid a declaration of war.i find it absurd, that simply by disbanding, the corporations of an alliance have an easier time, avoiding a war.i find it absurd, that wardeccing corps can cause new/inexperienced players to not log in... simply by declaring war on them.well, i think that non-consensual pvp has limits.this ties in to the descriptions of \"coporation lite\" that have been circulating. having a \"corporation\" that simply exists for social interaction, without any of the pos/poco/wardec components of the game is (imho) a good idea. the key to new player retention seems to be involvement in a social group... interaction with other players.having then social groups \"corporations\" that want to take part in pvp, sov, poco/pos things... and also wardecs... is a step up. motivation of players to stay and fight is a big theme. why would players stay and fight in high sec?one possible answer is to improve the new player experience, so that new players can not start playing the game with their wow sense of entitlement (or at least without knowing that eve is different). i agree that there is no motivation for players to fight for their own \"corporation\". as an npc corporation member i can safely say that i have not had any problems with war decs.why can one not wardec an npc corporation?this is again a very good question.i would like to remind you, and the audience, that i am a carebear.i see the main roll of the csm in checking what ccp is doing... and trying to let them know when it sucks. i don't consider myself savvy enough to tell them that \"if q=1 then......\" is worse than \"if q+1=1 then....\"describing the complicated changes that are necessary in order to bring balance is difficult. i am not set-in-stone with any particular set of changes....but:npc corps should be wardec-able. (but wardec the caldari state... then the caldari facpo are also gonna fight back!!)players should opt between \"social groups\" (no dec, fixed tax, no poco/pos etc) that cannot dec and are not deccable (social group)and corporations that can do anything that a corporation anywhere can do.... if one assumes that the model above is set in place, then anyone in a wardecced corp gets a \"flag=wardec\". this flag remains for the duration of the war (so no running away). any shareholding member of a corporation can call for a vote to surrender.. any war-declaring corporation gets the wardec fees refunded equal to maximal 1/10th the \"killed\" enemy. aggressors can recruit \"allies\" just like defenders.it is a complicated subject.i would be the first to admit, that i am a carebear, and am not happy when i get wardecced.but.... and i would like to emphasise \"but\":declarations of war have a place in eve, and should stay. i think it is important to enable these players.if there is a mechanic in place, that allows high sec players to \"opt out\" of such things (at the expense of not having anything from their corps other than a \"chat channel\") then i am all for it. (of course, that then needs to be balanced with high sec resource production (ice/ore etc)).i would like to say that the csm is not there to present fully finished solutions to all the problems that have developed in the last years in this game.... but are rather elected to represent \"interest\" groups of players.erm sorry, i seem to have got distracted. i hope that you have managed to get an idea of what i am thinking... and if you have any more specific questions... i will be happy to try and answer them!!the most important thing: people should vote for the csm. only in voting are we sure that the csm represents us.:)"
"oh. thank you for the interest in my csm campaign.unfortunately, after much research, i can report that santa has actually a lot of free time at this time of year. there are enough \"elves\" and \"little helpers\" that spend the time caring about the minutiae.even his wife, mary, has more to do than he has.any further questions, please let me know!"
"i agree. the question is how to fix it. i also agree. the corporation-that-is-really-an-npc-corp idea is fine with me as long as it has (almost) all the restrictions of an npc corp and (almost) none of the benefits of a player corp. then really nothing has changed in terms of gameplay except that players now have a shared identity and corp channel. this would help player retention, but does nothing to solve wardecs though.ok let me ask you, what would it take to get you out of your npc corp and into a player corp? and further, what would it take to get you to stay in that player corp and try some pvp, even if that isn't your main \"play-style\", to defend it?would raising the tax rate of the npc corp to 50% do it?would being valid targets to players of the opposing faction militia do it?would a player-corp only buff to your income, say missions pay you and increasing amount up to 100% more but only if you as a corp put effort into building a structure and defending it?would a player-corp only buff to your mining yield, that requires an moderately expensive and destroyable deployable structure do it?i agree that players should always be able to take refuge in an npc corp to rebuild in case everything they have is lost, but i also think we need some ideas to help encourage people out of these corps eventually. one way to do this is to make living in a npc less profitable than living in a player corp, and attach some persistent bonuses for staying and defending those player corps.i agree. eve is about risk vs. reward. to fix wardecs, there just needs to be a way to make living in player corps more lucrative than npc corps, and some incentives to stay with a particular corporation. if players are totally risk-adverse and want to spend their life in a wardec-free corp lite or npc corp - fine - but they should earn significantly less than players who take responsibility for creating, maintaining and defending a player corporation and its assets. best of luck on your csm campaign."
"please remember i am a carebear! that is why ccp get their big bucks! i would say, as a member of a voluntary player organisation (eg csm) that it is more my job to tell them that their solution is **** and to point our flaws etc.on the contrary... to solve the problem of wardecs, you have to solve the problem of corporations... and new players.any mechanic that enables a war dec to carry on and maybe shoot something.... well that is a good mechanic.without addressing npe and potential corporations changes, it is impossible to talk about serious, relevant wardec changes/nerfs.]would raising the tax rate of the npc corp to 50% do it?would being valid targets to players of the opposing faction militia do it?would a player-corp only buff to your income, say missions pay you and increasing amount up to 100% more but only if you as a corp put effort into building a structure and defending it?[/quote]1) raising taxes does not help new players. new players don't know any better...2) letting militia target people that declare war on an npc corps.... would be a good thing. but the npc corps must be deccable...... (see an earlier post).player-only buffs to mining yield are less important. the vast majority of care bear experience says that the vast majority of care bear players (sad but true) are not influenced by anything that anyone else does."
"oh cool.i'm with ya."
"i fully and enthusiastically endorse this candidate. a vote for sabriz is a vote for chaos and conflict in the universe. it is a vote to embrace the values upon which this game has its foundation."
"may seem a bit silly but there are 2 sides to the coin of the position you put forth. i wonder if you could perhaps provide some clarification?you spend a lot of time talking about care bears and risk versus reward. while i do tend to agree with you that the rewards of high sec are in some was disproportionately high when compared to the risk's of highsec straight up nerfs often tend to be a poor method of changing the balance, though in some cases necessary. i have seen ccp with the nerf hammer before, they often hit far to hard, and miss the true problems. it would be a bit of a shame to see the robust incursion communities die when the nerf hammer hits much like it contracted significantly before. i remember after years off null sec taking a break to run some incursions and it being a breath fresh air that reinvigorated me and many in my corp in the game due mostly to its unique mechanics and community.you speak prominently of the issues surrounding war dec avoidance, cases of isboxing/multiboxing and the plight of newer players and while this may be unfair your own alliance operates in some ways that is discouraging to newer pilots who operate in highsec. while granted the highsec freightor pilot who flies through udema is likely not the most intelligent individual or even particularly new the fact that he is often ganked with nothing in his cargohold suggests that maybe risk vs reward is in fact not very in balance in both directions. additionally along the same token, while 'carebears' are certainly guilty of wardec avoidance the same often apply to wardeccers who use a variety of mechanics to skirt the boundries of wardecs such as neutral repairs, boosts, scouts ect. i have heard that some of the wardec groups are even in agreement to not dec each other as that would introduce to much risk into their trade. also to be considered is (correct me if im wrong) a wardec can be maintained particularly against a small entity pretty much indefinitely. i know im takeing awhiel to get to the point, but the basis of the examples im providing is essentially how do you propose to balance both sides of the risk versus reward equation in highsec from the agressors point of view and the defenders point of view. as while i agree that isk generation in highsec is not particularly balanced neither is the pvp side. hope that was understandable, just found myself reading on here and decided to ask questions from the view of an outsider who does not have much involvement in highsec."
"vigilanta. in response to your questions.leaving incursions as-is undermines a whole raft of other activities. why put a 1-3 billion isk ship at significant risk to run level 5 missions when you can earn better isk by grinding highsec incursions in a budget incursion fleet? why risk a 50 billion isk capital fleet to fight over control of a c6 wormhole when the in-game rewards for doing so are only marginally better than fielding a 15 billion semi-blinged incursion fleet in highsec?i want to see highsec incursions pay out in a way that accurately reflects the level of risk involved. if i were a game designer, i'd change the reward scheme for highsec incursions to be primarily lp based with little liquid isk, and keep the liquid isk payouts in dangerous space.when the tengu was (unquestionably) overpowered, it was nerfed because the existance of an overpowered option invalidated other options. players felt obliged to train into the tengu whether they wanted to fly one or not. this is happening with incursions - there are people running them that actively enjoy running them, and there are people running them because the isk added to the economy by incursions (and also nullsec ratting) affects the purchasing power of the isk they earn via other means. drop incursion isk somewhat, and some of the present incursion runners will take their pve skills into wormholes, level 5 missions, nullsec exploration and pirate faction level 4 missions, while those that enjoy incursions will continue running them. this will add to the conflict that makes eve fun.it will indeed disrupt existing communities, but the status quo does that too, as nullsec residents or wormholers spend time on their 'incursion alt' in preference to playing in the space they lay claim to.on the later points. newbies and wardecs. newbies cannot fly freighters or afford them (anyone with those sp and resources is not a newb). our primary targets are exhumers (a month to train into), orcas and freighters (multiple months), and mining barges as a low priority (which still require more sp to sit in than battleships). newbies occasionally lose ships to us, but of the roughly one trillion isk in damage we do a month, i'd estimate five billion maximum is to rookies. i generally provide any newer or obviously clueless player that i blow up tips - i had one just last night that lost a ship and pod but learned how to use their overview and gather intel from the local chat channel to protect themselves.a small swarm of newbies in frigates is *terrifyingly effective* against predatory wardecs if they realise it and mobilize. i prefer to provide them with tips and training so that they can fight for themselves - which is what any corp ceo should do when facing a wardec.with respect to the wardec tricks - neutral reps don't work well (try it). neutral boosts and scouting are universal in eve and this is a consequence of how powerful warfare links and intel are. there is definitely not peace in the wardeccing community - my alliance is presently at war with marmites, pursuit of happiness and probably a few others. as for maintaining wardecs - it's a minimum fee of 50m per week, which hurts to maintain long term."
"and my gila!"
"you are paying me a gila to run? i accept your bribe... i mean donation to my campaign expenses fund."
"thank you for running for the csm.as a fellow candidate, exploring high sec issues, what do you think could be done to improve the lot of the war deccing player?"
"i fully support sabriz during this campaign and all of my accounts will be putting sabriz as #1!vote sabriz! vote for action! vote for an eve universe worth living in!"
"hi sabriz,thanks for donning the cape of the pvp crusader.your manifesto was a thought-provoking read for me, and it wasn't long after i finished reading it that i realised why this and my other accounts will be supporting your candidacy for csm 10.eve is about pvp. all of it. the division of the gameworld into low, null, wh and highsec space is as irrelevant as it gets, because wherever you live, pvp is what the game is about. a candidate who not only realises that but also commits to preserving and extending it, gets my votes.on a personal note, you have helped me with game mechanics and other questions i threw at you. i trust you, and your advice has never missed the mark. that james 315 included your 'vexor ganking' guide within his own article on ganking is proof-positive of the respect you've already garnered within our own community. now you have the opportunity to represent the pvpers of the rest of new eden and to bring to the csm/ccp table your experience in other areas too (wormhole life, for example). i wish you success!"
"responsing quickly to sasha: i don't pretend to know much about wormhole life. i know enough to use w-space to support my k-space operations (for instance, using w-space to get access to nullsec bypassing camped stargates, or using w-space to hide some of my forces when fcing a fight) but i've never lived there. in particular i have little to no experience with the system effects in whs.i do follow wh politics somewhat, however, and follow the bigger fights that occur there.so if i've appeared to you as a wh expert, i'm not.i'll assume from your question you are only talking about highsec wardecs. wars have some uses for lowsec residents too, letting you shoot first under gate/station guns, but i'm only responding in relation to highsec.firstly i feel that the ability to dissolve and reform a corporation with no consequence (for a corp without a pos) or merely moderate inconvenience (for a corp with a pos) is the single biggest issue facing wardeccers. wardec avoidance by corp shedding encourages people to wardec anyone and everyone, in the hope that a quarter of those wars will result in fights, and the cost of doing this requires wardeccers to form huge alliances whether they want to or not. adding carrots for defending your corporation, and/or a stick for not doing so, will thus be the focus of my answer.secondly, excluding people that use pos services, mission runners are the only highsec dwellers that receive any clear benefit for remaining in a player corp. incursion runners and miners in particular are actively encouraged to be in npc corps by game mechanics.as for concrete suggestions:- apply the npc corp tax rate to the isk component (not the lp component) of incursion payouts. this gives incursion runners a reason to join a corp and (combined with the next suggestion) to actively fight off anyone that wardecs them rather than merely surrendering.- apply the npc corp tax rate to members of very new corporations (ones that are less than 7 days old). this seriously discourages jumping ship and reforming corporations.- find some way to incentivise miners joining and remaining loyal to a player corporation. i don't have the answers here - perhaps a pos module that provides a 3% mining yield boost to corporation members within its system.- scale the cost to declare war differently. it should be based upon the size of the aggressor corporation, not the defender, and it should scale more slowly than linearly as the aggressor corp increases. one possible formula would be x^0.5 * 10 million isk, where x is the number of members in the aggressor corp/alliance and the total cost is capped at 200m (for an aggressor entity of 400 people or more).- consider having the npc corp tax rate be on a sliding scale. currently the tax is 11% of any taxable event equal to or exceeding 100k isk and 0% for taxable events under 100k isk; and a taxable event is an agent mission payment, agent mission 'fast completion' bonus payment, or a bounty 'tick'. i'd be interested to see the result of changing that formula to be min(0, 0.2*(x-300000)) for taxable events of x isk. this would make the tax smaller on newbies running level 3 security missions slowly, and larger on veterans blitzing l4s."
"hello friendsi am gorski car. i have been playing eve since 2003 on multiple characters. i was recently added to the current csm after some dropouts and i am now running for reelection and i really hope we get all the votes this time.most of the time in game i spend doing solo pvp/small gang pvp in every part of new eden. i have been doing lowsec, fw, 0.0 and recently i joined rvb to pvp in highsec. i have participated in two alliance tournament teams and the new eden open. i also try to show up for most ingame events. most people know me from my postings in the channel \"bringing solo back\" and for my stream at"
"having pvp experience in lowsec and highsec, i am curious on your views on the current game design philosophy of risk vs. reward and the relative profitability of the various spaces.decisions by ccp over the years have lead to the strange situation that while many people enjoy pvp in low/wh/null space, they return to highsec to make the isk to support these habits. this is because the reward of operating in highsec is far too high for the almost complete absence of risk, forcing people who may prefer to live and generate isk in the more risky spaces to return to highsec to make an income as it is more efficient and thus the only rational choice. counter-productively, this depopulates these non-highsec spaces and reduces the chances of meaningful pvp.comments from members of the current csm imply that they, and perhaps ccp, are fine with this design. do you agree that highsec should be where the majority of pve and other income-generating activities takes place? if not, do you have any concrete suggestions on what could be done to encourage players to spend more time earning isk outside of highsec? do you think the better approach would be to reduce highsec rewards, or to increase highsec risk?"
"well there is concrete information out there, that banned players have not been informed by ccp why they have (in the concrete case) been banned.whilst i am sure that the players that were banned must have done something \"ban worthy\", not informing them why their account was banned (as in concretely for what) seems kind of weak. a practical solution would be for ccp to say \"you have been permabanned for being associated with erotica 1s bonus room\".i am mostly disturbed that ccp does not always offer a reason, and therefore the chance of an \"appeal\".i guess djfunkybacons grey area left me all nervous."
"hi all!so, there is such a proposal: why not make necessary for all ships to pour fuel?ofcourse for small ships it will cost lesser then for large ones.perhaps the introduction of the parameter for ships \"fuel consumption\" or something like that.these changes will translate economy on a new level of realism!people will have to consider the logistics, how much my ship \"eating\", how much the road will cost etc. just like in real life!you will see a huge new industry in finding, mining, processing and saling the fuel.i know about existing of such for jumpers and poss, but it's a whole different level.this will affect all activities in eve.p.s. sorry for my english, hope you'll share my views."
"why?how does this benefit anyone who doesn't live in highsec, with incredibly easy access to market hubs?why should there be a game mechanic that forces people not to roam deep into hostile space?"
"well, the only attractive thing in low/null secs is hight-quality resourses.so we can placing there or using already existing there resourses for the production of fuel for some types of ships.simple example:frigs and destroyers uses fuel i, that can be extracted and produced in hi/low/null sec.cruisers, battlecruisers, industrials and battleships uses fuel ii, that can be extracted only in low/null sec.carriers, freighters, dreads uses fuel iii from nulls.thus further increasing the attractiveness of low/null systems."
"at a time when ccp is doing a lot for the new player experience, you want them to take a huge leap backwards."
"i've always thought that eve ships were more like a bussard ramjet in the way they produce power. they scoop up free floating hydrogen in the intersteallar medium, and run it through a fusion reactor to produce energy for normal operations. no need to add fuel, just lfy around. this thread has degenerated to the point it's become like two bald men fighting over a comb. -- doc fury"
"ikr how dare eve make it easier for new players to come in and want to stay!also when was the last time you saw a vehicle with a nuclear reactor (like a naval ship) need to worry about fuel on a daily basis? they done, maybe like once every 20 years but still. you want to worry about fuel go jump cap ships around and there's your fuel burn, or put up a pos.not every ship should worry about fuel constantly, because why you think this would help, it would cause fuel prices to lower as more fuel would have to be sustained for ships and then people still wouldnt want to dealing with the reduced prices in high risk areas"
"and i obtain this in hostile space by...?and i obtain this in a system with no station by...?and i obtain this 15 jumps away from my regional market hub by...?why do you want to make it much, much harder to live away from highsec? why do you want to remove the entire concept of extended roams, or living in hostile space? how does this benefit me, the line member and pvping member of a nullsec group?and hell. clarify your damn idea. is this racial like isotopes, or do all frigates use the same fuel? what happens when you run out? what possible benefit is there for any of this?"
"players would *****, whine and moan more than ever. i've wanted the same, but i dont ever see it happening."
"(i believe lordservants started working on this behind the scenes already, so let's keep that ball rolling) there is a lot of drama, misinformation, slander, name calling and anger from both users and haters of multiboxing. i posted my thoughts in multiple locations but i have a fairly condensed post here"
"your synonymous use of the words \"multiboxing\" and \"automated input\" are quite disingenuous. the \"dramatic stance\" you're describing has been as such for botting (read: automating input) infractions for a while now; isboxer 'slipping under the radar' was really more ccp turning a willingly blind-eye towards it. while it would be interesting to know what prompted the internal discussion, let's not act like this is some major shift in what ccp views acceptable and unacceptable."
"i disagree, for years multiboxing ment using one mouse and keyboard to be able to control multiple toons at the same time. ccp is trying to walk back 7? years of confirmation that this was ok, while providing little explanation or taking into account the half dozen work arounds to accomplish the same thing without much downside to the multiboxers. today, right now, i could easily implement a very simple change in isboxer and get around 90% of the mouse and keyboard duplication ban with zero hassle, the other 10% will simple take me a few more button presses to achieve. so instead of arguing among our selves i would like to speak directly to ccp and to show them the errors of their policy and to also dig into what really their issues are. whatever they hope to fix will not go away, people will still be able to multibox with little difficulty, only some inconveniences."
"no discussion is required, and most of the csm in the past have believed that isboxers ability to clone commands needed to go. you can still multibox just fine, hell i do with three alts everyday. you just can't broadcast to the three characters, not that difficult to understand. imo no discussion is needed. this is a good rule."
"what error? you want them to roll back the ruling or completely ban isboxer and other things, which have other benefits. and if you can get around the ruling then why are you complaining?"
"follow the rules of ferengi acquisition and you will have plenty of :"
"do not buy ingame anymore. do it for dollars or whatever your currency is...lower the demand ingame.and stop this stupid f***** -spam everywhere.and what the hell should mean a menace not to any accounts anymore? you want me to lol only.ingame are already paied. it's no odds who use it finally.there's nothing wrong with a living market.nobody should request market manipulations for his own advantage.i have no . i use no . easiest way to avoid disadvantages.-1 from me."
"i'll be glad to see you again"
"you deserve alot of it though, people don't see how much you have been pushing for all this.before i ran last year two step said how getting steve on the csm was super important, i can now appreciate how much this is true, he's worked really hard. totally has my support, good luck on csm x."
"i agree they are related but i am not sure we need to implement that before a wardec change. there really isn't any difference from a game mechanics view whether a new player stays in an npc corp, or in some new un-wardeccable corp-lite that is really just a form of player controlled npc corp.there are, and still will be player corps, and we need ideas to make wardecs between them meaningful and more engaging. i don't agree that anything that enables a wardec to carry on is good. ccp could just make dec-dodging an exploit again and wars would go on longer then, but people would still just dock up and play an alt, or worse, go play another game entirely. we need ways to make players want to stay in a player corp. otherwise, if there is no incentive or desire to defend it but we force them to endure the whole dec, they just won't log in. ok, so you think making npc corps more dangerous or punitive might be better than enticing carebears with carrots to player corps. do you think carebears would put up with this increased risk, or would they quit the game? i really don't have a sense of the carebear thinking on this."
"doesn't that mechanic already exist in the form of chat channels? wouldn't making your non-corp corps a game mechanic just move the problem from a handful of big npc corps to a whole bunch of smaller ones, at the cost of a bunch of time coding stuff?"
"greetings.i'm corbexx and i'm announcing my intention to run for csm x.last year was a bit of a rush for me, with me deciding to run at the last minute, this year i'm much more prepared. being already on csm 9 means should i get elected i can hit the ground running and hopefully accomplish even more.i started playing eve over 5 years ago, after some real life friends moved in to a wormhole. i joined them and spent 4 months in a c3 wormhole, then we left for null sec for 10 months and became a director. i got tired of that and then moved back to highsec and spent a couple months doing level 4 missions while i finished a few skills for my first big wormhole corp ccres. after 6 months, i moved on to aharm and am now in exceed, part of noho. i also have a successful t3 production and cap building corporation. some of the things i have done while in these alliances include: lots of pvp. running reaction pos's in nullsec. i was the diplomat for aharm. planning and executing invasions on other wormholes. helping to defend wormholes. helping organise large multi alliance wormhole fleets. being part of some truly great wormhole fights. probably the most memorable was taking a armour fleet with triage support and an officer fit moros in to a pulsar, against 3 times the caps and coming out on top. representing w-space on csm 9. i'm running mainly as a wormhole candidate again as that's what i know best, though i do have a lot of industry experience as well. some of the work i have done this year on the csm. c1 to c4 pve testing, leading to some nice buffs to w-space. loads of pos research, with over 100 questionnaires sent out and the information sorted for ccp. a wormhole general little things thread, leading to loads of small upgrades (sigs id's staying over downtime, d scan and probe scanner being split). a wormhole pve little things thread. multiple wormhole townhalls, attended all sugar kyles eve uni chats. pve sounding board with players and some ccp developers (which has been really constructive). managed to attend all meetings with ccp except 1 (approximately 30 or so). be incredibly available to w-space people, with over 370 people now having access to me on skype, and answering 20 to 40 eve mails a week. written up more than my fair share of summit minutes. what will you get from me.some one who has very good wormhole knowedge and experience. while my main lives in a c6 wormholes i have alts in several lower class wormholes, and understand issues they have in them. i'm some one who isn't affraid of work and will happily put in huge hours to get stuff sorted. i have good communication skills, and will happily chat to anyone about issues. someone who is no nonsense,be you a solo player, ceo of a huge allaince or a ccp dev, if your idea is good i'll tell you that, if its terrible, i'll tell you that as well. experience, i have a much better understanding on how the csm works now, and how to get the most for people i'm representing."
"reserved for endorsements."
"fully support corbexx and will have him on the #1 spot on my list. he goes out of his way to reach out and get feedback and opinions from every wormhole corporation out there, from all classes of systems and demographics. if you live in w-space and you don't vote for corbexx, you're doing it wrong and you should feel bad."
"all of no holes barred back corbexx for csm x! we are proud of him :)"
"corbexx has been doing an outstanding job on csm 9, and i am happy to fully endorse him next time around. he has been putting a ton of work into the csm process, far more than i ever did, and he has been getting results. if you live in w-space and don't vote for him, i will personally invade your hole and evict you.csm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate @two_step_eve on twitter my blog"
"+1. corbexx has been excellent this year and i expect no less going forward.also, i am slightly afraid to *not* endorse him after he picked me (90kg) up and threw me over his shoulder like i was a sack of flour at ff a couple years ago...best of luck, my "
"corbexx has been an outstanding csm rep, both in general and for wormhole space in particular. he has worked his tail off for both low-class and high-class holes. i don't have to wait for my annual endorsements post to tell you i endorse him wholeheartedly for csm x.he should be at the top of your ballot if you care about wormholes.thanks for all your hard work, corbexx, keep it up.author of interstellar privateer shattered planets, wormholes and game commentary"
"you've got my vote buddy!been great to have you on the csm this year, looking forward to a second term :) stuck in here with me:"
"i will be voting for corbexx. the blue loot buy order increases have made it much easier to fuel my pos and still make a profit in a c2 wormhole all by myself. and that's just my favorite thing he did..."
"corbexxx has been good to work with. even if his name sounds somewhat like that of a male pron star he'll be on my recommendations."
"finally, a candidate i feel strongly about supporting! thank you for doing this sabriz.you have my vote, my support, and my axe.. if we had axes.. which we don't.. but imagine we do.. and you have mine.a vote for sabriz adoudel is a vote for keeping the true spirit of eve online alive.o7"
"hi sabriz,it's clear i've confounded you with someone else! i suspect it was malcolm shinhwa, who did abide in a hole for quite some time.thanks for correcting that error!"
"is it voting season already?you've convinced me to keep my second account subbed."
"sabriz, your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. why are you so popular?more seriously, your understanding of what eve is, and your ideas of what eve could be, make you an excellent candidate for the csm. the amount of time you have spent helping new players understand how to play the game shows you clearly care about eve, and have a deep understanding of game mechanics.you have my endorsement. i believe you would be an excellent representative for highsec players of all stripes, not just the content creators that live there."
"i think there is a risk vs reward problem for almost all pve content in eve. they are currently designed in such ways that the best ship to do them in will have next to zero chance in pvp. every part of eve should have the things needed to support people living there in my opinion. i don't think that sov 0.0 people going back to highsec incursions between call to arms is a good idea. i think the better approach would be to encourage people to try more pve outside highsec by changing rewards and the entire way you do the missions. ideally you would have equal pve payouts in all types of space. there is also the problem where you can't force someone to fight and people tend to be very risk averse when the fastest way to run a mission is a 2b tengu and no one is going to bring their 15b incursion vindicator to lowsec for a tiny bit more isk. i used to farm incursions in deep hostile 0.0 and lowsec when they were first released and the payouts they had back then with increased payouts + blitzing was actually kinda good for lowsec and you certainly had risk and my group even lost a couple of machariels but we did all the sites with full pvp fits so it wasn't a slaughter when some fleet showed up. i think this was a awesome example of how people who normally do pvp could do a pve activity in hostile space and still be able to fight back if someone tries to pull a jackmove on you."
"i agree that every part of eve should be able to support the people living there in some way.however, i am a little confused with the rest. you think pve should be equally rewarding in all types of space, by \"changing rewards and the entire way you do the missions\". if that was the case, why would anyone leave the safest region of space (highsec) if they are only going to get the same reward if they moved to a more dangerous space?shouldn't more risky space have more rewarding pve payouts? otherwise, why would i risk my ships there for pve?"
"i meant that there should be greater rewards for more dangerous space. you should always reward the brave. there are less people out there doing pve and they should be able to at least compete income wise with someone who only runs missions solo and never really interact with other people in a mmo."

"no, it makes no sense to revamp a working system completely.but i see the idea behind. i'm sure it would be much easier to create audit log containers (user configurable) in sizes between large audit log container and station container.else it should be more useful to have more flexible content filters in hangars and containers."
"how do you intend to give carebears a \"50:50\" chance of winning? the chance of winning an encounter varies drastically depending on circumstances.i mean, an afk hulk has a near 0% chance of winning against a ganker. a skiff has a near 100% chance of winning against the same ganker. properly tanked he has a 100% chance of winning against 5. against 7+ he has a variable chance of winning depending on how much attention he pays to local, if he mines aligned, has bodyguards etc.how do you intend to give carebears an even chance of winning given how variable circumstances are?"
"the fundamental problem is illogical player behavior(which as a dev you have to account for). there is a certain prestige and mindset with joining a corp that you don't have with joining a chat channel. so a lot of players create/join corps even when they are clearly better off joining a chat channel and mailing list. these players are also the reason awoxing is being removed and wardecs got nerfed. eve is a social game and you really do want to encourage the userbase to be social.i would support a \"corp in name only\" status for the \"social\" players. this would allow ccp to attach better risks and rewards to \"real\" corporations"
"i can appreciate your point about the prestige of being in a corp, though it's not something i personally experience (i'm a member of the minerbumping channel *\o/*), and i certainly agree with you that more interaction between players is good for them and for the game.however, i honestly don't see these non-corp corps changing anything, other than eleventy-one of the dang things when everyone deserts the now-deccable npc corps. it's moving a problem, not resolving it."

"hello radu, before i continue let me wish you the best for your csm run.i think this is a little disingenuous. the \"powers that be\" have made it pretty clear that ganking is meant to be in the game and a challenge for haulers to overcome in several places, most recently by ccp falcon in this thread (all his comments summarized here)but that aside, i more concerned with the overall risk vs. reward design of the game and curious to hear your views on the issue. highsec haulers, have some of the lowest risk in the game and as such, the profession is notorious for afk and even actual botting behaviour. perhaps this reputation is unfair - i don't know - but it appears that many haulers feel entitled to move their goods (for their own profit) through highsec with near impunity while away from the keyboard. now i have no problem with active haulers, actually playing the game, being able to move their goods in safety, and it seems to me all the tools exist for this to take place - instadock/undock bookmarks, warp-to-zero jumping, and tanking your ship to be unprofitable to gank what you are hauling being the main ones. however, the years of ganking nerfs have made the actual chance you encounter a ganker vanishingly small, many haulers either don't know about the risk, or perhaps rightly, consider it so vanishingly small and ignore it and continue to overload/autopilot their ships. this wouldn't be a problem if they just got blown up from time-to-time and accepted it as the cost of doing business, but many of them choose to come to the forums and complain that it is unfair, ganking is too easy, and the like, even though they were the ones who made themselves a profitable target by overloading their ship and then leaving the keyboard to do something else than play the game to protect their stuff.so, what do you think could be done to better educate haulers that space is indeed a dangerous place, and they must take responsibility? i'll throw out some ideas, not necessarily ones that i support though, just to hear your thoughts: removal of (or a cost added to ) the autopilot function; very rare, but non-zero chance a powerful npc spawns (perhaps tie it to the sleeper lore) that will after a few minutes destroy a ship where the pilot is afk but is otherwise completely avoidable by a player at the keyboard, a highsec deployable that does nothing but shutdown the autopilot of ships, an in-game mechanism by which a player (especially a new players) can tell if their ship is \"overloaded\" and profitable to gank.aside from the issue of bumping and freighter ganking (something that happens so rarely in new eden that i am not sure it should be a plank of a csm platform), it seems that haulers have all the cards to avoid pretty much every gank except the most motivated and targeted ones, and even those if they make the effort to fly a ultra-tanked dst. are there other specific issues, unrelated to highsec ganking, that haulers face that you feel should be brought to the table via the csm?"
"i have no idea in which eve universe you play - but a simple look at a filtered kill board will show you that freighter kills and ganks are definitely not something that happens rarely -> look here you will notice that most of those kills happen in high sec by the way and not in general 'hostile' space"
"hello senior pedro,and welcome to the discussion. i want you to know that i have read your comments and certainly have a reply to your points.but for the moment i simply wish to say happy thanksgiving to all! and everyone - whether you celebrate the holiday or not - may you have a warm home, full belly, and wonderful day! i hope everyone can take the day off and treat themselves to some rl rest and relaxation... i'll get back to this thread tomorrow and reply then !best wishes,~ rl"
"if you actually look at that list i see a total of 8 suicide ganks on that list in the last week, all done in one session by code. and in fact for the other 6 days, there were zero suicide ganks of freighters in highsec. way more freighters were lost in the last week under wardec than to suicide ganks. of course whether this is \"rarely\" is in the eye of the beholder, but certainly compared to the number of ships lost each day in eve, or the number of safe freighters trips, the number suicide ganked freighters is a fraction of a tenth of a percent. in fact ccp relatively recently said that suicide ganking was at an all time low (a fanfest 2013 presentation maybe?) and with the recent buffs to freighters they are safer than ever before. to me though it seems that freighters, even auto-piloted and overloaded, are statistically one of the safest ships you can fly in the game."
"what is so bad with being a hauler in new eden? your chances of being violenced in any manner (wardec, gank, etc...) are so miniscule that you can pretty much operate in complete safety. if you are at your keyboard and taking active measures to avoid conflict (actually playing the game), the chances drop even more dramatically.you do realize that removing autopilot will hurt ganking because everyone will be warping to 0? and that, in combination with removing webbing, will only reinforce the need to have large numbers of friends to gank because the only things that will be easily catchable will be freighters with their terrible align times? smaller entities will have to roll the dice more often because scanning will be harder to do without all the slowboating going on, which discourages ganking anything smaller than a freighter.quite frankly all i see here is a severe lack of need for any sort of high-sec hauling representative who thinks ganking is a problem or that haulers have it bad on the csm, especially considering ganking is at an all-time low and becoming harder with every \"rebalance\" patch to up the ehp of ships, and that wardecs are so stupidly broken as to be nearly useless. high-sec doesn't need to be any safer, it's already had plenty of safety measures installed.not to mention that you sign your posts..."
"your ability to count seems to be very off - since when can anyone declare war on a npc corporation to begin with? it seems that you stopped counting after a single day - that is very short-sighted for this kind of discussion. which doesn't seem to be in your interest to begin with considering your statements in the thread of the candidate you already support. and the statement of radu's candidacy was very clearly pointing at logistics - and not as a high sec representative or anti-ganking rep. logistics happens all over of eve - not just in high sec.edit: and since the 3 of you are committed to another candidate i would actually appreciate if you would state so if you want to be treated with any credibility and not just like trolls in another candidates thread.,"
"actually, you're right - i missed several cfc ganks(6 ?) in and about jita, but still there are more non-suicide ganks (wardecs or suspect flags) in the last week than suicide ganks. marmite alone has killed 11 frieghters and 5 jump freighters in the last week. war targets get 24h notice, and getting a suspect flag can be avoided with a safety setting, so these losses are completely avoidable - and yet they are still more common than falling victim to a suicide gank which shows you how rare the suicide ganking of freighters actually is. edit: we are quibbling over numbers here which is not my intention. it seems unlikely we can settle on the \"correct number\" of suicide ganks there should be in highsec, especially since we don't have all the information - like how many trips are competed safely. as for my voting intentions, i have made up my mind to endorce one candidate so far as disclosed in my signature (so i will be treated with credibility as you say). however the ballot is long, i fully intend to seriously consider everyone who throws their hat in the ring. perhaps we should wait and hear what the candidate has to say to my questions?"
"lets look at the mechanics then in general - which are seriously broken and everyone is aware of that:war declarations: the only place in eve where that matters is high sec. it prevents concorde from getting involved in those infights. who declares war on whom? since you love numbers - the number of serious war declarations between 2 opposing corporations or alliances is minimal. in most cases we deal with a well-prepared high sec war monger against a lesser prepared entity ( be it because of lack of knowledge or ignorance or simply the fact that they mainly consist of 'peaceful' players).wars have not been declared for years between any serious eve entities as they reside in null sec or low sec where there is no concorde intervention to begin with. this mechanic has been broken for years and that has basically not changed despite some adjustments to it.suspect flag: most 'carebears' have never once changed their safety settings as they never had need for it. those who have this flag deserve of course to be a common target. but interesting enough no one cares about blinky pilots in combat ships - everyone chickens out or tolerates them to begin with. so that argument is a pretty lame one to begin with and you know that. almost every suspect did his action deliberately and most of them know exactly what to do to become one or what to avoid. others - especially newer players occasionally get tricked into actions to become suspect - this has been a common practice since eve exists. the number of suspect-flagged freighter pilots per day wouldnt even need the fingers of a single hand to count them."
"trolling? all candidates should back up their claims against anyone who asks. it shows credibility and suitability for the position.actually, it's not a lame argument at all. it's up to the chicken pilots to make things dangerous for blinky pilots. ccp has literally given players a means to police themselves, and people like you just **** on it and ask for more nerfs and safety instead of providing consequences for crime."
"since you change tone you might be careful who you accuse of what here. you dont know me nor have you any idea about my stance towards certain elements and how i deal with them. eve has more than enough systems to express ones will for violence and pew. whining about 'nerfs' in a policed and regulated area that was never meant to be the central place for violence is just what i expected from you. eve has always and will always have to deal with common demographics of players. that includes builders, caretakers, haulers and pew orientated people. eve consist of a full sized environment that was meant to be played by all these different groups - not just the last stated pew group.on top of that people tend to split into 2 major factions - the forum warriors and the people who simply want to enjoy a game for whatever time they can afford for it. the latter group does not necessarily voice themselves as heavily in forums as the more outgoing aggressive players - its simply not part of their nature to begin with. over the years eve has seen different groups who tried to 'take ownership' of how eve should be played or what it should be - and it has led to an awful collection of errors and failed tweeks. phoebe started to get rid of some of them already and brings a lot of the original eve back - which has nothing to do with 'nerfing'. its always a give and take and the original problem has never been solved since many years back - the mechanics in high sec dont really reflect a policed and regulated area at all. the mechanics are still mainly used by a minority in that area to satisfy their bloodlust which could easily be satisfied in more than 3000 other system that are designed for exactly that."
"its definition has not changed. multiboxing is still using one kb/m for several clients/toons. that hasn't changed. no they aren't. it's a change in how they view input broadcasting. it has nothing to do with their stance on \"multiboxing\"."
"so was wondering if there are any possibilities like 1v1 2v2 such as so where in the players get rewards for making to the top i think it would improve gameplay and there is a lot of pvp capuslers that i think would enjoy this feature. rewards could be plex ded space items bpc even bpo to each player, and also having different categories like the burners missions frigs only, or mixed categories where in say its a 5v5 and theres has to be a command ship 2 frigs a support ship and a crusier t3 or not just something along those lines i think it would be sweet it may have been proposed before but hey it worth a shot. it would be cool maybe even have an entry few also have caps in the tournament only 30 pilots and enter maybe even giving a medals for winning and for loosing"
"here is a link to my blog of ideas to make eve an even better game.*snip* - spam. post ideas on f&i -- isd supogodomanark co-host clueless space nerds podcast"
"nope, not going to feed your blog adverts. post the idea or gtfo."
"the are an in game item and the prices should be treated like any other in game item. your ability to use fictional in game currency to buy game time is a matter of convince. if you can not pay real money to play a single account for eve then you have other issues then prices. of course if people stop using to buy game time and then drop since they can't afford the real money fee then ccp may re-examine their fee's - as that is how supply and demand works. so....bad idea all around.-1"
"is ganking bad?"
"i am in the minerbumping channel too, so i understand what you mean.it solves the problem of \"corps are one size fits all\". once you have a corp for social people who aren't interested in the risks or rewards, you can change mechanics for real corps to give real benefits and risks."
"yes. there is no difference in terms of game mechanics... but in terms of social player mechanics.... and social players are happy players! the most extreme of my carebear cousins will simply go and play the hello kitty browser game, whilst waiting for a wardec to expire.... you will find, that you can take a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink (except if you use the camel-brick strategy... but that violates the human rights of the camel....).i think that there is simply no way to make a player take part in a war dec if he doesn't want to....but if he is in a corp with a poco or a pos then... losing his stuff is punishment enough... and if he doesn't want to fight.... then spending a week or two just docked up is punishment enough... and damages his \"mining/farming for plex\". then it is up to the player what he does."
"ok, so you think making npc corps more dangerous or punitive might be better than enticing carebears with carrots to player corps. do you think carebears would put up with this increased risk, or would they quit the game? i really don't have a sense of the carebear thinking on this. [/quote]i guess it works like this....i think that some of my carebear cousins will take the path of least resistance....but ccp statistics shows that they are more likely to keep playing if there is some kind of social connection.npc corps are poison for the soul of eve..."
"trust me... before your average \"care bear\" gets informed enough to join a \"chat channel\" he has already given up and gone back to wow!being a part of a \"corporation in name only\" is something that gives carebears a chance to feel as big as the members of the cfc, or code. or nulli secunda.... etc.(remember \"feeling\" is as important as \"being\"...)"
"good question.at the moment... fitting tank requires a very big drop in potential mining yield, or cargo.i could support a variety of ideas that allow players to actively (as in not afk) to switch between yield and tank....i have some ideas.... but once again i present the theory that csm should control the ccp plans... and not present their own ideas too strongly (especially when they have no idea about how hard or impractical something should be to code!).one of my ideas (especially for freighter pilots):the caldari navy intelligence self destruct device:this device was developed for caldari navy intelligence... once activated it guarantees (99.5%) the complete destruction of the ship and the cargo............so when it is fitted... the pilot simply has to be not afk.... and he can deny potential gankers any loot whatsoever..."
"hmm."
"well the brick strategy is especially cruel (for male camels)."
"i have no doubt. but i'm not convinced that a camel can have human rights!"
"are you trying to derail my csm campaign with some petty ethical distractions? or would you care to comment on the state of the game today?"
"well it's hardly an 'ethical' distraction. an animal would clearly have animal rights rather than human rights. i'm not making any comment on whether any particular practice is cruel or not."
"and your opinion about the state of the game? or any of the eve related issues* that have been mentioned here?*i think it would be a shame if the csm was elected based upon the differences between camels and humans."
"i think the game is in a better state than ever. most of my concerns about specific issues were canvassed during the summer summit - i think the current csm is doing an excellent job. tags4standings is about the only highsec issue i care much about (bring it on). i would like to see highsec separated by lowsec to make the trade hubs more independent. that's about it, really.oh, except for dynamic system sec status. that would be fantastic."
"why? and in what direction do you care about it?i personally think that tags4sec as it is... well it is a bit easy. easy for some antisocial ganker-type to just spend a few hundred million isk and get their standings back.what do you think?i don't think having the only route between jita and amarr going through lowsec space would make any great improvement for the game. trade hubs will develop where they are economical... and if the map is changed then (after a time) the most popular trade hubs will change with them.of course this makes a horrible disadvantage for the new players that are just starting... but then well... maybe they/we should have started playing earlier!dynamic system sec status? do you mean... that \"sec\" status would be system specific?please explain more!"

"all of hydra backs the gorski car"
"my tags, my pride"
"complete safety, even in only a small number of systems, is anathema to the wartime economy that drives eve. any time you undock to affect the universe you should be vulnerable, especially if you are injecting isk into the market willy-nilly. unfortunately the trend has been towards making high-sec safer; it doesn't need it, and this candidate's stated ideas will only reinforce the general trend of making things safer despite what he believes. that makes him a poor candidate."
"you are right that here is the core of the problem but it is in your expectation that is the problem, not the game mechanics. eve is not a simulation of a space utopia where everyone gets along - it is a dark, gritty, unsafe universe where many of the game mechanics are explicitly design to induce player vs. player conflict. i have already linked ccp falcon's recent comments confirming that this is the design of the game and it is still the devloper's intentions to keep all of new eden, including highsec, and unsafe place. highsec criminals are suppose to exist. wars between highsec entitites are suppose to exist. suicide ganking is suppose to exist. all of these are clearly coded into the the game and not by mistake.eve is fundamentally risk vs. reward, and without at least some risk everywhere, or at least everywhere that can influence the greater game world and economy, the game pretty much breaks, or at least the sandbox part of it does. now if you, or perhaps more appriopriately the csm candidate whose thread this is, can give me specific issues where haulers are at an unfair disadvantage, or there are some quality of life issues that could be addressed by a csm representative i am eager to hear it. if you both are just complaining that haulers can die when then don't use the myriad of tools to protect themself (as i outlined in my original post), i fail to see the point of electing a representative whose sole campaign plank is \"ccp falcon is wrong - highsec should be totally safe\"."
"repeating the same argument over and over does not change certain things. and comments of a ccp employee can be linked from sources in here - linking to the outside sources of manifestos and alike doesn't make it any more valid - we finally entered the level of trolling. there has not been talk of removal but being broken . and i am simply taking part to prevent another high jacking of another thread by you guys. your own candidate has only repeated the words of another person actually -james. and your interest is not to throw in your hat for anyone else but that candidate - so you are trolling. i am sure radu will be happy to answer in depth if you indeed had any serious intentions.and using ccp falcon now to protect your weak chain of arguments is just another low. we are not discussing what he said but what you try to imply. which was never said or stated to begin with. or to use the words of your beloved candidate: high sec is the target-riches part of eve. and making sure that its a hunt and not a battue of the targets is all that happens here."
"i apologize you felt that link is trolling - that was not my intention. ccp falcon's responses are scattered all through that thread so in the interest of making my point concisely, i used the most condensed version i know of. i could spend the time to go through and link them all again directly in this post, but i am not sure that would add anything to the discussion since the accuracy of falcon's words are not in dispute. the point is that ccp falcon was clear about how the game is designed, how it is intended to work, and that design includes haulers being destroyed in highsec. further, i don't see how using the words of a lead ccp developer who clearly states that highsec is a dangerous place where you are responsible for your safety to back up my view that hauler violence in highsec is working as intended is \"another low\". i am just pointing out that this is how the game is designed. haulers are suppose to be at risk in highsec - i am not sure how many times i need to repeat this.this is not about any other candidates - i am seriously interested in what radu has to say. i even bet there might be an issue or two facing haulers, highsec or otherwise, that are worthy of attention. or perhaps he has some ideas on other issues like wardecs which i have been asking other candidates about. but i am not at all convinced that the ganking of highsec haulers is an issue in light of the design of the game - which is suppose to include the ganking of highsec haulers.but i await radu's reply. perhaps he has something to add that i have not considered."
"we might even want the same but our approaches are very different here. for many players - and especially older players - eve was not just a game but a complete world. and as in any world there should be different levels of aggression, complexity and threat levels. eve basically delivered the framework but has moved further and further away from fixing things from a perspective of a entire world towards fixing single elements as used in a game.smart players - which eve is full of - will and have always managed to circumvent and twist mechanics towards their need and flavour. which is why eve is such an interesting environment. but as it stands currently there is basically no room for transition between different levels anymore. a simple look on the map will show massive ship destructions in high sec - which is policed and regulated. the reaction of the owners of that space does not reflect a logical level anymore. if that space would be player owned massive ejects of players from stations in that area would happen, organized hunt of criminals would happen etc etc .the current players in those systems are guests in empire space - they dont own it. so a natural attachment to protect and clean will not happen as ownership will not change - which is one of the highest motivational factors in eve. you expect roleplayers to fight hardcore gamers - that approach is simply wrong. high sec by its nature attracts mainly people who would role play or require guidance towards goals - thats what missions etc do for them. faction warfare and sov null sec on the other hand provide a vast field of sandbox elements - the players make the rules and decide how to execute them and on what level of escalation.there are many things - not just from a ganking perspective - that require csm attention when it comes to high sec. faction war players suffer from a broken mechanic that hurts their sec status - influencing their ability to use high sec as well. gankers suffer less negative consequences right now than a player actually fighting actively for that faction.eve used to have a natural progression from high sec towards low and null sec. with the current mechanics there is no incentive anymore thus a growing number of targets is available for those who play the current empire mechnics for their own purpose. the fixing needed would not only affect gankers but many more groups of people. logistics is the natural connector of all these different groups as basically nothing can be done properly in eve without at least some level of it."
"good morning gentlemen,quite a few things were said here throughout yesterday. as i said, i was away due to the american holiday of thanksgiving but am replying today as promised. this post is a placeholder for the post to come. i just wish to express that i hope the conversation may pause while i draft a formal reply in the interim. it will be an edited post of this one. thank you for understanding and please check back periodically for my actual reply.regards,~ rl"
"yes, and that's why it doesn't need to be safer or easier, or why there necessarily needs to be a csm platform based upon it; it's in everyone's interests. not to mention, one of the best ways of defeating your opponent in a war is to disrupt their supply lines. over the years this has become harder and harder to do through various mechanics tweaks and additions, and npc corporations and broken wardec mechanics only exacerbate the problem. ganking is one of the only ways this can be done close to the source of goods."
"i think that it could be a great addition to the traveling system in eve, if using fuel allowed us to bypass the use of gates.it could be maybe used just in sub-capital ships. instead of traveling from gate to gate, using fuel grants us the ability to travel to the star of an adjacent gate-connected system. instead of forcing fuel into all of us, just add the fuel usage as an alternative of our actual traveling system.this is such an excellent fondon-approved idea that i think it deserves its own thread. i might do it someday."

"corbexx, i voted for you last year, and i greatly appreciate the work you've done for the wormhole community. the new shattered wormholes look awesome, and i'm sure you've been weighing in on their development. my primary point of concern i the fact that you sat through the meeting in which ccp announced their decision to remove high sec awoxing and said almost nothing. could you elaborate on your feelings on this topic?founder of violet squadron, a small gang npsi community! mail me for more information."
"not everything from the meeting is in the minutes, going back and looking through them there is actually a fair bit i said in them. i remember that meeting very well as it became pretty heated. first i think you mean the corp on corp aggression not axowing as awoxing is different.corp mechanics are incredibly complex, very unintuitive. at the moment the optimal way to play in hisec and be safe is to be in a npc corp. removing the corp on corp in hisec is a good thing for newbies who just don't understand the game mechanics. yes there will be issue, yes it will affect rvb and eve uni. but on the whole i think its for the better. you can still infiltrate a corp and steala nd rob them blind, no issue there.every month i go to both of sugar kyles eve uni chat, and this is brought up every month as a issue."
"thanks for the reply. would you agree then that encouraging new players to join corps in high sec is more important than keeping a number of veterans in the game that use this as their primary play-style? i realize corp theft is a major point of gameplay in wormhole space, but it in not available in most cases in high sec. corporations in high sec don't have in space assets in general and function more like communities than cohesive entities. these groups will be virtually impervious to intra-corp aggression unless massive amounts of resources are thrown into suicide ganking their mission ship. if this change occurs there will be no reason to join corps in high sec at all for theft or aggression because a wardec or suicide gank will be required to achieve the same goal. i have a number of friends that are ready to cancel their accounts if this change goes though.founder of violet squadron, a small gang npsi community! mail me for more information."
"unfortunately this has lost you my votes, you were in my top 5 last year. i do not agree that this change will be an improvement to gameplay for anyone. there are ways to protect yourself from intracorp aggression and simply removing it only helps the corporations that can't be bothered to take the proper measures. as far as i'm concerned this will do harm to eve's position as a violent and treacherous game world without actually providing any benefits. people will still remain in npc corps to avoid war decs."
"the first part all depends on numbers which i'm affraid i just don't have.you do realise you can still do corp on corp in nullsec, lowsec and w-space so your friends can still do what they have been doing. i'm not sure why they have to stay in hisec to do this but if there is please mail me lettering me know."
"my counter statement to that would be that it means corporations who chose to remain in hs are immune to it. if i want to bring down a corp i'm going to have to infiltrate and either steal everything or convince them to give me shares, which is true in all space. but if i want to just dish out some quick justice without actually destroying the whole corp, i can now do this anywhere except hs. step 1 to making hs a theme park."
"stop thinking of this as a \"you can pvp anywhere\" thing. let me use a real example. i had someone i wanted to target that is a high sec mission runner. my ability to suicide gank such a target is extremely limited especially since he was flying an armageddon with an extremely heavy tank. any attempt to gank him would cost far more than the ship is worth and require many people. wardeccing would just cause him to close corp and make a new one. this leaves three options:1. get him to leave high sec (ccp kindly added popups warning that you are leaving high sec. this isn't easy)2. trick him into a limited engagement (i was assuming he was smart enough to not fall for this)3. convince him on an alt to let me join his corp. this is not a new player. he has been playing eve significantly longer than i have, so i doubt cheap tricks with lying about game mechanics will work. my only option was to gain his trust, but with the changes in the future, this will be useless.also, the move to low sec suggestion is insulting. i do pvp in low, but it is an extremely target poor environment unless you join an extremely large corp/alliance. null is even worse for small groups, and is even more inaccessible from high sec, and as much as i love w-space the gameplay there is very different.good luck on your campaign.founder of violet squadron, a small gang npsi community! mail me for more information."
"you have my whole-hearted support! anything i can do to help your campaign, please let me know."
"friendly bump, +1."
"to throw a curveball sabriz, do you support the addition of new pve content in high sec? god knows pve in eve is in a boring state right now, what should be done to improve the game experience for those players?founder of violet squadron, a small gang npsi community! mail me for more information."
"sion kumitomo, i'd like to pose the same question to you that i posed to corbexx. you were in the meeting where ccp proposed the removal of high sec awoxing, and barely spoke other than to suggest that suicide ganking is a decent replacement for it. is this actually your opinion, and could you elaborate on whether you support this change?founder of violet squadron, a small gang npsi community! mail me for more information."
"hello all,regarding ganking please see what i have quoted above. it is the tl;dr of the entire thread. in short that post, #32, covers all the basic ground work of what it is you wish to know. it also points you to post #27 which adds to it. but i would very much prefer you read the entire thread.your entire discussion, from posts #'s 35-50 could have gone an entirely different direction had you simply read posts 1 through 35 and in their entirety. therein you would have realized that the points you bring up have already been talked about and logical and fair conclusions drawn.what i have noticed here are two sides that represent their social spheres rather well. but there was very little constructive communication going on because one side was proceeding without the information from the previous posts while the other side assumed those were already read, though dwissi showed signs of realizing you had actually not read. so... before we proceed in constructive discussion please take some time to digest the entirety of this thread and then go on. otherwise this thread will simply become rehash statements, straw man arguments, and become a complete waste of people's times... including those who post willingly uniformed.my next post will be regarding actual subject matter rather than the nature of the 15 post debate, which has just been described.regards,~ radu lupescups - there's a history lesson post that explaining why i sign or initial my posts. as you read you'll come across it."
"hello mr. pedro and mr. hobb,once again, welcome to the discussion.by the time you read this post i imagine that you have taken time to read, at your leisure, this entire thread and are thereby now amply informed on where i stand, why, and what mechanics of mental faculty led me to my reasoning and conclusions (hint: balance, equality, and the integrity of eve online may be a few ). you also understand that i'm not as specifically interested in high sec as i am in hauling and haulers but many of my hauling constituents have a stake there and therefore necessity and concern drew me to more closely examine it as well. that has been done and i feel comfortable with the drawn conclusions so as to approach them when talks between the csm and ccp regarding high sec arise (pending my being elected of course). but what has this discussion of high security space and ganking demonstrated?what you see is a candidate that has a very specific platform yet who is willing to listen to the concerns of all from new eden. you have seen where i was not informed i asked questions. when i received answers i asked more questions. and the questions did not stop until a clear picture presented itself. after that point you saw how i went through each point carefully and used logic and reason, with a dose of history, as the governing factors in my conclusions. in essence... a representative of the hauling community was able to \"reach across the isle\" and allow representatives of the ganking community to build my conclusions with me. and that is a democratic system and how i function and shall function as a csm 10 member.i will say now that you may rest assured that i am more than willing to discuss subjects outside of my platform. and the process of adjudication will once again be repeated until a clear picture of the new subject is presented as well. rinse, repeat, find the logical conclusion to the new subject, it's that simple.i obviously have no idea how the other candidates for csm 10 function or reach their conclusions. i can only hope that it has nothing to do with the devilish word, \"bias\". i say that because the last thing that eve online needs is more bias. currently it would appear that bias is outweighing objectivity in eve, ranging curiously from ccp and blatantly to many newer players, and that is a very dangerous thing. because the moment that bias is a factor... emotions are close to follow. and once you've gotten near that stage... no constructive conversation may be had. that is exactly why in my life, as in eve, i apply every method known to me in order to remove bias from the adjudication process.it's difficult to question my platform given there is simply nobody that solely represents hauling in eve. but i'll be happy to examine any hauling related questions with you. and now that i have a good taste for going outside of my sphere of knowledge intrinsic to my community i look very forward to the next question that stirs the deliberation process.thank you and clear skies,~ radu lupescu"

"excellent question.i'll elaborate when not at work, but the answer is a qualified yes - as long as the new pve content is designed to drive a bit more conflict and player interaction."
"in this long thread much has been written but frankly i still don't have a concrete idea of what ideas you want to bring to the csm. i have a sense of how you and dwissi view the game, and that you think there is too much ganking in highsec but not much else. being a csm member is not a ceremonial position - they are they to provide specific feedback and ideas on the development of the game from the players, not just \"represent\" a player type. therefore, i would kindly ask you consisely and directly answer the following questions so we as voters, know what issues you will prioritize and bring to the attention of the csm and ccp during your first summit if elected:1) what are the top three issues facing haulers today in eve? are there any quality-of-life issues facing them, or is there a need for new ship types or tweaks to make their game play more engaging? are there issues for new players getting into the career?2) in your op, you say that your \"number one goal\" is to give a voice to the \"gank targeted minority\". from the rest of the thread it is clear you think ganking is too prevelent: a) in your view what is the \"proper\" amount of ganking in highsec? you can answer in any metric you want (e.g. 10% of what it is now, 1/1000 chance of gank per undock, none at all, etc.) but i am trying to get a sense of when and in what situations you think a player should be gankable. b) what specific changes in game mechanics would you recommend to the csm/ccp to make highsec haulers more safe?3) do you agree that eve as a game is designed to balance risk vs. reward? if so, from your point of view which activities are most out of balance in the game today - that is pay too much reward for too little risk, or are far too risky for a small amount of reward? i would appreciate as direct answers as possible similar to the ones you would give to ccp at your first csm summit."
"hello mr. pedro,i'll begin by saying that i enjoy how you are now bringing disciplined command to the thread. you are certainly the first representative of your community who has done so. and for this... i am grateful . but now i must address that your structure is based off of a false premise that you, mr. pedro, almost managed point out.you were very close to identifying what happens between the csm and ccp. but i have recently spoken with a member of the csm for counsel. i have also paid close attention to what other csm members have said in open source. during the course of conversation, and examination, a very clear picture was painted for me. one that has absolutely nothing to do with what a csm campaign runner suggests is his or her agenda, but rather, everything to do with who and what that member represents and the constitution of their character and personality. those things are what is most needed in delegating over matters that ccp brings to the csm. given that the opposite, the csm bringing things to ccp, is rare. you will notice that every member who runs for the csm again does not attempt to repeat the silly notion of having 3 things that he or she will boldly throw at ccp for examination. now you know why. i hope you won't mind but i will take your quote and adjust it for accuracy. \"being a csm member is not a ceremonial position - they are to provide personal insight and thoroughly thought out opinions on subjects that are brought to them by ccp for player input. ccp has gone to csm members that represent their constituents, and presented ideas to that csm member but it is available for all members to examine.\"- if there is any inaccuracy in that corrected quote then i will accept the amended version from any current csm office holders and them alone. i do, however, suspect they shan't disagree. with this understanding in mind i will address points that you bring up that remain pertinent after the facts.#1) because of the vast array of potentials that eve holds, new haulers stand a chance at starting in the career of hauling. missioning is available to them and if they are able to find a mentor or proper group they also stand a chance at making money. the idea that a new hauler can make enough money to plex for the month is absurd though because the rewards at this stage of hauling is something that most people would scoff at. - i have already addressed what changes need to occur to the freighter in a previous post. the nature of blockade runners and deep space transports has been touched upon by ccp already and those ships are in fine shape. the bowhead is a great addition to the field of hauling and its ramifications are linked to my freighter changes post. besides this, the orca was not designed as a professional hauling ship therefore it does not count as a middle step between industrial ships and freighters. this means that the creation of a mid-way ship should be considered as there is currently a defect in the industrial to freighter progression.#2) this is a straw man argument as i, nor dwissi, have never stated \"ganking is too prevalent\".a) you need specific statistical data in order to pass such a judgement and that means # of mining ships and hauling ships destroyed by ganking. this would prove an interesting statistic and we could go from there.b) i have already addressed this in a previous post. please avoid rehash if you can.#3) hauling is far too risky for too little reward. the only place where the pay is good is at the jump freighter level. though this necessitates having at least 2 accounts in order to be achievable, 6+ billion for the ship, and several billion in collateral.all of your questions have been answered based on understanding the premise with which they were written. therefore take note that your questions have been answered thoroughly. two of the questions you brought up were already answered in previous posts indicating those posts were not read. so please know, i would rather wait a week for someone to read the entire thread, thereby becoming knowledgeable, and answer that person's informed question(s) than dignify another question based on lack of interest. \"the greatest enemy to knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge.\" ~ stephen hawkings regards,~ radu lupescu"
"this was not even an argument at all, strawman or otherwise. i am just asking for clarification on your view of how the mechanics of highsec ganking should work. when and where should it be possible, and how common do you think it should be?if you do not think that \"ganking is too prevalent\", i apologize for putting words in your mouth but that was my interpretation of statements like yours from the original post: and from dwissi:if you do not think that \"ganking is too prevalent\", then i am even more curious what your views on highsec ganking are.i am not trying to engage you in a discussion. i am asking a clear and specific question about your views on how highsec should work. if you do not think \"ganking is too prevalent\", then what exactly are your thoughts on highsec ganking and the game mechanics that regulate it, and more importantly, what should be changed to make the game better?"
"mr. lupescu, the reason people keep asking you the same questions is because your replies are just a lot of hot air without much substance. perhaps you could deign to answer questions in a concise manner instead of avoiding them? right now i can't tell if you're having too much fun trolling or seriously trying to role-play an american politician. \"yes\" or \"no\" is perfectly sufficient in most cases.ccp has already stated that ganking is at an all-time low. based on that, do you think that ganking is still too prevalent?is this rewards for missions you're talking about or hauling contracts? considering that players create such hauling contracts and set the value to their satisfaction, how do you propose to fix this perceived imbalance?"
"mr. pedro,now we are closer to being on the same page.alright, so... you are actually touching on two separate subjects here: equilibrium between a capital ship and non-capitals (quite a notion that) and the nature of high security space, low security space, and null security space.the first has already been well covered, i want you to know that. but i will digress to recap the initial premises of the drawn conclusions: currently the talos, brutix, catalyst, and others have received buffs that make them favored by gankers. this combined with loopholes in high sec, and the issues with concord/police forces, yield the balance in favor of gankers. the only nerf to ganking, in the classical meaning of the term, has been the insurance nerf. regardless of what angle you look at this subject with, you will find that the balance, which i referred to in my campaign announcement post, is in favor of the ganker. - therefore when you read the conclusions drawn on this thread you will see how if they were implemented there would be greater equilibrium. it is not a question of \"ganking being too prevalent\", it is a question of balancing the offensive capabilities of ganker swarms and the defensive capabilities of the hauler. -----now... first point is a separate entity from the second point and yet is a part of the second point. mind you that this too has already been covered on this thread, however, the conclusions aren't as specific as for the first point. so talking about this isn't quite as rehash, albeit borderline:what we have here is what dwissi brought up in the quote you shared. but for all intents and purposes we must look at what distinguishes the 3 security spaces.we have all heard it said at some point or another that \"null sec is safer than high sec\". ironically there is a lot of logic in that statement. but how is this possible? what is the difference? what we find is that there in no concord or police presence in null sec. we'll hold on that thought for just a moment as another question needs to be answered in conjunction to moving on. what does \"high security space\" mean? the only parallel we can draw in order to reach what such a term means is to look at rl examples (given the term is based off of rl premises). so what are examples of high security irl?high security accesshigh security camera(s)high security fence(s)high security job(s)high security lock-downhigh security prison(s)high security residence(s)high security storage(s)high security truckinghigh security vacation(s)high security vehicle(s)high security zone(s)these are all easily recognizable rl examples of \"high security\". so how does it work in conjunction with eve? first and foremost we have 4 specific areas in new eden controlled by 4 different npc governments. 2 of these are dictatorial in nature: caldari & amarr. the other two are democratic in nature: gallente and minmatar. and there is a slue of eve literature that stresses this. so the term \"high security\" necessitates meaning different things (although similar as just pointed out) in the different spaces. in caldari space, and this is simple philosophical postulation, one might image that it would be a very dictatorial place to live, perhaps similar to the former soviet union. in amarr space one might imagine the stringent precepts of something like religious law. and therefore the term comes closer to what most of western culture is used to when imagining high security in gallente and minmatar space (still something to be very mindful of but nowhere near as badly as in the other two). npc runs hs, players run ns, and there is supposed to be a happy medium in ls. and as dwissi pointed out and alluded to before, this means that standings and security status should be on all high security space residents' minds first, then their professions.the current state of affairs in high sec does not represent any of this though. and given the amount of literature and terminology that has been crafted by and or endorsed by ccp, this means that high security space is far from what it was intended to be. and if ccp is satisfied with the way things are then the simpler solution would be to rename the three spaces and strongly consider doing away with standings and security statuses. players adapt to the environment you provide and having proper definitions is the only way to know what that environment is. that is how it works irl and that is how a realistic and science based game needs to function as well. so i am not against what ccp decides the definition of things should be. i am doing what should be expected of any any csm candidate, examining what the content providers have created and waiting for them to solicit my opinion so that i may help them as best i can on behalf of the player body as a representative of that body. i sincerely hope you see the logic and reasoning in all of this. and i hope you see how the combination of the two points you brought up mean something very different than the commonly thought of means for looking at them.regards,~ rl"
"mr. hobb,i answer questions quite thoroughly and your suggesting i answer with \"hot air\" is disingenuous and insulting. please don't become a troll. i suggest you examine each of the statements said in the past and back your claims rather than attempting some form of tom foolery. and no, i am not playing a politician. i am who i am. in a more relaxed environment i can be \"fun\" too, but we're not here to have fun, we're here to take care of matters that affect thousands of people across the world, and they literally do given the emotional attachments that players form to the games they play.now to your points.> regarding the tired straw man claim that \"ganking is too prevalent\" please read post #58. although the rest of this thread should prove informative for you as well.> regarding rewards being too low:i was referring to both missioning and contracts created by players. one can be adjusted by ccp and the other can be adjusted by something that i would like to see come alive in new eden... h.u.n.ehune stands for the haulers union of new eden. unlike pvp'ers haulers have no collective decision making abilities at the moment. my being elected on the csm is a good first step but more needs to be done. hune is a means of giving the hauler the a similar collective experience as pvp'ers currently have. it is something that i am hoping all hauling corporations can unite under and include all independent haulers as well. further to the point, by being a union, hune would be able to collectively set prices for hauling in new eden. and one might imagine that hune could provide many other benefits for haulers as well. and before you begin with assumptions again, let me answer you, no... there would not be any union dues. regards,~ rl"
"i think that sort of answers my question. if i understand you, you feel that the name \"high security space\" is a bit of a misnomer, and does not actually represent the level of protection offered by the current game mechanics. now for an actual argument: i would counter that ccp falcon's comments suggest that high security space as it currently is, regardless of its name, is exactly what ccp intended it to be: a place where there is risk. i see no need for it, but i would not strenuously oppose a change of name to better reflect the level of protection that ccp has currently implemented for highsec if you think the name is misleading.i now have enough information to make my decision on whether your views align with mine and whether to cast a vote for you. thank you for your time, but i would encourage you to to try and be much more clear and succinct with your views if you want others to seriously consider your candidacy."
"#58 is nothing more than you going over semantics and what ccp actually intends by the words \"high security\" (in other words, hot air). presumably if ccp changed the name of high-sec to \"probably medium security but call it whatever you want\" you'd have no problem with the state of it? is the definition that important to you or would you prefer to see some mechanics changes either way? what if ccp intended \"high-security\" to be in relation to the other areas of space rather than in relation to a real-world definition? would you agree that high-sec is, indeed, higher in security than low-sec space?regarding ganking, since you seem to have trouble giving a straight answer, i will assume you think it is still too prevalent even after all of the nerfs to make it less attractive.hauling missions run virtually no risk whatsoever, why should they pay more? as far as your union, good on you, i hope it works and that you're prepared to strong-arm undercutters."
"thank you mr. pedro,i'm sorry that you did not find my replies informative enough but i am glad that you feel you have an informed opinion regarding my candidacy and are ready to make a decision based off of this.regarding ccp falcon's comments: i have seen his name used a good bit by you and others as reference for ccp's official stance. this is problematic though given that he and a seemingly strong contingent within ccp have null sec based history as their reference. although ccp falcon has made statements about this i would be curious to see if everyone else at ccp (especially those that have been working there longer) feel the same. it's fine that he feels that way and it makes sense, but a small inquiry simply to see if it's a unanimous statement is called for, i believe. supposing they all feel the same, after said inquiry, then i would do my best to help provide opinions on what can be done to still close loopholes and adjust the balance between defensibility and offensibility in high security space. and also, pending that they admit it is a misnomer, would be happy to help by providing opinions regarding placing solid definitions that make it very clear as to what is the desired environment of that space (thereby needing adjustments throughout the rest of new eden as well). mind you this renaming is still something that opposes the historical context of high sec.supposing it is not unanimous then a redefining, potentially more content creation, and what i've talked about before should be examined as well. again, i would like to be apart of that process too.best of luck to you mr. pedro and thank you for your questions.~ rl"
"mr. hobb,i'm afraid you are neglecting the first portion of post #58. i suspect it is simply because you like your stance and wish to ardently maintain it rather than have open minded and intelligent discourse (as other members of your community have had on this thread). please read post #58 in its entirety and reconsider what you have just typed.i have given many answers regarding a complicated matter. i'm sorry that \"yes or no\" is the extent of your inquiry into something that can't be answered that way. i am not concerned with the prevalence of ganking. i am concerned with balance. provided there is equal ability for balance and things get tightened (loopholes) and the mater is settled mechanically and dogmatically, then the game is running fine. until that time though, it is clearly not. the posts by mr. lowery clearly point out current flaws. the posts by dwissi show the dogmatic discrepancies. the posts by mr. amatin show the nature of the ganking situation from the inside. the posts by admiral root raised decent talking points. the posts by mr. pedro offer decent cross examination. and the posts by me have offered logical and reasonable conclusions. had you read then you'd see why your statements are uninformed. i have given you all of the resources available so that you could ask questions that haven't already been answered. i am more than welcoming of fresh questions (to your credit you did ask one) and fresh topics. but if you ask or say another uniformed or out of context thing i will consider you a troll and leave it at that. good day to you mr. hobb,~ rl-----anyone wishing to ask questions based off of previously made conclusions or introduce new topics are more than welcome to do so.thank you for reading over this thread and thereby having an informed opinion.o7"
