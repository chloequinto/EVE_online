"i did, you suggested if a person has 20 million clone the killer gets 20 mill so if a alt kills the bountyed target they lose nothing, and they take down the bounty. what i suggested is half of the value of isk lost that does not come back through insurance is given to the killer. would make farming ones self with a bounty a money losing venture. one tweek to payouts removes a huge portion of exploits."

"hi there. i apologize in advanced if what i am about to say has already been said i haven't got the time to read through the whole thread, especially given the length of the average post in here. although i have skim read over most of it.first, i would like to say that i support this suggestion. but i think if you are going to make \"bounty contracts\" they should be kept separate from the system that is already in place. i was in the process of writing up a very similar suggestion when i found this thread so for the sake of simplicity i am going to post what i was going to post anyway below for you guys to consider. splitting the bounties this way solves some problems you were discussing earlier. if you use contracts only for people who you trust, then you dont have to worry about people accepting the contract just to void the money also, why not just have the money in escrow and have it returned if the contract expires or is cancelled. public bounties would never run out, so you wouldn't have to worry about that.i would also like to say, that i don't think having kill rights on someone should be an essential part of making a bounty contract. if someone scams you, or war decs you repeatedly, or tricks a n00b into stealing from a can and blowing them up etc etc, it would be nice for them to be able to put a meaningful bounty on that person. it will help newer players feel empowered where at the moment they feel helpless. i also think that adding killrights into the equation over complicates matters. also, having the bounty payout as a % of their total loss is important because otherwise players can use it like the old insurance scam, where people used to pay for platinum insurance and then kill themselves because it saves selling the ships out in empty nullsec or whatever.i was also going to suggest that locator agents be added to the agent finder to make bounty hunting a more plausible profession. i am always surprised to find that even some older players have never used a locator agent, or some didn't even know they existed.\"in the age of information, ignorance is a choice.\" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
"the problem with allowing anyone to put a bounty on anyone assuming that the bounty system is itself worth a damb is that it can then be abused to harass \"innocent\" players.for instance: i say you are a corp thief. yes you, you dirty thief. and i'm putting a bounty on you, so that random strangers are now incentivised to kill you, on my unsupported word. good luck ever flying a small ship or a hauler again, buddy."
"well this is true. i would argue however that your in a similar situation already. assuming you don't get your alt to claim the reward back, then you cant travel in your pod in high-sec for fear of suicide ganking. without transferable kill-rights, it is only suicide gankers you have to be careful of there. and then you only have to be careful of them if they can kill you in something where their loss is less than 75% of yours. you are right, this is a potential griefing mechanism. but its in no way worse than the current war dec mechanics, or suicide ganking, or scamming, etc etc. i would argue that if i were a corp theif which i might be >.> it would be cheaper for you to pay a merc corp, or get your corp/alliance to declare war than it would to put a bounty big enough to hinder my progress in high-sec. or probably the cheapest option is for you to suicide gank them yourself. you would have to be really really lazy and really really rich to do it that way. even then, your better of paying merc corps for a war dec. moar tears that way aswell.just something to think about. i personally think your better off doing it this way, than to introduce kill-rights into the equation or make all bounties by contract only.\"in the age of information, ignorance is a choice.\" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
"kill rights must be part of the equation, but i am not sure they need to be the only part.with transferable kill-rights, the kill-rights system gains some value it does not currently have.i do see malcanis' point about bounties being used to grief, and there is certainly an issue with that i am not sure how to resolve.it would be great if there was a way to place a bounty on a corp-thief, but there is no in-game method to discern them from honest corp members with access to a wallet. any suggestions i have that would address this problem bring what i think is excess complexity to this issue bounties could be tied to isk taken from a wallet, but that doesn't cover ships/items stolen; you could be able to select certain corp-wallet withdrawals and secure container log entries and label them theft, and that covers almost everything, but that's ~really~ complex and hard work for ccpfor now, i think limiting it to active kill-rights, -1 secstatus, and possibly wardec participants internal corp wardec bounties! would cover all the reasonable options. with the idea that it could be improved if there's a better way to cover the less obvious bad-types."
"\"assuming that people don't use the obvious and failsafe workaround to negate the bounty, the bounty could be a problem\"yeah, no. as said above, it would be good in principle if there were a way to put bounties on characters for \"crimes\" that don't involve sec loss and kill rights, but it's just not really possible. as i asked on the previous page, how do you design a mechanism that allows a bounty on a corp thief but that disallows one on a corp director using corp funds legitimately? how do you have a mechanism that allows a bounty on an ore thief, but not a bona fide hauler?so far as i'm concerned, you'll just have to do it the old-fashioned, under-the-table way, by paying mercs directly. on the plus side, assuming we get a working bounty system, there will be many more players who will specialise in bounty hunting who i am sure would be more than happy to use their experience and assets to undertake such... unofficial jobs.of course, that would mean that the bounty hunters would risk getting bounty contracts placed on themselves... oh the possibilities!"
"the true purpose of the last post i made, of which you took the meaning of one sentence and then assumed the rest was rubbish, is the following;i just think the potential for griefing really isn't a problem. i do think however that adding killrights as an obligatory part of the bounties makes them just as useless as they are now and horribly complicates the matter. having to mechanize when bounties can be used makes them practically useless. i don't want to put a bounty on some chap who killed me in lowsec. as far as im concerned, i'm fair game to him. people want to be able to put bounties on people who are just *******s, or who scammed them, or suicide ganked them, repeatedly war dec'd them, etc.\"in the age of information, ignorance is a choice.\" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
"you said it yourself - without killrights, bounties only matter to suicide gankers. either the bounty system is effective enough to allow griefing when bounties are unrestricted or it isn't. decide."
"in highsec - bounties would change the equation for suicide gankers drastically.you would know that the target was worth x amount.it wouldn't be subject to random drop chance.it would be in addition to any other loot dropped.it would apply to all ships from the lowliest pods to the most expensive officer modded ships.in effect, applying a no-killright bounty to a player in highsec means they would have to recalculate their own value as a suicide gank target to compensate, and as the bounty would likely stick around for a long time - they would either be repeatedly suicide ganked, or they would have to fly around in much cheaper or tougher ships all the time. it would be a major hindrance to play.it would also affect poorer pilots adversely much, as they couldn't afford to try to clear the bounty an older character could afford to place.pilot a 2-3 years in game, bored places a relatively trivial 1bil bounty on newbie pilot b 1-12 months in gamepilot b now is in danger of being ganked constantly since he is worth extra as a suicide gank target.pilot b has this problem for the time it takes them to reasonably amass, and then lose, over 1 bil in assets.ps: this system does, with killrights, allow you to place bounties on people who suicide ganked you. you currently get kill-rights for that."
"you paint it in a rather black or white way which it isn't really. you sir, are manipulating my words. i said in highsec, yes. which means that the bounty payout must be sufficiently high for anyone to want to try and kill someone in highsec. or, high enough to warrent the bounty hunter's corp or bounty hunting corp taking out a war dec, in order to complete the contract. you said it could be used to seriously grief people, i didn't say it couldn't. i said it wouldn't very often and isn't as bad as other methods of griefing. not that it wouldn't happen. i just said that it \"isn't a problem\".it would make it difficult for people to collect bounties in highsec, but shouldn't it be difficult to kill people in highsec anyway? with your system it will be nearly impossible to hurt people who plague you in nullsec because people with 90+ isk efficiencies out there often have high positive standings, and never give kill rights. difficult is not impossible. if you build killrights into the mechanics, it will be impossible rather than difficult to put a bounty on some people. ccp like open ended gameplay, and so do i.\"in the age of information, ignorance is a choice.\" www.stateofwar.co.nf"

"or even negative feedback will help to improve the concept if you explain your reasons for disliking the proposal. as long as it focuses on titan balance, without bringing supercarriers or other regular capitals into the discussion, i should be able to continue to improve the concept."
"your proposal isn't bad tyran and it may be able to address the issues behind the ability of fleets to kill a titan and therefore limit their proliferation by increasing the number of titans being destroyed. however, these fleets would need to be made up of more titans/supers/caps. this would therefore increase the number of titans built and not limit their propagation in eve.what it seems to me you are doing is effectively creating is another tier whitin eve. sub-capital ships will no longer matter in capital fights as is the case now, and once titans get deployed in a fight, it will be a matter of how many more titans the other side can deploy to counter this. that is one of the points made by mechael in his post.instead, as with the sub-capital system, where smaller ships can be immune to larger vessels and be useful in fighting them, so sub-capitals need to matter in capital fights. therefore the answer, in my opinion, would be to make adjustments to the current capital ships to make them less effective against sub-capital ships remove tracking or damage done to sub-caps whilst allowing sub-capital ships to have some effectiveness against capital ships ewar, tackle, damage?.how this is done... i am unsure... and there are certainly a lot of threads exploring numerous options. if the removal of immunities, reduction of tracking and nerfing of ehp aren't applied, then there were notions of a sub-capital ship with bonuses against the capital ships - or perhaps these ideas in tandem may restore some balance between these two classes."

"what amarr and caldari prefer has no bearing on what slot arrangement a minmatar ship should have. also, while the ship's faction matters when choosing the best slot arrangement, a lot more hinges on what the ship is used for. electronic warfare ships generally have a lot of mid slots because ewar modules are mostly mid slot modules and are never low slot modules except for the modules that boost the power of the mid slot ewar modules. as far as i am aware, there are zero electronic warfare ships that have more low slots than mid slots; and the only ewar ships with the same number of mids as lows are the arbitrator, pilgrim, crucifier, and vigil. three of them are amarr ships; while they would want mid slots for tracking disruptors, they are also likely to use energy vampires or neutralizers. the arbitrator and crucifier do not have energy transfer module bonuses, but the arbitrator has a slot setup suggesting that it might be fit with those. the crucifier looks like it could use another high slot, but that's a topic for another discussion. also, all three of those amarr ships have more armor hp than they have shield hp. the vigil, however, is almost entirely dependent on its mid slots. it gets a skill bonus to target painting, and due to its small signature radius, high speed and agility, and low hit points in comparison to the other t1 ewar frigates, it can be assumed that it was intended to use speed to survive. with a propulsion module, it only has 2 mid slots remaining. it can fit 2 target painters, but that leaves no room for stasis webifiers which stack extremely well with target painters. alternatively it can use 1 painter and 1 webifier, in which case it does not stack multiple effects from the same type of module at all and only one of its modules actually gets a ship skill bonus. finally, there are no low slot modules that will boost the effectiveness or range of a target painter or stasis webifier. so with this setup, a vigil on the field is about as effective as a stasis webifier and target painter fit onto any other ship say a drake that had a loose enough fit to put them on, meaning it's using up a whole pilot to fill a redundant fleet position.do you see now why it makes sense for the minmatar ewar frigate to have more mid slots than other slots?to recap: its target painting bonus requires mid slots to be used it and the hyena have the amarr ewar frigate/electronic attack ship slot setup, while the gallente slot setup is inbetween amarr and caldari minmatar ewar is both target painters and stasis webifiers, and relies strongly on their cumulative effects when used together; either one alone is less crippling than all other major ewar modules [*] ewar frigates almost invariably will be fitted with a propulsion module if they have any desire to stay alive through an engagement"

"stasis webbers and target painters give a damage boost to your whole side of a fight. having 3 4 for your t2 mids 1 for a mwd one for a painter and one for a webber gives your whole gang at least 5% damage boost. this type of ewar is really minmatar as it just helps you kill the primary even faster, and helps projectiles as they do most of there work in fall off.the problem is not that you don't get enough ewar its the platform is poor at delivering said ewar. all it would take to make them good is the ability to survive long enough to make the boost to your gang count. even if you give the hyena 5 mids and enough cpu to fit it all with webbers and painters it still go's up in smoke the moment some one locks you.i think losing a bonus, doubling the webber range bonus and doubling the base lock range would do far more for the hull than even +3 mids ever could."

"why would my proposal require more titans/supers/caps than we have now? yes there would be more ship options for capital pilots, but i don't see how that impacts titan production rates.what makes you think this would be the case? my proposal removes over half of a titans capabilities, and the only ones it has left cant harm sub-caps at all.this is not quite correct; frigates are weak to destroyers, which are weak to cruisers, which are weak to battle-cruisers, which are weak to battleships, which are weak to frigates. to continue the concept, sub-caps are weak to capitals, which are weak to supers, which should be weak to sub-caps. regular capital fleets should be able to crush a sub-cap fleet, while a super fleet should be terrified of a sub-cap fleet.i really hope you meant to say supercapitals.... because if not, you would be removing the counter to sub-caps, just as the titan currently has no counter. actually, as i've pointed out, there are already 3 classes, sub-caps, capitals, and supers."
"since you split the role of one titan current into 3 different titans proposed, it can be a valid assumption that this would lead the current titan pilots to want all 3 ships to retain their full capabilities. unless these ships would each require a different stream of skills specific to their class, i would say it would propagate the titans further.the only counter-argument would be that the current csaas are already spitting out as many titans as they can which would therefore force them to streamline into one of the 3 titan types each time they build one. however, where there is a demand, there will inevitably be supply and your proposal increases the demand for titans threefold.yes, your proposal streamlines the current titan into 3 separate ships but without further clarity around what exactly their capabilities would be, i can only be lead to assume that the superdreadnaught 3rd titan suggested which you mentioned would retain the current titans combat capabilities - if appropriately fitted and boosted, would still be able to hit and 1-shot sub-capitals.except they are not. as soon as titans get on the field, sub-caps cease to matter. again, it would seem that at least one of your titans suggested would still be able to maintain this imbalance.my mistake.agreed. however, class-related oversights aside - the current ability of sub-capitals to affect supers in any meaningful way is very limited and in my opinion your proposal unfortunately does not address this problem."
"my proposal splits the current titan into a titan mkii, a mothershipworking title, and a superdreadnaught. the mothership is a vanilla capital akin to the rorqual. the titan mkii and superdread are supercapitals which each have half of the current titan's combat capabilities. both of these two supers would be undockable under current game mechanics making it impossible for current titan pilots to have more than one of them. this was all outlined in my proposal.go read post #2 in this thread, it outlines precisely what abilities go to which ships, and also asks for suggestions improving said divisions. i re-arranged my post just this morning, and you may have read it during the change.i said should. obviously they aren't currently, which is part of what this proposal is designed to fix.as laid out in post #2 in this thread, superdreads would have the titans capital weapons systems and the ability to siege. they would be based on an upgraded dread hull, and as such would have a dread's tracking stats. the titan mkii would get the superweapon, and fleet bonuses. the superweapon needs a rebalance too, which is noted in post #2, and i have a suggestion for the new superweapon in post #3.edit: actually looks like the mention of the superdread being based on a dread slipped through he cracks somewhere... fixing that now."

"i'm confused. your title talks about all minmatar ewar, but your post refers only to the eaf. your proposal does not involve boosting minmatar ewar per se, but the minmatar eaf instead. please can you clarify your proposal? other random ships do not get web range bonuses, so they can never replicate the web range of a hyena. many would say that this holds true for all eafs. you are arguing for a boost to the hyena only; this can only be justified if it is agreed that the hyena is significantly worse than the other eafs. you need to support this assertion. alternatively, you may decide that all eafs need help."
"oh dear god!this a request to buff minmatar eaf's!!!you said it wasn't a buff to eaf's in your other post and our replies were 'off topic'.as you were told in the other post by the way? cross posting is frowned on by ccp changing the slot lay out will not help the eaf's in the slightest. the problem with them is they die as soon as someone in jita sneezes. they have no range on the ewar mods so have to fight stupidly close to anything that can kill them and with no tank you'd be better of flying something else.the fact remains that all of the eaf's need attention and ccp has already acknowledged this.as it stands, minmatar eaf's are no better or worse than any other races....they all suck as they stand.again, not supporting this proposal."
"don't quote post #1 here. you're clearly too inept to understand it, so pretend it didn't happen. focus only on what i said in this one.my first post was about a lot of things, and you all ignored the vast majority of it, therefore this one is only about one thing. for every webifier that the hyena fits, there is a target painter it is not fitting. its bonuses represent three separate kinds of modules, thus unless it has all three present, it gets less than 4 bonuses. that leaves very little room to stack multiple effects on top of each other. that's my whole point here. not just a little part of it. that's my whole point. a hyena only paints significantly better than random fleet member x if either random fleet member x hasn't fit a painter, or if the hyena has fit more than 1 painter. same with the webifier, and on the point of range, while its range is much better, with multiple fleet members having webifiers equipped, there is generally a good chance that any given primary will have a webifier in range from one of the fleet members other than the hyena. if you don't get this, just say \"i don't get it\". but don't make a huge rant about how i'm missing points that you're too lazy to read about in my posts.once again, claiming i didn't support why hyena is worse than other eafs because you're too lazy to read the part where i did. and even after i condensed it for you."
"this is incoherent. you tell me not to quote post #1, then you tell me to focus on it. you sound confused. why does your thread title refer to minmatar ewar in general, but your op only talks about eaf? please clarify this.like the keres, you mean? i don't understand why you regard this as acceptable for the keres, but not for the hyena. there is a logical fallacy here, i think, and a fundamental failure to grasp that ship balance is determined by more factors than adding up medslots. you have not shown why you believe the hyena to be worse than the other eafs, because you have not mentioned the other eafs."
"+1 let's put that risk vs reward concept into more things then just pew."
"while i get the motivation...you are aware that your going to make a severe change to the market right?================ stop the evemail spam!"
"prices might rise a little to offset higher production costs, but since the aim is to provide a reward for low/null indy's for their increased risk in the form of a larger profit margin compared to hisec indy's that's not bad imho.so yes i'm aware."
"a little no...alot...yes.dont underestimate the market....even a slight pebble causes huge ripples of isk.this idea is all good and fine but in the end its likely gonna cause more harm than good.but i'm not gonna make a judgement call on this just yet...think ill sit back and observe for a bit. ================ stop the evemail spam!"
"actually yeah. after going through a few wardecks the only people who actually fight back are people with stuff to lose in space. this would actually add risk vs reward to highsec. a corp would have the choice of... a. working out of stations only knowing that if anything bad happens all their valuables can be safely docked.b. have a more efficient and cheaper pos out in space that can get shot at and needs defending.... well assuming ccp reworks wardeck mechanics, and a pos fix would be nice too.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"poss are player-owned, why should they have taxes?i support this topic, and in fact have actually brought it up before. there are generally zero research/manufacturing slots available of all types in my whole region, including lowsec. given how many total slots there are, i can only assume this is because there are players putting various blueprints into the slots for months at a time when they're not getting any significant bonuses out of doing so, simply because they aren't paying anything either. that would explain why there are blueprints with, say 200+ material efficiency when its tritanium cost is the same at 25 material efficiency or less."
"yes, ewar frigates need some sort of survival buff, however i didn't bother to address that in this post because it is a complicated issue i don't even have a good answer for. but the point i was making was not that 3 mid slots is not enough to do good ewar, rather that it is not enough to make the ship have a stronger ewar effect than a fully fit non-ewar battlecruiser. if giving it more mid slots makes it too powerful, then nerf the target painters and/or stasis webifiers.the bonuses you mention would have a much weaker effect without those mid slots being added. no matter how much you boost the lock range and web range, you aren't fixing the heart of the issue which is that its ewar is only marginally stronger than a drake with a target painter and webifier. the drake, however, contributes far more to the fleet than just its ewar. it also has far greater survivability in almost all situations, and for only slightly more cost than the hyena."
"you really can't compare a bc especially one of the top two in the game currently to a support frigate. it's just not a fair comparison."
"oh gee, let me see where i got that from....ah, yesso basically you are stating only eaf's aren't used for their intended roles? if so, why not just ask that eaf's be fixed along with about 20 other threads in here asking for the same thing?any buffs to ewar modules will benefit the recon ships as well. they already work very well for their intended roles except dampeners.buff eaf's, not the ewar modules themselves, otherwise you will make recon's very overpowered.as already stated, adding more slots or rearranging the slot layout on eaf's will not help them in the slightest. they will still go down in flames as soon as anything locks them.they either need a buff to range of the ewar mods or a buff to their tank."
"i can, because the point i am making is that they both have approximately the same ewar impact, and the difference in what they add to the fleet other than ewar is tremendously clear. that's the entire basis of my statement that the vigil and hyena need more mid slots, to make them better at ewar than non-ewar ships.if the drake had, say, three times the effective hp of the hyena, it would last about as long as the hyena in most engagements as its higher hp are perhaps just enough to counter its larger sig radius and slower speed. if it also fit about the same amount of firepower as the hyena, and someone was arguing that since the drake had a resistance bonus and missile bonus, that it should therefore have better tank and dps than a hyena, would you actually try to dispute that?"
"this isn't a thread about electronic attack frigates though it has sort of turned into one, it was supposed to be a thread specifically about balancing minmatar ewar with other races' ewar. in the case of the hyena and vigil, they differ from other ewar frigates by bringing nothing to the field; they are essentially a redundancy and waste of a pilot. it is rather indisputable that all other ewar frigates, for all their shortcomings, are better than non-ewar ships at ewar."
"this is the only intelligent thing i've seen anyone else post yet on this whole thread:you were right about that, i concede. otherwise, everything else that has been said by you guys has been vapid at best, and dead wrong rather often."
"minmatar ewar is finest.also eaf's dont need more slots if you want to be better at ewar buy more expensive ship your problem is solved right away. they are throwaway crap you fly when you want to explode. don't ask them to be some kind of blueballing ships.please move to features and ideas."
"you really need to make up your mind whether you want to buff ewar mods or you are talking about buffing eaf's because so far you have veered one way then the other. even your post above says buff ewar but you then go on to eaf's again.as as already been stated by a few people here, all of the eaf's are not used that much because they die very quickly so don't really help in any fleet. minmatar aren't any different from gallente, caldari or amarr eaf's in that respect. when was the last time you saw a sentinal, kitsune or keres in any fleet actually doing it's intended role? i've never seen them used in any fleet since they appeared in game.the t1 ewar cruisers do a better job and actually live longer so why even bother with any eaf's?you really really can't buff the ewar modules themselves as you will make the recon class ships stupidly overpowered. huginns and rapiers already do very very well at their intended roles. why make them even better?the only ewar module that really needs fixed is dampeners.i think you should reconsider what you are actually asking to be fixed, then come back and be very specific about your 'fix' and why it's needed, otherwise your idea will get shot down in flames again."
"holy crap! i didn't see this one and i can't believe you actually compare a bc to an eaf!!! seriously???so your newest idea is give eaf's the tank of a bc?you are missing a very important point here. the eaf's are frigates that have zero tank in comparison to a bc.the bc will out live an eaf by a country mile so will seem to be better than a dedicated ewar ship even without it's bonuses.if the drake had the same bonuses as the kitsune does, then that would be the only ship to be flown in eve!! awesome tank, moderate firepower, stupid ewar capabilities. why fly anything else??i now think you are just trolling. well done, i fell for it. +1 internets to you sir."
"very much this. if you are not saying that the huginn and rapier are unused and need to be buffed, then why are you proposing buffing them via blanket changes to ewar mods?if you are instead saying that the hyena needs to be buffed, then you need to decide whether the hyena is poor relative to other eafs, or whether the eafs as a class are poor. if it's the latter which it is, than the solution is not a buff to the hyena alone, instead you need to decide how to buff eafs in general."
"i'm done here. no matter how many times i re-iterate the same rebuttals, you guys completely ignore what i say and make the same already-refuted arguments against it. i'm going to make a new post to get rid of this nonsense. i'm going to streamline the entire thing and take out all that juicy intelligent stuff i said about balancing, and instead feed you a ultra-concentrated short-form mass of text that will clarify exactly why you guys are wrong and i'm right, and moreover will reveal to you the idiocy of everything you have said here. i'm telling you this here so you know what to look for when you read it later."
"well make sure it is very clear what you want to fix and, more importantly, why.this proposal was a mess from the start."
"i would like to propose a cumulative bonus to hulls of the same faction working together in fleet when a command ship is boss. this in the interests of improving the effectiveness of command ships and encouraging same faction fleets.edit: withdrawn"
"yes, homogenous fleets is what eve needs. let's remove any variety and force people to train for very specific fits.seriously, even by ah standards this is an extraordinarily bad idea."
"you have a point, groups training specific complementary skills for the purpose of getting an edge are playing the wrong game.and variety is not imposed by the chaos of real life in any way."
"yeah i can't really see this ending badly fleets can't consist solely of one faction as they would be less effective, not more.for example, say you have an all minmatar fleet in arty canes. how do you stop all of the enemy fleet just laughing at you and warping off? sure you could use a sabre but that sabre isn't going to live long in the middle of an enemy fleet well outside logistics range.this is why you see a lot of lachesis in large fleets for a massive range on the point to hold ships long enough to kill them.quite a few gallente ships complement minmatar ships. gallente/minmatar recon combination is one of the best in the game.even in small fleets this would be a bad idea. ecm is prevalent in small fleet warfare so by bringing all the same faction, you make the kitsune, blackbird, falcon, rook and scorpion pilot's lives so much easier as they just fit one racial type for jammers.there are lots of different reasons why a same faction fleet isn't a good idea.i am sure others will come up with more examples for you.not supporting this proposal."
"yeah, we really don't need to penalize fleet diversity, not supported at all."
"as more experienced voices have been heard to voice legitimate arguments against, i respectfully withdraw the proposal.thank you for the consideration."
"i am pretty sure they can at the moment on stealth bombers.as to 60km on other ships? not sure that would be that great. sniping torp raven's would give me nightmares."
"i can't really speak for your corp/alliance but in mine i normally find out about fleets because:1 my ceo screams at me to join or i get tarred and feathered 2 my alliance chat is spammed to hell and back with the fleet 3 the fc screams at us to join fleet or else 4 my corp chat is spammed with the fleet 5 corp/alliance people scream at us on comms to stop being terribad carebears and join fleet6 planned ops are posted on the forums in advance to help the terrible spies we have7 really important ops are usually sent out in an alliance maili don't think adding any more range to the fleet finder is really necessary unless your corp/alliance only have secret fleets you are not suppose to know about."
"+1 there's no rush to add new sounds, but this is something ccp should eventually look at. i think it makes it harder for new players to take the game seriously. the effects aren't bad. they're laughable. reminds me of cheesy 16-bit console games i played"

"i like a lot of this. i've always wanted some type of rts eletment to eve, available to players.a couple notes though:the \"bank should not be able to generate any isk from nothing.\"any setup where it does is wide open to abuse.allowing moon goo to be extracted from wh's, would likely crash the market for it unfortunatlyalso related to wh's, supercaps should not be able to be built in wh's, and here's why.at the moment, it is very difficult to conquer anyone entrenched in a wh due to mass limitations.the reason for these mass limitations was to promote some of the 'small gang pvp' that everyone loves.allowing players to build supers inside a wh, would make said wh essentially invincible if even one were produced.finally, as much as i hate to say it, it took ccp years to give the assault frigs a little bit of love. i doubt they're going to go doing anything as big as this unfortunately :"
"taking a peek at the files on the client, i see cached texture maps. i don't see cached skeletons though. i expect that this means the skeletons are either packed and i missed them or more likely they're stored server-side. in fact, they must be stored server-side for that view full body button to work. that means that to support mods, they'd have to change to local skeletons or support uploads of player-contributed skeletons, which could easily break things. either way it's a fair bit of dev time.now adding an additional few bones and some mild weightings, on the other hand, should be easy."

"shame you can't export your bookmarks so that you can just load them up as and when you are living in a new region."
"you can. just copy them then drop them into a can. sadly the cans only hold 1000 per. after that it will tell you that you have hit your limit. then you have to do that more and more. we are talking about 1500 per region or so. including the hour it takes you to remove them and the 5 to 10 hours it takes to re-install them.just asking for ccp to give us more room. how much would it take to actually allow this!?"
"ffseverybody always talks about \"fix titan tracking\"or\"there's too many titans\"or other **** like thatthere's a simple solution to this!not allowing capitals to use other capitals' fitting servicestracking titans are rediculously easy to kill. seriously.the problem is that if you shoot one, they use the fitting service of another nearby super, and instantly have a wtf-pwn tank.the fix isn't fancy. it's quite basic. easy as that."

"actually they are reimbursing ships pretty well.process can take over a month thoughit is however very unlikely you get reimbursed if you lost ship because of lag/disconnect caused by the usual fleet fight and that is okay since you should know by that point when there's more than just 10 people in system that it might just happen.disconnect and crashes are just common in fleet fights, when i started playing it was normal to crash in fight when you got more than 20 people in field.i think common principle is that if you lost your ship in pve you get reimbursed more likely than if it was a case in pvp. and it makes sense. i've also seen ships reimbursed pretty well if it was a case of unexpected server slowdown or bug. however, again your personal client crashing in fleet fight doesn't count on it. if you participate in fleet fights you eventually crash one day and lose a ship just get over it and dont fly anything you cannot afford to lose :d"

"you haven't a clue what you're talking about so how do you expect anyone else to understand what you are talking about?this is solely an attempt to buff one ship over the rest. why should the hyena only get a buff but the other eaf's get ignored?guess what? this is eve where you have to make tough choices about your ship fit.i would love to have a full rack of 425's, ham ii's, 4 neuts, 3 td ii's, 4 ecm and a bomb launcher on a hurricane but i can't because the ship doesn't support it.the hyena doesn't support all of it's bonuses at the same time, so you need to choose. tough life really. seriously, you need to stop posting about this now."
"this is a horrible distortion of the actual data. your 3 \" types of mid slot modules represented in skill bonuses on electronic attack ships by race\" is including the mwd sig reduction. since prop mods are something every frigate fits, you're presenting a distorted viewpoint.here's another way of looking at that same data:distinct and bonused ewar modules per racial eaf hull:sentinel: 3 tds, neuts, and noskitsune: 5 4 different types of racial ecm and multispec ecmkeres: 3 point, scram, and dampshyena: 2 web and tptotal number of slots per hull:sentinel: 12kitsune: 12keres: 12hyena: 12so, by your logic, since all of the other eafs have more ewar modules they are bonused for, then all but the hyena especially the kitsune really need more slots. personally, i'm not trying to say anything about the slot requirements of the eafs, i'm saying that presenting data only from a slanted viewpoint that backs your position is shoddy posting at best. you should bring real logic and all the information to the discussion, not just the data that supports your position.the eafs are relatively balanced atm; but they're all balanced in being paper-tanked primaries. it's not that the hyena or any of the eafs needs a buff, it's that eafs as a class need a buff. until the eafs as a class are buffed, talking about individual ones is completely pointless."
"eaf do not need buff. it is a good thing they are paper thin primaries that's how they only get used in situtations they are probably meant to. i.e in a small frigate gang they are pretty cool.if you want a ship which survives in a bigger gang take a recon ship.tough world. you cannot wtfpwn everything with frigates. so sad."

"...since you bumped this, here's the thing.it might look cool when pre-rendered, but i think it would end up looking kinda ****** for pretty much everyone involved.remember that from your perspective, all you'd really see is the grid disappear.and from someone else's perspective, all you'd really see is their ship disappear.i don't think that the effect would look quite as cool as you think when implemented, i mean its all well and good when the camera is already hovering in the exact spot you need for an impressive fly-by, but from a realistic standpoint, it wouldn't end up looking all that impressive.now to a practical standpoint.when you warp in, and have the deceleration, it gives you a few moments to grab your bearings before everything goes to hell.similarly, when somebody is trying to warp on top of you, as it stands, you have a couple fractions of seconds to make a decision.imagine on-grid warping for a second. you're in sniperhacs around 70km off their cr fleet. they will try to ping off, and get a warp in on you.they ping. but because there's no acceleration or deceleration, they just kinda pop to a new spot. especially if there's a lot on grid, and things are getting a bit framey, you'll just see ships teleporting around.when they warp on top of you, same thing. they can warp and bubble, before you even know they warped. they'd just \"teleport\" right on top of you.this would break the already dubious state that sniping fleets are already at."

"i think someone in the other thread was basically on the right track when they interpreted what the op said in a slightly different way, where instead of:\"if your minimum amount is 100% of the quantity of the order then you have to put 100% of the isk up for escrow regardless of your margin trading skill level\" thinking of it this way seems to break the point of having margin tradingit is actually:\"the minimum amount cannot be set to an amount that would be worth more than the amount of isk you put up for escrow.\"this simple semantic difference in the interpretation of the proposed solution much more obviously does not break the margin trading functionality, and it doesn't allow for this catastrophic game-ruining flaw to harm the customers in a game-mechanic sanctioned way.it's not like you were gullible and trusted a player saying something rediculous in a chat, you trusted the in-game market mechanics that are supposed to be the method that prevents you from harm - the very thing that you are supposed to trust. but then that very system is what harmed you. it was not the other player who scammed you. it was the game itself that scammed you on behalf of the other players wishes. that right there is the very difference between a legitimate scam and a straight-up sploit."
"having the system kill the order if you no longer have the funds available seems like a good idea at first...but i think the whole point of doing margin trading is so that you can buy things without having the money, or rather not directly \"buy things\" but \"place buy orders\".i think the problem here is with the resolution of an order that is being fulfilled when it was a margin trade. to let people spend so much time and money going around to collect up a saleable cache of items in response to a buy order, only to have that buy order killed because the buyer didnt have enough money, thus causing all the harm to the player who thought they were engaging in a trustworthy activity is just poor design."
"so now, if the existing method isn't reasonable, we get into a discussion of \"how do we properly resolve margin buy orders that get fulfilled when the buyer doesn't have enough money to pay for it?\"how about, the seller sells the items, and gets the money, just like they deserve to for going through all the hard work to fulfill the order.then, the buyer gets the items for which they paid the escrow, and for which they have the wallet funds... as for the rest of the items, well, those go into some sort of post-order escrow limbo.then, in order for the buy order to serve it's purpose of buying things, and in order for the margin trading to serve it's purpose of buying those things without having the money, the moment the buyer who of course didn't have enough money to pay the buy order and is therefore sitting at a balance of 0 gets any isk at all, it automatically goes into the limbo order until they reach the point where the order is fulfilled and the items are taken out of limbo and delivered to the buyer.this way, the main that does this can never do anything else until they fulfill the very responsibility that they have ordered to be required to fulfill when they placed the order in the first place. thus forcing them to live up to the responsibility they agreed to take on.then if people try to find ways to exploit this method, it can be dealt with by having limbo items only last a certain time. say 30 days, and the items go out of limbo and up for general sale at the location where they are, for the amount of money that was paid to the seller for them. that way the items go into the game, the isk eventually goes back into the game, and no one gets hurt in the process. and that can give rise to another skill that allows you to extend the amount of time by so much each level, etc.so in that case, if an alt tries to do a margin buy order and ends up leaving a whole bunch of items in limbo, and that alt gets biomassed, all that has to happen is those limbo items instantly go up for sale. or just say \"sorry, you cannot biomass this character at this time because it has outstanding buy orders\" or something like that.every proposed solution has the potential of being exploitable, so the developers would have to figure out how to do it right.trouble is, any time you allow people to buy things without actually having the money for it, you get into dangerous territory, unless you force them to pay asap."
"they aren't active. there's a lot of systems out there now with newbie corp stations and nothing in them.they are sad and lonely places."
"please remember that bumping threads are prohibited according forum rule #12."
"i don't think jack was bumping. i think he was highlighting a need for further exposure to a good idea and was very eager to garner more support by keeping this topic in the eyes of his peers.if he was, i am sure he meant no offence or to break any rules as jack is a very fine and upstanding player of eve that would never break any rules.saying that, this is a good idea and i doubt it would break the the game to have a ship dedicated to the moving of other ships. another isk sink that ccp is very fond of."
"i believe adding a bone or two  no pun intended  and mild weights as you suggested is all that it would take. it does seem rather odd that they would store skeletons server side. usually they would be stored on the local client to make rendering easier. something like breast movement would strictly be a client side function not rendered by the server. i wouldn't want ccp to open up the client to modding of the characters...that leads to all sorts of problems."
"yes, i like this idea.either fix the damage mods on amarr drones or implement this idea.i'd be happy with either."
"i support this idea. i'd always thought have it even simpler would help: 1 jumpclone and skill level = how many times a day you could jump. seemed simple enough.obviously you'd get the whiny \"but i have slave implants in 6 jumpclones waaaah\" that would veto this idea no pun intended verone"
"this"
"thank you ccp for dealing with autopilot to station and the warping through planets additions that have been overdue for years. those make my current predicament seem petty. but, in the interests of helping ceos encourage industry-minded n00bs get into that career, by allowing them to install jobs from the corporate hangars without needing factory manager role, ccp needs to prioritize fixing the corporate roles. as it currently stands, the role 'factory manager' is needed for many actions specifically 'cancel job' whether it be r&d or manufacturing and installing corporate jobs.ccp needs to alter that so the role to cancel a job is a separate role than install. that will fix that problem. this game is wonderful because of the element of risk, but it's also interesting because of the level of effort one needs to put into doing anything - please correct this insanely easy way to grief that scares any sane ceo/director from giving 'factory manager' simply to allow someone to take advantage of those players' skills in research and manufacturing.there's other things about corporation roles that needs work, so an overhaul is strongly recommended at this time now that autopilot to stations and that eyesore of flying through planets has been solved."
"i think when talking about super caps we need to address super carriers and titans separately.super carriers are getting a lot better. but titans are still waaaaaaaay too overpowered.as far as game design goes i think that dreads should be reworked to be the counter to titans. mainly because all they are used for now is structure bashing.first dreads need to be able to survive one titan doomsday zap. that either means more ehp or a damage reduction into doomsdays. second titans need to be more vulnerable. i'd vote against boosting dread dps too much for fear of creating another overpowered ship. i'd reduce the ehp of titans by a lot.oh yeah fix titan tracking, and get rid of the ewar immunity.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"why should combat ships have built-in, penalty-free wcs? that's restricted to non-combat ships such as transports and that funny skiff thing. if supercaps want to keep their infini-stabs, then their combat capabilities should be removed, leaving them as giant logistics or on-grid gang-link vessels."
"eve uses directx like most games do. porting it to opengl would be the only real cross platform solution. however this won't happen since there is no business reason in doing that.wine emulates directx on top of opengl, there is not much ccp could do to provide better emulation as what wine already provides.good intention, but it won't happen sorry"
"so, on one side we have few of users canceling their subscriptions which equals some small number of money for cpp, and on the other side we have days and months of work and paying cpp workers to get linux running client for those small number of players. i would rather lose small sum of money, then pay large sum of money to keep getting small sum back. yeah, i am sorry for you, but look, buy a windows, or continue emulating on linux. why do you expect to get everything on a plate?"
"1. i'm not the op2. ccp actually is pretty responsive. they don't have a lot of resources dedicated to it, but the development team is at least sympathetic and doesn't deliberately break stuff.3. i'm the guy who doesn't want it on a plate. if i was computing in easy mode i wouldn't have to pay extra to get windows."
"you must be a genius, you are probably the first one that came up with this idea. after all we all just use linux because we can not afford a windows license. also i consider wine the superior win32 implementation and support for it isn't asked that much. after all they support several implementations by microsoft that challenge each other for the title of the most broken os.btw what are you doing in the eve forums? don't you have to fix uncle bob and his mums printer problems you windows genius?"
"1. i didn't say you can't afford, but somebody mention as a reason 100$, so if that is your only reason, would be easier to petition for 100$ then to do whole game for another operating system2. i own both pc and mac, and no, i don't fix stuff for my relatives, if you do , then thats your problem, and i would like to see your uncle bob printing on linux3. if majority of users are windows users, you can only expect windows versions of majority of software. yeah, windows are far from perfect, i have both windows and lionos, and both have advantages, but this isn't one of those topic. all in all, to much effort and time would be needed to make linux client while there are many other issues which needs dev attention..."
"frankly i don't care if ccp decided to start supporting linux again or not but it seems rather silly for them to devote that many man hours and resources to the small fraction of people that play on linux. they would need to be making enough money off of said fraction of players to make it worth spending money on the resources to develop a linux client and maintain the support with each expansion. i understood this to be the reason they dropped linux and even mac support and i doubt that has changed much."
"i will attempt to avoid the negativity in the thread, and try to point out why your idea is misguided. the idea at it's core is based on two views that are fundamentally flawed : skills make a huge difference, and bigger is better. these are both woefully wrong, but are, unfortunately, views that are held by most of the players that try starting an eve character. what separates a successful, happy eve character from someone who quits early on and the bittervets is that successful players have separated themselves from this viewpoint. you obviously have not, which means you are either a new player as some in this thread are professing, or you are one of the paradoxical old players who for some reason continue to play a game that they fundamentally do not enjoy.any new player who jumps into the game with the mentality from other mmos will fail. there is no \"endgame,\" and there is no grind between you and actually playing the game. i feel this is something that gets ignored a lot. since i'm tired of typing \"other mmos,\" i'm just going to say wow, since it's what everyone's thinking anyway. with a new wow player with a freshly bought game, you cannot do anything other than be led around from quest to quest, and you cannot play with any friends until you reach max level. the leveling experience is nothing but a grind, you have to pay your dues, so to speak, in order to unlock the real game. for someone who knows the game and knows the most efficient leveling path, that is 5 days of played time. for a new player who doesn't know how things work, that can easily double, but let's pretend it's 5 days played time. for someone who can log in two hours a day which is probably about average, the basement virgin 12 hours a day dudes are offset by the huge numbers who can only play on weekends, this means 60 days, or two months before you can even play the real game. at this point it is at least another 3 days played time, probably more, before you grind out enough gear to participate in whatever raid or pvp that your friends are doing well, you can do the pvp, but until you get the gear you will literally die after five steps. that adds about another month, giving us effectively three months before the average player can really do much with his friends. now, those friends can take pity on the newbie and run him through heroics to farm his gear, effectively carrying him, so let's ignore the gearing up portion and say two months.why did i lay that all out? because it's important. eve offers new players the unique opportunity to do almost whatever they want within a couple days of playing. yes, high-end pve content, such as incursions, wormholes, or l4 missions will not be doable, but each of these are only better ways to make isk anyway. as someone earlier pointed out, it takes very, very little time to be a useful member of a pvp gang. within a few hours of creating your character you could have a frigate fit with point, web, and mwd, making you a tackler. these are always useful members of a fleet. within no more than 5 days you can have most skills relevant to a pvp frigate to level 3 or 4, giving you a solid frigate that can even contribute a bit of dps while tackling. this is an opportunity unavailable in other mmos, and unfortunately, because new players are so used to how other mmos work, they don't avail themselves of this opportunity. the assumption amongst new players generally seems to be that if you can't fly a bs you won't be useful, which is patently false, but unless someone explains otherwise that's what you'll keep believing. for the lucky few that figure it out, the universe opens up. you can do whatever you want to do pretty much right from the start, as long as your goals are realistic much like real life, really.what's all of this mean? changing the skill system accomplishes nothing is what it means. as was repeatedly pointed out, the best auto-logout function that ccp could build can be circumvented easily with even a rudimentary understanding of script writing. so, effectively, such a change does nothing to benefit anyone, but will harm players who are unable or unwilling to write or download a simple script that keeps their character logged in while they're off at work or asleep. the only change that would actually accomplish anything would be to remake the skill system into a grind-based system that gives you sp for doing tasks basically an exp system from other mmos, and i can guarantee you that such a change would murder eve so quickly that ccp won't even have time to ask what happened."
"yup. they allowed making playlists. unfortunately, one cannot alter the current soundtrack playlist."
"seriously? you necro a thread that's been dead a month to add in \"yep\"? what's wrong with you?"
"i have been in fleets of all machs, logi, and an off grid booster that can bang out a site in under 3 minutes. and that's just joining random pubbie fleets.20 sites an hour comes out to 200 mil an hour.that's right folks if you get in a faction battleship, fly to an incursion, and hook up with the dudes in local ... 200 mil / hour.no wonder nullsec is turning into a ghost town with the occasional tech moon fight here or there.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"nullsec becoming a ghosttown? well i guess the endless hordes of noobs finally got tired of being exploited by their more advanced hierarchy that told them the good moons \"go to the alliance\" ie: top brass.there's incursions in nullsec too, and they pay much better. i live in lowsec and have no trouble keeping in isk. quit trying to make this game easier. the rest of us like the challenge."
"i am sure that lots of players out there don't use cq because they like their ships and they like to spin them all the time.so where do i think we can improve things?as it happen, when you dock, your focus changes to enter captain's quarters button, and if you were typing a message in chat just before you dock, and press enter to send that message when you dock you will see loading bar and you will need to wait some time for your character to appear standing on suicide ledge in captain's quarters. sometimes you really need to dock up fast, change ship and get out, and this \"location\" change is really annoying since you need to wait additional time. so suggestion is, just remove the focus from that button."
"if you find yourself doing rushed dock/undocks a lot, disable cq.fortunately, it is also possible to set hotkeys to switch between cq and the hangar view *while docked* so you can have it turned off by default and switch to cq when you have time and want it."
"i have cq disabled, but there is still that button which gets the fucus when you dock so it then switches to cq"

"i think option #2 or as you called it the complex option would be a great idea for new players to be able to experience.the young never do as they are told, the old never do as they say."
"ehh, oops.but as menace said, i was just trying to keep this idea in the eyes of my peers to garner more support for something that would be extremely useful, and non-game breaking.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
"each bank will be connected to a wallet division of a corporation or a player's wallet. it can only supply isk for approved loans if the wallet has the funds.to this end, banks cannot generate isk out of thin air since they would need the isk to begin with. the only isk that could be generated out of thin air, would be the interest payable due to corp adjustable interest rates. this is the profit the bank makes out of the loan.but to prevent abuse of interest spamming, no trial accounts would be allowed to take out loans. and if the character that took out the loan does not have the needed isk to repay the loan or is biomassed, the bank will reclaim that isk from your non existent wallet and put it into a negative balance, regardless of your characters status. i also think it would be worth while to flag all characters that get loans approved. this loan flag would prevent the character from being biomassed during the loan period, or until the loan is repaid with interest due.loans will be subject to the interest rates they were approved under. in this way, a banking operation cannot extort more interest out of a loan than it agreed upon even if they hike their interest rates during the loan period. this will not deter scamming tho, since the banks should by setup be allowed to \"hide\" their interest rates from their would be loan shark victims in the making, prior to signing the loan agreement. once the agreement is signed, any descriptions would be listed as such, while the \"actual\" interest rate would be displayed along side it. this would make finding reputable banks harder to find in a world of perpetual griefing, pvping, scamming and right down ruthlessness. as much as security status is a part of jihadding, so too should reputation be a part of banking. all it would take is one post, chainmail or eve news cast with less than favorable publicity.while this suggestion is by no means a perfect system and would probably only serve as a foundation for expanding into the future beyond, i believe this working version is pretty air tight for eve. any cracks that could be identified and or exploited going forward, should be considered a legitimate risk of banking, much like scamming is a legitimate risk for trading."
"server-side skeletons would be necessary to support server-side portrait rendering and use of an avatar from more than one install of the client. they can't not have them on the server. there shouldn't be a gigantic amount of data in a skeleton, or at least there's little enough that looking it up in the db and zapping a copy to the client takes a few seconds at most probably less than that. all rendering and animation would be done on the client as you'd expect."
"you would have to make a special exception for primarily concord based kills, you don't want gankers shooting friends to scrape bounties when they die to suicide ganks."
"what kind of exception? the whole point of a bounty system is to encourage other people to shoot at the guy who committed a crime against you. suicide gankers will be the most likely candidates."
"i mean - normally when concord gets a kill, any player who so attacked the victim of concord's attack gets kill credit.they should not get bounty for this kill since concord did all the work, as it would be easy for a friendly to use an agressive mod to ensure they got bounty prize on the kill, helping offset the cost of their own ganks with bounty prizes."
"seems like a good idea and doesn't break anything. +1"
"agreed, would be convenient."
"sounds like a good idea."
"can be effectively done already with bank alts, but bank alts shouldn't be necessary. +1"
"strangely i like this idea.your drones are as good as your skills, and you choose the damage type you want to field.create more drone modules and rigsalso, now that lag isnt so much an issue anymore with tidi, allow a ship to field more than 5 drones with the proper modules to allow this"
"meh... you would still be better off with hobgoblins. it would be easier to tank the warrior iis, which would off balance things.me, i say make the worst attributes tie for all drones."
"i also like the idea of having it just straight cut in half. at level five, that's 25% which makes the cooldown timer 18 hours, which i believe is not really worth it. if people are doing two cta's a day, 18 hours will still conflict quite a bit. 10% a level is good at level four the cooldown timer is 14.4 hours about fourteen hours and fifteen minutes which i think is more reasonable. +1 from me 24 hours is ridiculous"
"your idea and view on how to reduce the time for jump clone use with out making it an easily exploitable system seems like a fair way. it would give those that are mining and who want to be able to jump to a clone for pvp a chance to do so at a shorter time frame, with out as you said letting people just create several clones to jump around through eve to do other things with little to no recoil from their choice.the young never do as they are told, the old never do as they say."
"trouble with that idea is you still need to carry the can around with you if you want to use the bookmarks again.there's already a facility in ship fitting and market to export to a file held on your pc, so why not have that for bookmarks? then you wouldn't care too much about the limit as you could load the bookmarks on the fly.just a thought."
"i propose that the leadership of the goonswarm federation be detained on charges of war crimes comparable in scale to that of sansha kuvakei against the gallente federation.miners in gallente sovereign space are a solid and highly valued constituent of our society. should the goonswarm directorate be found guilty, in court or in absence, of ordering the interdiction and destruction of assets furthering the freedoms of the gallente peoples, we ask that faction standings be adjusted sanctions be imposed to reflect the gallente peoples disapproval until such a time as damages equal to the value of destroyed vessels are paid to the office of the president via the devout and respected mining advocate; chribba.gallente law is hazy at best when dealing with the rights and restrictions of capsualeers.i call upon the vocal and enthusiastic support of gallente loyalists capsualeers everywhere to support this action and make right the wrong done to our people.[ i<U+FFFD>m just playing with you guys. the point is this; in a sandbox - if you throw sand - don<U+FFFD>t be surprised if you get some in your own eyes. in a role-playing game - if that is what this is - your actions should have consequences beyond game mechs in fairness arbitrated by game masters. ]edit: further much needed explanationedit: nerfed the penalising faction standings language and replaced it with the more nebulous term sanctions. see final thoughts."
"i think this would cause a problem for how some people choose to play the game. some players like the freedom of being able to play how ever they want and not worry about such things, only having to worry what the corporation of the person they attacked would do next. if this sort of system was enacted it would change how the game is played on many different levels. instead of people dueling it out in space over a contested action there would be court cases and sanctions that would hamper some players style of playing.the young never do as they are told, the old never do as they say."
"i would hope so. somethingawful has happened to how i'd like to play the game. yes and no, the game is already being played at this many levels and more. check out how all the rp candidets have been knobbled in the csm.[/quote]instead of people dueling it out in space over a contested action there would be court cases and sanctions that would hamper some players style of playing.[/quote]yeah, it's called being held accountable for your actions and being true to game lore. there is nothing wrong with what goons have done. there is nothing wrong with what i'm proposing. pirates ask for ransoms all the time. getting this proposal enforced without a shot being fired is how i'd like to play - but somehow don't think that is going to happen."

"what is even going on here am i being space subpoenaed now"
"with all due respect i have to disagree here. whilst most of us dont go around talking rp style, with 'for the empress/federation/isk/falcon!' when we fly into battle we are all actually role playing here whether you realise it or not.neither you nor i am actually spaceship captains, i am not a ceo of a mighty warfaring corp of killers. im a guy sat at a desk playing as one. therefore to at least a small degree i am playing a role, therefore am roleplaying.so, there it is folks, technically we are all roleplaying to some degree, the only variable is how deeply you roleplay. most of us its just barely for sure, but still...take for example all the hard men on the forums, they are almost all going to not be hard men in real life, i bet drake draconis is a mild mannered guy who wouldnt argue face to face, same as most people here, so.. they are roleplaying on the forum, behind the anonymity of the internet. again roleplaying, by definition being someone you arnt in real life."
"only if you want to be,in all honesty i've lost interest.let's all just go back to whatever mundane routine we were faffing with before."
"are we all role-playing here to some extent? yes. there's no doubt about that. however, is this thread worthless? yes. also no doubt about that. wtf is op trying to prove anyways? eve is not about law, order, any of that crap. if you want that, space barbies are over there. eve is about a sandbox, it's about pilots flying around in space trying to gain isk. nothing more, nothing less. trying to bring some sort of new \"space court\" would be worthless bullshit. also - even if you wanted to try this, how would you actually \"extradite\" goonswarm leaders from nullsec? you might as well extradite the pope from vatican city because he condones the abuse of altar boys which unfortunately won't happen either. stupid ideas like this belong in features and ideas discussion, not assembly hall."
"should not be allowed in combat.. or at worst should generate loss/killmail or capitals and supercaps should have longer timers.. something to make it less appealing to the foolish"
"i have to disagree with this view point it should be at the choice of the player if they want to be able to self destruct during an engagement. removal of this option would make the self destruct command nearly useless for there would be few other reasons to use it.you are not guaranteed the rights to a kill unless you can successfully make the kill. this would be about as bad as how players of fps games like call of duty complained they only got the assist for a kill when putting a player in to final stand and not the points for the kill itself.if you do not finish off the kill you do not deserve the kill mail or the rights to it.the young never do as they are told, the old never do as they say."
"i propose we remove this proposal from the assembly hall and move it to the trash bin.as a member of a small pvp corp, you do not deserve to tackle a ship worth more in isk than your whole corps combined assets.valid game mechanic working as intended.space poor tears best tears."
"well linux has the same print facility macos has. does it sucks to print with a mac?what some of us propose is the support of wine as a platform instead of a separate mac, linux and windows client. thats -1 client, so it would produce less effort for ccp. there would only be the windows client or win32 client or whatever.also it already works for years it's just that it isn't officially supported."

"i remember some year ago, some old player say to me. you began really to play at eve when you have about 12 m sp. and this is true. the new player must be have the possibility to add some extra skill point when they began eve.exemple some new storyline or epic arc. when the player have finish them give them some extra sp to atribute. maximum 4 epic arc to add some extra sp if you have less then 6m sp.first epic arc give 1m sp about 60 mission to dosecond epic arc give 0.75 m sp about 60 mission to dothird epic arc give 0.50 m sp about 60 mission to dolast epic arc give 0.25 m sp about 60 mission to doall mission must be in empire or the last epic in lowmission you can have the choice between mining, trading or fightingextra skill point if you make the 4 epic arc : 2.5m speve need new player. but a lot of new player stop eve because, it's really difficult to began."

"in my opinion whole war declaration system should be change, or rather split.1 if target corporation have hq, office or pos in low sec. should be totally free war zone there, its outlands, where law dont exist. or are just rules of borderlands where you must take care about yourself by self. where everyone fight for they place, resorces, systems and defend they interest by own without empires above.2 if target corporation have hq, pos in high sec. aggresor should get standing hit to faction under what target have hq or pos. also hit into security standing, because you start war in zone where law exist.3 casus belli system, if someone steal something, kamikaze you or do other stupid activity than your corp get casus belli to punish such corporation. even in high sec without restriction of point 2.because if some corporation waste time to upgrade standing to some faction, and start pos \"under they wings\" so why some bored people can easy declare war to us? for silly small price, let be more war declaration restrictions. if someone want to fight and test his pvp abilities, why he dont search equal fight in low sec? mainly this high sec wars looks like this, that bunch of old bored eve veterans killing some random carebear fresh players. not everyone have hard \"lower of backs\" or so many isk at start to handle heavy loss.sorry for bad english."
"i would not really call that an exploit but instead smart thinking and planning. it is always a good idea to keep your isk earning toon in a npc so it can not be wardeced so it can support the toon in the corp being wardeced. that is just smart business management there.the young never do as they are told, the old never do as they say."
"you've been allowed to make playlists for as long as i've been playing eve... which is over a year and a half... i think i found that feature on day 2... nice one, op."
"the idea of ship mass being prohibitive isn't necessarily an issue. we are talking about a tug after all, which is really nothing more than a cockpit and engines with a framework in between to attach ships. not really a terribly large amount of mass there. the anchor points wouldn't even need to be enclosed. you don't see it with tow-trucks or even most auto trailers for semis, and this is basically the same idea."
"a tug ship for the rivers of space, sort of like how a river barge needs a tug to tow or push it along. but in this case the ships are housed within the tug if i am understanding correctly.it could be a novel idea and would facilitate moving fleets around easier and would open up a new market. i agree no launching from the bay. would need to dock up at a station before the ships could be unloaded.i think the +.06 should only be on a t2 variant though or it would be to strong against a fleet trying to lock it down, once the skill was maxed out.no on jump drive for a t1 variant, but maybe on t2 variant it would be feasible. the young never do as they are told, the old never do as they say."
"this is a great idea! not that it will benefit me personally since i live in wh but its still a great idea !+1"
"look at it this way. i'm an average null sec grunt. i have a ton of ships all fitted out and i need to go on deployment. i want to move a bunch of them in one go and i don't want to repackage them so i can send them via jf.right now i can do it in a carrier which is great. but thats all what i use my carrier for and it doesn't fit that many rigged ships in it when we're talking battleships sizes.we sort of already have it, its a carrier. what i think we need is another carrier type for each race which has a much large ship maintenance bay but reduced or removed drone bay and a different set of bonuses to reflect its role."
"as a hi-sec missioner, i'd love to see this. i change my base of operations from time to time, following contacts or for rp. it's a gigantic pain in my backside to jump each of my ships system to system from a to b, while also having to plan on bringing enough shuttles with the first transport so i can shell game my way back and forth until they're all moved. i already have a mammoth for hauling goods to rens for sale, and for shuttling my own cargo with plans to upgrade to a prowler for lo-sec runs. if i could have something analogous for my personal fleet, it would simplify things immensely, and let me get on with the business of blowing things up.excellent idea, i hope to see it shake out in the ship re-org."
"why thank you.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
"as a -10 pirate, i think this is a good idea.i can't tell you how many people hesitate to join us for low sec pvp with the thought of never going back to hisec. so this would be great to get a lot of people to pew with.the real pirates could still grab pods, which would make ransoming into a more formal affair, so only the \"higher ups\" who have high sec alts would point the pod and prepare for ransoming, rather than everyone pointing it and someone always shooting by accident before the ransom is initiated hate when that happens. along with this, everyone who shoots without aggression will slowly get a negative sec status, which by your change can thus be shot at without penalty. therefore, everyone in lowsec who shoots at those who are non agressed can have fair pvp, rather than those upstarts that religiously keep their sec status just above -5 so they can't get shot at without penalty but still kill stuff frequently in low sec. as well, low sec shouldn't prevent frigate warfare. currently, you can't use them on gates 90% of the time because you will get instapopped, but now, people who actively pvp in lowsec will have a negative sec status, so frigs would be viable to shoot them. i don't see why a shiptype should be blocked off to a large extent, frigate warfare is great fun and this change would make going out in an assault frig gang in search of other negative-seccers an actual valid option for pvp. not saying it should be possible to camp a high sec gate with interceptors...that would take away the classic hic pilot fittings needed to point people quickly, which are a great part of low sec.moreover, this proposal reinforces a style that does not force people to have multiple accounts just to be able to function. this is good. only thing is there would still need to be a scout for high secsupported.tundragon ~ low sec piracy since 2003 ~ youtube ~ join us"
"...if everyone has a maximum of -2, everyone can just go into high sec and follow them, unless they have true -10 from killing pods, which is understandable. assuming pirates shot at you first, you have the right to aggress them be it high sec or low sec. if you shot them first and they ran away...that's your own error. if a pilot successfully deagresses and jumps through a gate they should deserve to get away anyways, be it into high sec or not. tundragon ~ low sec piracy since 2003 ~ youtube ~ join us"
"this isn't going to 'fix' lowsec. it will make it easier to pvp lowsec - which would fill it with predators feasting on predators; an unnatural sh*t storm that will keep all but pvp players from going to lowsec.we need to bring all types of pilots to lowsec for many reasons, not just pvp. precisely! if you want consequence free pvp regardings sec status you can go to nullsec, join a war in highsec, become a mercenary, or go to low and only engage flashies.you and i are on the same page. and this too! i have been ranting lately that the falloff from .5 to .4 is way too steep when it comes to risk. i beleive there should be some relevant risk from .6 all the way down in varying degrees to .1 - risk of attack from other players, and risk to those agressors as well.for example, pirates cannot go on a raid into .5 and .6 systems without getting completely demolished by concord as a consequence, but in .4 there are only gate and station turrets to worry about! if there were roaming npc naval patrols in .4 the risk of unprovoked attacks on say, miners, could be noteworthy, but perhaps still worth it. same for .5 sec - perhaps a very minimal concord presence in .5 would bring the shadey types out of low. and - the power of concord should be put into the hands of real players to some extent. there needs to be player based faction police forces where combat pilots of good standing can patrol .6 to .1 and get paid doing it!miners with good empire standing need to be able to transmit a system-wide distress beacon to call in either the npc or player based patrols patrols with police licenses. what this would do is add a nice spectrum and variety to the borders of empire space. especially as police patrols are on the move playing cat and mouse with raiding pirates.yahsee - piracy in eve is starting resemble less and less true piracy. piracy in rl can be defined as theft on the high seas - translateably in eve to theft in deep space. there aren't enough soft targets for pirates! why can't we make lowsec more like the wild wild west? yah got treasure seekers, gold diggers, outlaws, sheriffs, gunfighters, train robbers...that's what i want!"
"fantastic idea! don't see a downside"
"well the problem here is that lowsec is still empire space supposedly - some technology from concord is still big brother - watching you and pulling your sec status down as you commit criminal acts. it as if the law still applies, but there is no one there to enforce it! that is what is broken.but otherwise, sure! players should be able to work for these npc pirate groups and maybe get a tatoo. :d but also stand to profit from doing work for them."
"i am with you except for the above - hmm. so this means that ratters and miners will be far more deterred from lowsec.yah know your scaring off all my sheep and i don't like it one bit!!! it might work if....if... see my solution about distress calls 2 - 3 posts back..."
"this change would benefit the gameplay of casual pvpeven tho such changes would go against the eve story/rp background, those things should never get in the way of good gameplay in mmo. the story part has to revolve around gameplay, not other way around"
"i am just a noob nobody compared to you. but you of all people cannot see the flaw of this? i've heard you say at the last csm debates on eve-radio that mining although miners are at the bottom of the food chain is one of the most important aspects of the game. and i beleive you were one of those who beleives the reward for missioning and mining needs to be increased in lowsec. this proposal will destroy the prospects of new miners coming to low, even if the rewards were increased.now, since i am newbish - can someone please assuage my concerns?? i feel as if i am standing in front of a stampede that is about to run off a cliff."
"that would be easy enough to reconcile i'm sure. besides, i've never go the kill credit for killing a player whilst they're getting ganked by concord and i've definitely shot at people getting concorded before.\"in the age of information, ignorance is a choice.\" www.stateofwar.co.nf"

"logging on to an inactive skill queue is one of the worst things about eve.this commonly happens because of loss of internet, broken pc or unexpected afk.personally, im a truck driver so some times i can only log in once a week. this makes it very hard to train skills taking over 24 hours. ccp won't increase the queue time, and you can't change skill training on a mobile device. both of these would be the best solution.my proposal is for skill points to accumulate at the base rate whenever the skill queue is inactive. these skills points would then be available as unallocated skill points."
"not saying it is a bad idea but it has been suggested many times before and has been shot down just as many times. frankly i don't see why not...other than because ccp want's you to log into the game. most people will just call you lazy, stupid or just tell you to queue a longer train while you are out. personally i think it would be useful to have a pot of unallocated sp when you forget to set your train. i think perhaps the sp should gain at a reduced rate though."
"yes i know training queues are brought up a lot.like many people i didn't have a problem with them when i had daily access to the eve client.how ever in the last 12 months i've lost a load of training time because of work commitments, internet problems and pc breakdowns. yes we known people will exploit longer queues, the same people that will bot their way to sc glory no doubt. why penalise the many for the crimes of the few.the train a longer skill argument is valid to a point. how do you suggest i get to the longer level 5 skills though, when typical the lvl 3 / 4 skills take more than 24 hours but less than 5 days? to train these i lose a few days training time per week. trust me im not lazy, i've spent 7 months juggling long skill buts its very frustrating when you want to train for the current alliance fit and it takes months instead of a few weeks.yes i was suggesting a reduced rate so its at least some compensation to those of us who pay for account but only play at weekends, or have long afk times."
"the skill queue is intended to allow players who are actively playing the game to avoid 3am wake-up calls for those pilots that are too obsessed with the game. you've been at work, that's great. i'm glad that you have a job and things to do in this struggling economy. remember first and foremost that eve is a game, not a job. you missed some training and you're mad about it? then you're missing the point. the point of the game is to have fun. unallocated sp is always a bad idea except for the rare case when ccp deletes a skill, such as the learning skills and is simply for people who want fotm right away. paying for an account doesn't guarantee you sp, it guarantees you the opportunity to earn those sp if you actively log in and play enough to update your queue. also, not to troll/flame, but in 2012, with the fact that wireless is nearly everywhere and a decent laptop is cheap, i don't believe that you don't have the option of bringing a computer with you and occasionally you can take 5 minutes when you're at a rest stop that has wifi to update a queue. if you're not willing to do this, it's fine. however, it's a choice that you make and that you need to deal with - it's not a game problem, it's a user problem. tl;dr: nope. never going to happen. ps - please use the search function on the forums - this has been suggested countless times and is always shot down. also, this belongs in features and ideas, not the assembly hall."

"im not mad about it, im putting forward a view, from personally experience and from what i hear from people on comms.the skill points system is full of contradiction and annoys many eve players.troll / flame response:i live in england, and i can tell you that eve capable laptops certainly aren't cheap.if i could park a 50ft vehicle in mcdonald's car park to take advantage of their wifi then i would, because wireless internet isn't cheap either.you also have no idea about trucking, rest stops, not in this economic climate, parking is roadside because nobody will pay for parking. that's if laptops are allowed, many companies don't allow them because they are fire risk, flatten batteries and have adverse affects on a drivers rest time."
"i agree that interaction is essential, that's why im not directly calling for 7 day+ queue. im suggesting that a small accumulation of sp equal to perhaps the sp per hour that a new player experiences would ease the frustation of inactive skill queues."
"if i had to hazard some sort of \"acceptible\" level....perhaps a 10% of the whole sp acculimation?an encouragemnt to be active...but you won't be pissed if you miss a day.....reason i start very low....because we don't want this to turn into an char bazar where people get toons with a shitton of sp to spend.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"ccp stated once that the reason why the skill queue is limited to only 24 hours is to get players to actively log in and play the game. but ccp missed the point entirely shocking, i knowlogging in to adjust skill queue, then logging off does not constitute player activity ingame. so yes, i'm all for this change to the skill queue. especially since i'm active duty military and occasionally go on lengthy deployments with zero internet access.summary of eves last four expansions:"

"i guess the question i would have is why are we worried about low sec mining? you could put low refineries at 900% output and the life expectancy of a hulk in low sec would still be about 5 seconds.i think he addresses the real issue: people don't spend a lot of time in low because fighting back at any length means not going back to high sec. not everyone wants to spend tons of time managing sec status. eliminating this worry will encourage casual pvp.edit: if anything giving people more freedom to fight will encourage them to even try mining since they are allowed to protect themselves"
"if a miner or missioner doesn't agress of course they can protect themselves just as things are now they just can't jump or dock for 1 minute. and if its a criminal, they can even shoot first. i see no problem with this now.and yes, the current state of the game has no benefit to lowsec mining. for that you have to go to nullsec. i would bet that this will be fixed in the near future. this will diversify lowsec and provide targets for real piracy occasional greedy miner, and large mining operations for the well organized miners.this proposal is great for pvp, certainly it is! but if the goal is to bring a diversified group into lowsec as the csm's have stated over and over is an agenda then this will not do it.if this goes through, i hope i am wrong. and if you can tell me why i am wrong, then maybe i will not be so concerned."
"you're right about the mechanic as it stands now, there is nothing particularly broken. the issue is making it appealing to as many people as you can. changes to mineral quality will only get so many people to enter low sec that are not already there since any mining op would need enough protection to fend off any amount of pirate attacks. very few corps could or would be willing to pull that off given how saturated low sec is with pirates. someone like aaa could match anything you put out there and would love doing so, it would just be a lossif you start eliminating the major objections people have to spending real time in low sec, you will begin to see more people there. you will also dilute the danger posed by aggressors simply because there are a lot more targets, which will make things like industry and mining more feasible to more corporations creating even more targetsyou can already make a lot more isk in low sec than you ever could in high sec through mission running, exploration and pi. that still doesn't bring people in. doing something with the security status hit will imo"

"well there is an option to stop ppl contacting you from a direct chat perspective. there should be one also for mails.but you can of course have checkboxes that allow corp/alliance.perhaps use the same functionality as the fleet finder filter."
"simpler fix: let me set any chargecurrently maxes at 5mil iirc and let me have the isk that is charged.if you don't mind you contacting me, i will happily refund to 100 mil isk cspa charge, and if it was unsolicited mail sent out to 200 names on a list, i get 100 mil for dealing with it"
"aside from the obvious \"well duh\"i'm talking about stopping the first initial mail sm...not the second.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"this.i don't think anyone will speak out against something like this. not game breaking. just allows an extra level of personal organisation if one so wishes. the ability to turn it on, off, or just be able to add divisions at will up to maybe a maximum of like 5 or something"
"this proposal is already here for like 3 yearskeep coming those spam threats"
"i loved the idea when it was proposed by the devs, and hope it can be implimented soon. +1"
"i had a similar problem the other day. lost a few hours sp due to unforeseen circumstances but it's only a game. a thousand sp here and there won't make any great difference.as much as it would be great to log in from a mobile phone just to change the skill queue, i don't think it would be that great for the game overall.you may say why punish us all for the crimes of the few that would abuse it, but the fact is once you put temptation in people's way, they will use/abuse it.skill queue is fine as it is. real life comes first and sp should be the least of your worries in this world.and not meaning to troll or be funny, op, but you don't work 24 hours a day so why wouldn't you be able to change the skill queue? at worst you will suffer the loss of a few hours as i did."
"but it does make the average online numbers bump up, which in turn makes the game look busier, which is what ccp wants in hopes of attracting more players."
"character selling is unlikely to be an issue as i suggested an accumulation rate equivalent to a new player. a character seller would get far quicker results with cheap implants."
"wrong.stop thinking short term....================ stop the evemail spam!"
"skill queue editing via eve gate or api please..problem solved."
"i would like this idea better.if i recall there was even a dev blog commenting on this being possible not to long ago."
"i would love to see a striped down client that could be installed on the android or i phone.this client could allow market access for order updates, access to skill training, eve mail, chat channels, etc, but not capable of undocking or flying a ship.even just give us access to skill que's and mail etc through api and we can develop our own apps to handle the rest."
"you have access to the mail-part through eve-gate. maybe adding a basic function to add skills to the training queue, though that would likely be too much of a bother.but i support having an \"eve-online lite\" for tablets and smartphones. i don't know how often it would've been handy to have a small client to chat to corp-mates while forced out on shopping. might actually make it worth going to those huge-ass malls with wifi-hotspots..."
"this is actually among the most pressing issues in my agenda, i suggest you check it out, m8.\"being supporters of free speech and free and open [csm] elections... we removed fon revedhort from eligibility\". ccp, april 2013."
"i completely agree. a 'spool up' timer on a cyno? 15 seconds would honestly be a good amount of time. a bridge on top of a fleet would likely die.a bridge off gird, but close couple hundred thousand km would give quick fleet hacs? just enough time to get there and pop it before ships start coming through.a bridge a few au out, would allow fast ceptors to get there, and have a small chance of popping a small ship.a bridge many au out already gives the fleet a lot of warning of incoming ships.with a spool up timer, i don't think a small 'anti cyno' field is needed.however, portable system wide one might not be bad-not sure to be honest.i definately think it should be a little bit more dynamic though. not many fleets fly around through gates any more :p"
"why would you think that any of this would be a good idea?"
"i think someone got hotdropped by a cyno kestrel."
"i think its worth a look into by ccp. force projection is a big issue in eve right now. this might help tone a bit of it down."
"cynos placed on ships made of paper mach<U+FFFD> and prayers function quite well. the ship dies to a single volley from my tornado, for example, and thanks to server latency only a fraction of the enemy fleet manages to enter system, to be brutally butchered.i can't support any proposition that makes it more difficult for our enemies to get into a fight with us."
"certificates aren't award. they are more like a grade.i think ccp underestimate power of medals. for example if they had add medal for n kills on a certain ship this would increase an interest for not popular ships we all know how screwed low tier battlecruisers/cruisers now. if ccp would made medals here won't be so much 'pink pony 1337 pwnz noobs'-style medals and if displayed they will actualy show that owner deserves some respect.also medal management might be improved so players could remove/hide/rename medals."
"to be honest, i think the best thing ccp can do for target callers is to make the \"broadcast: target\" and \"remove battleship from overview\" not be right beside each other.i think anybody whose fc'd using broadcasts has mis-clicked."
"especially when you open up the ol' hangar, go make some coffee, read the newspaper, walk the dog, fix yourself some breakfast, and maybe, just maybe, it'll be loaded when you get back.most of you likely don't experience this special version of hell, but those with slow internet connections or extremely large hangars our people who fit rifters feel a marvelous variety of pain when they open theirs have a tough time of it.i've recently heard that people who live in wormholes have this hit them especially hard. the problem with this is we all know it's a problem, but we don't know how big of a problem it is. i suspect this problem is huge and needs a lot of attention, but i'd like for you guys to tell us a bit about how this affects you.information gathered for this will be used to determine if this is an issue we need to focus attention on as player reps or if it's a fringe issue that can be fixed when people have spare time. if you feel strongly about this either way please post in this thread and tell us how it impacts you."
"i think its a database caching issue that can't be fixed. i personally resolved it with a very large number of station warehouses to sort things intoincluding the one i keep my station warehouse bpo in."
"don't worry about this part for now, the results of the thread will be helpful regardless of your opinions on this one."
"we noticed this when corp bookmarks were created and we were transferring over tons of bookmarks to get our building corp a copy of all our important spots.anyway, this 'bug' is very noticeable when you have a ton of bookmarks in a hangar. or any bookmarks for that matter. edit: it doesn't seem to matter if those bookmarks are in cans or in that hangar. something about the bookmark item bugs any kind of item holding container.the whole way eve organizes items in game is pretty rough. folders would be great. not just containers, folders. trying to load 1000's of items can't be good for any interface system.dual pane idea: click!"
"i always try to keep my personal hangar tidy and low-asset, but i do experience this issue on our corp hangars. it's really tiring to have to wait for a long time on each hangar load until you can see what's in there."
"i came across this issue being in rvb and buying stuff to fit 10 incursus, 20 catalysts, and 6 vexors, and i am sure this is small compared to many.so yes there is station warehouses and cans where you could dump this stuff. the problem with this which would apply to folders too, is that i found that i was loosing stuff - i would accidentally drop a gun in my ammo can etc - and wonder where the hell it went!if there were tabs, or quick and easy filters, the problem would be solved. i sense that ccp may already be looking at this?"
"have to agree here, this 'idea' is most definitely posted in the wrong forums.if you are really being serious, why would anyone want to even do this? people would honestly want to roleplay a space lawyer, judge, bailiff etc? do paperwork rather than shoot things and making things blow up in space?i personally think this would be the dullest thing bar mining, sorry miners ever in the history of gaming.go make your own game of lawyers in space if you want it that much.this does just smack of more 'anti-goon' propaganda. they play the game their way and have fun doing it. learn from them.i am not a goon alt before anyone asks."
"perhaps i<U+FFFD>m not explaining myself clearly. this was never an argument i could win by winning and i<U+FFFD>d like to thank you for taking enough interest to post. this thread was raised not to ask for a new feature, it was to to give an example of the weakness in a fundamental assumption; that eve is a mmorpgwhat the discussion above demonstrates is how hostile eve online has become to role-play by subscribers. some people just don<U+FFFD>t get it when anyone other than a gm takes the part of of an npc entity.in my discussions in korvin<U+FFFD>s campaign thread it became clear to me that the only rpers that could gain respect are those that are willing to fight for sov holdings in nullsec. empire loyalists in empire space are just not cool.this thread raises awareness of the situation for ccp and the csm to discuss. in accordance with ccp spitfires stickied so you want to raise an issue / proposal tips and faqs topic.however, i do agree with the mittani that there are much more pressing issues and that must be addressed for the term of csm7. rpers will live out their fantasies whether you like it or not. it would just be nice if ccp rp dept were better supported, more fully staffed and nudged the static areas of high-sec more often in response to player actions."
"to answer the question no-one has asked yet; from my rp perspective mining and ratting bots are no different to any other ai in the game. they represent lives in the eve universe.the reason i picked on goonswarm for my opening tirade was because in interdicting ice miners in high-sec they stepped into my world. this is me paying back the complement. i could have easily have chosen hulkageddon as the focus, but helicity is not around to be irked."
"yes, rp should be in the rp forums. i apologise for dismissing you out of hand.i was being overly defensive because i expected your reaction.this thread is not about asking for a new feature.it is not about asking goon-swarm to play space court with me.it is about asking the csm to investigate why high-sec appears to be a rp dead-zone.the mitanni and the goons just make a handy targets, soz guys."

"if we can have drones used for personal defense, or defense of a specific other ship in fleet..... why not set them for fleet defense in general? they can focus fire on the target that would be the group's best weakest target. if flying pvp, the fc may do this same thing: order all drones on a target. if pve or mining, instead of everyone having to \"f\" their drones on the target, have them set to auto defend the fleet in general. so, why not add a feature where you can pool your drones into defending the fleet in general, instead of a specific ship. you know, have all the drones defend fleet, and focus fire, so all drones knock out rats no matter who in the fleet they attack."
"this would be an awesome feature to have, but would at the same time make afk mining and bot mining much safer. i can not in good faith support a feature that would be so easily exploited by bots and afkers. no matter how much i might like it."
"trebor daehdoow,i do not appreciate, nor will i tolerate, you mass spamming characters for your election! also, your link:> > > use this url to vote for me -"
"yeah, i have to say i'm really not a fan of the spam mail myself, it seems like a pretty weak propaganda scheme."
"me neither, but you dont have a cspa charge for nothing. so u can solve the problem yourself."
"one message is not spam.trebor is a great guy, we need him on the csm to balance out alex's ego."
"cspa charges don't work if you send to a group."
"i tend to agree, but getting unsolicited mail advertising him for csm forced me to choose seleene as the superiour choicewho didn't send me an email advertising himself, that i had to scroll through a page and a half of other peoples names to get to the body of.felt just like the junk mail my dear ol' mom forwards me, only without a punchline or a cute picture of a cat."
"i guess you really dont understand do you? ok not everyone has a cspa charge, and if they do they have a small amount set, as its not feasible to set it at a high amount for obvious reasons. so he would only need to spend a few million isk to spam 1000s of people. not a bad trade off is it?what gets me is how did he get all the information? was it from evewho? because he even spammed alts that i dont really use or have used. his statement that he 'selected' people is absolute nonsense. what he prob did was get info from eve-kill to get the corp names and alliances that are active, then using evewho information spam everyone in that corp/alliance.tbh i dont mind too much i guess, its only one mail, but if he constantly spammed or i got spammed by all csm candidates i prob be pi$$ed then."
"it's a great tradeoff if the cspa charge is never applied, which they aren't when you send to a group of people instead of individuals. go ahead and try it."
"you got one email. you will get over it."
"yes, it is. spam = unsolicited mail.also, i got it on every single alt i own. that's just annoying.trebor, i like your platform, but your methods are distasteful."
"i too got this mail on a number of alts.when asked his thoughts on certain aspects of eve or on ideas, he responds with \"can't do it now, the vote!\"too busy spamming for votes to do your job?mmmmkay."
"this================ stop the evemail spam!"
"this is spam...do you hate it?"
"yes the single eve mail i got has crushed me. i have been left utterly unable to do a thing due to the gigantic sapping of effort caused by this one single eve mail. i trust no one sends me another solitary mail about something or i may be outright killed by the sheer magnitude of spam that one eve mail is."
"are you sure you want to increase the time it takes to create titians? i mean the man spent two years on the assunta. isn't that long enough?"
"ccp beat us to making a new topic about removing ship tiers, and changing allot of everything with ships.here is a link"
"to be totally fair, how is scamming for votes any worse than an alliance coercing it's members and their alts to vote for their candidate?the csm is really just a sounding board for ccp to listen to people's views from the front lines. just because someone is on the csm, it doesn't mean that they will get anything changed, any changes are still down to ccp. ccp will do what's in their interests as a business and if they can make nice changes along the way that makes players happy, then that's just peachy."
"this being eve it's legal to gather votes by scamming, blackmail, intimidation, extorsion, payment, pier pressure, campaigning, torture, sexual favours, bribery, false promises, true promises, selling your soul and possibly human sacrifice."
"there is no grey area its, its clear cut, black and white. scamming is allowed, got d3 into the csm last year, and people complaining about it just makes sure his constituentsthe scammers and griefers of eve know he is still doing his thing, and so they will vote for him.something to be aware of, not all the people posting that he scammed him are real people, he got caught sock puppeting once last year iirc, i wouldn't be surprised if some of these threads are the same thing.edit: to be clear, d3s whole platform is that scamming and griefing are good, and should remain an core part of eve, and so he runs his campaign as a giant scam."
"who are we kidding...they all sock puppet.================ stop the evemail<U+FFFD>spam!"
"over in the ship rebalance thread i found evidence that ccp yttrbium is snot shot, as well as noticing another alt he accidentally posted on"
"the self destruct should remain in place.one reason for it is so that if someone is being a massive ****, and is clearly going to kill you, but won't, he can't hold you there for the entire day.imagine if there wasn't a self destruct option. people would grief by just holding someone tackled forever. this is augmented by the new logoff mechanics.so no. there should always be a self destruct option available.however, i do agree that a killmail should still generate."

"having seen that more than one csm candidate spammed people for votes, i've changed my mind and will support this now.it will cause problems for everyone if this becomes the 'norm'.the simple fix to have, i am guessing, an unlimited cspa charge that goes to the person that received the mail is a good one.like drake, i will quite happily deal with spam if i am paid for it."
"exactly....this isn't to do with 1 csm cannidate...this is to do with the system of how they allow/employ it.if people start to abuse it....its gonna make life nasty.================ stop the evemail spam!"

"they should have left at the same time as learning skills. +1"
"agreed except the cheapo ship thing.travel changes are in need of a much bigger overhaul than that, in fact i'd make it easier but also more risky.a single ship like carrier/jf/industrial command ships would be able to self jump without cyno at same distances than today but, here's the interesting thing, jump portal can't be re activated for 5min after jump and disrupt systems harmonics preventing any other jump capable ship to jump in to that system.fleets shouldn't be able to use this mechanic the why harmonics crap stuff and titan bridges should be completely removed.caps/sc's/titans fleets would only be able to fleet jump if they have a cyno and a black ops to set the bridge, the fact of using a fleet cyno would remove the jump portal and system harmonics penalty thus enemi fleet can jump in and spank your ass-increase solo mobility for expensive capital ships would be good for the game.-remove or make harder force projection by removing titans bridge ability would sudenly give local small entities a much more important role, would bring black ops to fleets and make those and asset you must not loose if you commit your capital fleet in to a fight, cyno capable recons instead of kestrels.this is just an idea, nothing serious right?"
"look at all you babies crying.why is it fair to allow hundreds of sub cap ships to blob a gate and allow them all to jump in without some sort of traffic timer?why can massive sub cap blobs traverse mutiple systems in the space of a few minutes when they cry about capital jumping?why is it acceptable for sub caps to be built in hours when caps take weeks? if a battleships can be built in 8 hours, caps should be built in less than 5 days.why is it acceptable for sub cap ships to require plain minerals to be produced and not have components like capital ships? don't they have sub capital armor plates, sub capital propulsion engines and so on?these are all questions that are on top of my priority list.personally, i say allow caps to jump without cynos to massive celestials. remove cynos. jump bridges will work the same way. no more precision dropping or jumping."
"balancing caps / hotdropping is p simple.give all caps a base spool-up time for their jump drive, eg:carrier/dread: 5 secondssupercarrier: 20 secondstitan: 30 secondsthen have different sizes of cynogen like guns with appropriate fitting reqs that modify the spool up time:small: 5xmed: 3xlarge: 2xxl: 1xvoila. now small disposable cyno ships force a longer spool-up for jumps and aren't as useful for hotdrops. instead someone trying to hotdrop needs to risk a larger ship to reduce the delay.edit: oh yeah this also adds scope for pos-based cynogens to have different spool-up modifiers depending on which level upgrade you install and how much you pay...."
"i think they should make it so rookie ships can not equip cyno'sit is way to easy to time a self destruct so the cyno is only up a few seconds. if this was not an exploit then why the 10 minute timer?this would still be possible but not with a free ship.all you need to put a cyno on a rookie ship is a aux power core. very low cost for a hot drop."
"the answer to that lies in the fact that their jump direction is entirely predictable and easily scoutable. with a little effort you can know how big the force is on the other side, you can even get 10 second warning when they all start jumping before they actually appear in the other system. with cyno, there is no way to effectively scout incoming force. unless you get lucky or use spies, you don't know who's jumping it, where they coming from, and how many there are.smaller ships are supposed to travel faster than large ones. with cyno mechanics, the cap ships travel much faster than even interceptors. that isn't right.that has nothing to do with cyno mechanics.while that is an interesting idea, it's too radical to be considered as a \"fix\" and should be proposed separately"
"i like medals. there is no lag associated with displaying the character photo, so go for it.it will only affect those who want to participate.support"
"bumping for pre-fan fest discussion."
"consider this a probe to see how widespread an issue this is. if it's a widespread problem we can make a case to put resources, now, to fix it as compared to later when time is available."
"you obviously have way too much stuff, vile rat.can i haz your stuffz to fix your problem? actually, i have encountered this problem recently so it would be good to know the extent of the problem so ccp can take a look at it."
"i do have a somewhat tangentally related issue...we should be able to 'stack all' items in a corp hangar / drone bay that's nearly full just like we can in a cargohold. it's really frustrating having to pull items out of a corp hangar then drop them back in again just to stack them together - especially when you're in space and this involves dicking around with jetcans."
"do it boss! i, for one, want to shoot some amarr"
"there are reasons why i can't take the whole corp in.but there has got to be better ways to make your sympathies known than huzzahing in local, bashing out a bio, typing up a storm in the intergalactic summit - which you never see me do anyway because; what's the point? - or being flashy orange on the overview.those are the only ways to communicate your identity with a factionfaction liveries bought with loyalty points would be a start, but even shiny paint jobs are ineffectual against a titan in high-sec.if you don't empower role-play with a vigilant gm team - you might as well be the barman in the cantina saying; \"your kind aren't welcome here\"."
"well the op won his/her own thread with the above statement! fantastic. i do understand what you mean by the 'rpg' element being a bit weak in eve your op wasn't very clear by the way.i am hoping with the new patch that the rp element will be kicked up a notch; war is good for that sort of thing.more interaction with the npc's in the eve universe would be a good thing for those that want it."
"well thanks, i was beginning to think i was talking to myself, or maybe one of my split personalitiesas exercises in futility go, eve is one of the more engaging - and could be betteyou may have noticed that i'm not much or a rper, mainly because there is no good reason to be. but i would like to champion the art for those that aretrue, it was probably for the best that died horribly rather get anywhere near adopted. i regret trying to bait super-mits and cohorts into a debate about the transcendental nature of identity. the opening act was appropriately rubbishedabsolutely. it's just not entirely clear who you are fighting for, or why. omnipresent threat for no reason kills creativityi'm not sure i agree on that score. i'd rather we ditched the npcs and let the subscribers take up their rolesi know that would blur the line between empyrean and the mortals of the eve universe, but i think it is time."
"i should've expanded on that one a little.npc's i mean the factions, gallente, minmatar, amarr and the carebear one, ummm yeah, caldari. someone else suggested that it would be good if there were border skirmishes with the factions along the border regions that players may choose to get involved in which is a help to the rp side of things.might work, it might not.i personally have no time to rp in eve nor any inclination to. i log in long enough to join fleet and kill things and that's about it."
"you know what? i actually agree with this. i am not a roleplayer, in fact i find the idea a bit weird personally, but i do agree that because eve is very much based on the sandbox ideal. and as such i think there should be more \"ripples\" to your actions as ccp so elegantly says it in their adverts. i would go a step further and say that there should be a new feature. i think that faction standings should change for large alliances as a result of their members actions. suicide ganking should not only effect the players standings in that faction's space. it should also affect their alliances' standings in a very small way, so that prolonged suicide ganking from an alliance would eventually lead to consequences for the alliance and its members as a whole.corporation and alliance npc standings should matter more.although this discussion has started around rp, it seems to me, that it is ultimately about the effects we have on one another's game experience. i know im probably not looking at this in the same way as everyone else is, but i can't help but feel like there should be some political implications for actions everywhere.\"in the age of information, ignorance is a choice.\" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
"you know what, your probably onto something there. it seems to me that nullsec alliances spend a lot of time adjusting standings in relation to their neibours because it is vital for defining how they react to one another. i'd argue the nullsec alliances have forged their own strong identities and are rping by default because they have to.but in highsec, standings are not nearly so meaningful. perhaps they should be.maybe part of the new player experience should include a section on setting standings and bearing grudges against a can flipper that crossed you half a year ago."
"standings between players and npc should definitely be more meaningful.i wish you hadn't brought up the goons and their ice interdiction. makes me uncomfortable as someone who has played as a rper in mmorpgs when i get the slightest scent that rp is being used as an excuse to get the game mechanics to protect and insulate gamers from hostile actions of other players. i would like to see the game lore reflected in the game mechanics, but the lore is the framework in which we interact with the game world, not a means of regulating and enforcing 'good' player behavior. the only thing worse than that is roleplayers that create a story and expect it to be insulated from other players or the game world itself. always reminds me of this group in shadowbane called dragonscale. they claimed to have a scale of the \"great dragon\" under their city and some how this would help them defeat said dragon should it ever return to destroy the world again. well great most other players don't care, problem was their city was in a desert region home to a large number of player groups roleplaying irekei, vicious red desert elves who by the game lore worshiped this \"great dragon\". well the irekei all declared holly war against the dragonscale group, which in turn lead to much dragonscale members whining about griefing. so called roleplayers complaining about other roleplayers playing their role. rp should be part of the sandbox, not isolated from it.in short there has been a lot self proclaimed rpers in mmorpgs that have deservedly brought down the scorn of other players and tarnished what roleplaying is, or at least ought to be in these games."

"dear sir,i was not surprised when i logged on around a week ago to an alliance mail from hans jagerblitzen asking us to take a look at a good post you had made on the eve forums. ever the community builder, hans is never shy about promoting something that is good or meriting discussion, even if it comes from a candidate he is running against. though we all support hans here at late night alliance, many of us were willing to go take a look, and offer an encouraging word to another csm candidate, specifically yourself.what did surprise me was the solicitation i received several days later, where it was obvious that my character's name, and the names of fellow alliance members and pilots had obviously been stripped from this post. this was a different mail then the one sent to the eve community at large the following day. in this mail, you solicit our help, stating that you \"need to grub for every last vote.\"the following day, i received a second spam, and must admit that i became somewhat irritated at this point, and concerned that ccp was allowing this spam to continue. what will be next? recruitment spam every morning? contract solicitations? by setting the precedence on this matter, ccp is opening a huge can of worms. i'm afraid that based on your example, people are going to realize how easy it is to spam, and that our inboxes will someday resemble jita local chat.i could argue that your spam is indeed in direct conflict with the terms of service of eve online.i could explain how spam in general, specifically the precedence of your solicitations that will eventually cause additional solicitations, directly interferes with the ability of other eve online subscribers, as a whole, to enjoy the game. spam interferes with other, legitimate communication between players. it is also extremely frustrating to pilots who cannot easily filter such unsolicited communications -- filtering that most companies readily, and eagerly offer their clients in this day and age.i could explain how your mail could be considered as a promotion of solicitation, and that your open urging to forward this spam mail on to my corpmates and friends resembles the making of a chain letter--a practice specifically prohibited by the tos.instead i'm petitioning your good graces. i am petitioning that you do not contradict the very things you state in your mail.for, how can i believe you when you say:when you send spam that most decidedly does not improve the game, and does not benefit the entire eve community, but instead frustrates and annoys pilots?how can i believe you when you say: when you defend your spam mail, even though a large number of people have expressed their opinions against this act? when you knowing took a 'calculated risk' knowing full well you would be going against the opinions of a large portion of eve pilots? when you blatantly shoved the opinions of eve pilots aside for the benefit of your own interests? how can i believe you when you say you want to push for us...when you openly disrespect the eve player base by openly 'grubbing around for votes' and spamming, instead of using that time to engage the community in honest, open discussion about game mechanics and players' issues?not even the troll voters want this kind of spam in their inbox.how can i ever again engage you in conversation on the eve online forums without the fear that the very act of posting on one of your threads will lead to another spam mail?even the mitanni built his name recognition through game philosophies, reputation, and action. not by sniveling computer programs and scraping macros that smell of desperation.so, i petition you: please stop unsolicited mail sent to the eve player base at large, and petition ccp to have this considered an exploit, to prevent it from happening in the future. please take the time to build your own mailing list, as other candidates have done through hard work and community involvement, where you can openly engage with people who desire to hear from you. please start listening to us again. and please, please stop spamming me with your desperate, contradictory propoganda. sincerely,susan blackwww.gamerchick.net @gamerchick42"
"cheers susan, i second this."
"i am going to go with a wild stab in the dark in here, you got spammed by a csm candidate?hope robert woodhead pays attention. this may very well backfire and cost him votes.i take it back, drake, i may support your idea after all."
"this is beyond stupid, you obviously did not read trebor's open letter to the community on why he did this.seriously, get busy living or get busy dying ... just stfu about things you are clueless about.kthnxbai"

"you forgot to mention that this thread doesn't belong here. but thats ok. :================ stop the evemail spam!"
"i received this kind of thing from trebor last year. so it didn't surprise me that he did it this year. the people who trebor offended are the minority, but raising the issue of the spam exemption for csm candidates is important.this does raise the issue of how well the large alliances can organise behind their specific representative. the rest of the players essentially need to get behind o e or two candidates. when the counting is published, i have no doubt that a large majority of the votes in the first 20 hours will turn out to have come from null sec blocs.as offensive as trebor's campaign is to some people, it is necessary on order to secure a seat for someone whose support base is \"the whole population\" as opposed to single-issue candidates such as the mittani \"death to all supercaps\", two step wormhole population, hans jagerblitzen faction warfare, mintrolio csm are joek et al.i voted for trebor, since he will at least communicate with the players, as opposed to mittani who figures no one is worth his time. well, except when he has an opportunity to appear as a stool pigeon on a ccp propaganda video."
"it is one thing to get the populations attention to participate.its an entirely different matter to shove that message down peoples throats without permission or authorization thereof.i find trebors moves disgusting and insulting....if he was interested in winning the hearts of the common pilot...he's got alot to learn about politics.he likely will win mostly on nullsec/low sec votes anyway.as for the csm in gernal....get a clue....seriously.....the csm has always been like this....people are likely more turned off than ever when it comes to participation and the underhanded tactics they use just to get a damn ticket to iceland and sit there and look pretty.at least those such as mitanni and a few others are actually doing something for once...everyone else traets this like a laughing stock of a joke.if you want to win the hearts of the common joe pilot....then you do so by your actions...not by your flipping words.you get out there....talk to people....convo them....and eventually by word of mouth they will show up.forcing them to vote by means of spamming is going to **** people off....hell i'd sooner vote for darius who scams by promising plexes to get them to vote for him as opposed to people who fill my eve mail box with their #### smelling campang messages.why? because darius is using a eve mechanic that is widely known and respectable....well in most circiles aside from noobsspamming with eve mails is not respectable or considered a mechanic to be widely nown and used.it's an exploit.....prue and simple. one that ccp will beat around the bush about and pussy foot when it comes to reasoning as to whether its allowed or not.they gave a grey answer...not black or white....no no or yes...etc.lets get the facts straight people....this is par for the course here...nothings going to change...just going to make more people demand csm disbandment...and that's just the tip of the iceberg.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"if a player can commit 50billion or whatever for a titan and 100 for fits: triple the amount of minerals/components needto build it, make capital components much more expensive in materials cost.having a titan must be an exceptional asset but should have much bigger access difficulty than now by it's price, if tomorrow you have to pay 500billions for a titan i'm quite sure you'll see only a few outside because everyone and his grandmother will want to kill them by any means.buy a 30millio sp alt to sit it in is a difficulty?titans price with the number of plex flowing is dirty cheap and are not dieing enough, battleships need to be cheaper to build have more hitpoins as speed, and 25% more dps againt caps/supers/titans wouldn't be too much"
"i think that the older bitvet guy that has at least 1 pt in each battleship race:will get free prerequisite in each race he has that point -will it be lvl3 or 4? we'll seenow the same bit vet has battlecruisers 5: dilema, because he also have 1pt per bs in 3races and 1 to 5 because carrier. will this scrub get racial battlecruiser 5 in all races? malcanis law also: battlecruisers 5 and destroyers 5 in training folowed by frigs4/cruisers4/battleship 1 where it's needed to be sure you will not have to train stupid amounts of time for something where another one spent a few hours only."
"personally, i'm fairly concerned about the changes to dessies and bcs, specifically because i have bcs 5 and was considering training dessies 5 soon. i just don't see this change to them ending well; either i end up getting the sp back for training one of them up to the level that i have now and get robbed of access to the other three races due to an arbitrary change of ccp's or i get sp for all 4 of them and younger players have to train 4x as long to get access to the same stuff. personally, i prefer the second option, but neither one is a 'good' solution.personally, i think they should just leave the bcs and destroyers how they are now, since it will cause the least pain overall. otherwise, someone's going to end up getting pissed off and hurt, either way.i do like the idea of the tiericide though, i'm hoping they balance and execute it well."
"the tone of the comments from the devs indicates that they intend to err on the side of generosity."
"this is eve where \"life isn't perfect.\" upon sd substantially reduce the chance of loot dropping to \"almost but not quite zero.\"killmail yes since the sd pilot would not need to allow sd if they were winning or thought they could escape.no insurance.also: because suicide ganking is legit and certainly a lot of people support stiffer sd penalties against the attacker, i also agree it would be cool and good to have a self-destruct pulse that damages the attackers as one destructs whether concord shows up or not.since death is meaningless in this game, in a sense, every attack is an investment. just because concord isn't around doesn't mean the soon-to-be-spacedust pilot shouldn't get a last swing on the way out."
"maybe ccp should re-look at how the market and item system is organized? this is probably a simple suggestion that opens a leviathan of database manipulation, but there are some oddities in the market, like the fact that you find nano-fiber hull conversions in the hull upgrades section. while it is true that this is a 'hull' item, no one uses it for its beneficial upgrade to your hull, its basically a propulsion upgrade. if your fitting up an interceptor, you need to go to both propulsion upgrades and hull upgrades to get the fittings you need. additionally, could we have weapon upgrades either sub-categorized, or have the modules in them placed into the same folder as the turret type they bonus? i think this is a help the noobs kind of thing to, so we don't have gallente noobs flying hybrid ships with heat sinks in the lows thinking they're going to help.i'm sure there are other oddities in the market system, but those are some specific examples. i think it would be a good little ui/usability/noob disambiguation project."
"another thing about this proposed vessel is that it will unlike carriers be able to operate in high security space, and won't require ships to be packaged.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."

"at a minimum drop gcc for plexes and anomolies. anybody ratting, and hanging out at a planet is asking for trouble anyways. they are either looking for a fight, or are going to get ganked by somebody if they aren't careful. i guess i would follow the suggestions here and keep sec status hits to points of transit - stations and gates.pocos... pos... if you're not going to not implement gcc at pocos, then don't implement it at a pos. i would prefer to keep gcc for structure attacks since they \"theoretically\" encourage low sec economic developmnet.but this is all details. great idea overall!"
"i only lead with the goons and the ice interdiction as an example because i know they are a hardy bunch and are very able to speak for themselves.i personally think they have done more or the game than many other group. the ice interdiction was just sound strategy, period. an rper could adopt it as a personal motive for revenge but they would be daft to do so, because in all likely-hood they would be outmatched in every way. but say they did want to take the part of a gallente national outraged at their callous behaviour. what are they gonna do? go the the intergalactic summit and file a public complaint? what good will that do?personally i<U+FFFD>m in favour of abolishing the intergalactic summit because it segregates rpers from gamers and fosters a feeling of preferential treatment. what is i.s. for if if it not a tool to make the life of gms in charge of pandering to rpers life easier?no-one is going to look in there for a reason why they are getting shot at. kill it off, it is doing more harm than good."
"i guess it is hard to accept a debate from someone who has not made their motives clear from the outset.you are right, ship combat pvp does not interest me, motives and causes interest me. eve gives plenty of reasons for people to shoot one another in the face. but you can rarely be sure exactly why you are waking up in a new clone at any given time.rpers make good leaders because they set impossible standards for themselves and get frustrated when other people don't see the beauty of their ideal.the thread you linked was an interesting read, except swtor is not nearly as deep as eve.so here is my ideal. i want to take the markets from jita - the citadel and bring them to everyshore. for gods sake why? - because game lore suggests that is where it should be and if i pull it off i'll get a sense of achievement like no other.here's the problem; i played fw because it was new and exciting. now my corps standings are shot to hell with the caldari faction. i guess i'll have to convince someone else to do the hauling. you see plenty of people wtriting their own eve related stories outside of the game for that reason. rping in eve is every bit as hard as acting is in real life."
"what?? pretty sure rping in eve is not remotely the equivalent performing on broadway."

"with pi shifting from high sec to low sec i propose allowing a module to be constructed on-planet in low sec and 0.0 only that allows jettison of 4000 or 5000m3 into space. we are starting to see corps setting up dozens of customs offices over wide stretches of low sec and allowing them to sit collecting high tax rates. the larger the corp or alliance, the less chance anyone has to dispute their claim. i feel if a corp is going to lay claim to an area and profit they should have to protect their interests. by allowing space drops you create a new profession of smuggling. when dust arrives it provides an option for corps to hire high ground forces to raid and destroy these \"illegal\" facilities. in space they would need to police their own skies to prevent smugglers from circumventing their customs duesas more products are introduced requiring pi goods, quality planets will become more valuable. smuggling will then become more profitable and more dangerous as large corporations will be more inclined to protect their assets from theft.edit: just noticed this is the 666th topic for the assembly hall. not sure if that's good or bad..."
"i'm afraid there are some obvious problems with this suggestion.firstly, anyone in low-sec gets shot at, whether they are doing pi or not. so there would be no policing, only business as usual. secondly, we have no idea how dust is going to work in relation to eve yet anyway and so making suggestions this far in advances is probably a little premature.also, if such a mod were to exist, then everyone in low-sec would be using them. and so it would make the customs offices largely pointless.\"in the age of information, ignorance is a choice.\" www.stateofwar.co.nf"

"back to the top - some good ideas here, let's discuss this some more! - op updated with mxzf's suggestion"
"i like this idea. it would almost have to be a change in the way mission are distributed, changing tag requirements still wouldn't address the lack of tags on the market.still, i think people tend to avoid tag missions in general because they don't want to be restricted to one part of high sec. not sure how to solve that issue.one thing they may want to consider is reducing or even eliminating the faction hits with these missions. they seem like a needless restriction and are the reason you can't find tags on the market. they would be fine if we had an economy that was spread even, but we don't. a gallente mission runner needs jita a lot more than a caldari mission runner needs dodixie."
"ah, see there, there's the thing - there are people probably not many! like myself, who would exclusively run anti-faction missions if i the option was offered to us and ii the distribution of the missions namely, a gallente agent offering anti-caldari missions and vice versa. if these conditions were changed, the tags would flow...true there would be some tag value deflation with increased availability, but of course not everyone will want to run the anti-empire missions :don't forget that this proposal, diamaht, is exlcusively concerned with increasing the tag supply via the choice of exclusive anti-faction missions; it's not about looking at the tag requirements in the lp stores as the increase tag supply will rectify the disproportionate requirements. thanks for your support!"

"snowflake,i think it might be worth re-posting this thread as a [proposal] at some point. you could work out the details here with others' constructive criticism in this thread. i don't have a strong knowledge of how standings work so you'll have to bear with any questions or ideas i talk through.i would propose that; this would get you your wish. if goonswarm just as an example. im sure there are more criminal alliances. actually, possibly not were to commit enough crimes in highsec their member's and the alliance in general would have some accountability and eventually would be seen as enemies in highsec.obviously people could still create \"marta\" corps to avoid attention, but that's a sound political strategy even from a rp basis.\"in the age of information, ignorance is a choice.\" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
"it shouldn't just be the 'where' that's important but the 'who'. taking the ice miner example, were those miners really pod pilots that the gallentean authorities really care about let alone really count as their own? some maybe, that had high standings, were part of gallente npc corp thus providing taxes, perhaps some had been in the militia, but the rest? there could be quite reasonable rp explanations why the gallente might actually welcome a group into their space like goons to kill off certain miners.npc reactions to players shouldn't just be based on the history of a player's actions towards other players, but also a player's history towards npcs. the rper in me questions why that ice and minerals is freely available in high sec in the first place, being that it is the most built up established part of civilized space. where are the mines in the real world? they're rarely next to major first world cities, they may have been there long ago, but have since been depleted. the current mines are out in the middle of nowhere in the wilderness and the frontiers of modern civilization.anyway, if you want to come up with ways to improve rp/lore in eve, stop trying to figure out a new ways to protect high sec pveers from the likes of the goons, and start coming up with ways to make the game more immersive where all player actions and choices have meaningful consequences that also make sense within the game lore."
"i would argue this idea would add immersion to the game. it wouldn't really be a nerf for pvp alliances and such. it would become a lifestyle choice. it wouldn't protect highsec people, because there will always be people wanting to kill highsec players whatever the consequences. but it would mean that those corporations and alliances would have to be generally located on the fringes, in lowsec. you can still highsec gank using wardecs if you want without incurring these penalties.it would give pirate corps a much more authentic feel. because lets face it, plenty of pirate corps have people flying around in highsec without a care in the world sure, maybe not many of them.i think it would make for much more interesting options when joining corps. having to choose whether you wanted to join an hardcore infamous pirate corp that can not go into gallante space, or some mild mannered alternative that tries to keep its relationships all hunky-dorry with the factions.i really don't want to protect highsec players. if you have any alternatives to make this kind of thing work, throw up some ideas. that's kind of the point.\"in the age of information, ignorance is a choice.\" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
"if your idea was to replace concord as a form high sec policing, and that the standing hits/npc reaction was based on who the aggressor and who the aggressed are to the npcs rather than just where it happens, i would consider it a potentially nice improvement. ultimately a system that is built to promote immersion and the game lore shouldn't distinguish between player actions towards other players and player actions towards npcs. game mechanics that have the gallente npcs outlaw the mattani because he blew up a hundred or so ice miners in their space, but give a free pass to some other player who blew up a thousand gallente navy ships running caldari missions, never was about the lore or rp."
"i'm sorry, i'm afraid i'm not bright enough to follow the technical aspects of standings you've described in your postspeople seem to be under the impression i've got something against goonswarm, i really don't. the ice interdiction was the most exiting thing to happen in my neighbourhood in years. the fact that they announced the action allowed me to protect the vulnerable people in my corp. i want to encourage interaction between small highsec corps and big nullsec alliancesthey did not couch the interdiction in rp terms because quite frankly they don't have to, there is no advantage to it. but that should not stop someone from trying to interpret their action in terms of game lorequite frankly i'm jealous. as someone has already pointed out, they are having more fun in this game than i am, and the reason is they are in no way tied to game lore and they are not stuck sat in highsec out of necessity. that's my beef. game lore should be a story telling driver not an impedimentwhat bothers the hell out of me is that no one can offer a satisfying response to the ice interdiction, except take some ships up to their stronghold and shoot at themi've argued myself to a stand-still because there really is no place left to goplayers can't take the part of the empires in empire space bacuase they have very little control over the environmentthe gms can't take the part of the empires without being called out for favouritism, they are few in number and have to be painstakingly careful not to upset the balancethere is something very very wrong, i can't see a solution - maybe you can."
"this is the major difference between a sandbox like eve and a theme park like wow.in a theme park, story is the driver, in a sandbox, players are.oh, and according to game lore, capsuleers are not citizens anyway, they are pretty much treated as 1 man sovereign nations by the empires.edit: i am trying to be real nice about this, but ultimately this thread comes down to you not quite understanding that eve is a pvp sandbox. even mining is supposed to be a form of pvpgetting the ore before the other guy and ice mining is one of the thing that break this paradigm. anything that you can do with no real competition or threat breaks this paradigm."
"i've never considered it in those terms before. maybe it is the ice mining mech that needs to be fixed.thank you folks for adjusting my thinking without pissing me off too much. :i wish you all the best in every endeavour."
"except roden is an empyrean capsuleer - see templar onei really tried not to point that out, but \"the geek\" won over."
"great point, but i would qualify the statement somewhat.in the themepark mmorpg the story beginning to end is predetermined. the tracks are laid out for the player, and although there may be different tracks to follow, you can never get off the tracks and set your own path to an unknown outcome. also because of this the developers are under constant pressure to lay down new tracks content, because players aren't given the tools and freedom to create their ownthe sandbox mmorpg players are more free to create their own story and that of others, or to have their own story shaped by other players willingly or not. however, all this still happens within a framework of the game world. it's not pure imagination land where anything goes, just like the real world there's laws of physics, a backdrop of history and culture, a framework that builds up a virtual world that allows us all to interact with it and each other in a meaningful way. it's in this context that the game lore is a legitimate story driver in the sandbox mmorpg. albeit unlike the themepark, it's up to the players how they deal with itput yet another way... the ultimate themepark, is like a disney land/six flags that builds new rides so fast that there's always something new when you get bored of the last one, and just like dave and busters you get cheesy prizes at the end just for playing. the ultimate sandbox is star trek's holodeck. which is the better venue for roleplaying?in eve's particular case, i've long argued that the game's areas delineated by security rating should rather be divided according to how much the players can manipulate the sand in the box. wormholes and sovereignty nullsec are the purest player sanbox parts of the game and should remain that way. empire space high sec and low sec and npc nullsec should be driven by npc politics. that is to say in this space the game lore drives the story, or perhaps better put, the game lore drives the players to create the story"

"please make this topic sticky"
"this is not caod"
"thanks"
"increase the material requirements, since people wont lower their prices any futher the titan price goes up."
"oh look. yet another thread that should have just been in the dev blog feedback thread."
"i think that faction hits could be balanced a bit, using that as a way to adjust the supply of tags if this was implemented, but i think the faction hits are good to have because it gives you a tradeoff. bear in mind that you really can buy pretty much anything in any of the four major trade hubs, though some stuff is slightly marked up i haven't been to jita in months myself. and everyone does have three slots on their account, tossing together a jita alt doesn't take much effort.i think that this proposal would go a long way towards making the tag market actually work well, due to people being able to choose to go for anti-faction missions, and would love to see it implemented. the faction hits can be re-balanced after the market stabilizes if it turns out there's too much/too little change in the tag market."
"this is true. however, you would then have the issue of tanking a drone that does em damage as opposed to explosive that's almost as fast as a warrior ii but does more damage.making drones suck even more wouldn't be that great for gallente pilots that use drone boats. the problem is that the warrior ii's are doing more damage than they are supposed to due to a mix up with the damage multipliers.fix that and amarr drones will become useful again."
"ok, could some of you hitting the like button tell me why you like it? or what you would like to see improved?"
"i disapprove because:breaking down the titan into multiple 1 trick ponies that are good at pvp against a modest 3 hulls carriers, dreads and supers at the cost of 50 bil isk or so per ship, is nerfing the titan into a pitiful state similar to what the black ops is in now. and that is underwhelming for a ship that costs half a bil to say the least.your moaning in this topic because of tracking abilities while being buffed in fleet + titan fits that allow those ships to shoot at smaller ships. you justify this emotive demand by pointing out its lack of role and the fact that it should be rare as per design.last time i checked, eve has less than 1000 titans. out of how many hundred thousand players? yea, that sounds pretty rare to me.so your idea of breaking the titan down will fail in the long term because people will want the underwhelming ship to do more later down the line.your justification fails because the ship is already rare, even if allot of them are owned by a small number of alliances within the powerblocks."
"please no. no more supercapital size ships. there are to many in eve already and with the amount of isk around, the botting, the ability to buy isk online means those will just get blobbed as well eventually.best solution for titans = remove them."
"my solution to the problem, probably hard to implement but here goes.1. nerf capital turret tracking to the level of sieged dreads for structure bashing only2. add another rack of turret slots to titans, only being able to fit bship sized guns.or: double damage bonus from 100% per level to 200% per level for capital turrets and make titans fit only half number of capital turrets  marauder style and leave the rest of turret slots for bship sized guns with appropriate bonusso you would have a massive ship able to fit anti cap and subcap weapons, wich only makes sense. subcap weapons although highly bonused  100% dmg per level and the equivalent of 8 bship sized turrets  would inflict far less damage than the current capital sized weapons but would still add a huge advantage at a proper cost: 1 titan = 50 bil hull, firepower equivalent for 5 bships compared to a bship costing 150m. i say it's only fair.as for the massive ehp titans have just remove their ability to receive remote repairs forcing them to fit a local tank or just a massive buffer.now titans are both very useful, not highly overpowered and should start dying.problem solved."
"still think the simplest way of fixing the titan issue is remove the damn turrets. it still has the dd for virtually instapopping capitals and structures, why have it shooting at sub-cap fleets at all?they were never designed to be taking on a fleet of sub-caps. why else remove the aoe dd's of old if ccp still wanted them to take on fleets solo?do this and the titan still retains it's usefulness in fleets and there's no need to remove them or redesign them."
"lol....your logic works the other way as well.more isk = more disposable sub caps = bigger and more frequent sub cap blobs.fix the blob and delete all spaceships from eve!wis for everyone yay \o/"
"actually, my proposal would make the mothership cost about 7 bil, the superdread about 18 bil, and i left the titan up in the air as for price until someone else came up with a reasonable suggestion.edit: you mean carriers, dreads, supers, and structures. also of note, only 2 of the proposed ships are for combat.the only time i mentioned tracking was to say that its a problem that needs to be fixed, but doing so will not magically \"fix\" titans like some seem to think it will. plus, my point is that it is currently balanced as a rare ship, when it no longer is, and as thus needs a re-balance.i would define rare in eve terms as any time you only see 3-5 per fleet. given that we regularly see more than that, i would say that it is no longer rare.i would like suggestions to prevent making the ships underwhelming, while allowing them to be balanced effectively.please go re-read my proposal, it appears to have been updated since the last time you looked at it."
"too many people have too much isk invested in building/having/flying titans. removing them from the game would dump trillions upon trillions of isk back into the game, and would massively screw up the economy. as such this is a bad idea."
"the reason they have massive ehp is to account for the fact that they cost 50b for a hull. if you nerfed their survivability, you would also have to nerf their price tag along with various other things to compensate."
"i would like to thank tallian saotome of fatal ascension and snow axe of goonwaffe for their ideas. i almost forgot to thank issler dainze for allowing me to run this idea in her post.what i am currently proposing is that all newbies enter a pool effectively like that for the rookie channel probably using the same info that allows people onto that channel, except with the added requirement that the account the character is on is not a buddy or other added account and isn't a plex accountand the account is less than 60 days oldat the same time allow people to opt in to a mentor pool. give this pool some kind of criteria, possibly a time frame like 6 months + active for the account.allow the newbies to do a tutorial quest to teach them how to use the mentor database. have the mentor list showing things like name, ageof character, number of jumps away from mentor and scores previously given to the mentor by previous newbies. also a button to allow a chat to be opened to the mentor before accepting also removing the mentor and pupil from the lists for the duration of the chat, preventing a mentor from being overwhelmedhave a panel similar to this for the mentors to access with access to the newbie information like age of character, amount of time played allowing the mentor to see if the current activity level of the player fits in to his own and how many jumps to get to the newbie.allow a simple pop up like the one currently used for fleet invites to allow a mentor invite.now the hard bits are the rewards for the mentors. i agree with tallian saotome that a corporate reward system is probably a good place to start. this will allow ceo's to set up a structure within their corp to allow newbies to flourish and give something to the corp as a whole. i'm not sure about tallian saotome's idea of increasing tax rate mostly because of the current inflation in the game it's self. with plex's rising at a fairly allarming rate and mineral prices rising as well. i suggested a leveled system for corporations to assist this as well but i don't think that is right either. so what i am going to suggest is that corps should get a 1% reduction per newbie up to 10% in a reduction in the price of medical clones, repairs, insurance costs and production costs at npc stations.for the mentor himself i recommend the addition of an in-game and in-forum tag, similar to the dev and csm tags you see on people now.as suggested by snow axewe need a corp bonus as corp isn't as likely to do this, as they don't want dead weight screwing up their numbersunless it is a newbie training corp so they will teach the newbie to survive so they can help the corp.i agree that a corporation is an integral part of this process, for it to succeed corps have got to want newbies. i also feel the need for the newbies at the end of their tutelage whether from time or they leave the current mentor need to be able to rate the mentors performance. allowing an averaging of this score and possibly a pop up on comments to appear on the newbie mentor screens for others to see.to prevent newbie abuse, i recommend that an easy ability for the newbie to remove them self from the mentor be established so that way if the mentor does us them as a personal slave, the pupil can get out simply, i also recommend the ability for either the mentor or the pupil to cease the relationship easily as sometimes personalities clash.for the future of eve we need not just us regular bar flies but need blood to move the game forward. i personally hope eve will be around in the distant future so i have something to play if i ever make it to retirement:in addition to this i feel that additional tutorial missions and and an expansion of the lvl 1 quests are needed to intice players to stay and play. i have been playing level 1 missions for the last few days on an alt and they repeat so often to make you want to shoot your self in the face. please feel free to leave any helpful comments and suggestions as i think this is a good idea on a way forward for the game.frying doom"

"curious but exactly what do you consider \"flood\" to be? just how many minerals are on the market due to bots? 10%? 30%? 60%? 0.5%? before you accuse bots of being the reason for something you might want to actually figure out how much responsibility bots are contributing"
"there was supposed to be just a few of them but now alliances give them away, certain alliances blob them and there is no answer to that. they've ruined sov warfare. if you don't have them and a couple of titans to back it up you cannot hold sov."
"it's like a pissing match. doesn't matter how much **** you have...in the end nobody wins and **** is all over the place. the problem is the proliferation of supercaps and titans. these are supposed to be the best of the best and very hard to obtain and maintain. rare...instead...they are all over the place in blob numbers. the only answer i see to this other than completely changing the mechanics behind them is to make dreads the supercap destroyers that they should be."
"i actually think they should lose turret slots entirely, and get the their dd able to target subcaps again. one kill every 10 minutes per titan isn't huge, but their blapping power is just silly.let them keep their ability to refit on the fly, they have hundreds of thousands of crew member able to recalibrate parts/bring entire systems online. ewar immunity has to go.and is till think titans should be tied to a fleet command role to activate any systems other than warp/jump drives."
"it's pretty bad for living out of a pos tower in wormspace, yes.things that tend to cause the hangar to load extra-slow if present: bookmarks, named cargo cans, fitted ships. anything uniquely identifiable really.not had it happen to me personally but a few corpmates have had ship hangars refuse to load at all, necessitating a re-log to get at their ships."
"does affect me to some effect - i mostly alleviate it by spreading assets over most tabs to equal extent.more tabs might alleviate the problem to some extent.search function without preloading - would only load what you need if you know what you needloading modules by type if you don't know what you neednothing else come to mind"
"just a quick related questionis red vs blue's current popularity because of an absence of game lore and alliance politics - or because the enemy is clearly defined and you know what you are fighting for and against?"

"the thing with botters is they tend to do their activities solo so as not to draw attention to the fact that they are botting.as to afk miners, well it would be rare to have a whole fleet of them be afk, possibly the odd pilot here or there but not everyone.this proposal would benefit fleet fights more than anything else but i am not sure how they would all focus fire on one ship if 200+ ships of the opposing fleet opens up on you. drones are pretty dumb at the best of times.if they did this, i would hate to be the first guy to open fire as 1,000+ drones heads his way..."

"as far as i am informed the player and csm part of the scrum is to provide ideas and priorities to said ideas. said idea implementation as well as tweaking is one of the tasks done by ccp.therefore without further ado:create a site similar to july 2011 prioritization crowdsourcing, but with few minor changes.- every registered account is capable of voicing his own idea since only idea required - few words are necessary, if the need to explain arises - link the idea to the corresponding forum topic- every registered account is capable for voting multiple times limited amount on other player's ideas. whether votes will be for only or both for and against is up for debate.- said account holder can then modify his/her votes at any time - to reflect his new ideas on new patches or personal experience.this would allow very robust and malleable system that can be accessed by anyone - and anyone would be able to see much more ideas per session. with ever growing voting participation i expect high traffic with this idea as well, previous crowdsourcing showed decent participation.main problem that i see is it can potentially grow very big, perhaps it should have automatic purging of ideas, that achieved very little response \ too much negative response. perhaps manual management required.thoughts? ideas?"
"what's the difference between your proposed site and, say, a forum dedicated to posting ideas in?"
"more consolidated information - and more easily available.you don't need to read each thread to see the basis of the idea as well as general feelings towards it."
"how exactly have you been 'harassed' by someone opening a convo or trade window in station?these are legitimate game functions and without them, communication and simple trades would become impossible.if you mean that someone is deliberately doing this to annoy you, then why not block them? would seem the easiest option.*edit*i don't normally click on external links but in this case you kind of have to as op has missed a rather important point from his post....they are still opening chat/trade even whilst blocked. i know it's impossible to open a chat to someone you've blocked but can't confirm it with trade i like just about everyone and only have a handful of morons on the block list so hard for me to check.think you will need to explain what's happening fully before anyone can give you advice/help."
"well it is simple ... u block the guy who is annoying for u .... and he is still able to open trade windows all around .... even if u closing them. the only reason he is doing that is to bother u. no reall offer just opening the window u cancel it and he opens it again. i have captured video and pics of him doing that. u cannot write properly because poped windows moves ur cursor.solution is to have this **** in blocking functionality or minimazed them by default.and honestly if i block someone i really dont want to communicated with such guy even here on forums."
"ah, so what you are proposing is that the \"block\" function should do its job properly and block trade requests as well as chat/evemail.why didn't you just say so?"
"lol next time he does it, put in a request for 100mil isk and accept, see if he falls for it.i wasn't aware that you could open a trade with someone you had blocked. you learn something new everyday."
"you might also want to learn that the term is \"harassment\", there's no second 'h' in \"harass\". it helps if you don't have blatant spelling errors in the central premise of your post.and if the issue is that blocked individuals are opening up trade windows with you, then just say so. however, harassment is a part of eve, just as much as pvp. don't expect ccp to make it impossible to harass someone, but they will likely fix what seems to be a bug if it is, in fact, possible to trade with someone who you have blocked.also, an easy way to get around this is just to minimize their trade window and ignore it, they can't open a new one with you if you have theirs still open."
"agreed...for the love of all things good...please speak english for crying out loud....this isnt high school..this is not your damned cell phone....nor is this playskool....you dont need to slur either.because when you people and you know who you are do that...we all die a little on the inside.l1k txt u l8tr wheva*couldnt resist*================ stop the evemail<U+FFFD>spam!"
"current systemthe current overview settings allow you to colourtag and set a background for all pilots in the overview depending on standing/fleet/war etc.backstoryin recent weeks, the corporation i am in has been heavily running missions and then cleaning up with two salvagers. what we have noticed, is that the two salvagers are constantly locking onto the same wreck except only one can tractor the wreck. we created a temporary fix by having a pilot abandon roughly half the wrecks so they would be blue allowing the two salvagers to divide their attention in between the blue and white wrecks.my proposal - basicadd new colourtags and/or backgrounds to the overview settings that allow you to see what fleet members are locked onto in general. as the system is already there, i am assuming the implementation of this would not be as hard as creating an entirely new system. as a lock cannot be cancelled during the locking stage, i believe a wreck should be 'marked' when someone starts to lock onto it.my proposal - advancedas well as adding the colourtags and/or backgrounds for targets, the ability to see if a pilot in fleet is already being supported would be useful. e.g. 'pilot is being cap/shield/armour transfered'uses1. more optimal salvaging operations due to less wrecks being \"double locked\" with tractors2. more efficient fleet mining operations as fleet members would not be mining from the same asteroid as someone else-this is more when there are 10+ miners in a belt3. allow smaller targets frigates/cruisers during missions to be cleaned up faster as the larger ships battlecruisers/battleships/strategic cruisers would be able to divide their fire-most smaller ships can be destroyed in one or two sequential shots by larger ships, however, many ships may fire at the same time or be firing missiles which is overkill, a waste of time and a waste of ammunition.4. if there are multiple support ships in a fleet, the transfer of capacitor/shield/armour can be divided more easily particularly if more than one ship is tanking damage.-support pilots would not need to keep resetting module's targets."
"that might be a fantastic idea for your small fleet of mission runners or miners but in a fleet fight were there could be 256 people per fleet, this would make the overview even more of a nightmare than it already is.bad enough trying to work out what the hell i have locked on the overview as it is when tidi and lag kick in. how you could possibly keep track on who's locked what in a fleet of 256 would be near impossible i would think.easy solution for missions you have already found, abandon your wrecks then there's no need to worry about the salvagers.and seriously? people still salvage missions? is that even a profitable use of your time?"
"i gotta say...finding the vote site without the link from the login page of eve was a pain in the ass. you wold think they would make it a front page link or something. instead they bury it. no wonder nobody votes..."

"uhh...wait what are we talking about?"
"in the space the mass is not importante. and if you increase your shield like large shield exterder, you need to add some extra generator in your ship. this generator have some mass also.this drawback, it's really a big problem. perhaps the best idea it's to put the draw back in the shield. not on the agility and speed for plate."
"despite what you think is fact, in space there is resistance and mass does matter. if it didn't then we would be able to use rockets to travel faster than light...we can't.if you want to argue with me about it i suggest you first go read up about dark matter. then read up about dark energy. \"roflmao! those don't exist you noob!\" you might say? google is your friend. go read."

"i would like to like this proposal, like, because, like, i am an armour tanker at heart. but i have always, like, thought the penalties were there so, like, not to make armour tanked ships be, like, as fast as shield ships, like. lol, ok ok...this is like, getting stupid. no more likes.as i as saying, the penalties are there so that armour ships don't compete with shield ships for speed and agility. make armour ships as fast and as agile as shield and hull tanked...they do exist, trust me ships then why even bother with shield tanked ships ever again?as much as i would love to 'wtfpwn' everything in my gallente big ass armour tanked ships, i think the penalties should stay as they are.not supported."
"if you increase the time required, you will only see more csaa's up to build more of them at the same time.similarly, if you make titans cost alot more, its only a matter of time before the player economy expands to the point where they aren't that expensive again. changing the cost on a titan will only provide a temporary band-aid. titans themselves need to be changed to provide a permanent solution to the problem."
"lollol.while your at it.increase the build time on sub cap ships all of them. introduce sub cap ship components to be used in building instead of plain minerals. double the cost of sub cap bpos.this will solve all blobbing problems. true story."

"ccp benefits from having off-grid boosting, players buy another account to pvp with a dps, logi, etc ship while leaving less attention for a offgrid boosting ship for the other account offgrid boosting encourages players to make more characters and more accounts to increase efficiency without having to double the workload of focusing on more things at once, since you can pretty much leave the off-grid booster afk at a pos and focus on your combat character your change is very unlikely to happen"

"i'd rather see something opposite implemented - replace all bounties with tags and then diversify the tags required by lp stores a bit so it's not only the other faction tags, but also pirate ones.this would have the same effect on lp stores, as now you'd have an abundance of tags, however it would make 0.0 rating a bit harder, where it wouldn't just be - kill rats receive isk, but you'd need to transport all your tags to empire as well to sell them.it would also make marauders more desirable, as you could get your tags while running missions / ratting, would make ninja salvagers or rather ninja looters much more common.suicide gankers would have more targets.you could still convert those tags into isk by selling them at a concord or faction navy station, but it would be a bit more complicated."
"i think you're talking about a rather more radical, revolutionary overhaul of the lp/tags system than the evolutionary model presented here. i think it is quite important to preserve rat bounties whether at their present levels, who knows... because, as we know, diversity is fun! in a way, too, i think it would greatly overcomplicate things - imagine, after a couple of months of missioning and hoarding, you look in your hangar and are faced with dozens and dozens of different types of tag, and you think \"wtf\". i believe that the current system holds the basis for a new, workable tags system - give the pilot the choice whether to fly anti-pirate or anti-faction missions exclusively or the current random system, for those who truly don't care. you must also remember that the distribution of anti-faction missions for all factions is completely borked too, by the way..."
"if you want to run anti-faction missions and get tags, you can take them as they come in highsec, move to lowsec and do fw missions/plexes or l5s, or move to nullsec and do pirate missions. there's plenty of options for amassing as many tags as you could possibly want."
"as a former mission runner, some of the tag requirements for certain items are ridiculous. you'd find modules that require 400 tags of one type of tag, additional 200 of another, and finally another 100. making the cost of the modules astronomically higher than variants you can get from pirates that work just as well and are much cheaper.there is a reason why you never see imperial navy medium energy neutralizers and some others on the contract. its just ridiculous to get the amount of tags needed to get them."
"thought i would carry this over from f&id with the permission of the op."
"the 800mm and 650mm \"repeating artillery\" pieces are autocannons and require the large autocannon specialization skill to use the t2 variants. this is confusing when there is also a large artillery specialization skill. \"repeating artillery\" should be changed to \"autocannon\" or \"repeating cannon\" to avoid confusion."

"this game has so many wonderful things about it, super advanced things but for some unknown reason, ccp can't think of a better system for character transfers. current system requires you to send isk before you get the character, opening yourself completely to be scammed. you have to hope the seller actually sends it. hackers are now hacking accounts, putting up character sale threads, receiving isk, and not sending the characters. i imagine they then sell the isk for rl money and could care less if the account gets banned.please for the love of god, fix how to do character transfers, suggestions are welcome here."

"back when incarna was due to be released, ccp had announced that the screen in the captains quarters would have functionality that would be useful both to new players and old vets. as it stands, that screen doesn<U+FFFD>t really have much functionality at all. i have a proposal that would make the screen vaguely useful, with hopefully very little effort expended. in the future this could even be iterated on, to further increase the functionality of cq and the screen. this proposal is that one of two thing should happen. the first idea, is that we could create channels. the second, is that we could create filter options for the screen.channels:at the moment the screen flicks between visuals of various different aspects of the game that might be dividable. we have displays of players<U+FFFD> <U+FFFD>wanted<U+FFFD> bounty posters, career agent adverts, incursion warnings, ship adverts, epic ark mission adverts, new pilot certification, clone status alerts, sov change alerts, nex store adverts, and <U+FFFD>buy plex<U+FFFD> adverts. if i missed any, please let me know. now, i propose we slit them into channels, and i<U+FFFD>ll give an example below;general <U+FFFD> all topics default channelnews <U+FFFD> incursion warnings, bounty posters, sov change alerts, new pilot certificationcareers <U+FFFD> career agents, epic ark, incursion warningsmarket <U+FFFD> ship adverts, <U+FFFD>buy plex<U+FFFD> adverts, nex store adsnow it doesn<U+FFFD>t need to be these specific channels these are just examples, and the clone status alert should probably show on all channels, because let<U+FFFD>s face it, that actually is useful. these channels would be accessible by highlighting the screen, where you would see a ui interface similar to that of the seat, or the image of your ship that shows fitting/cargo/etc.filter options:you could also have a simple filter option where you tick only the types of displays you want to see on the screen. for example, i could turn all of them off and keep sov change alerts on, so that i can watch for the slow and painful destruction of certain alliances<U+FFFD> sovereignty. or if the bounty system worked i could watch the bounty board only, for tasty pvp snacks. this might give a reason for station bound toons to actually pay some attention to the screen.buy why!?:i imagine there are a few people in here who will be like <U+FFFD>wtf, cq is crap, why bother?<U+FFFD>. i would answer, because it<U+FFFD>s not going anywhere, so we might as well make it useful. hopefully with channels/filters and perhaps some later iterations, the screen itself could be used as a tool to improve gameplay, or even your toons financial performance.imagine for a moment that you<U+FFFD>re a trader. now imagine that there are also item adverts now on the screen, and that these new item adverts and the old ship adverts had the highest buy and sell orders in various regions displayed on them. you could use the filter or channels to watch for these specifically and just watch for potential deals or trade routes.alternatively, imagine you<U+FFFD>re a hardcore nullsecy just chilling out in your sov space with nothing to do. now imagine the sov change ads had associated battle reports on them that you could click on. whilst chatting, or sifting through your alliance/corp kill board you can watch the political landscape shift and change as people blow each other up. glorious.throw your support or criticisms at the idea. the more the merrier etc.\"in the age of information, ignorance is a choice.\" www.stateofwar.co.nf"

"still not a very good idea, for exactly the same reasons everyone else and i have already mentioned. all that capital ships need to do is:fleet support and force projection ideally what carriers, including tier 2 carriers aka motherships aka supercarriers, would do.structure bashing and blowing up other caps ideally what dreads and titans would do.whether or not you win the game matters not. it's if you bought it."
"this, a thousand times this. there's nothing i hate more than homogeneous fleets."
"i don't agree. there aren't that many titans that it would upset the economy. most of the isk that paid for them will ill gotten anyway. all it would do is upset a tiny minority of players who have amassive sway over the game; we're better off without them anyway."
"you mean the reasons of yours that i have already refuted?that would be the pipe dream, yes, but ideas for getting there that would actually succeed are non-existent thus far.most of the titans out there were paid for with moon goo, and as such you have to re-imburse everyone's titans, plus all the bpo's for titans out there too. lets assume that betwen completed titans and titans in build, that you would have to reimburse 1000 of them. thats 50 trillion isk right there, not to mention another 50 billion for each bpo, and probably another 5 bil for every bpc in existance. you can't possibly think that dropping significantly more than 50 trillion isk back into the market isnt going to have serious side effects."

"abandoned your own proposal raziel? let me give you a bump, and even some content ; - switching squads requires the right to do so and it's also a workaround and not a solution.- \"afk\" / \"re\" in chats makes it annoying for the fc to keep track of who's back and who's still afk.- that's an even worse workaround than switching squads, as you miss information from fleet chat in the meantime.my opinion:the auto-afk part should be optional for fleet members. e.g. menu entry in the fleet window menu \"enable auto-afk\".also don't forget the \"re\" button, next to the \"afk\" button in the broadcast toolbar."
"scamming in character transfers is strictly forbidden. if you got scammed in a character transfer, then petition it."
"i know it is, and i have petitioned many, many different times and i have got my isk back eventually, ranging from 2 days to a week. the point is that:a. plain and simple the character transfer system could be a lot better and user friendly.b. the time saved from having gm's answer these petitions is money in ccp's pocket.c. players currently have to divulge account name.d. players lose time waiting for petitions to be answered as well as miss out on any new characters they may want to bid on."

"lol drake this post was created to inspire new ideas on how to improve character transfers. did i obviously go over the top on my original post, yes, did it work to bring people to read this, yes."
"95% of the character scams are from characters that have been hacked, so when a petition is filed and isk is reversed back to the buyer, ccp looks at the account that scammed, normally finding it was hacked and reversing the character back to its original owner.this is directed at maru utama's comment."
"i like the way it is.i have purchased one character from the market. therefore, my chances for being scammed are relatively small as most people have experienced. if the deal is too good to be true, it probably is. if you are paying only 50% of market estimated value for the character know that you may never receive that character. guess it's part of the risk one takes in playing the market.however, for your first point; maybe have an escrow account at a npc corp that holds the isk until the character transfer has been confirmed. other than that, it's fine."

"two things i'd love to see improved in the drone window:1. drone damage visible for drones in bay:it is tiresome to have to move damaged drones into a \"damaged\" group to avoid relaunching them after retrieval.2. open/shut state of drone groups remembered separately for drones in bay and in space:i normally like drone groups to be open in space, and closed in the bay. having to keep clicking to get this right is a pain.a couple more things that would be great...3. remember the drone groups on the server, not the client:for those of us who use more than one computer, it's a pain to have to reset all groups when you move to a new machine.4. flash the drones info when they are receiving damage, just like the watch window.no explanation necessary. a suggestion i'm not so sure about would be to split the hotkeys for logistic and combat drones. \"engage\" simply doesn't work when you have a logistic drone out with your combat set. perhaps not so relevent to pvp, but for pve i sometimes tune things to the limit.comments, anyone?k.this proposal was originally discussed in speakers' corner . i'm putting forward here after positive reception there."
"i'm all for 1, 2-4 i'm less sure about, but i don't see them as an overly bad thing though the ability to turn off the flashing damage warning would be important.another thing i've mentioned elsewhere, though i still haven't gotten around to making my own thread for it, is to make it possible to drag drone groups from the drone window down to the f1-8 hotkeys to let you launch a group of drones with a hotkey the button would be essentially the same thing as right clicking the group and clicking launch. i think that would make drone boats with half a dozen groups of drones much more fun to use and less clicking different groups to launch."

"when you light a cyno which has a 10 minute cycle time it actually takes 10 minutes for the red ring around the module icon on the ui to cycle.when you launch a bomb the ring cycles immediately and there's no indication as to when the module is ready to launch again. you kind of have to guesstimate and hope that when you press the button again the cooldown has cleared.proposal:when you launch a bomb the module cycle time the period while the red ring fills up around the module icon on the ui should be matched the to time it takes the module to cooldown.eve down under - a community for players in the autz"
"the one thing against that is that i believe the cycle time is tied to reloading. the current system allows you to change/reload bombs and not lose time. i agree that there should be some indicator though."

"anything to indicate when i can launch my bomb next would be nice. cooldown timer or just a pulsing blinking red light around the bomb launcher indicating that it's still cooling down. mmos come and go, but eve remains. -garresh-"
"just make the bomb launcher reloading time = the cooldown time? --> who cares how fast you can load a bomb if you can't fire it until cooldown is over anyway?"
"because you can reload while you're waiting for the cooldown to end, while off-grid. and then you use the remaining cooldown time to cloak up, fly to the spot for your next bombing run, and get in position for the next pass."
"it is easy ,make the bomb deploy in the begin of the launcher cycle, and make the cycle as long as the cooldown.problem solved! new pos system new sov system"

"show the cycle visually on the module, allow reloading during the cycle as it is allowed now. problem solved.same thing with interdictor bubbles."
"originally this thread called for lic sphere launchers to have the same cooldown but i edited that out of the title. i figured since a warp disrupt probe bubble lasts for the same duration as the cooldown give or take 2 seconds there's your indicator right there.although i suppose if you're no longer on grid with the bubble you put up then it would be worth having the same indicator that they'd hopefully put on the bomb launchers, so +1 for that addition, too.eve down under - a community for players in the autz"
"uhh... sure if you have interdictors trained to 0, then the launcher delay is 120 seconds just like the bubble duration. if you have it trained to 1 which you need to even fly the ship then the delay is 108 seconds. if you have it trained to 4, the delay is only 72 seconds.so i would say the feature is as important for a bubble launcher as it is for the bomb launcher."

"i was about to post the same issue until i figured using the search tool would be a good start.i myself have mused on this idea for a while now, dealing with friends in multiple corners of eve i'd like to fly with when i get bored. i can see how you don't want players hopping around that much, but 24 hours is effectively two days of not being in the field as you can decide to jump at late night, but you can't jump back until even later at night, missing out on cta's or events.skillbased or not, i don't really mind as long as it can shave at least a few hours off from a full day.eve can be difficult enough as it is to cross barriers. myself, i live in a deep pocket in nullsec space. it costs 35 mil for a carrier round trip to empire, and going by conventional travel will take about 30 jumps, part of which will be through hostile territories.every now and then my and my rl friends like to poke around in another corner of eve, but in this current climate it takes too much time in preparation to spontaneously go ahead and have some fun, something which i believe hampers my eve experience marginally.sure enough one could argue that i should go ahead and live somewhere else, but i think that it shouldn't be that black and white."

"ever since seeing the original concept videos for incarna, i've always hoped for an rts mini-game within eve to perhaps help fledgling fcs figure out tactics, or even help show noobs how the \"big kids\" play eve.the idea itself is simple, a match is set up between 2 opponents, with a certain number of \"fitting points\" up to a maximum amount. these points would allow the selection of different classes of ships, and eventually lead up to a simulated rts control style mini-game where by each participant would take control of a fleet, and a \"grid\" is selected, say on a pos, an asteroid field, a gate, a station. once the ships and perhaps fittings for the ships were selected by both players, the game would be played where by each player controls their fleet in a top down view slug match.there could be a betting system in place, where by the two players bet on themselves in how much they think they could win. no additional skill points should be required, and it should focus more on small-mid gang warfare so no capitals+ would be allowed. perhaps have the alliance tournament fleet size rules in place although a bit more expanded to allow for fleets up to 256 or something along those lines.an addition of this mini-game would bring perhaps some actual use towards the cq/wis concept, and allow for those who don't normally fc get a somewhat better idea of how things interact \"in the real world\""
"wis is in it's second bout of planning stages, ideas can be posted in this thread.some ideasor you can argue about it's usefulness in this thread.angry peopleproposing such an outrageous idea is probably unhelpful to the csm. especially when they take next to no interest in wis. also things like this are common as an idea but i think you need to re-think it considering the wis dev team size. then once it's off the ground push for it to become as detailed as your proposal."

"dear csm & ccp; hello i fly a titan class vessel in a corporation with many titan class vessel's in a alliance with the most titan class vessels. my alliance uses titans more than anyother organization in game. i am advocating the deletion of all ttitan class vessels :full stop:. i am also advocating the deletion of all titan specific skills from the database  racial titan skill , doomsday device operation :full stop: i am also advocating the removal of all titan bpo/bpc's and titan specific component bpo/bpc as well as any and all doomsday device bpos/bpc's :full stop:. in compensation to the effected pilots i am advocating the return of the minerals for the build of the titan and its doomsday device all equipped modules and equipment within the titan to be moved to jita 4-4 so effected pilots can easily decide what to do with the assets at that point. reimburse all skillpoints from the deleted titan specific skills as has been done in the past with other skill deletions. make this change at the exact same time compounds are removed from drone region npc's. this will offset the vacuum left from that change and soften the potential flood of minerals to market from titan deletion with both changes counter-balancing each other  perhaps not perfectly. after the deletion or at the time of deletion  if ccp can make it happen \"time constraints\"  introduce a new capital or supercapital platform. this supercapital platform would have specific skills required to pilot it and specific bpo's to produce it . this new platform would have no offensive capability only defensive. its role would be a support/logistic capital/supercap. it would do things such as create jumpbridges , provide gang bonuses , have a large corporate hanger and ship maintnence array to support its fleet. my arguments for this are pretty simple. changing titans to do this job is silly as not that many would be required to achieve having enough to support the role. currently there are more titans in game that what would be needed to outfit all nullsec/lowsec groups with this important role. furthermore a very large portion of titan pilots did not train for over a year or spend billions upon billions acquiring a hull or further billions upon billions acquiring modules to outfit a titan that has been deemed since inception to be a offensive roled hull to have it suddenly changed to a non offensive hull. the supercarrier will retain the role as the dominant force in supercapital warfare specializing in laying waste to capital class vessels and sovereignty structures. this is also a stealth buff for dreadnaughts as they will be used in greater frequency to shoot pos & sov structures in the abscense of titans. i make the assertion with the complete removal of titans and a addition of support/role supercapital we will see a more dynamic player experience. with more specific roles for players to fill instead of titans dominating the battlefield of all types.sincerely,paikaka manfred sideous"

"it stil is an offensive weapon just not against subcaps. if this makes you sad, ccp does not care."

"they give nice bonuses too. of course having 30 titans doesn't give you 30x the bonuses, but hey."
"i've got a better idea, why don't ccp just make large fleets of titans extremely undesirable, as they should have been all along.that way the self entitled little crybabies that fly them will make a vast mountain of hilarious spergy rant threads which the rest of us can take great pleasure in, then unsub, and the titans will be effectively removed from the game, without the massive influx of minerals caused by ship recycling, or the rampant fotm-chasing that a skillpoint re-allocation would lead to.seems like a win-win-win to me."
"eve is cold. scouting enemy forces is for babies in empire. real men run into fights blind.its called force projection. working as intended. bring a bigger gang or deal with it.your there for pvp to begin with... why would you need a warning that more pvp is coming your way? so you can run away?cap ships jumping massive distances is perfectly acceptable, simply because we take hours to align and warp and we can't jump by ourselves. we can't use gates, we can't really target you fast enough to be a threat even if we jump right on top of you. infact, you probably have a full minute or more to gtfo if you get dropped. so i really dont see your problem.you all enjoy telling hulk pilots to align if they dont want to get popped... maybe sub cap gangs need to stay aligned during a pvp fight so that the moment they see a cyno, they can warp off or get owned."

"to be honest, the entire warp-drive mechanic in this game seems messed up to me.to start, why in the world are warp speeds labeled in au/s instead of something like... i dunno, warp factors?. however, i will say this about \"warping through planets\": the idea of a warp drive is that a ship's warp engine bends the space around it--contracting the space in front of it, and expanding the space behind it. in this sense, the ship is slipping through space in a bubble. so, warping through planets/starts should be possible.*however* i also think that once inside a warp bubble, we should not be able to see outside of the warp bubble--but i also think that once we're inside a warp bubble, no one can see us either. also, star trek's rendition of the \"punch\" warp seems accurate to me because a warp bubble shouldn't be constrained to the classical limits of acceleration, because nothing is actually accelerating; it's bending the space around it, so i think it would make sense for a 'punch warp' to be prevalent in this game. lastly, i think that \"aligning\" should stay the way it is. it makes absolutely no sense that you'd be able to skip aligning--you still have to be pointing the right direction to be able to travel that far accurately. although, i don't see why a ship would need to be travelling at 75% speed, since maneuvering thrusters and a warp drive are 2 entirely different systems. i could argue that a microwarp drive makes absolutely no sense considering everything i've written above, but i guess it could be looked past if you think of the mechanics as the warp drive intermittently 'spurting' a warp bubble so that the ship appears to be moving but is really doing very short bursts of a warp, so that the ship is, again, just moving the space around it, but in such short bursts that it never 'actually' goes to warp. kind of like the way led's can flash so fast that they appear to be constantly on, yet they are off between flashes--but only for a very short time.i know there are a lot of mechanics that would have to be changed to accommodate all of this--i just really like all of the science behind eve, and it really bugs me when the science makes absolutely no sense like ships lacking any kind of inertia--maybe it would make sense if the ships didn't have any maneuvering thrusters, and only used their warp drives to move like the way i described microwarp drives could work up there ^, however that would mean we'd have to change afterburners maybe just change those to \"maneuvering warp upgrade module\" or somethingthe eve travelling mechanics are so messed up a lot would have to be changed for it to just 'make sense', but it would really make me happy and probably a lot of other people too if it all made sense. i know that warp drives and jumping are both theoretical anyways, but they could at least make sense in lining up with the currently available theories on warp drive and jump gates. it's not even stated in game how the warp drives work--something about energy, but the commonly accepted idea is that warp drives have to use some kind of matter/antimatter reaction, but with that kind of reaction only a small amount of antimatter is needed to create a large amount of energy, so it would only take a pound or two of it to sustain a ship for a very long time. to anyone arguing for the mass effect--warp drive is a completely different phenomenon from the mass effect theory, as that uses a theoretical \"element zero\" to increase/decrease the mass of something. let's at least stick to the same theories we already use in eve."
"please find in the link provided a word document discussing some potential gameplay changes for the enrichment of smuggling, cargo concealment and some specific low sec space gameplay.edit:i have converted and uploaded the document to eve files as a pdf as it was recomended as a prefered medium: pdfprevious mirror on mediafiles in word format: 0.1b - ms word format 2003link to a free piece of software: ms word viewer that allows you to read word documention should you not have compatible software to read or convert the document.after requests i have now also detailed the proposal into eve posts in this thread below to aid individuals who are reluctant to use the document from the above dl facilities."
"suggestions: deny titans of capital weaponry. keep them on dreadnoughts & carriers please. a new super-support device as a defensive option to diminish multiple titans in area: being physically/electronicly/somethingly unable to have titans operate untimely within range of each other. instead, there'd be sequential activations of, say super-devices within vicinity of each other requiring communication to discuss your next titan's next move. fleets w/ titans have 'activation priority rights' above solo titans and multiple fleets w/ titans have 'competitive activation rights' against each other. consider this as a militarized safety protocol.variations: tech 1 - standardized titan 1 per empire - foundations to specialized roles & economical flagship option.- super-weapon device offensive- new super-support device defensive!tech 2 - specialized titans 2 per empire - specialized command gang links/titan fleet bonus.- specialized logistics bridging/clone vattech 3 - generalized titan only 1 this probably will not happen. not even necessarily."
"ccp gave the titans their capital weaponry to give them something to do against structures since their doomsday was not really useful there. if you want to remove capital weapons from titans you will need to change the titan superweapon to allow it to be more useful against structures. my proposal does remove capital weaponry from the titan, but only alongside a doomsday buff to allow the titan a consistent damage capability rather than a single blast every 10 minutes.interesting suggestion, how would you make that work?i think the easier and simpler solution would be a re-design of the superweapon. my proposal only adds one super capital hull to the mix, this would add 4. the best solution is most often the simplest solution that will be effective. i can't support a suggestion that is more complex than my own, but if you come up with a simpler solution, feel free to post it."
"inherently, quite possibly, a low priority update though with recent blog of rebalancing eve, one ship at a time i think this can correlate quite well together.the proposal is to better-define the differentiation of the battlecruiser from the battleship and the cruiser by simply renaming it. there is much to a name especially in the encyclopaedia of names items that is eve online. i questioned folks in deep core mining inc. and they seemed ok with the idea of renaming battlecruiser from its in-between similarity of cruiser and battleship.what would re-indentified battlecruisers be known as?condition: must remain a militaristic impression.gunboat english probably the only and the best re-identification of the list of battlecruisers. it is still an impression of militaristic, similarly to 'battleship' yet curiously smaller than battleship and very much role-specified by the name 'gunboat'.other titles?other foreign titles?"
"why? simply changing the name doesn't really do anything at all. besides, all the older players will still call them bcs, despite whatever name there is on the group of ships, which would just confuse newer players that are seeing \"gunboat\" abbreviated as \"bc\"."
"explained why. if it were gunboat [gb] already and this thread existed to change it to \"battlecruiser\", you'd likely say the same thing of it confusing players and new players and it'd probably be more believable. e.g. 'battlecruiser sounds like battleship. be confusing.'see?it works. plus it sounds rather awesome; gunboat."
"what about missile battlecruisers? they aren't \"gun\"boats. besides having a general gunboat name would cause much more confusion, than battlecruiser, since 70-80% of current ships are technically gunboats.but with battlecruiser name the name pinpoints the connection to the cruiser class albeit with modification - battle specialized cruiser. i would be more towards changing gb into bc if it was the initial set up."
"handheld guns shoot projectiles projected from the barrel.turrets shoot projectiles & lasers projected from the barrel.launchers shoot missiles projected from the barrel?technically equally 'battleships', too. yet it's a different ship. a battle-specialized cruiser can equally be a gunboat and a battle-specialized cruiser would be a tech2 variation specialized of a cruiser in eve online terms, recently."
"just changing the \"name\" accomplishes nothing and is too trivial to waste the dev's time on.and your reasoning is a matter of interpretation.not supporting.oh and no one ever calls a missile centric ship a gun boat... battlecruiser / battleship makes a hell of a lot more sense at that rate.just look at the ships of the navy.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"modularity is for nich ships, keep titans, big fracking ships that can do allot of things.with current change by ccp that will diminish them as being subcap pasters in solo fleets.though.... big super ship should have some thing it does that other ships can't do.as i suggested before, allow capitals to dock inside them, being that they are so huge a fleet should be able to fit inside them and or fit. that in addition to its titan bridge, and a huge corp hanger freighter size would give it a power for assisting fleets. along with fleet bonus found on no other ships. not a solo ship i win button, but a big boast to top the balance."
"it figures that a goon would find fault in any solution that could actually help the game rather than specifically help goons, then accuse others of being cry-babies. bit rich isn't it, seeing as goons cried the loudest to ccp because those big bad titans that naughty pl fly somehow managed to shoot double lse drakes with microwarp drives?! how dare they shoot goons! i'm surprised you guys didn't also demand the sig radius on drakes be lowered so that nobody can shoot back at you. i mean hey, there's only 7000 or so goons clearly you are outnumbered so maybe you should have also asked ccp for a nerf to alliance sizes while they were at it for every alliance except goons of course, since you are all so \"special\" - note the capital \"s\" there...yes, the big red bus will be along to pick you up shortly. stop being a bunch of hypocrites and start using what little brain power you actually have and try seeing this from the perspective of all eve playersso onto the serious part, yes this is a solution, no i don't see it as being the only solution but you all have to admit it would resolve the age old question once and for all: is the problem titans themselves, or is the real problem the lack creativity that everyone else seems to have when trying to come up with a counter to them?i don't actually think the problems are titans, i think the problem is 2 parts politics, 1 part ccp not having a clue about what they were doing introducing them in the first place. seems almost like introducing titans was done similar to how the technetium changes were made e.g. lets try this and see what happens...and if anything bad happens then we can always say \"it's on our roadmap of things to fix\". the issues with titans are not much different from a lot of other ships, it happened with battleships blobbing up and shooting everything else smaller, happened with super carriers doing much the same, and so on. regardless of ship type, what makes the difference is this: someone who is better organised than you and not necessarily bigger is very likely going to come at you and if you aren't ready or aren't well organised, then you'll probably die. it's really that simple.how about we just remove every ship type higher than a bs? that way goons can still keep up with their jihadi behaviour toward ice miners still gonna need isotopes for fuel blocks so plenty of room for market manipulation and they won't have to spend so much time whinging about capitals i'm sure there will be something else they'll find to complain about though."
"while reading all the forum-signatures of your alliance mates about this topic , i actually do get the impression that ccp does care if you cry long enough."
"your angry keyboard flailing about evil goony dev manipulation aside, this bit i completely agree with. ccp never had a clear vision for what titans should do in the game since they were first introduced, and showed a complete lack of understanding as to how introducing them would affect the game. if ccp had been running itself like a proper grownup company at the time, rather than throwing new ships at the game with a design brief of \"lets make something kool and awesome with a lot of wildly diverse abilities, but its ok because at 40bn per hull only the biggest alliances will be able to afford even one or two, there's no way they'll ever be mass-produced or thrown around casually!\", we wouldn't be in this mess.thankfully, this tracking nerf seems to be step one of ccp righting its long-standing mistakes and going through the process of giving titans a clear defined role."
"not sure if you are trolling or get what you are actually saying, but where are titans in the process of getting a \"clear\" defined role, when your just reducing their abilities? besides the jump portal whohoo 100b pvp ship just to bridge other ships aorund there is literaly no purpose you cant just replace a titan with a different type of ship. t3's are mostly prefered as a bonus supplier already, since they are way cheaper, easier to move and can give different,mostly more usefull boni. dreads and sc's do both better dps anyway. so would you please explain, why you think this is an improvment for defining the role of titans?"
"this is easy...if titans cant shoot subcaps then subcaps shouldent be able to lock titans exept hics of coursethen, if you want to kill a titan you bring your own capitals, ships a titan still can kill. if you want to kill a titan you should risk getting raped in your own super capitals and not lean back looking smug orbiting in your cheap ass drake and think you are good at this game."
"its almost like you didn't read the tracking nerf thread or something."
"by ccp's own admission the tracking nerf is a quick fix because they can't decide on a role for titans. it's almost like they dont read their own dev blogs. and learn nothing from their past mistakesanyway - titan's were always meant to be very rare in eve. frankly, deleting all existing titans, compensating players by returning some titan specific skillpoints and some portion of their value in minerals is a pretty good idea.if you still think there should be titans in eve - and tbh, i think there should be a ship class called \"titan\" - then give us a new, properly designed and properly balanced ship that fills a role that doent completely unbalance large scale warfare. most importantly, remove bpo's and tightly control the supply of bpc's to limit the number of those ships"
"the main problem i see is the greyscale nerf realistically reduces dps versus subcaps by 25%. subcaps will still be blapped in short order. this is a useless slap in the face in a long list of useless slaps in the face against titans. every titan nerf the \"anti-titan\" parties gather in celebrations and countdowns to nerf day. to only find out soon later that they are still getting ownzoned by titans. if you read seleene's blogmy ceo  vote seleene you will see where the problem with this and pervious nerfs are. basically ccp has done this over and over through the years with titans \"kick the can down the road\". however when they do so the titan falls down the list of priorities on the backlog allowing them to divert attention to higher priorities. instead of repeating this scenario again for the 5th time lets just do the sensible thing. delete titan's as they exist now and everything titan involved. problem solved! then ccp can take all the lessons learned over the years and design a new titan that better fits into eve. at that point the players will decide if they want to skill for or pilot the new titan. its really that simple. now i get it the \"anti-titan\" crowd wants vengence they are unhappy to have been subjugated to titan blapping. they would like nothing more than to see the pilots punished. but i say punished for what? titan pilots used the ship that ccp put into the game. no matter what ccp's best intentions were reality is the titan has been a subcap smashing machine since introduction and will continue to be post greyscale nerf. deleting titans is a victory for everyone and a damn sure sight better than \"kicking the can down the road\" again for the 5th time with a open-ended statement \"we will revisit these later\". we all have seen what that means.18 month anyone? as a titan pilot i can live with blapping with 25% less dps for another 18 months. can you?delete titansseleene's blog"

"yes, please. also, other things:* enable hotkeying launch of a specific drone group or, as you say, the ability to drag a drone group icon to the hud button rack; being able to launch with one click instead of click-rightclick-menudrag-click would be nice.* allow mining drones to use the engage hotkey if the target is an asteroid.* merge the silly \"mine\" and \"mine repeatedly\" commands. who sends their drones to mine exactly once?nested folders is a horrid ui design for a combat function. imagine if we had to open a folder of guns mounted on the ship, then right click one and select \"fire gun\" in order to attack with a turret weapon? absurd. and yet this is how our drone weapon system works."
"because it actually iscynos are currently one goddamn problem when you try to fly close range ships like gallente for example. or armor tanked ships.and the instant hotdrop fleet/supercap whatever doesn't just feel right.sure you have option to always fly kiting ships with falcons and so on gay setups but really, cynos are fine??? hahhah.activating non-covops cyno on grid with enemy gang in any subcap should be nearly suicidal tbh.not that it would be enough with these instant travel jump bridges either.y u why not get back to real fights instead of blueballing the poop out of a single drake"
"i suggest a move of the motd to be moved from the client to the eve launcher.it just makes more sense that way, and it will be a quicker way to get information out to the players.comments, ideas, and general feedback are welcome, as always."
"don't know about you but i've already turned the launcher off."
"there's this little thing called \"progress.\" i know it scares most people. but advancements in technology especially given the current setting of eve, would allow for such breakthroughs.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
"i don't really care what the maneuver looks like, i just think that we need to either: a make all of the systems larger and make ships slightly faster in warp, so that the accel-decel time is less pronounced, orb make the accel-decel time much much shorter. not instant, as someone already showed how this is bad, and is probably bad for technical reasons too.why? because right now unless the systems are very very large, there is not a significant difference in the amount of time it takes to warp across them. trying to catch someone is more dependent on lag and the size of the systems, and not what ship you are flying. this is bad, as it makes a warpspeed stat kind of useless. at this point, they might as well basically be the same. except for freighters, but if you're being chased and your in a freighter, you have another problem.i'm not saying it should be instant, i'm saying that the way it is now, ships spend waaay to much time getting into and out of warp, and not enough time at warp speed.on the whole science thing, its very easy to come up with a reason for the visual effects: the warp bubble only lets in very high energy particles, those being photons light and radiation. the radiation coruscates, providing the simmery white light, and the light just appears as it is, images. other sources of high-energy particles are either not concentrated enough to be noticed, or blocked by other matter. as for the whole ships actually being submarines, just pretend this is an alternate universe where the victorian era scientists were right, and space actually a luminiferous aether that our ships plough through, constantly slowing them down, limiting top speed. ships in eve do have inertia. if they didn't have inertia, they would travel the same speed even after sharply changing direction. nano-fit ships try to do this, but don't get all the way to inertialess."

"time for a...bump"
"i don't know but i imagine it'd equalize the mass devastation that their super-destructive weaponsa bring. possibly an active forcefieldb like player-owned structures as one example, which i don't know how they work, or a specious active cloaking fieldc similar to those deployables.a:b:c = massdestruction : massprotection : massevasion/invasion.this thought spawned from having titans not just a militarist presence but instead supporting industrialists and sovereign deficits, budgets, economists and all that financial babble.but it is applying a new game-rule to using capital super-weapons. it is a control to the chaos from which sub-ordinate ships have more perseverance in combat without multiple super-devices being activated. it is a control for balance, and where balance and control exists produces a fairer game and satisfied gamers. a fictional militarized safety protocol addressing the need to control 'the titan problem'. still, they can be re-designed to target structures with this control solution in-mind, that's no problem."
"putting a pos shield on a titan seems a little overpowered to me, so would a field that cloaks everything around it.if you can solve the super weapon issue by redesigning it, the \"new game rule\" becomes pointless, and a waste of time and effort by dev teams who could be working on fixing other stuff."
"i support this idea."
"i actually like this option a little better that the op's. or both ideas could be used in conjunction, 24/12 hour cooldown for long distance jumps, and an 8/4 hour cooldown for going to the system next door."
"not supported. nobody is going to gain anything from this, and it won't change anything either.besides, neither the drake nor the myrmidon coincidentally my two favorite battlecruisers and the only two i ever fly/buy are gun-boats. the myrmidon is a drone-boat, the drake is a missile-boat, every other battlecruiser is a gun-boat. sure, the myrmidon can utilize guns, but it doesn't get any kind of bonus to its guns.at the moment, gun-boat is one of three unofficial classifications that apply to multiple ship-types. we have gun-boats, which are ships that have good guns. we have missile-boats, which are ships with good missiles and we have drone-boats, which are ships with good drones, and then we have the typhoon, which tries being all three and fails horribly at it.why should battlecruisers suddenly be renamed gun-boats? it'll just create more confusion when people mention the word and actually talk about ships like the rifter or hurricane."
"i'd much rather \"gunboat\" be used for a t2 destroyer designed for killing swarms of frigates."
"cruiser, battlecruiser and battleship are 3 different names with 3 different meanings for 3 different shiptypes with 3 different roles. doesn't get much more different than that. no renaming of an entire class of ships is necessary.now the idea of \"gunboats\" as a new class of ship might be interesting. needs a purpose to create them though..."
"ok. sounds cool.> [standard gunboat] t1, previously named \"destroyer\">> [advanced gunboat] destroyers specialized t2 - multi-rocket masters?>> [advanced gunboat] interdictors specialized t2 - anti-warp masters."
"apparently you just don't get it. either that or you are trolling which is violating forum rules and i should report you."
"don't like it? no need to be judgemental and unnecessary about a harmless post. just say no and move on. now please... it's a suggestion.i considered the name 'destroyer' as a titled specialized ship like most specialized t2 are, and so i suggest gunboat as being the more generic militarist impression as the new t1 standard of this group of spaceships.understand my perspective now?"

"while at it.. maybe also show which rocks are being mined by others.. this would be a great help in larger mining operations.mining is too much of a waste of time for me these days, but i remember on big mining ops how annoying it could be to be mining with 20 hulks in a belt, and trying to find the rocks which aren't targetted by others, so mining is most efficient."

"there's 400 titans give or take a few, that in minerals is a fair amount but they need to get to market and back into the chain. i bet you'd notice a slight change in the market in some bits of null for a very short while then nothing. ccp might lose 400 subscriptions, big deal, thats 0.001% of the eve player base. likely they'll just all become supercap pilots and the minerals will be used to build supercaps. then supercaps will be removed."
"-1counter proposal:delete all sub capital ships, equipment, skills, bpos and bpcs.solve the real hobo blob.now that would be win sauce."
"how about giving them some sort of \"flagship\" status? titans aren't meant to be something anyone can just fly. they're meant to be rare, valuable ships, that gives the pilot some kind of status. strip it of its guns, let it remain able to use all the fancy titan-only modules and give it superior fleet bonuses, while keeping it too expensive to just bring to every battle. this might actually give them the flag-ship status i always imagined titans having, instead of the slightly bigger frigate-status they have now. titans weren't meant to be something everyone could just get. in fact, removing all current titans, reimbursing the sp and adding a flagship-class with the same names and models as the current titans might be the right way to go. or even better: remove all titan-blueprints, but let the current titans stay. when they're gone, there will be no replacing them, which will lead to them eventually getting some status, when enough are killed by smaller, cooler ships.i'm not saying this is the only way to go, but it's definitely one way."
"ok so. after the upconing and ****** titans nerf1 cannot shoot sub-capitals why sub-capitals will able to shoot titans2 alone can only kill carriers with doomsday. and maybe dreads. so doomsday device is now unuseful3 titan will take a lot of time targetting even capitals 5mm scan resolution its a joke4 titans dont receive at least an extra bonus like more damage or something like that. ****. its a 70-90 billion stuff. what is the add value to have a titan??? basicly ccp is leaving a vessel only to shoot pos'es and do bridges. lol we need to expend 90b to do bridges ccp.ccp are you really thinking what are you doing ???? i think nope. csm guys are not doing his jobs for whole eve community. thats is a clear statement. p.d: sry for caps but for god sake this the more ridiculous nerf i ever saw in eve history. this kind of decisions are killing the game or fastening his inevitable death."
"lol...maybe you should not participate on this discussion"
"yes please. the drone window is depressingly ugly and hard to read."
"agreed.but i feel much more is needed. drones need to be looked at not only from ui perspective, but also as a weapon system as a whole.even the combat rules for drones should be revisited. for instance, when drones are set to aggressive, why is it that deploying them while fired upon will not make them attack your target automatically, but once you manually tell them to attack, they will move from target to target without being told to do so, even if the target isn't being locked? makes the game awkward.and i would love some kind of a visual indicator, a small one, on the drone window that tells me whether the drones are set to aggressive or passive, without having to open the settings window.additional drone modules would be nice too. utility drones like the repair or neut ones could be looked at, i don't think i've ever seen anyone use them. same with webber drones, especially heavies, they're not that great.in closing: more drone love, please!"
"i totally agree that the character transfer system sucks!!!!!!!!"
"\oh wow you're clearly really seriously and hardcore or something for yelling in caps. scamming in character trade is petitionable. this isn't even remotely a priority or worth developer time."
"yepwe should probably leak a list of account names acquired through character transfersthat might help get faster action on this issue."
"uronksur suth, yeah yeah the post is in caps, it's doing what it's supposed to and getting people to read this. yes it is petition able but what i am saying is that a better system can be implemented so that you don't have to give your account name and also not get scammed.by the way, if your character does get hacked, even if you get it back, all the assets may have been stripped and generally are not reimbursed to you."
"bingo. the pvp group of the game as a whole is the biggest group of whiners/crybabies in the game. obviously not all of you, but a good majority. how about you keep your big mouths shut for once and practice what you preach? like stated above, you like to tell the hulk pilots what they should be doing, but you are too stupid to do it? and then come to the forums and cry about how you got popped and think the game mechanics need to be changed?you complainers/crybabies out there should probably just stfu unless you have a legitimate complaint/idea for fixing things. hell yes cap ships should hotdrop and travel large distances faster than the fleet, but it requires a \"team\" effort to get them there even if it is an alt since they need a cyno. +1 to the idea of having caps be able to jump to celestials at the same distance as a cyno. i'd leave the cyno in-game though for more options. lighting a cyno is more risky, since you put up a beacon that says \"look here we are!!!! \o/ right here! come on!\"i realize maybe the rant above was slightly unnecessary but i'm just tired of all the b****ing and complaining from people who can only think of one way to fix it: nerf the hell out of everything that they don't use because someone else has an advantage. someone else will always have an advantage someway or another, so deal with it. keep the ideas coming though, some neat things being tossed around. keep it positive and let's move forward instead of falling backwards nerfing crap. thanksoh and ephemeron, the b****ing and complaining bit was not directed at you sir. just seems to be everywhere. you bring up some good questions, and i like the idea of the jump drive spool timers and mobile cyno-jammers."
"kestrel ? dont be stupid, a cynonoobship enough there. so ridiculous this cyno mechanic. insta travel, no risk for cynocharacter because not need clone, not need expensive ship just a noobship etc.it's time to change this."
"you look like you could be my long-lost brother this is a good rational argument for a short delay between lighting a cyno and being able to jump. just those few seconds' delay make all the difference in the world tactically.and for those who would complain about having to do it this way: adapt or die. isn't that what you tell other people?"
"no cynos are not.we should not suffer or even entertain the stupid idea of making sub caps safe from hot dropping by pvp hungry caps or bridge gangs!if you want sub caps safe from hotdrops, move to high-sec."
"not need spool timer, but need travel time after cyno pop up.add after every one light year to 1 second to travel time.that's mean, the jump from 15 ly would be 15 sec time long. if the cyno ship popped, the fleet travel would be broken there where the fleet it's traveling.when they moving on a 10 ly route and their cynoship down at the 7th seconds, the travel would be broken at the 7th ly and the fleet would arrive just there where they are just during the travel.15 sec enough time to managing the fleet travel if the cyno ship open a cyno at safepoint, because no one can landing there within 15 sec, but when someone open a cyno at the battle or dangerous position, need bigger ship than noobships or frigs for survive until their fleets do not arrives there.noobships open the cynos with pure clones that's unacceptable."
"personally, i'm not fully opposed to this ideas, but strict criteria should be met:1 medals should only be displayable on actual uniform-type upper body wear uniform shirt, field marshal coat.2 those who don't have those items, or don't want to display them on their avatar should have a display case in their cq for the display of their medals.3 displayable medals should only be obtainable through the nex store to add legitimacy to it.3a the nex store should also add things such as dogtags and hats military-style hats, berets, and other headgearif someone earned something from their corp, they should have a means of displaying it with pride. it adds to the immersion of the game, and in and of itself is not game-breaking.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."

"new skill: cargo concealment rank 4 mechanicsfor each level in this skill allows for an additional +5% protection to the chance of npc custom officials finding and locating illicit items in a cargo hold. it also is a skill that allows for items to not appear on cargo scans made by players, though the bonus applied under these conditions is +3%. for this to be applied as a chance for each item type however, the total cargo capacity associated with each item type must account for less then 10% of the total cargo capacity. the concealment chance is intended as an independent level of checking when associated with npc customs checks and cargo scans designed as a preventative piece of logic to see if it avoids scanning altogether. if any illicit item fails the concealment check therefore it will be treated normally as per existing scanning rules.also the results are applied on every scan, so if something is hidden by the process on an initial scan it may of course be discovered on subsequent additional scans. something to be tactically aware of for both processes by pilots.prerequisites: hull upgrades iii, cloaking i"
"new mod items: secret compartment low slotthese mods recognise electronically shielded and cloaked areas of cargo space. as a result of this dedicated space the structure of the ship<U+FFFD>s hull is compromised as a result.secret compartment i: meta 0, cpu 50, pg 5, + 1.5% concealment, -15% hull hp. concealment level isecret compartment ii: meta 5, cpu 55, pg 7, +2% concealment, -10% hull hp. concealment level ivcargo scan analyser mid slotan active mod designed to remove concealment effects. it needs to be combined with a cargo scanning module for it to be relevant and modifies scans associated with those mods as per the concealment mechanics.cargo scan analyser i: meta 0, cpu 5, pg 3, - 5% concealment to target, act. cost 2 gj / 5s. electronics icargo scan analyser ii: meta 5, cpu: 7, pg 4, -7% concealment to target, act. cost 2 gj / 5s. electronics iii"
"new class of ship: courier transportthis is a new class of ship that is a smaller industrial type vessel than is tuned more for speed as opposed to cargo usage. it is similar in size to a small cruiser or large destroyer, but is not configured for combat though slightly more agile than current industrials or transports. prerequisite skills: racial industrial level ii; concealment level iiship bonuses for each level in the race<U+FFFD>s industrial ship skill offers the following:+5% velocity sub warp speed per level.+3% warp velocity per level.role bonus: +12.5% fixed value to total concealment chances.suggested idea for stats but not fixed of course:race,speed,cargo,cpu,pg,high,med,low,warpamarr,202,1350,455,73,1,1,4,5.5caldari,192,1600,475,55,1,3,2,5.5galentte,196,1450,385,53,1,2,3,5.5mimmitar,207,1200,385,58,1,2,3,5.5the rest of the stats i<U+FFFD>ll leave to ccp imagination regarding stats as per racial characteristics and other conventions.idea is for a tech 2 version to be a <U+FFFD>cloaky<U+FFFD> equivalent as per blockade runners with a specific bonus to allow for covert ops cloak usage as per transport skill. tech 2 additional role bonus would therefore be: -98.5% to -99.25% bonus to cpu need for covert ops cloaks.again following a similar strategy as per conversion of the tech 1 industrial version, reducing cargo slightly for better speed might be also a useful adaption to adopt. stats may obviously need to be tweaked to afford tech 2 equivalency etc.the tech 2 versions are crucial to afford low and null sec useful options and considering the intended role by these types of courier transports the tech 2 version is vital to help with normal smuggling activities of general economic interest e.g. boosters. the tech 1 version viewed to be the high sec counterpart to help assist with faster supply needs.tech 2 prerequisites would be racial industrial v, transports i, concealment iian alternative model to consider may be to apply them as pirate factional craft with mixed racial skill requirements as this might be more applicable tech for those factions, however at least a <U+FFFD>cloaky<U+FFFD> version would still be required for intended use"
"new canister itemsdiplomatic poucha small secure can that acts as a normal canister with all the normal conventions for anchoring facilities etc. but with the following additional changes:it only has a limited amount of cargo space: 1m3it adds an additional +5% for any items stored within it to concealment values.prerequisite skill: cargo concealment iiigiant cloaked cana giant secure canister that acts as a normal canister with all of the normal conventions for anchoring facilities etc. but with the following additional behaviour:it will remain cloaked whilst all vessels are at least 2km away from it. due to the added running costs for the battery of the canister, the total length of time it can be left in anchored in space is reduced to 7 days. if anchored in relation to a corporation, a covert ops cloak ii fitted craft of the same organisation will not break the cloak as a result. nor will the canister break the cloak of those crafts either. actively cloaked cans will however visually register on pilots hud and overviews for those associated with the can outside of the normal cloaked disturbance ranges. i.e. drop for self, means it will reveal to the owner. drop for corporation obviously for the whole corporation.suggest using a significant timed ticker to check for status to see if should be cloaked or not as opposed to a more continuous checking process to avoid any performance issues. also allows more time for pilots to be aware of its presence should it be revealed.prerequisite: cargo concealment vbit uncertain about the cloaked can item due to the can flipping playstyle, but decided to keep it in the proposal as part of the suggestion in completeness"
"new npc agent distribution missions specifically targeted to help enrich low security space.mission: drug runninga new mission type will be added to specifically enrich the black market element of game play. these missions will be tied into distribution agents that are present in low sec space. however, only players who have a security status of -3.0 or less will have the opportunity to be presented with one. however, they are not intended to be so common.the mission will present a high isk and lp earning distribution mission where the player will have a limited amount of time to delivery some illicit drugs into neighbouring high sector system from out of the low sector area. the target system will be random but the suggestion here is to at least have to penetrate a least a few sectors to give some potential difficulty due to security issues. it may also be plausible based on the player<U+FFFD>s security status to therefore be offered a mission which will take them into hostile policed space. a suitable awareness message may be helpful for these missions as a result.the volumes of drugs as mission items are suggested to be relatively small. though some variance to volumes associated with mission level difficulty is an obvious link to apply here."
"mission: insurgent deliverythis is another low security distribution mission type available to players with a security status of -2.0 or less. rewards can be as per normal distribution types here with perhaps a slight improvement in isk rewards. ideally it probably needs to be a fairly uncommon mission offered to players due to its effects.the idea is to deliver an insurgent hacker, terrorist, spy etc. to a high security station in a system at some distance away e.g. up to 8 sectors or more but is not so much an emphasis on haste to achieve bonuses.once delivered the insurgent will <U+FFFD>temporarily<U+FFFD> reduce the effectiveness of that station for a small period of time minutes for the following specific features: 1 escrow charges will be increased by a small percentage to everyone.2 station offered refining yields will drop by a small percentage.you cannot apply multiple effects or compound effects due to multiple insurgents being delivered, but the time will extend to the length as per the last delivered insurgent. also effects will be more relevant and apparent to lower security systems than the higher ones i.e. 1.0 security systems will be less affected by this process than equivalent 0.5 security systems.to offset this feature, other normal distribution missions in high sec will have other normal deliveries occurring in the form of security agents. such that if a delivery of this type occurs at a station currently affected by an active insurgent it acts to cancel out any active insurgencies. and when this does occur there is a substantial bonus applied to the reputation awards normally afforded for that delivery."
"corrections to current corporate hanger cargo holdsit is viewed as a need to correct the current ease of applied use of these kind of cargo storage areas e.g. orca to be made accessible to player scanners and be treated in a similar way as regular cargo space but equally applying this suggestion<U+FFFD>s features to allow for a correct interpretation of smuggling possibilities for players."

"i miss my y-wing from swg... eve filled a big hole when i left swg even though eve is immensely more difficult to figure out than swg ever was but it's internet space ships and they're very important , i'm still learning stuff even now and i've played for years but alot of the \"free-flight\" pilots from swg couldn't adapt to eve's strategic play style so i left literally hundreds of people that loved or hated me behind and made new friends here. the key that kept me here is the people i met. the first corp i joined was the one who's ceo actually helped me salvage a wreck i couldn't, something that simple and i was pretty edgy about accepting the help because i'd had one guy try to kill me already that day after looting one of my wrecks his kestrel didn't last long under the guns of my cormorant, i was a ratter in a destroyer. they got me into mining and taught me that not all roids are created equal and a scanner can save time when you're not in a barge.all it takes is one person to give a newbie a leg up and it points them in the direction that eve is a social game more than anything else."
"it'd certainly add something to mining other than to warp around, lock the nearest shiney rock and shoot it until you've got it all in the hold then move to the next one. i'd love to see this in as it'll also make it a bit more complex for the suicide gankers to hit a normal miner... i'd assume a botter program would have to scan every so often as an algorithm which would probably make it easier to spot as it'd be scanning in a more regular pattern than a real player would. the only losers would be the lazy people and potentially the botters if it was implemented as has been discussed here and the new players are taught to scan i never saw a tutorial for it though they might have one now."
"while we are fixing confusing gun names why dont we do somthing about the lazers? medium lazers are light, heavey lazers are medium and giga are mearly heavey. i know of at least one frig torny kill mail that caused the acusation of cheet because it had an aparently medium sized weapon on it."
"hope this happens!!!"
"i want old names back... they added some coolness and made life easier to tell someone what you wanted... i could ask someone to find some \"bloodclaws\" for me and they'd buy kinetic light missiles... now i have to ask them for some \"trauma light missiles\"... longer to type in and they might buy the wrong missile due to them all being trauma missiles. i mean really... couldn't they just have added kinetic light missile to the \"bloodclaw\" name? or just \"bloodclaw\" light kinetic... we know it's a missile anyway, so the word missile in the name is kinda redundant.actually while i'm on a rant... why did f.o.f's get to keep their names?"
"i heard some rumor that ccp might be making new turret models for missile launchers. that would be a great addition to the game, but some other improvements to missiles could be made as well to add all around improvements to the weapon.cosmetic1. missile reaching its target, it would be great for effect if each missile had a long white streak following it as seen in various movies and anime reference cowboy bebop, outlaw star, and if fired as a group they would look like a swarm and not just one. hard to say if the missile model should change, i would emphasize streaks being the missiles generally are moving too fast for anyone to get a good view on them also have the streaks be one of 4 colors, depending on damage, size changes depending on size of missile.2. missile explosions, some of them seem too large and the explosion is very transparent. i would think the should explode with more of a concentrated punch, like a ball of light. function of auto targeting fof missilesauto targeting missiles should have a functioning targeting system. currently they target anything including asteroids and npc structures. did sloth from the goonies design the targeting systems. give it, it should not be perfect, but seriously, the heck. it would be fixed 1. in missions target only rats and or turrets things with a red cross on them.2. outside of missions, list of acceptable targets can be increased or decreased default, only reds and people being hostile to you, to include neutrals as well. blues and fleet members by default not target-able. 3. the main group of missiles fly to the nearest target in range, if target is destroyed they go to next nearest. 4. base damage reduced to 90% of non-fof missile.5. a quarter of all missiles fired do not go to nearest target but a random one at range fof skill can affect this, at level 1 50% fly at random, level 5 25% go random. fof skill to level 5 gives access to tech 2 ammo that can be fired out of respective tech 2 launcher. this would make the missiles useful for quick shots, and convenience of having a missile target enemies on its own. mitigating locking times, and jamming. the obvious downside would be the reduced base damage, combined with not being able to focus where missiles go they are smart enough to shoot ships, and not roids, but not much else beyond nearest target, and some ma fall of mark. with added effort a person can with regular missiles lock targets for more damage, and sure fire way of having them focused all on the right target. with these changes the fof missile could have a role other than a joke weapon, with advantages and disadvantages over regular missiles. what do you think, other ideas to improve or change missiles?"

"um... actually... not always, i've lost several ships where help from people in corp / alliance might have saved them. there were standing fleets when i was out in 0.0 that basically listened for someone calling for support so that they could go and dock and cower in the station instead no matter how much we would have out gunned the attackers."

"i'm tempted to suggest having mining lasers pull in ore every few seconds instead of every few minutes just so there is less waste in a system poorly designed for player driving optimization.or at the very least automatically shut down a laser if the asteroid has disappeared."
"define \"too expensive\". when someone drops 20 titans on you, that's well over a trillion isk. you simply cannot \"balance\" titans by making them too expensive - that was just one of the fundamentally flawed assumptions made when titans were introduced.but yeah, deleting existing titans and replacing with something truly rare and impressive again gets a +1 from me. keeping the existing names and models makes sense."
"+1 to deleting them and trying again. same should be done with sc's in all honesty."
"why not introduce something new. make titans corpvessels, operated by more users, like a pos. one guy fly it, next guy fires frontguns, next guy rear guns etc. it would advance the game in a new experience of battle. instead of nerfing it or deleting it transform it to a multiuser plattform."

"everyone feel the silence of pl crying girls after this post ? :d"
"sith8 the greyscale changes nothing really other than the fact that titans wont blap roaming gangs. in fleet fights titans will still be blapping happily which makes the change pointless. however what the change does accomplish is it lowers the priority for ccp allowing titan re-design to fall down into the backlog. pushing real development further away this is not speculation its how ccp does things. so rather than a pointless nerf that nobody is happy with just delete titans. ccp when they have time can then reinvent them and introduce them again properly. this solution everyone wins instead of the current status quo where everyone losses and then we wait ~18 months for ccp to get back to the subject. ccp has other things they are working on in inferno and obviously a re-design of titans is not on the table . clearly thats what predicated this bandaid nerf except its a bad bandaid as it doesnt actually achieve the goals of the nerf. i mean you realize were talking about ccp here correct? in regard to the comment you made directed at me. i have fun fighting in eve in no matter what ship class. my alliance has some new fleet concepts that makes fighting with titans seem boring. solve the problem instead of bandaids"
"i and most people i know are p. darn happy with the nerf and do not agree with you that it<U+FFFD>s pointless, on the contrary.perhaps that<U+FFFD>s the complete opposite to pee l.but i<U+FFFD>ll give you that no one does crying better than you guys, or at least you are the first to demand that a whole ship class with all class specific modules and skills to be deleted from the game because you can<U+FFFD>t play with it like you used to.deal with it pee l. :smug:"

"lots of words, read them if you're a nerd.logistics and stationsyou should not be able to dock while your remote repair is active on a player. possible 1-2 minute aggression. mostly for stations, gates i'm not sure.carriers and stationsas above, the same applies. carriers should receive 2 minute aggression for remote repping.storing ships while tackledif a warp disruptor is active on your ship, you should not be able store it inside a ship maintenance bayhigh sec wars and towerssaving your tower by abusing war dec mechanics and +1day timers needs to change. make it so you can only put in 23 hours of fuel in a high sec tower?wars and corporationsjoining or leaving a corporation engaged in a war should have a 24 hour waiting period. no leaving corp to hop 3 systems then rejoining.security status and low securitykilling outlaw players and potentially gcc'd players grants you a security status increase. based on ship size, so you could in theory kill your alt a million times, but unless you are willing to invest a lot of isk and time into doing so, it isn't that worthwhilealso, you only get one sec decrease per 15 minute flag for initiating combat you still get sec loss for ship destruction if they dont shoot back this is to encourage people to fight gang vs gang without absolutely destroying your sec just for shooting at a gang. gangs will standoff sometimes because they don't want to be the gang that flags because they will receive too many sec losses. seriouslyself destruct and killmailsgenerate a blank killmail if target self destructs. players still get no loot and the target gets a potentially less embarassing killmail. potentially remove insurance for self destructed ships also.in addition potential gradient of self-destruct timers for capital ships to titans.low security officer spawnseveryone knows the 'best pirates' are in low-sec. i'm not advocating cormack starts showing up in old man star. potentially a 'baby' officer new or toned down old officer, where as 0.0 officers will drop multiple modules, low-sec officers will drop ~2~give a reason for people to check the asteroid belts.hulks and destroyers in high seci'm all for ganking, griefing etc. when someone uses their 50-100m+ isk ship at a shot at receiving 100m+ in loot then they deserve props for the gamble. using a destroyer to gank a naive frigate pilot with too much isk in his cargohold. props.using two 1 million isk ships to kill a ship that is uninsurable and worth 200m+ isk is not fair to miners. they have to be sat in that belt. their tank is horrible. nothing they can do. you lose sec status but thats inconsequential to outlaws.one option would be to increase the raw armor hp of hulks just to make it that little bit harder, requiring more or bigger ships.probing and plexes/whchange the plexes that are not radar/gravimetric/ladar/magnetometric to a new name other than unknown. or change wormholes name from unkown. a minor change that saves a few extra minutes but has no reason to be the way it is now.alliance contractsno limit to amount of contracts you can put up for alliance members as with corp contracts or a sufficiently larger number.ecm dronesjust remove them. they damage solo pvp and small gang pvp. in a 1vs1, you have to hope you can kill them before they jam you, cause if they do, the other guy is gone. so you really need to bring a friend to make sure you can keep him pointed. in small gangs, there is just too much jamming power, if they want you jammed you're gonna be jammed and you're outnumbered already. at the very least drastically reduce their jam strength.eccm needs a slight boostlet's take this slow. eccm is worth fitting but it doesn't help enough. just give it a slight increase and see how it goes. let's not go overboard.remove login contact listreplace with remote locator agent style dialog. for a small fee it will tell you if the character is online or not. enemies shouldn't be able to see the instant you log on.abandoned, unfueled possomething similar to the reinforced mechanic in the sense you can initiate a timer of x amount of days at the end of which it can then be unanchored. the only person that can prevent this is the pos owner.black opsthey're good for bridging... erm... yeah that's it. for fighting? they're worse than t1 variants of their ship for 10x the price. bridging is pretty cool and all but there's no reason to fight with them. just bridge recons and bombers. give them same base stats as t1 variant. a sin should tank as much as a dominix can."

"happens a lot in jita. it's a high sec war thing. fighting on stations sucks anyway but this makes it even harder to competently fight anyone on a station.happens all the time in low-sec. anytime you get into a fight with pirates on a station, they will undock a carrier to rep. beli' dat.my apologies i did not mean fuel, i meant strontium. so you cannot have a reinforce cycle longer than the 24h it takes to circumvent the war declaration. it happens quite a lot if you attack anyones tower in high sec with any know how.you lose money everytime you lose a ship, even if it is insured. and i'm not talking about large sec rises here and it should scale per ship size. so you would have to invest a fair amount of isk and effort to exploit it."
"this would provide an intriguing method for making *very* deep safes, which i am lead to believe are considered \"bad\"."
"very deep safe for what ?please tell me how can you kill a cyno which is open 8au from you?15 sec really enough for you to kill it the cyno ship? \"very deep safes\" blablatry it first.1sec you need to realize to a cyno opened up in the system. you starting to warp there. with a fast tackler you need 1-2 sec align time, and you need to travel at least 10-15 sec. try it.2-3 sec need to leave the warp effect when you reach the cyno point, and you cant targeting under this sequence. when you leave the warp, do you need target the ship, if you are with a fast tackler such as a inty you need ~0.8 sec target time to frig. + you need to kill him.a kestrel need 2-3 shot with inty, that's 3-5sec minimum.do you think about it, this is shorter time than 15 sec ? no way, and with a bigger ship the travel and align time is much longer.i bet you, you cant kill a cynoship under 15 sec if the cynoship open the cyno 5aurange from you, because you cant travel there and kil him under 15 sec."

"when will ccp create a dislike button for these forums?you suggestion doesn't suit me so -1."
"seems a lot of effort when it's just so much easier to get a fleet of friends together, send them through the gates ahead of the 'smuggler' and get them to kill any customs ships that are hanging around. they will suffer a sec hit but so what? it's fun and your shady goods get to jita ok. i do have to wonder though as to what you would be 'smuggling' anyway? only thing of any real value would be boosters. anything else just isn't worth the trouble."
"boosters are primarily the player related product that would be of most emphasis i guess. and yes i'm aware of the potential move by ccp to legalise them or reduce the illegality associated with some to potentially open up this trade. of course for selfish reasons of this proposal there would be an interest to maintain their status.there are also a number of npc trade goods that have variable legality in empire sectors:khumaak,protein delicacies,small arms,ectoplasm,narcotics various types,elite slaves,slaves,plutonium,toxic wasteso potentially some aspect by ccp could be exploited to make low sec industry apply some profitable trade runs to other areas with these products. where they don't already exist of course.it would be nice to see more player related products of course to expand on the possible illegal industry possibilities.one idea i had thought of was \"cheaper\" counterfeit products.e.g. some implants could have a counterfeit or black market equivalence. they would operate in a similar way to their regular bonefide version but they would also have a negative effect associated with them to balance out a cheaper cost. problem with these is they would obviously compete with regular implants to some extent and also would need to be labelled in the market correctly to make them stand out from regular implants so as to not confuse the two.as such the black market versions could be made available in low sec lp stores. but have some illegal status to transport but not illegal to use. there may be other more sensible counterfeit items that could be treated in a similar way.or there may be new opportunites similar to boosters, which would actually expand on illegal products players can make sensibly and fit into the economy. if you can think of any such items that might be useful i'd appreciate it. i'll keep it in mind of course, but haven't applied much thought to it as yet."
"i agree that smuggling / black-markets are a wasted opportunity in eve atm, so read the pdf and here's my thoughtsi like the skill based approach, it seems right that cloaking should be a pre-requisite and i like the idea that it's not 100% certain to work.the secret compartment module is a good idea as well, although i think it should work a little differently. consider that the more secret compartments you have on a ship, the more likely they are to be discovered by customs... so it seems backwards that having more of them would increase the chance of concealing your contraband. i suggest you have two modules, a low-slot and a mid-slotsecret compartment ilow slot module that adds x m3 of shielded storage space, either in seperate cargo hold or in your main. for each extra secret compartment after the first you receive a penalty to your concealment percentage like a \"reverse\" stacking penalty, meaning that you can either transport small amounts at less risk or larger amounts at higher riskcargohold white noise emittersa mid slot module that emits a signal similar to a cargohold full of consumer electronics. used in conjunction with a secret compartment to conceal the 'blank' space in the cargohold that would otherwise show up on cargohold scanners. adds x to the value of the concealment skillfinally, i don't much like the idea of a ship that gets a bonus to concealment, as it really breaks with the immersion in the game. i mean, if a company started making trucks with hidden compartments to avoid customs, i think there'd be a pretty good chance all such trucks would get pulled in for a check. the whole idea behind smuggling is that it can't look like what it is, so imo it should happen on all the regular ships in eve, not some designated 'smuggler' ship.just my two cents,/yargle"
"btw, it also always bothered me that there are customs agents on all high-sec gates that scan all ships. if you are patient and careful enough, and move with a scout, it should be possible to plot a course through the 0.5 and 0.6 systems without running into customs.also, it'd be great with a mechanic that took into account how many ships are currently at the gate. if you're moving through a gate with 60 people on it, customs should be less likely to check your particular ship than if you're all by yourself./yargle"
"some good points.can you expand on the seperate cargo space model for the secret compartments. would you see it as like having an expandable bay area that needs these modules to become active. and as such would be a new mechanic applicable to all ships that would only become applicable when these modules are applied? would you see each module granting a fixed m3 rather than %? care to suggest some maths to illustrate useage?this does make sense as a custom fitted design to ships that smugglers would use and i take the criticsim that a ship designed for such purposes would stand out. i guess my purpose here was to give some incentive to use of the ship. but i guess even as a fast equivalant it would be useful. so i'd be happy to drop the dedicated role bonus if it's not deemed to be sensible. it would then be a case of how best to adjust the numbers, as i had this factored into a role for the ship as a result."
"ideally it would be a new cargo compartment, like the drone bay or the ore hold on a rorqual, as this would be, by far, the easiest way to manage your concealed cargo, the available space for contraband, etc.with regards to secret compartments giving a percentage based bonus volume to the concealed cargo space m3, you can go two ways on that. if you make it percentage based that will mean that you can carry more contraband cargo on a bigger ship. if it is instead a fixed value, you could argue that a small compartment is more difficult to locate on a large battleship than on a small frigate, and have the ship volume somehow impact the concealment effectiveness of the compartment . either way makes sense to me.i didn't work out any numbers, my notion was purely conceptual and based on game immersion. i think the very nature of smuggling is that you try to look just like any other ship out there. also, in my humble opinion there already are enough cookie cutter configurations out there in new eden. i'd prefer more ways to use the ships i already have.great ideas though, and would work as a good base for the later implementation of a proper black market in low-sec./yargle"
"my thoughts on the matter.- firstly bounty payouts must be payed when a ship is destroyed not just a pod, i think that is something most people agree needs changing.- secondly the payout needs to be in line with the ship loss up to a maximum of the bounty set and insurance payouts reduced by the value of the bounty so it is not ever profitable to collect your own bounty with an alt or friendly 3rd party.those 2 things have to happen before any other changes to fix the most broken part of the system. i agree that you should be able to set a bounty when you acquire kill rights from an unlawful kill regardless of the players sec status.accepting a bounty should transfer kill rights, to do so should cost a small % of the targets bounty and give you kill rights for 7 days.bounties should be acceptable for yourself, your corp or an allinace.if someone else collects the bounty within those 7 days you lose the kill rights and your bounty acceptance fee is refunded.pretty simple but really all that needs to be done.regards, mike712 the battleclinic team"
"supported. good idea to solve a long standing problem. if ccp wants to advertise bounty hunting as a legitimate career path in eve, they best make it one. these changes would be a good move in that direction."
"hi all,i was just looking at my skill sheet earlier and i saw the sp i 'wasted' in defender missiles.i think nearly everyone would love to just ditch that skill completely and get their sp back as it's one of the most useless skills ever.however, i was wondering why defenders are never used? they were a good idea to provide 'personal' defence i'm british, that's how you spell defence here, honest! against missile spamming ships but 99.9% of pilots would rather have an offensive capability on their ship rather than waste high slots for a dubious at best defensive system.my proposal is instead of having defender missiles only target missiles aimed at you, they be able to destroy any missiles aimed at anyone in your fleet. think of it as your patriot anti-missile battery for eve.i should also point out this will only work for fleets. it won't work against missiles randomly fired at npc's/fc's/ccp that aren't in your fleet.this will actually make defender missiles worth using on certain ships fleet scorpions? loldps from cruise so have them be your missile 'shield' instead as well as ecm as an example and it would also mean there would be absolutely no need to nerf drakes or tengus as there would now be a handy counter to missile spamming like there was supposed to be.your thoughts/trolls/insults/improvements/apathy?"
"it would be nice if ship defense included point defense hard points with turret and missile forms for missiles and drones, or that pesky frigate but then special hard points would likely be needed and ships would need to be significantly re-balanced."
"i would agree with this; however, eve has a lot of ****** up names. i'd frankly rather keep dealing with the odd names that currently exist than have to learn new ones. the missile name ****-up was an example of how ****** ccp is at changing that kind of stuff; lets not invite them to screw it up further..."
"of all the module name changes, this one makes sense."
"i completely agree."
"yes, agreed. never understood why they went with artillery on autocannons."
"ship prices have already risen significantly and dramatically."
"yeah, lets trash the economy, cause huge inflation, all so the four players who mine without bots gain 30% more isk per hour. brilliant idea. you should enter politics."
"so let me just clarify this, you are advocating that the drone regions still drop drone minerals for refining that seriously deflate the prices of minerals to make mining unprofitable for the people that actually enjoy doing that?just to break it down to it's nuts and bolts, you are happy that a few alliances in the drone regions have a virtual monopoly on mineral prices?brilliant idea. you should enter politics."
"dont get me wrong, id prefer that drone regions never had mineral poo in the first place. however it is too late now. removing such a major source of minerals will cause the price of minerals to increase dramatically, thus increasing the prices of ships and mods to increase dramatically - yay inflation. unless ccp watch the prices of everything, and raise the bounty/mission rewards etc to match this inflation on a weekly basis, this move will screw over actual players in favour of mining bot owners. and lets face it, who is more valuable to the game - someone who farms drone poo by day, warring by night, or a bot?"
"i can see your point but i think ccp are and should continue to slam the banhammer down on bots.sure, for the short term ship/mod prices will increase but once miners actually start to see profit for mining, it will settle down before long....hopefully."
"if this was combined with a boost to mining yield - or perhaps a reduction in the number of units of ore required for one reprocessing cycle, or increasing the mineral output of a reprocessing cycle, or something else to increase the mineral output of miners, and another crackdown on botters, then that might be enough compensation to lower the damaging effects of removing mineral poo from drones. but simply removing mineral drops from drones as a single change will have more negative than positive effects, in my opinion.if ccp could give us concrete data on the origin of all minerals, then it would help clarify this issue - it could be that mining accounts for a tiny fraction of the actual mineral output, it could be that drone poo provides a tiny proportion, we just dont know. most reasoned guesses put mining at about 40% ish, with drone poo at 30% ish, and misc sources such as mod drops at 20%. and those are very rough figures :p"
"i know your trying to sound funny but there are alot of people that mine as a main source of income and alot of people that have the ability to but have moved on. with higher mineral payouts will come more miners.also yeah a boost to yeild or reprocessing could help solve the drone region problem you stated"
"if they remove drone alloy drops i don't think this will be needed. this would also likely need to be done by nerfing refining which i don't think anyone wants."
"then why did they change them in the first place?the old names were effective and people are used to them. there is really no reason to change the names. and do you really think a newb uses the market search feature to find missiles? more than likely they will look in the browse feature to find missiles, and just find the properly colored one."
"lol! yes! cloak seeking fof missiles ftw! i can see the tears starting to form already......just out of curiosity, why the heck would you want to use fof missiles in missions in the first place? they do quite a bit less damage that standard missiles and you never get jammed that often in missions for them to be worthwhile.for pvp on the other hand, they are perfectly fine at what they do. not the first time i've kicked the crap out of someone's destroyer on a drag bubble with their cloaky falcon alt hovering nearby to facilitate risk free pvp.not so risk free when there are fof's buzzing around."
"this is very confusing and should be clarified:this page has a link called \"reporting scams and exploits.\" when you click on the link you get the following instructions:\"if you notice someone using scams, exploits or cheats within the game, please file a petition to let us know. \"however, in the first link there is also a link titled \"scams and exploits\" which reads:so, why advise players to report scams via petition if there is nothing the support team can do for you? yes, we all know scams are allowed in eve as advised by the \"scams\" link...unless you're new. the reference to scams should be removed from the links page first reference as well as the second link advising people petition scams.also, the wording in the page on scams and exploits is very confusing because it seems to use the word \"scam\" and \"exploit\" interchangeably instead of making a clear differentiation in some parts. for example, using \"how can i fight those who exploit me?\" as a title for how to report exploits, and then giving tips for avoiding scams in the same paragraph keeps the line blurred for new players. while you're at it, a list of all of the \"scam rules\" in the eula would be helpful instead of just relying on word of mouth or scattered info/posts to keep people from doing things like running gtc scams, plex for good scams, recruitment channel scams, impersonation scams, loan scams, character exchange scams, etc."
"the difference is in-game scams are perfectly fine. out of game scams aren't.if you are scammed by, for example, clicking on a link that takes you to a webpage that steals your login details and all your isk, then that's a scam you should report.buying a used titan from a 3 day old goon for 10bil and never actually getting the titan is perfectly legal and shouldn't be reported you can however emoragepost on here so we can all get a good laugh. it could do with a clearer definition on that page though but not sure how they could without literally posting a list of reportable scams.guess ccp just want people to use their judgement....lol!"
"not true. scamming someone in the in-game recruitment channel is not allowed. running a scam pretending to be ccp in-game is not allowed. loan scams in-game are not allowed. etc. not to mention your point is completely invalidated by the language used. \"if you notice someone using scams, exploits or cheats within the game, please file a petition to let us know. \"there are only a few exceptions to the rule that in-game scams are allowed. why not \"literally\" post them in one place...in the link about scams perhaps? there's room for 20 \"tips\" on avoiding scams but not enough for the 5 or so scams that are prohibited?"
"*sigh*"
"i think you're confusing judgment with experience/knowledge. how would a new player who has heard all about how \"it's okay to scam on eve\" know about the exceptions? you take for granted the things you've heard about the subject scattered over the time you have been playing."
"iirc, the only in-game scamming that isn't allowed is scamming in the recruitment channel or the rookie systems. claiming to be from ccp isn't a scam, it's impersonation of an employee which is a far different level of offense than scamming. and there's no rule against scamming in a loan. if someone lends you isk and you refuse to pay it back, that's perfectly valid. other than those two channels where you're not allowed to scam, pretty much anything in-game goes, as long as it's using valid game mechanics not exploits."
"same way everyone else learned. ask people in the help channel, local, corp, alliance, forums, voices in your head etc etc etc.and no, i am not confusing judgement with experience. judgement is something we all have, even new players. if you are in any doubt, petition it. simple as that."
"this just goes to prove my point. loan scams were, iirc, deemed \"out of bounds\" by ccp back when there were loan contracts. they were so confusing that ccp eventually ended up removing the mechanic entirely, but the rule against \"loan scams\" is still floating around and quoted by people replying to questions about which scams are okay and which are not. why not consolidate them?"
"because people in the \"help\" channel, alliance, corp and local are so reliable. really?also, the whole point of the suggestion is to reduce the number of unnecessary petitions to ccp. this would speed up the replies to valid petitions which is a good thing, right? i really don't understand the resistance to simply posting an \"official\" list of scams that are not allowed and then letting people \"use their common sense\" or the petition system to apply the rules."
"if you can't see why giving people in eve of all games information on how to scam then, quite frankly, there's little hope for you."
"ah, so we have finally arrived at the heart of your true objections. you want to see \"security by obscurity\" enforced when it comes to scamming and you object to clarifying the rules because you want new players who try to scam to get banned over the confusion caused. welp.i hate to break it to you but everyone already knows scamming is allowed on eve. frankly, if you ask any gamer who doesn't play eve if they're heard of eve, and they have, they usually reply with something like \"oh yeah, that's the game where you can scam other players.\" the reason is all of the publicity the big scams get outside of eve. it's unfair to glamorize the fact that scams are legal on eve and then keep the rules about scamming so murky that a new player has a good chance of getting banned for violating a \"rule\" that is buried in a dev blog somewhere years ago. i find your attitude of secretly hoping new players get banned for wanting to try something eve is famous for revolting. i also find your lack of knowledge expressed in your very first reply sentence about how \"all in-game scams are allowed\" telling as to your knowledge of this subject and what you have to offer in this thread. it's just not true...provably not true. go troll elsewhere.ps: my blog has a nice little guide on running some common eve scams. it should be far more helpful than a list of the 5 or so scams not allowed, and it's in my sig. so as you can see, you and i have very differing opinions on the subject of providing info on how to scam to new players."
"loan scams aren't off-limits anymore though. loan contracts don't exist anymore, therefore nothing relating to them can exist either as i said, iirc the only scams that are existing in the game that are actually scams which are off-limits are scamming in a couple very specific channels. and, iirc, the recruitment channel has a motd that scamming is prohibited and the rookie systems have long-standing rules against scamming or griefing noobs."
"you know, if the last suggestion in my post was implemented, you wouldn't have to keep qualifying everything you post with iirc. hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....also, not only have you not addressed the primary subject of the topic, but you have so far failed to make your point about why a list of disallowed scams in ccp's page on the subject is a bad idea. new players are far more likely to hear that \"scams are legal in eve\" than they are to hear \"long-standing rules\" that aren't stated in the eula. these new players are dropped into ... where else... noob systems. so where are they more than likely to try their first scam?again, why not just post the rules on scams on the page about scams?"
"lol! contradict much?which is it? everyone already knows about scams or they don't?i get the strangest feeling that we're talking at crossed purposes here. i couldn't care less about in game scams. post them all day every day in here or anywhere else for that matter. these scams don't matter and ccp isn't interested in them.i was referring to the nefarious scams that actually cost people their accounts and real money. you know? the really bad scams? the ones that you really don't want to broadcast so as not to entice more people to try them? after all, if they don't know about them, how can they 'accidently' get banned? you don't 'accidently' steal someone's account. you are just being pedantic now.i didn't say all in game scams were allowed. what i said was but that's not what this post was about. it was a proposal to clarify which scams are 'legal' and which aren't. i stand by my earlier post....use your judgement. all intelligent people have this."
"sir, i believe by your own standards you are disqualified."
"this is irrelevant, everyone knows there are no more new players in eve, only more alts that get created."
"i say 'iirc' because i'm working off of my memory, which isn't always perfect, since i don't scam. i could go look up the exact info for sure, but it isn't worth the time to me, i'd rather just use the disclaimer of 'iirc' i'd say the exact same thing even if ccp did have a site to look up scams.and the recruitment channel has a warning in the motd warning against scamming last i checked atleast and a first-time-offender noob scamming in a noob system because he didn't know better won't get punished. he'll get a warning against doing it again and he'll either learn from that and not scam there again or get punished for it if he knowingly continues. and i didn't say i'm opposed to posting the rules about scamming anywhere, but since it's just one line \"no scamming in recruitment or the rookie systems\" there's not much point in it. besides the fact that having a list of forbidden scams opens ccp up to people doing something that's not covered and then the player saying \"but you didn't specifically tell me i couldn't do that\" as an excuse. the current system puts the burden on the players to follow the spirit of the rule, rather thatn putting the burden on ccp to cover any possible loophole there might be."
"and the first person to resort to insults has already lost their argument.welcome to eve, enjoy your stay."
"and mxzf wins another thread. congratulations sir. basically this."
"i fail to understand why nobody has suggested that people who get the beacon and can warp to it aren't +5's or +10's in corporation/alliance/personal standings list rather than anyone else."
"well as this idea is mainly for hi sec people, it would be a nightmare setting everyone blue in local that says they may help. by the time you did that, they'd be dead anyway.and, eve pilots being the devious little souls that they are, what's to stop someone saying they will help to be set +5 etc only for them to gank you anyway?standings are an indicator of intent, not a guarantee of intent. blues will nuke you for lulz if they want to."
"well the naming convention we currently have seems just fine.don't see the point of a pointless name change for the sake of it.and just for your information, gunboats would be most closely associated with cruiser size ships and not battlecruiser size. so you would actually be renaming the wrong ship class anyway and causing more :confusion:"
"if someone cannot tell the difference between a cruiser, a battlecruiser and a battleship, then eve is the wrong game. also, they should not be allowed to vote. or breed."
"this is cross-posting from the ship & modules forum about the titan nerf and ccp doesn't like that.not like pl would bend the rules/mechanics to suit themselves."
"it doesn't make the slightest sense no matter how you look at it because limiting the amount of titans in a fleet or in a system will still result in an ultimatum. it's either you get as much titans into the system first or create multiple fleets. you can also decide to engage with 300 alpha maels...get owned, then proceed to whine on you tube."
"drones themselves and the ui do need some attention from ccp.+1"
"i don't...what??ok, not sure what you are asking for here and seriously? people fly the typhoon? wow!"
"actually, you are really wrong. if you know what it feels like to wait for weeks before receiving your isk back or even getting a reply then you won't post that comment that sounds like it's coming from an ignorant individual or someone involved in the same dubious act.a contract like system will narrow character transfer issues or scams to only hacked accounts. the way it works is simple and sound, if you can afford it then pay up but if you can't then move on... anyone that doesn't get his character sold can adjust the price as needed. the current mechanism makes it too easy to scam and put unnecessary work load on the gms. this is time that can be used to address problems of new players that ccp is trying so hard retain and please. all of these can be easily avoided. a wise man once said, \"if ignorance is bliss, why aren't there more happy people?\""
"well,they used to have etc selling through the account management page where you assign the etc to someone and price you are asking for it.i just wonder why other than the possibility to scam isk from the current method is considered business as usual this method was not adopted to the character transfers. if you are auctioning your character on forums and then when the auction is over you'd then simply assign that character-to-be-sold to a character \"i buy toons and stuff\" with the amount of isk agreed - and when the buyer accepts the character the character transfer fee is deducted from the sellers account and the isk is transfered or possibility to purchase 'character transfer tokens in advance.if the seller do not have credits at the time when the transaction would take place it would just notify the buyer that the transaction could not be made and inform the seller by e-mail 'dude, where's your credit?' so the seller could then make approriate actions.however, all things must evolve or die away this whole thing could be taken to another level and implement the real character bazaar.seller would put character up on auction with options: auction time, min bid, reserve, buyout.optionally some sort of short 'sales speech' field allowed as well.characters with negative wallet and other invalid data could not be put up on sale.then normal auction controls for buyers, bid x needs to be higher than min bid apparently / buyout.bidding would then reserve the isk bidded on the character till higher bid or buyout has been made.the auction would then provide information about the character in example: skill list and queue corp history security status forum post count link to posts etc what is considered relevant. optionally there could be search filtering when listing characters on the bazaar based on skills etc.just my few cents - love it or keep on hating.- j"
"as much as the transfer mechanics leave a lot to be desired, you really have to ask yourself just how much of a problem is the current system?if it was affecting a large portion of the eve population then i would agree that it would need fixing.however, i suspect that this will only ever affect a very small minority of people that trade characters for whatever reason.i don't think it would be worthwhile for ccp to devote time and resources to this.my own personal opinion on this is that transferring or selling characters should never have been allowed in the first place because it is very open to abuse.caveat emptor as they say."

"it's not just solo that it's killing, it's also harmful to new players and corps starting out in pvp. because we're in danger of getting into a position where people believe that they need a booster pilot to be able to compete. the above reference to \"solo\" pilots needing a booster alt is evidence of that. at which point there's a great danger of new players thinking \"this is stupid\" and of going back to pveing or logging off.now, sure, this is really a problem with warfare links in general, rather than off-grid alts, but on-grid boosters are more visible so easier to scout, more vulnerable and are trickier to manage as an alt."

"funny, when i tell people they have to read through 191 pages of website before they can effectively start the game, they fire up some lol or bf3.much as eve has always been a 'go to www.evecraplearningsite.com and figure it out' game, that doesn't actually keep people playing for more than the 15 minutes it takes them to read about tracking formulas and say 'i'll play swtor for my spaceship fix' because eve is complicated, and the npe doesn't prepare you for this.you're not gonna learn from 200 webpages worth of info, you are gonna learn from experience and guidance. give vet corps a reason to recruit newbs and train them, and you will see an increase in player retention. telling people 'here is the website, have fun reading dry technical data for the next day' is gonna make them rethink being your friend."
"why do botters only get a short ban of a week or two when they get caught botting....this is basicly saying to people yea go bot but stop when ya get caught.people caught botting shouldnt be allowed to keep there characters simple"

"ok so what your saying is everyone here bots....and because you think that.....all should be banned on first offense.who died and made you judge again?maybe you should take the time to think before you voice your opinions.....just because you think they are a bot doesn't mean they are....you can come up with any number of concepts/proofs/ideas but when it comes right down to it...ccp will be the one to make that choice.now you can #### about it...or go shoot them.and if you actually read the statements given....it is not a slap on the wrist you think it is. try reading the whole message eh?================ stop the evemail spam!"

"my experience with shield and armor fleets has made it more than obvious that armor ships have enough buffer which allows for enough time to react. i see where you are coming from but literally, my point is that remote armor reps consume less cap per cycle and the ships they are fitted on generally possess better cap stability before considering the effect of mods.if anything change should be made at all, it should be to capital shield transporters. it's fairly reasonable, if the lower variants are left as they are atm."

"there are jump freigters that cost 5-6+ b isk that can fly in highsec, jump to a cyno in low- or nullsec and carries vast amounts of cargo. there are rorquals that can be used as a transport of kind in low- and nullsec. they cost 2-2.5 b.so they are expensive but fills a need for logistics of large cargos for large corps and alliances that also have the isk to buy them and to skill for them.for small but still adventouros corps with few members that likes to produce stuff mainly in lowsec, there is a need for a smaller jump-capable and affordable ship that still could carry more than a blockade runner but less than a jump freighter. to keep up the logistics of fuel and material for production based on moon mining, and still have time over for activities irl, this would fill a need in eve! this would enable entrepreneurs to move to lowsec, compete with t2-products on \"equal terms\" as the larger null/lowsec alliances etc.in short they would work just as jump freighters, but be smaller and less expensive. the target customer group would be small corps for smallscale jump transports to and from lowsec-nullsec and highsec. lets say price around 600-900 m, cargo capacity as a iteron iv, jump capable, t2 with maybe only 2 rig slots, possible to fly in highsec, no cloaksa suitable name could be \"jump haulers\", perhaps!?ccp and eve community - any thoughts around this?"

"you are, of course, entitled to your opinion, but you are mistaken, as whining is not the reason for this proposal.the reason is as follow:imagine corps whose goal would be to fight piracy, and not commit piracy and agression themselves... corp that would be willing to police the areas that concord does not touch, low sec especially.. in the current state of the game, very few corps would do that successfully, because there is no way they can scan and jump to the location of a fight, if they would be willing to help defend a victim they do not know in time.by deciding to emit a mayday call that can only be visible to non-pirates and agressors at the time of the mayday, there would be a mechanic for groups of vigilants to help out carebears. these corps could establish patrols to help around. limiting the feature because of sec gives a reasonable hope to the person emitting the mayday that they will not just add insult to injury. sure, newcomers could decide to jump in and take the ss hit. but knowing that at the time of pushing the mayday button, the ss status of responders would not be set that way is a psychological factor that is not negligeable.right now, this is mostly impossible to try to help a victim without already be in corp/fleet, because the time of a fight otside of major engagements usually does not allow scanning and jumping to the location, hence the idea of the mayday beacon to help in that aspect.of course, i am totally seeing why pirates/agressors would not like this idea, and this is fine. as i said everyone is entitled to their opinion.as a late thought on this, a mayday would only be usable in deep space i.e. not on grid of a station or a gate, as options already exists in these areas for the victims, and the locations are already easier to jump to anyway."

"tl;dr: making newer players over-dependant on specialization is bad.ccp on the whole has been doing rather well as of late, however, one of the biggest issues i have is the repeated statements regarding specialising in a particular ship, and the new set of ship specializations feed into this.however, i think this is the wrong way to go for the starter elements of the game such as battlecruisers.my concern is that as a new player, i most certainly did not know what i wanted to do in game, i trained mining, missiles, some guns, eventually found learning skills. my skill queue was all over the place and i was not terribly effective at anything, but i could do a little bit of everything and i did so because i wanted to explore multiple parts of the game.i fear that by pidgeon-holing new players by forcing them down specialization routes to do anything at all, that we would be short changing them of a lot of the variation that is to be had. ...to compare it to a typical education; the first things a person is taught are general fundamental skills, reading writing, numeracy. when a child first enters school it is not decided that they will be, for example, a classical novelist, and as such will not be taught numeracy and would have 30 hours a week of reading and writing instead. it would obviously be very silly to do so, the person has no idea what they're going to do in life, and those that do want to be astronauts or ballerinas which is unrealistic. the specialization comes later, much much later, after the person has had chance to learn what they want to do.therefore, i propose that the csm resists over-specialization of ships and training paths and ensures that it's possible to enjoy the game *without* being a one trick pony....as a side note, i personally love the idea of having a few more generic skills such as \"battlecruisers\" and \"destroyers\". they provide you with a tool kit which lets you be adaptive, and when you're playing for fun, surely that's much more important than having to sit out because your particular specialization isn't in need."
"you aren't forced to specialize, you never were and these changes won't really change it. the only difference is that you'll need to specifically train levels in bc and destroyer. there were always requirements of racial cruiser/frig, the racial weapons, and the racial tank. the levels of bc and destroyers have always been relatively minor in comparison to the total amount of training time it takes to actually become effective at flying the ship."

"thanks for the feedback. keep the recommendations and suggestions coming."
"something to keep in mind, and this is what i hope my ccp crystal ball is right about ... the new crimwatch 2.0 and the suspect flag. when jumping through a gate it will be a very simple matter to flag the player as suspect if and when they are carrying contraband. they then have to run like hell to the next gate, dock or play dodge the probes.there may be some restrictions on cloaking and things of that nature, how all that pans out who knows. skills, modules, faction standings, etc may and could be used as modifiers in all of this.what i hope is, customs agents go away for the most part, and the enforcement of contraband is put into the hands of the players. this will create an entire new set of career options, from faction white knight / gate camp gank for suspect flags and the assortment of pick up my contract full of contraband margin trade scams.necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom. it is the argument of tyrants; it is the creed of slaves. - william pitt"
"bump and +1i've long supported the idea of a contract system for bounty hunters, putting the burden of preventing exploitation on the player just like the market and trade contracts do. good to see it supported by csm and combined with the \"asset destruction\" suggestion as well, the two ideas work well together."
"shamelessly putting here my previously ignored proposal... my take on bounty hunting, with a cool name for it:eve: retaliationproposal 1: \"transferable kill rights\". sbdy shot you down, you can transfer the kill rights to sbdy else to take care of the agressor, for a price.the kill rights can be transfered to as many undertakers as you want -but bounty hunters taking them can't transfer them again. why unlimited transfers? to prevent the agressors from stealing the rights from the victim with a bounty hunter alt.proposal 2: \"the price of destruction\". bounties are claimed by destroying the agressor's stuff, not necessarily killing himup to twice the inflicted loss, the reward is half the cost of the destroyed stuff. practical case: they blow your hulk, you lose 300 million, so you pay 300 million for sbdy to destroy 600 million worth of agressor's stuff. payment is due upon the destruction of stuff, no kill, no gain.proposal 3: \"it sucks to be friends\". hirers can extend kill rights to any other target being hunted and who belongs to the target's corporation.practical case: captain scum got a bounty on his head and is in the same corporation as vicious ganker, who also got a bounty on his head. by getting a kill right on captain scum, miner malone can also ask the bounty hunters to target vicious ganker even if vicious ganker never did anything to miner malone. the kill rights stand even if vicious ganker leaves the corporation.proposal 4: \"you will never be alone\". bounty hunters on duty can track their targets via two new skills. skill one: network interaction. allows access to the records of gates and stations, so whenever a target jumps or docks, the bounty hunter can read a track record about it. the distance and time span of track records varies with skill, up to a whole faction's space and the last 5 days.practical case: with network interaction v, a bounty hunter can read the records of every jump and dock carried out by captain scum in say minmatarr space for the last 5 days.the access would have a concord fee, so any hirer should pay some expenses to the bounty hunter.skill two: navsat interaction. allows access to the local satellite network so whenever the prey shows in a local chat, if even for 0.5 seconds while leaving a station, the bounty hunter knows his exact location. in order to do so the bounty hunter must deploy combat probes, which will interact wiht navsats and tell where exactly was seen the target. practical case: captain scum is in a safe spot in a lowsec sytem. accidentally trips off his cloak and then recloaks. five days later, a bounty hunter interacts with the navsats and learns of the last known location of captain scum... bounty hunter jumps in and he's afk cloaked. g-bye captain scum!this skill is so powerful that it must be expensive, say, 30 days to level 5. of course, bounty hunters only can track targets upon which they got a kill right from a hirer.summary:- unlimitedly transferable kill rights; if a hirer is fillthy rich and can throw 20 hunters on the agressor, let the agressor have it picking filthy rich traders/industrialists sucks- pay for destroying the target's stuff, not merely kill him once. no longer self-killing for the bounty unless you're up to losing twice the reward.- any other target in the target's corporation can be punished too. if you gang together against bounty hunters, bounty hunters can gang together against you.- bounty hunters can track the last moves of the target via stargates and stations. it sucks to be hunted.- bounty hunters can pinpoint the last moves of the target via the target's appearences in local chat. it sucks a lot to be hunted."
"looks like a relatively simple change, that does make sense. i have my eve-mail as open, as i'm usually in lowsec....i have seen those spam evemails, and they are annoying. an option like you said, to have more settings on it would be great."
"dude set you cspa charge at 1 million. i never get spam mail unless i set the charge lower for ppl to contact me thats not in my corp/alliance.if your getting that much spam mail its your own fault plain and simple!did you try adding the spammers to block list not sure if that will work but worth a trytroll skill lv3 =v="
"if anything is op, it's the damn dreads pushing out way more dps than any super atm whilst still having a good tank, being relatively cheap and easier to produce. nowadays, it makes more sense to engage in a lot of dreads instead of a few titans and still come out ahead in terms of isk efficiency and general effectiveness.there's no need for the titan, if it'll be limited to a certain role, especially when you consider all the effort put into getting and maintaining one. i think all capital and supercapital production should be done in a capital assembly array. it'll even out the availability of capitals as a whole.p.s. nerf titan turret tracking and increase dps. dreads pushing out more dps than titans is unacceptable."

"when i did hear right, the proposal was: the bigger the opponent, the more you payi don't think this is the right way. it should be calculated by the member difference between the corps/alliances.for a big corp/alliance it should be more expensive, to declare war to a far smaller corp/alliance, than to a similar in size."

"actually, from what i've heard.... they are removing the mwd and replacing it with this."
"ok so at fanfest they proposed having an additional 500k isk added for every player in whatever organization your are wardecking. i think this makes large alliances far too safe.i say instead of having a linear increase in the price based on members, make it a logarithmic curve instead"
"it made sense until i read it again. there's no way ccp is going to implement a mechanic where a highsec system suddenly acquires low/nullsec system characteristics; there are more than enough low/nullsec systems that way ----> so simply use the currently available wardec system, if you must fight in highsec; suicide ganking is also another option. besides, the social benefits of incursions over weighs any other reason for a possible pvp environment to be considered, especially in highsec, imo."
"i think incursions should both drop sec status and be subject to faction war type mechanics of concord aligned vs sansha aligned players. however, an easier approach from ccps perspective might be just to restrict incursion participation to those in player corps/alliances and with the new wardec system allow players and the sandbox to sort out the rest on their own."
"associations: a stepping stone to corporations, or squads for everyone.what i propose is to formalise and extent support to something that basically already exists in a variety of forms in eve online.over the years various like minded players have created chat channels to socialise in, but unless you know they exist, you can only find them by accident. you can drop named cans outside popular stations, or link in your character bio and spam local, but these are very limited forms of advertisement.now, a corporation can be advertised, but possesses a great deal of functionality that is unneccessary and frankly bewildering to the unintiaited. for new players especially, all that's needed are the social functions that a corporation has access to.so i propose a minminalised form of corporation, that possesses no physical assets, that's streamlined for easy of use and setup, and can be advertised in game with all the necessary tags that can be searched and sorted for. essentially a purely social form of corporation, which we could call 'associations', or whatever else you happen to prefer.addtionally at the end of the new player career tutorials, stick a new tutorial that shows a new player how to find or create an association.importantly an association is just a glorified chat channel with a few extras such as fleet finder and calendar and recruitment advertising, it doesn't preclude you being in a corporation as well, or being in multiple associations, so it can't be war-dec'ed, it can't setup a pos or have hangars or offices. it's just an addtional tool to promote social play."
"not true. too many feking stargates is the problem. stargates should all be removed and all ships should get jump drives. of course just about every aspect of eve needs to be changed and reballenced to acomodate this and new mechanics need to be introduced to goven how jump drives operate and complicate their use. but ultimatly we will all benefit from playing in a universe where clueless ideots get stranded without fuel thousands of lightyears from the nerist comunications link to local chat.that said, untill the universal transportation re-design is implimented, nicolo is right, we dont need more jump capable ships in the interim."
"if local is at something stupid like 150+ people can drones just not show up? they still do what their function is but they are not \"shown\" we don't need a bracket for 5000 fighters/drones in big fights just makes people with low end pcs hate their lives.thanks"

"they are already rolling out a tracking fix, and its to nerf all xl turret tracking by 50% across the board. they are removing the 50% tracking penalty from the siege module tho.as for your dread damage complaint, i dont see anything wrong with it, since they have to take a massive risk by going into siege mode to get that damage. if you want a titan to be able to use a siege module to be able to beat a dreads damage output i could get behind the idea since it comes with risks."

"i know a lot has been said about this issue, however i've thought a bit about the mechanic and i believe as many of you might agree the chance based binary effect you're either jammed or not is not in line with other forms of ewar. therefore i came up with another way to normalize ecm. in case the whole idea's been mentioned before, i apologize in advance, as i had not heard about it.for an explanation and further discussion, i will use the following stats as currently on tq:pda rigged falcon with a multi jammer t2: 8,967 ~ 9pda rigged falcon with a racial jammer t2: 13,450 ~ 13,5ec-300 hornet: 1ec-900 wasp: 2nonbonused racial jammer t2: 4,5average interceptor sensor strength 10,4, max targets 4average recon sensor strength 27,5, average max targets 8average hac sensor strength 15, avreage max targets 6average battlecruiser sensor strength 17,8, max targets 7average battleship sensor strength 21,3, max targets 7average carrier sensor strength 74, max targets 6the idea is to compare an ecm module jam strength to the target ship's sensor strength, multiply the ratio with max targets of the ship and subtract the result from it's max locked targets. for example, if you fly a falcon and activate one radar t2 jammer on an armageddon 17 sensor strength, 7 max locked targets, it would subtract 5 or 5,558 rounded down targets from his max locked count. therefore the armageddon would only be able to lock 2 targets.[current max locked targets] = round up  [max locked targets] 1 - [ecm module jam strength] / [ship sensor strength] using more than one ecm module on a ship should of course be subject to some diminishing returns. the reduction in jammer strength in falloff still applies. the example with falcon and geddon is the top limit of the module's effectiveness bar for eos boosting. a nonbonused racial jammer would only remove 1 target from the armageddon and a flight of ec-300 drones without diminishing returns 2 targets.if this change would go through without any adjusting of ship and module stats, the following scenarios could happen:- only a flight of ec-900 wasps would remove all 4 targets from a claw, though not from the malediction.- a falcon could in an ideal situation remove 6 ruptures from combat using 6 racial jammers.- an eccm module would permit each of those ruptures to remain lock on 3 ships.- a rifter with an eccm module and one racial jammer on him still retains 1 lock.- etc.pros:- ecm mechanic no longer chance/luck based - no lucky breaks, no lucky permajams- extra use for automated targeting systems high slot module providing extra possible target locks thus reviving a seldom used modulecons:- can't think of any if the system was fine tuneddiscuss and support if you like the idea.p.s.: inb4 people saying falcons ruined mah game - nevah happened!"
"as some of you are aware there are changes coming to the war declaration mechanic.i want to relay my thoughts before everything is set in stone so there are more chances any good bits would be included.current proposed mechanic has few flaws:- promotes alts within corporations as new wardec shield- makes bigger corps/alliances more safe from wardecing compared to the medium\small ones.here is my counter proposalkeep the pricing system same base+increment but increment the price of war declaration not by the players of target corp/alliance, but players of the offensive corp/alliancewhat would that do:- completely negates the possibility of alt-shield- makes aggressive corps strive for smaller more efficient member lists off-corp logistics has to be tackled separately - logical want bigger revenue - use less people- makes target corporations more even in terms of safety if they have more members - more chances to get attacked but more chances that they would retaliate/recruit defenders as well- same process could be applied to new \"defender\" declarations - so you cant just easily get 1k player strong alliance to defend you for cheap. more defenders = more money to pay.if you have some other ideas, or want to change\elaborate mine - please post here."
"or the current system, being in a giant alliance is a red flag for never ending wardecks by greifers at the jita 4 undock.i think new system is good, you pay proportionally to how many targets you want. they should keep track of active subs and trials and not count them, but beyond that, no issue of having a real cost to making wars, thats not pocket change.furthermore, pvp, get out of highsec seriously."
"true large alliances get war-decced often but if they wish for it they can always retaliate. i've seen in happen.with new system large alliances could easily hire defenders and i foresee specialized corps and alliances emerging to fill up that nichewhile medium and small corps would get hit much more often now with this system, even to the point where there might be a possibility of declaring wars on 10-20 pilot corps en masse and waiting for them at same jita 4-4. these pilots usually would not posses knowledge, ability, and resources to defend themselves unlike larger alliances.and yes pvp, yes in highsec - this is the entire intended purpose of war declarations. one would not fix wardeccing by saying \"get out of highsec\" is not a solution it is abandonment of the problem."
"tl;dr: you point out minor issues in their proposal, yet your own proposal repeats them, makes them worse and creates new ones, but you conveniently ignore all that. ccp has given this more thought and their proposal is better.i'm not convinced your proposal is better than what ccp has in mind. yes it promotes the use of alts, but the cost rises about 500k per character on a fully paid active account. this can be used to ramp up the cost, but it is in no way a decshield. this can also seen as a good thing, since you have incentive to get rid of the huge number of one man corps and create larger, more fuctional corps as a response. this is a good thing for the game and the players.it also doesn't make large entities more safe. the reason being the cost increase per member isn't huge and cost also increase with your wardec count. this balances it out, since a large entity has to dec a lot of small corps in order to get equivalent funzis out of the system and the cost increases with the number of wardecs you have while the cost/character is the same. in a system like this it's a bad option to dec every random small corp you come accross. point being your issues with the new proposal are insignificant at best and they also have good side benefits.your counter proposal also has the same weaknesses as the ccp proposal, but in a different, worse form. since the cost is determined by the number of people in the attacking corp, it makes manipulation of the price very easy in favor of the attacker. all you need is a 1 person corp deccing people, have people transfer to it after the bill is payed and keep on the war at minimum cost to the attacker. it's a system with another loophole that allows bypassing the intent and balancing in the system. this is bad in general and is the reason we needed a fix in the first place. there is no point intentionally bringing them back, especially to fix trivial issues in the proposed system.as for the benefits you mention. alt-shield: it doesn't work in the proposal and consolidates players in larger, more capable organisations. this isn't a bad thing.strive to be smaller: no. it isn't a good goal to begin with and can be bypassed entirely by alt corps.bigger revenue - use less people: as said you can bypass the limitation and same reward for smaller amount of people will bring larger gains in both systems. this is just common sense and can be done in every sytem if the players so choose.equal safety for all corp sizes: they are pretty equal in the new system too. the cost increase per character remains equal and costs still increase with the number of decs you've made. it encourages engaging entities that can offer entertainment for you own entity, which means deccing 20 small corps vs 1 large one is a huge waste of money and offers comparetively very little entertainment for the cost. so smaller corps are cheaper to dec and more vulnerable, but they are very unattractive options to larger entities.defender declarations also increase in cost: is this a good thing? it seems it only creates a needless barrier for the defender and makes mercenary contracts prohibitavely expensive to use for the smaller corps. basicly meaning they are in an unequal position, since they can't afford to hire help from any large entity. in the ccp system they can freely negotiate with any merc they choose and they provide help according to the contract. in your system this would be hard, since you'd have to pay for the cost of 1k man ally, even when the agreement is sending a few ships to hep defend against an aggressor. this would create a heavy and damaging cost barrier, that would punish small entities and cripple the mercenary contract system. ccp's system is simply better."
"retaliation, meaning they haul a bunch of members to highsec, so the jita gankers dock until they are effectively board, and move back. realizing this, its not even worth responding being that the people looking for a fight, are not really doing it, if they were they would, you know attack them in 0.0. how do you retaliate when someone isn't relay waging a real war which if they did they would attack your stuff and not camp a npc market but just greifing for easy kills among people moving stuff in highsec atm who didn't check the wardeck. whos main money making and supplying chars are far away from the war. if a empire war corp wages war on 10-20 pilot corps en mass they would pay about the same, if not more for a large alliance allot of effort for people who might jump corps being that in addition to scaling with number new system it would also scale on top of that with multiple war decks going on at same time.also the scaling issue isn't a absolute deterrent like multiple war decks scaling exponentially, it just makes it so for equivalent number of chars you have to pay for access to them concord looking the other way more. small corps can bring all alts in the same corp 3 per account max just as much as larger alliances. if its 20 mil per corp, and 500k per char. you pay nearly the same for access to the same number of chars, maybe even moreso a bit of a bulk discount where the cost for waging wars against larger corps is closer to 500k per member being that the main cost would be adding up all of the chars in the corp/alliance, if it is a smaller one 4 accounts 12 chars you would pay 2 million per char, or nearly four times, more money for less targets that will be a needle in a haystack to find and add to that, targets less juicy than wealthy ones in larger corps.ccp is fixing the game, i say don't stop the music."
"signed!i agree, i thought it would be a half way between pve and pvp, an attempt to get people to fleet up and work together.but its not, its nothing like pvp fleets, its utterly predictable, its completely risk free and it can be multiboxed & botted. its wow raids in space and it gives out to much money for no risk."
"loltrollyea concord can instapop tech 2 and faction players any part in space that they shot eachother, but never touch those rats seen in regular missions. by that logic should highsec missions be abolished while everyone just watches god concord npcs one shot wave after wave of invading npc rats before players ever get a chance to get a bounty. the bounty money concord should get just like any player, is used to get more concord ships, concord should be controlled by a sentient ai that desires to take over the universe, and secure all important resources for itself to maintain security and universal peace.concord will be the game."
"bring back the juggernaut torpedo, the old names were so much better"
"i have been playing since 2004, and i was very comfortable with the old names. i was attracted to eve because it was mind-numbingly complex. in 2004, playing eve was like being invited to speak at a mensa meeting, you knew you were the best of the best and you played the elite game that others ran screaming from.so yes, i miss the old names, and i shudder to think of the lesser classes getting into eve. dumbing-down eve is a loss to every player who struggled, and succeeded at playing the best game in the world.now, any dumbass can pick it up in a few months! and no more learning skills? no more six-months of struggling to gain access to a ship worthy of a level four mission? i still do not think there is any better game in the world than eve, but the gap has been narrowed. instead of being head and shoulders above the second-best game in the world, eve is now but a few hairs best. how long will it be before eve is passe?still playing, after all these years... aramis rosicrux"

"even when spider tanking bs was \"in\" only armor bs had the option as shield transporters were and still are too expensive to fit."
"the only viable shield fleets of nowadays employ skirmish setups and this limits the variety of ships you can bring to such fleets. it's either minmatar variants or gtfo. where is the torp raven? i can't remember when last time i saw any shield bs fleets around. armor has always been the favorable tanking style for brawling when using battleships and above. this is also noticeable in heavy assault ship gangs. any smart person nowadays is gunning for armor caps mostly because shield caps are pretty much sub par to their armor counterparts in every way that matters. why should i use use a chimera when it's cap, tank and logistic ability are all sub par to that of its direct armor counterpart? it's too much of a setback imo and numbers don't lie; they would be a balance in usage if these things were properly balanced in the first place.p.s. the main reason armor reppers activate at the end of the cycle is because of the order of the various parts that make up a ship shield before armor and not a setback in anyway."
"ok, thanks for feedback!yes, i want to make it easier for small corps to compete with the larger ones in primarily lowsec space. lowsec is very scarcely inhabited today, and thats because the incitements for small corps/single players going there are not present risk/reward and logistics. i have flown for close to a year in a few-man/single-man corp using cloaky blockade runners running poses for t2 production. i have had absolutely no problems jumping through gatecamps with pesky pirates, avoiding those beautiful disco-ships in rancer on the gates, avoiding wartargets waiting in highsec etc. its that easy today allready! also its very very boring and time-consuming. i dont mind risks, not at all - beeing a small-corp industrialist in lowsec is risky! posses do burn from time to time ;- so a suggestion for something that would balance the risk/reward would be welcome i.e. reward beeing less time-consuming having to jump those 23 jumps to jita 11 times in one day to fill up your posses fuel bays....concerning safety - a \"jump hauler\" can be shot in highsec if wardecced, i dont think they should be cloakys. also it would have to use a cyno to jump to so thats another place you're vulnerable. going back to highsec means jumping to a lowsec system, and flying to the nearest jumpgate. finally, the cargo hold would not be that big, meaning many more jumps and increased risk/opportunities for gankers/pirates etc. on top of that, if you want to get to a small corp in lowsec - just fly in your dreads and kill the pos! nevermind the haulers!also, using a black-ops would require 3 toons, right? one for the cyno, one for the black ops making the bridge and one for the blockaderunner. now, i'm talking about small corps! having 3 accounts or even 3 players online at the same time - then you are a medium size corp in eve ;-"
"your definition of small corp/medium corp/large corp is a bit of a error.small in my eyes would be 5-10 people.as about half of them are alts.maybe 20....25 perhaps?medium would be 40 to 50.large is hundreds....a black ops fleet to move cargo does require 3 people minimum.but that is the point....your asking for something that means solo-able lets be honest here....because thats what your really asking for.your not going to get that.now as far as my suggestion....its quite good..and potentially fun.anything with a covert ops cloak can do this...you can jump from high sec....and transport goods...if you happen to cross null sec you'll get stealth bombers in the mix and its really fun.i realize what your shooting for...but in all honesty your removing the risk from the equaition with your idea.jf's have it easy....throw away cyno toons and a little bit of timing with scouts and multi-billiong isk ships get off scott free.================ stop the evemail<U+FFFD>spam!"

"i have a request for cloaky ships. im pretty sure im not the only one who has these problems.1. can we have a proximity alarm for when you delcoak so you know whats up? its hard wif you have different overview sorting to keep tabs on the closest target. nearly impossible to see in time.this is necessary because you begin to decloak long before your ship model is visible to you. by the time you can see you are decloaking..youre dead. its happened to me countless times. i cant have everything on overview all the time so there may be a can or some crap that im next to, and i cant see it.so..if you are cloaked and some object gets within 5k of you, start sounding it. 2. can you make the cloak activated module look a bit different? its so faded green and you cant see it all the time, on green background...its bad. and lots of other ones too. make it all flash green not just the outline. and if it turns off, have it red please.thanksps ...and all you hardcore players who \"well you need 8 eyes and 9 hands, so better get used to it...\" shove it. :"
"no, im afraid i dont agree, the cloak is a powerful tool and needs to have drawbacks. tbh more drawbacks than it currently has since it doesnt really have an in game counter yet anyway."
"overview management. i have a cloak tab that shows everything and is sorted by distance. i'm not surprised by something getting too close to me."
"simple: the titan should not be a combat shipthere is just no way to balance it otherwise, without making it either overpowered or obsolete.it should be a mobile station, full docking and logging off at location, corp asset like a pos, titan bridge, station services and both the old and the new doomsday weapons both very ice-expensive to use so emergency-onlybig alliances will use it as a front-line command post for reshipping and logistics. small alliances will use it as a their mobile hq keeping away from the front-lines.operation write down all the things!!! check out the list at"
"i disagree.expense should not be used for balancing, on a ship that costs as much as a titan. even if you made a single doomsday cost a bil to fire, it would still get fired at every single cap ship it faced. plus, you would have people taking advantage of the cargo space you had to include for that bil worth of fuel."
"since you don't make any valid arguments i'll just disagree with you disagreeing.as for the doomsday... yeah this is just because i think as a mobile station it deserves a good last line of defense, anti-cap and anti-support. and on a timer to make so there's a good risk of getting caught with your pants down if used willy-nilly.though the biggest factor limiting projection of power is always operational cost. when big enough and people will just start weighing cost vs benefit. if the cost is too high to be used just to gank some carrier, but low enough to be acceptable to be fired to prevent losing a station with possibly tens of billions of stored stuff from corpmates, then it should be balanced. the reason why this didn't work before was because there was practically no cost for firing the old doomsday. nor could you run out of bullets.the point is, when you have people storing their stuff in it and logging off at it it will be way less likely to be used as an offensive front-line ship anyway.as for the cargo abuse... a station should have insane cargo-space. and tt's not like there's no easy solution to your posed problem, just turn all the ice into a doomsday bullet first before it can be used.operation write down all the things!!! check out the list at"
"this tobiaz guy seems to have a brain on him.whether or not you win the game matters not. it's if you bought it."
"you didnt provide a reason why you believe that titans cant be balanced as a combat ship, so i didnt feel inclined to provide a reason why i disagreed with you.maybe, it would reduce the amount of titan hot drops specifically to dd something, but alliances will shell out the money to fire the dd's on fleet operations no matter the cost, so your idea is really only going to nerf them in a solo setting anyway. it might make pl add a titan ammo fee to their contracts tho. true, you can easily get around the first problem that came to mind, but i really didnt feel like putting much effort into it when you didnt bother to explain why you dont believe that titans can be balanced as combat ships in the first place."

"it was a missile platform originally, but since the theme was \"cheap'ish sniper\" the only alternative was cruise which are quite frankly horrid hence the change to guns.at any rate, you should train guns regardless as most of the skills cover all systems and they are pretty much superior to missiles in the vast majority of cases."
"nice job just listing off arbitrary bonuses rather than looking at what the ships are actually meant to do.tier 3 bcs are meant for mid-long ranges, and specifically sniping. to do this, they need guns. caldari have hybrids as their alternative weapon system, and the naga is a great railgun platform - so this works quite nicely.a missile naga on the other hand is ******* worthless, and if you tried to bring one along to my tier 3 gang i'd take a good amount of time to laugh at you before kicking you out of the fleet and telling you to fit up a proper ship.yes, yes there is, and it works completely differently to the naga despite the shared weapon systems.the naga has a nich<U+FFFD> that the talos cannot fill anywhere near as effectively. notice how it does this without using missiles, and now punch yourself in the face and learn to play.and just because i can, i'm going to point out a few flaws in your list of missile boats.condorheron - is a probing ship, the fact it has a missile bonus is purely incidental.kestrelcrowmanticore - is a stealth bomber. all the stealth bombers have missiles, regardless of race. i don't see many threads from minmatar whining about how their hounds can't fit artillery, do you?hawkflycatcher - is a dictor, and the fact it's missile bonused makes no difference whatsoever to its role.caracalcerberusonyx - is a hictor, and the fact it's missile bonused makes no difference whatsoever to its role.rooktengu - nice to see you listed this under both categories, missing the irony that if the naga were made into dual missiles/hybrids, the missile variant would be worthless much like the hybrid tengu is.drakenighthawkravengolemwidow - is an ecm/jump bridge monkey, the fact it's missile bonused makes no difference whatsoever to its role.naga - the fact it's hybrid bonused means it can perform its role on par with the other tier 3s.yeah, once cruises and long range missiles in general get their fix, the idea of a missile naga might be worth considering, but i don't see the point personally.also iirc, the first iteration of the naga was dual-bonused to hybrids and missiles, but the missile variant sucked balls."
"my words missiles do not miss and do not need to level 3ters of missiles for 2t missiles bsganks theman = gangster man :p"
"yes, i realize that the missile version would be useless in a gang/fleet, unless you were shooting structures with torps... i would like to have both options available.heron/manticore - i agree, i only included them to avoid the omg you missed something posts.flycatcher/onyx - they do happen to be dictors, but i also believe that they need to fix dictors so they can be used with the weapon systems they have bonuses for.tengu - yep, they need to fix the hybrid tengu as well.widow - yep, they need to fix black ops too.even if you remove the heron, manticore, and widow, my previous analysis stands unchanged.edit: i could also point out that the falcon and vulture only happen to have hybrid bonuses as well, one is an ecm boat, the other a fleet boosting ship. i included them anyway."

"with the recent uproar over the alliance panel's drunken escapades this year at fanfest, i feel this is an opportune time to address the issue of in-game conduct and it's businesspersonally, i found much of the panel painful in a train-wrecky way, mostly with test's leader's presentation. to be perfectly honest, i glazed right over mitten's comments about the mackinaw miner, and didn't think much of it. if you've been on the internet a while, this kind of language is common and strewn throughout the great web; and anyone with an ounce of sense can see it for what it is -- childish, thoughtless literally, without malicious undertone 'insults' constructed by those who cannot, or will not, apply more than a few braincells to it's buildingi will be frank with my bias -- i am a member of a cfc alliance, and i happen to like mittens. now that that's out of the way, that kind of language is to be expected within eve online. it's just the nature of online gaming, and anyone with more than a few hours of experience playing online knows this. the internet is full of these kind of folk, and i'd venture to say that many of them don't, in their heart of hearts, mean anything of what they saywhile the whole 'kill yourself' thing is considered by many jurisdictions as cyber bullying, many of you know just how dangerous that line of thinking really is. there is a line that continues to blur every day regarding what is cyber bullying. the very name of it belies it's existence as a construct of those who just can't let something go. they whine about words posted at their username, take it seriously, post youtube videos about it complaining about how much it hurt them, and about how it's sent them into a spiraling depressionthese things never used to be an issue, and to borrow a phrase from modern gaming, the internet, unfortunately, has been casualized. it is now the casual user that everyone must cater for, censor for, and coddle. this is abhorrent to me, especially within eve's context. the internet, this vast network of not only linked machines, but linked people, is easily the most important thing humanity has ever created. we are able to share literally everything and anything. a vital part of this is bigotry, stupidity, and their ilkwe must know these things, see them, and attempt to understand them if we are ever to hope to remove them completely. without knowledge, through censorship of this kind of madness, we bury our heads in the sand and pretend they don't exist. growing up, as i am sure many of eve's playerbase had, i was 'bullied', made fun of, and occassionally assaulted. what did i do about these things? i learned how to deal with them and i became a better person as a result. i know how to deal with these kind of people, and how to communicate with them. humans are mean, vicious creatures, but such labels are so heavily contextually based and subjective that there's no way to draw a clear line in the sand and sa--------------------------------------------<---do not cross this. it is indecent and offensiveccp has created a sandbox; in my opinion, the most sophisticated of the bunch. we are allowed to control our own space, our own internet spaceship destinies. we came for fun, we stayed for the serious bidness. that said, the very character of the sandbox is at stake when political correctness gets involved.that said, and wall of text aside, there needs to be an addendum to the current, or a completely separate tos acknowledging the bigotry, the greasy, and the extremely harsh nature of eve. not to quell it, not to condone it, but to make sure that when someone gets involved, they aren't going to cry about it later and ruin this great experiment of eve. it is a fundamental human right to speak one's mind, regardless of what that speech is. i hate to say it, but the vast majority of those who cry foul at things that offend them, especially when things aren't going their way, need to 'harden the **** up' and dealwithiti refuse to let people who cannot disconnect themselves from the internet ruin this sandboxi refuse to make this game so serious that we're worried about what we say or doi refuse to condone any action that would somehow distort humanities true colours, because in doing so, you refuse parts of yourselfi simply refuse to do these things; and i would hope that the csm, and their chairman, would see it the same way, regardless of what they've said, done, or feel on the matter."
"came expecting ganking tears, left oddly satisfied... i salute you sir."
"and here i was thikning this was yet an another rant about mittens remarks.seems like hes echoing my thoughts.that being...the lines between greifing and verbal assaults/remarks are starting to blur a little to much.just how far is too far is the question being asked....supported.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"wall of text aside, i agree. it may not have been the nicest thing to say, but people need to go back to the old adage \"sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me\". words only have as much power over us as we choose to let them."
"i think the line needs to be between words and actions. if the goons has followed through and the player actually received hundreds or thousands of mails suggesting he end his life, something would definitely need to be done. even if the player doesn't take that seriously, coordinated harassment isn't allowed in real life and isn't something ccp should allow to happen to paying customers.so a kid was mining one day, got ganked, and in a fit of rage and frustration let all his real-life drama spill over into the game world and said something about offing himself in a letter to mittens or some other goon who forwarded it. mittens shared that and everyone had a good laugh. so far, no harm is done. but *if* that kid had found himself suddenly under a barrage of stupidity...that's different. that's threatening ccp's bottom line. the more of that he gets, the more likely he is to quit eve, possibly taking friends with him and certainly telling everyone he knows that the community is terrible. we need to be above that sort of behavior.remember guys, ccp is running a business. it's in their interest to protect their subscribers. mittens endangered their subscription rate with his behavior, and that's something they have to consider. nevermind the morality of it, eve has never been big on morality."
"take it further....in this country....failing to report a suicide threat could land you in a boat load of trouble.such things should be reported to local law enforcement...and when the law gets invovled...i don't care if your in iceland or not...its gonna come down on ccp like a ton of bricks.ccp takes actions as a result..they yank the guy off eve...call the police department based on his billing information and treat each and every so called threat of suicide/murder/other....as real as it gets.i'm hesitant to get any credence ot the mittens thing...but as i said...the line is blurring a little too easily these days.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"well said and very relevant to alot of situations we see in eve. there should be a definitive line that you do not cross."
"if one thing has come out of this, is that mitanni has managed to bring the game into disrepute in the media, and in doing so has painted eve players as being, nothing more than bullies and drunken fools, as long as he was doing this with just his buddies that was fine, nobody really cares that much about goonswarm anyway, but as a 'vocal' representative of eve... epic fail. and bad publicity, is bad publicity."
"reducing target locked down to one does close to nothing, if they all have one target they can target and blow you up.one target is usually all i target anyway unless queing up stuff."
"ok i like the idea of making ecm effect your max locked targets but i think your formula needs a bit of tweaking. mainly because if you can't jam someone out under any circumstances it's kind of useless to fit ecm if you are flying solo, or even in a large fleet because fcs usually just call one primary after another.the way i'd do it........first tie max locked targets to your sensor strength. max locked targets = round up sensor strength - ecm so right now a hurricane has 6 max locked targets so give it a ladar sensor strength of 6.eccm gives you sensor strength which in turn raises your max locked targets. this gives eccm an extra purpose other than \"in case you get falconned bro\" this puts it in line with sensor boosters and tracking enhancers which have uses on their own.also the amount of ships someone will have locked up is more often than not skill limited anyway so at most you're going to have 15 dudes locked if you are really pro... and use up all your mid slots on eccm.get rid of the automated targeting system or just lump it in with eccm.now all you have to do is calibrate the ecm module strength based on the max locked targets of most ships. so to perma jam a hurricane with no eccm on it you'd need a total ladar ecm strength of 6.then i'd also suggest giving ecm a short optimal range and a large falloff. that way you can tactically counter ecm by burning out a bit until you can lock someone up. so if you are a decent pilot you can still fight through the jamming, same as other ewar. fighting against sensor dampeners you just need to get in close and stay there long enough to lock on. to fight against tracking disrupters you need to pull a good orbit on someone, or sit still and take a steady shot.also if the tactical counter to dampeners is getting close enough to lock and the counter to new and improved ecm is to get in close then you'd see falcons and arazus pairing up and having to work together.also you could have this odd dynamic where your max locked targets is based on your total sensor strength so a hurricane with it's natural ladar of 6 and maybe some gravometric eccm fitted for an extra 2 points would lock 8 targets, but to jam it out you'd need to hit it with a bit of multispectral jamming in addition to just hitting it with ladar.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"i suppose it would be even better if ecm jam strength was buffed up, optimal severely reduced and falloff increased, along the lines wolodymyr suggested. you could effectively permajam a hull with a weaker sensor strength, even in an unbonused ship using some ecm modules, you'd just need to get really close 1000m or smth?.therefore it wouldn't be as unviable to bring an ecm module and ec drones to a, say, blaster ship, though it wouldn't be as good on kiting ships and snipers.i don't however think that making sensor strength = max locked targets would be a good idea. an archon with it's 72 sensor strength and 6 locked targets can hardly be compared to a zealot with 13 sensor strength and same 6 locked targets.in response to sephiroth cloneiiv:if you'd manage to jam your target down to 1 locked targets it means one of the following: you're flying a bonused ecm ship and have several ecm modules. thus you can afford to allocate another ecm module on him. even a wrong racial one could push him down to 0 max locked targets, much in the same manner as is done now - you put 1 jammer on a target, if it doesn't jam him, use another and another etc. the other option is, you're flying a nonbonused ship to ecm and only have a module or two. in that case yours is not an ewar role, the ecm module you have is to inconvenient the target, just as you don't expect to win a fight by adding 1 nonbonused td or damp rare exceptions with bombers or frigs, but then with the above range fix, similar exceptions could apply for ecm. if more pilots in your gang used that 1 unbonused ewar mod, then they would make a bigger difference, again making it possible to push target's max locked targets to 0."
"and the first of these targets would be the falcon, which then dies in seconds. oh wait, not really: there would be no reason to kill the falcon, because it's completely useless now.stupid idea.operation write down all the things!!! check out the list at"
"how about if we change the ecm around - instead of ecm being something you use on an enemy - ecm is a module you use on a friend/enemy which makes it harder/impossible to target them.this could be used to counter primarying, as an alternative and also counter to spider-tanking, and as you can't currently target yourself, it would not be effective solo."
"you didn't read his proposal at all. you would still be able to reduce a target to 0 locked targets, it will just be more consistent and not based on chance. contributer to eve is easy:"
"yeah my idea does kind of fall apart at the capitol level. unless you just want to bite the bullet and let big ships have a ridiculous amount of max locked targets.whatever we end up doing with ecm there are a few things that need to happen.1. you need to be able to jam someone out all the way otherwise ecm becomes useless if someone can still lock up 1 dude no matter how much ecm is on them. changing your formula from round up to round down would do that. or maybe something like...[current max locked targets] = round down  [max locked targets] x [ship sensor strength] - [ecm module jam strength] / [ship sensor strength]so if you hit your armageddon that has 17 sensor strength with 18 points of jamming you'd get  7 x  17 - 18 / 17  = -0.41 which is less than 0 max locked targets so they get jammed out.2. eccm modules need to do something outside of preventing jamming to bring them in line with other ewar protection sensor boosters, tracking enhancers. although by this logic warp core stabilizers and inertia stabilizers need to do something by themselves too.3. there needs to be a way to fight through the jams other than just fitting some module. the low optimal and large falloff should do this just fine.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"it had been confirmed in a video interview that yes, drone rats are moving to bounties and that ccp think mining is not a viable profession in it's current state.thank you ccp"
"a random internet commenter had a good idea.there is a better way for factional warfare to flip sov/ownership: turn the current static bunkers into nullsec-style outposts, dockable only by the owning militia. no need to lock off already-existing stations. no getting alts involved. allow this outpost to give certain benefits to owning militia; tax-free production, free repairs and clones, etc. systems turned by putting this outpost into reinforced, and popping it 24 hours later. give it sentry guns to impede enemy camping. make it a tactically important little piece of floating property. if your stuff is inside when the system turns, fight for it back, or jump into a clone inside. give it cloning facilities, with the new owner able to revoke clone contracts.this is a simple, easy way to tackle factional warfare."
"+1great idea! i would add that in system stations should not allow enemy to be able to dock."
"sorry that is way too elegant of a solution. wasn't the proposal meant to avoid that? it defuses the outrage currently in progress around the proposed lockouts."
"yeah, actually."
"did the op watch the fw presentation from fanfest?"
"yes, the french dev was talking about ihubs which i am intimately familiar with when it comes 0.0 dominion sov warfare. the problem with ihubs is that the lowsec stations will be flipped as soon as the ihub is down. this adds a dockable structure, supplemental to the ihub. you must shoot the ihub, it goes into reinforce, give militia time to repair it, if they can't repair it, after the reinforcement timer is up, you can kill the timer. then you can incapacitate the militia outpost, it goes into reinforce, militia can rep it. if they can't rep it, then after the timer is up, the other militia can drop their ihub and claim it."
"i hope that they do remove the mwd and replace it with this. although, really, why the name change? microwarp drive ... you know ... for micro warps. it should never have been an overgrown afterburner in the first place.whether or not you win the game matters not. it's if you bought it."
"i suppose its to differentiate it from the mwd, to reduce confusion for new players?"
"going by what soundwave said in the eve keynote, the mjd will not replace the mwd, rather it be a new option to mix things up a bit."
"i like ccp's proposal.give me two reasons why a small high-sec group wardecs a large alliance. that's actually a trick question, there's only one: to grief them on the jita 4-4 undock.legitimate war is unaffected for the following reasons: null-sec/low-sec alliances don't use war decs. seriously, that's what neutral/orange/red status is for. just blob up, pew-pew and stay away from the sentries, if applicable. high-sec wars between two independent corps is cheap enough as is. one corp wardeccing a 100-member corp = 50mil extra. dude, that's chump change. you'll spend ten times that amount on ships to get blown up. go run an incursion for two hours and war-dec eve-uni. i bet you'll still walk away with a profit. high-sec alliances who want to pvp... wait, do those even exist outside of eve-uni? fleet up, head to .4 and pew-pew to your heart's content. just watch out for the sentries."

"no.it's called alts.end of discussion.================ stop the evemail<U+FFFD>spam!"
"not true. we had a rather entertaining war with test a while back, and none of the fighting happened in jita that i know of.besides, if a large alliance can't swat a couple of pests harassing them on the jita undock, they aren't as formidable as they pretend to be.well, ours did until someone forgot to pay the alliance bill. rip petition blizzard."
"majority of pvp greifing corps wont war dec larger groups because they want easy prey....but that doesn't mean it never happens.case and point...we get war decs every week..... and we are vastly larger than the bulk who do war dec us.not including cfc and company.not that we give a crap.same applies to high sec....i'm sure your familar with mercenary corps...amirite?================ stop the evemail<U+FFFD>spam!"
"my original post was largely hyperbolic in composition. i'll attest to the fact that legitimate wars can be waged between a corp and alliance, but i will also point out that in terms of my experience, i've never seen a corp-on-alliance war dec that resulted in actual fighting. it was pretty much a bribe to concord to let them shoot that shiny jump freighter that passes by every week or twothat would involve movement of ships and players to the jita undock, which frankly isn't worth it when the most likely result is the griefers docking up and playing station games all dayalso, i've yet to see a logistics run that is an alliance-wide op. most of the time it's individual corporations making the runs, which makes them easy pray for griefersin lieu of flowers, send isk"

"this and other threads on similar topics continue to miss the key economic point -- ccp has revenue issues and has to take action to address them.every hard core gamer who gets into this game ends up, within six months or less, being able to pay for his gaming by buying plex ingame with isk. it's dog dirt simple, in fact -- you only need to make 20m a day and that can be done in an hour's play if you're ruthless enough, even if your 'toon is only one month old.it follows that ccp makes all their rl money from a those players who don't play enough to make 500m isk a month, plus b new players that haven't figured it out yet, and c new audiences such as dust 514 first person shooter gamers, and d people who prefer to pay 15 euro a month in order to put the isk into their ships and toys, plus e vanity players who buy plex for cash so they can have those shiny mods long before they can make the 500 million isk they cost.war deccing for griefing presents a problem to ccp -- players in groups a, b, and e get turned off and quit the game. but, ccp needs the revenue they represent, so the war dec mechanics have to be tweaked to let these [for now, they might change] carebears play the way they want to.go ahead, look up my 'toon ingame -- you'll see that i'm old enough to grief any newb any time anywhere i want to -- and there's nothing the newb can do about my enormous advantage in skills and ships except either hide, quit eve, or band very tightly together with other players and do nothing anywhere without friends in at least the same system. nothing.ccp can not afford to let new players who get enticed into eve quit in large proportions within 90 days or even six months. they need the revenue.ergo, high sec griefing must be limited.it rather follows that the ally system to combat war decs is going to be retained and some griefer corps are going to discover that they've bitten off quite a lot more than they can chew.***nonetheless, ccp must also address the mechanics of neut alt reppers and station games, including 'bumping' ships with neuts.***i'm ambivalent about the target size/cost issues ... and ccp has to make a decision here that keeps newer players in the game and paying. it's that simple."

"thank you all for continuing the discussion while i was gonedestination skillqueue:yes what you have pointed out are valid points, but i think ccp can fix them as well. for example if corporation has declared wars charge the newly joined members the proper increment fee at full amount. this would prevent players bypassing the charges and make more stable corporations. no more 1 today 100 tomorrow corpsi have played eve for 6 years with this character and 8 years total. i have been in corporations that are filled with alts before. it is a sorry existence - being in a 600+ man corporation with 10+ - 15+ online all the time and corp chat devoid of life. that is not something i would wish forabout equality - actually with base cost present the cost per capita decreases the amount of isk paid per person, but the difference is negligible. now it would be simply unprofitable to target large alliances with war declaration since no matter how much spoils you obtain the amount of isk spent on war declaration would overwhelm itwhat you have said about prohibitive cost of larger defender corps is true but they also could potentially strive for smaller corps that consists of only pure active pilots w/o alt junk. it would also possible to have defender corporations that specialize in specific timezonesephiroth cloneiivnow they would potentially retaliate by simply hiring the defenders. and let the griefers and defenders wage war at jita 4-viciouscyclewhat ccp wants is to have plex at low enough isk pricereason being ccp wants more people to buy plex - atm we do not have the shortage of plex at our hands. main problem right now it the isk influx into the game - there is no good isk sinks atm in the gameand do not forget - you are talking about hardcore gamers - no everyone in eve is like that - there are some out there who have year old chars and perfectly fine paying rl money for the game. it all depends on how much you earn in rl if you can easily earn 15$ than 480mill isk then i think you might as well just pay for eve. or even 9$ if you have yearly subscriptionthis is an eve online - place where scamming is allowed - i think griefing is viable tactic as well. i dont want carebear online anytime soon. besides i personally flown industrials in high sec while beild warde"

"first off, the hulk is an exhumer. not a mining barge.but yes, they are too easy to kill nowadays. yet somehow, i don't think adding more hp to their structure is going to help a lot. sure, they'll be less likely to die in high-sec, but they will still be killed with ease in low-sec, null-sec and wh. how about giving them generally more hp, a bit more pg/cpu and 1 or 2 more mid-slots, so they can survive until their allies arrive in logis and hacs t deal with attackers doesn't help them at all against caps, of course. simply adding more hp won't fix them for when drones lose their compounds and miners will actually be valuable assets to any null-sec alliance. they need a chance to actually tank a bit of damage until someone can come and save them. this might also make it less likely to just send in one or two bcs with lots of dps to destroy the enemy's mining fleets.no, i don't live in null-sec, and i'm not going to say this will fix mining vessels either. but it's more likely to fix them than just giving them more structure hp, since high-sec miners never fit damage control systems on their ships anyway."
"add to that.....the hulk is not a capital ship like the orca...so please do make foolish comparisons.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"technically, the orca isn't a capital ship. it's an industrial command ship, but due to its sheer size and lack of maneuverability, it is classified as a capital ship on the market. as far as i know, it's currently perfectly possible to build orcas in large ship assembly arrays, although the components needed are built at capital ship assembly arrays, if i'm not mistaken. another thing is that orcas can enter high-sec, just like freighters and jump freighters. why? because they're not capitals. they're just really huge sub-capital ships built using capital components."
"an exhumer is a t2 version of a mining barge, lol, but if you want to quiblble then feel free. mining barges should have a stronger structure, i would add another low slot and make the structure 10,000 hit points and that will do it. i have setup a 0.0 mining hulk and they can tank a couple of bs rats quite nicely.i think it will make a big difference and means that people just need to fit a single dc to add to their survival and it makes sense that a mining ship has a very strong structure. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"

"well that was annoying the forum lost all that i just typedlets try again, your logic in terms of the ammo is flawed and has no relationship to large chunks of ore that are uneven and very bulky and of course are not constrained by gravity or special racks fitted to the ship. anyway if you want to think that a hold for ammo is the same as a hold for ore than feel free, but it does not make any sense.i am very interested in the crimewatch proposals at fanfest, because at the moment if you have a covering fleet in high sec you have to ask the ganker to flip a can so you can try to stop him, i wonder how many would do that? and in terms of out of the way places, well i tended to mine in systems well away from low sec. but i have not been in a hulk for over 6 months and even then that was only for a special reason. until a hulk has a hull stronger then a wet paper bag i guess i won't be bothering at all.but i have no issues with hulks being ganked, my issue is that they are so weak in terms of stucture that even a solo catalyst can now kill one and have time to get the pod too. and my concern above anything else is that ccp decide to nerf tier 3 bc's which i do not want to see. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"

"umm it seems that a lot of you cannot see the difference between \"better game-play & interface\" vs \"tactical, overpowered advantages\"....put your thinking cap on andhow does changing the color of the cloaking blinky thing make this overpowered and having a proxy alarm which can be turned off if you wish, be also overpowered? if the proxy alarm goes off you should have maybe 2-3 seconds to react so this unlikely to help you unless you are paying attention and know what you are doing. right now when cloaked you have zero warning that you are being decloaked, which is a major oversight. there is neither a text or a graphical warning , either on the modules or the ship. your ship is targetable but the ship model looks cloaked...i mean wtf. this needs to be fixed. when you decloak, you decloak, you dont make the ship targetable but only lose the cloak 10 seconds later. its purposefully deceitful! hehe. and besides, decloaking by proximity objects is overall just lame the way its set up nowgive me some sort of graphical warning on the ship that its being decloaked...like i dunno, some electrical discharges going across it. what i would do is i would have the following1. when cloak is active the module glows a bright green itself not around it..2. when cloak is being deactivated manually or automatically, make the module glow red for 10 second3. when the cloak breaks because of proximity of objects - have the ship model decloak either instantly or some way that i can see it happening.4. when proxy alarm is tripped have that nice neocon sexy voice say \"danger, unable to maintain cloak due to objects being too close to the ship.all those of you who see this as some sort of new uber cloaking tool, im sorry its not. this addresses the interface, common sense and just plain better and more convenient game-play.i would classify this right there with the following in game warnings1. market buy warning for excessive prices - this shouldnt exist either right2. contract warning for zero price public contract - humm? how about this3. steal warning? - no this is overpowered4. module overheat display makeover - no no no just burn the guns, overhead needs to have huge drawbacks its overpowered already..5. jumping into low sec - nooo!! let the stooopid die6 autopilot being able to dock on its own as it can jump gates on its own but in a way that doesnt actually do everything for you. --- but not, we must jump every jump. docking is overpowered7. warning that \"you failed to jump because you are cloaked\"...no but cloaky overpowered already, let the sob sit at the gate.i trust you get my point....if you dont, then go minethe person saying \"fck sake, cloaky faggots got really huge advantages with cloaking and crying more options for cloak ? lol\" the point of being cloaked is that you have huge advantages, but these advantages are heavily compensated by huge limitations. unlimited cloaking times aside, i do not agree with afk unlimited cloaking ...but meh, its not up to me.i mean really, if anyone suggested that autopilot be able to dock on its own, it would get a hail of opposition from the elitist ignoramuses who have no clue about making a game better because they are unable to see past their own experiences and limitations, which is why they need to stay away from designing games"

"i wouldn't object to audible alarms where there are already text notices. rather than pings or alarms or anything like that, a unique cloak/decloak/failed cloak set of sounds would be fine.i play without audio, so that's still no excuse to do away with the text warnings.i'm pretty well against proximity warnings though. if you can't manage your overview and know how far away things are, then you don't need to be trying to sneak within 10 km of something cloak.i frequently decloak inside of 3 km from targets. the proximity can result in irrational behavior and trips up less prepared pilots. i don't want persistent alarms telling me i'm at risk of being decloaked while i'm scraping past wrecks to get the range i want. i know what i'm doing, and if i *do* get decloaked i'm well aware of the risk. and no, adding a toggle to turn of such alarms is not a good idea, we've got too many toggles already"

"no, it doesnt scream afk. the problem is that you actually decloak long before you are visible. you are targetable long before you are visible. thats what im talking about. try a cloaked ship and get close to an object. your ship will still be cloaked on screen but its actually visible and targetable."
"well there is already a visible warning. see that little green circle with the picture of a cloak in the middle? when it stops being green and changes to red, that's your cue to be somewhere else. of course this is assuming you are not an afk cloaky. if you are, tough. should've been paying attention. as has already been pointed out, this isn't really that much of a problem if you have your overview set up correctly.i do feel that it does give another advantage to the cloaked ship. if you are afk cloaky and you hear a warning, then you will change to that toon to see what's happening, so it's just giving afk cloakers another 'layer' of protection that they really don't need."

"i searched for other bounty hunting posts and didn't find anything that was similar to mine, so i apologize if this has already been proposed, although i doubt it has.the change i suggest is:1 placing bounty on player ships a. the full bounty cannot be collected unless the worth of the ship destroyed is equal to or more than the bounty on the pilot's head. this would mean that if a player has a 100million isk bounty on their head, it can't be collected unless they lose a 100million+ isk costing ship when it happened. thus, if the player with bounty on their head happened to be flying a 50million isk costing ship, the bounty pay-out to the attacking player would be 50million out of the 100million, leaving 50million available for further claim. b. for obvious reasons, self destructing would not claim any bounty prizes. as well as npc destroying a players ship.2 the option to add a bonus \"pod\" bounty, capped at the current cost of the target player's active clone. i've put much thought into this, and i can't really find a reasonable way to exploit this system on paper anyways. i think this would put much more usage and gratification into the bounty system and give players more opportunity to lose ships + make money at the same time."
"also!! let me add: to make bounty hunting a fully used feature and a viable profession, i would also go so far as to make players with bounties on their heads free to attack in highsec. perhaps once their bounty is of a certain value maybe? i.e. bountied player with 10-20million+ bounty can be fired upon without interference from concord."
"haha! thanks, shandir.that is very similar to my idea, although, i would say the linked proposal is a tad more complicated, and still leaves plenty of room for exploitation. i don't think bounty hunting should be viewed as a corp/alliance profession first, solo profession last.in my mind, bounty hunting first means \"a bounty hunter going after a target\" -- hence why my idea has no deliberate \"who is allowed to attack the person i'm putting a bounty on\" dynamic. if a bounty can only be collected when an equal or greater value of ship is destroyed in the process, the person with the bounty on their head simply will not be able to profit. this also means players won't be required to destroy pods to collect, which to me, seems to be one of the current dynamics that turn a lot of people off from bounty hunting, as there are only a small number of ways to go about killing someone's pod quickly as opposed to destroying their ship.bounties will cease to be \"free gifts\" to people that are deserving of someone's revenge. plus, if finely thought out and tuned for longevity, making bountied players somewhat/somehow attackable in high-sec would naturally develop a sort of 'player policed' environment. that's a good thing imo."

"there are more caldari turret bonused ships than there are gallente drone bonused ships.in short: there's more to caldari than farming l4 missions with tengus. the naga is currently a popular and useful pvp ship. with missiles it would be almost useless."
"... umm, what? damage dealing isn't their job. they have only token weapon systems as they do just fine at bubbling/infinipointing. if they were doing decent dps, they'd have to have compromised somewhere on the \"interdictor\" part of their description.what analysis? you threw up a list of ships that are hybrid bonused vs those that have missiles, and then declared that the naga should be missile bonused based on that rather than, oh let me think here... ah yeah, being a good ship.you have no shortage of structure bashers available. including the blaster/rail naga, in fact."
"the only reason you dont see caldari dictors fitting missiles is due to using up all their powergrid on tank modules. i want to be able to fit the weapons systems those ships have bonuses for, while still being able to perform the role adequately. dps doesnt even come into it, i dont really care about the dps, i just want to be able to fit the weapons in the first place.i am not arguing that, all i am saying is that i want to have the option of using torps on the naga."
"wow this thread still going?i think it's safe to assume that the naga won't be getting missiles anytime soon.personally i think the naga is a kickass ship with blasters."
"if it's an onyx - it's really not that hard to fit. if it's a flycatcher - fitting weapons to it is a waste of money anyway.so basically, you want to open up a potential balance nightmare and take up dev time, because you want a different graphic while shooting a structure.yeah, that's an awesome justification."

"frigate fights tend to be very short and very brutal but fights with larger ships do tend to take awhile to come to a conclusion so i am guessing you've been on the wrong end of a gank or two?also, people need to kill fast in eve. the reason for this is that the guy you are shooting and beating has probably got a billion buddies burning to you so it's never really a good idea to hang around especially in low sec.i've always rather enjoyed fights in frigates. it would be boring as hell if you gave everything a million hp and had to spend an hour grinding down a frigate. i think you should learn a bit more about the game before you make proposals that aren't needed or wanted as the sub capital ships are fine for the most part."

"i've said for the past 3-4 years that logistics are a huge issue in game since there's very little about logistical warfare that promotes strategic combat. so i've devised a way to keep the intent of logistics, but boost active tanking, and determine more about fitting decisionsthe 2 big problemscurrently, active tanking has little role in the game. everything in game is buffer with no incentive to fit active tank modules. logistics are odd in their performance as they require no skill for the person receiving the logistics other than a timely requestso how would i change the conceptremove the direct transfer of armor and shields from logistics to receiver. instead, call it a nanobot armor or plasma shield transfer system. here's how it works: in order to utilize logistics i must have an active repair system on my ship. a small armor repairer can receive the equivalent of a small armor transfer amount per module per cycle. obviously, it can have multiple remote repair modules working at once, and each module can transfer more armor. but no one remote armor transfer can send more than what the small repairer can receive. however, my active repairer must actually apply the transfer, meaning a cycle time and application. essentially, the logistics ships/mods boost the performance of my repairer within respect to my ship size. however, i must have the capacitor, and the cycle time to apply the repairthe same works for shield how do you prevent stockpiling logistics repairs on a ship over time? it's always cycle based. so whatever logistics support you got during that cycle, is applied. for armor, it's applied at the end of the cycle, for shields, you always get that initial base boost, then collect plasma during the cycle time to be used on the next boost. why is this better? there are going to be obvious gaps in repairs since it's only your active repairers that apply. no more consistent unbreakable stream of repairs, but rather questions of can you out damage the cycle of repairit also means there are ways to break up logistics networks besides just eccmthe active repairer takes up a slot that would normally be dedicated to buffer tankwhy is this needed? combat over the past few years has devolved quite a bit to very lopsided affairs far to often. fights are skewing so badly that it's frequently true for one side to hardly take any losses 5-10 in a fight where 100s of ships are on either side. it develops a sense of hopelessness when one side can be so logistically strong that you can't break the chain of their ships and fights devolve to: bring more people. the goal is to provide more ways to break up and reduce logistical efficiency, bring back some incentive and reasons to fit active repairers, and reduce the very large buffers a lot of ships fitting. i'm probably going to heavily refine this idea as i think more about it and see reply, but the overall goal is to make combat less about that initial alpha strike to overwhelm a logistics team, and more about tactical decisions and adjustments in real time."
"hey i'm down,an interesting idea, but alas, i'm sorry but i disagree.first off there is the fitting issues. several ships are designed to be used in a fleet. consider for example the abaddon, a ship that isn't meant to fit an active tank, which is why it gets 5% armor resist bonus. then consider say a hyperion which does get an active tank bonus - a ship you rarely see in fleets for exactly that reason. you'd have to change several ships to really make this work.in addition, many fleet ships already have capacitor issues, and by further increasing the reliance on an active tank as well - you will just end up with everyone fitting way more cap drain on their fleet ships and rolling out bhaalghorns.in addition logistics ships can happily be countered by more than just ecm. cap draining is a real issue if done properly, and if they are at range, sensor dampening, as well as shooting them with good switching shot calling.two of the logistics only work while cap shared so removing one causes real issues in a fleet. and ships like scimitar and oneiros can be jammed by non minmitar ecm racials because they don't typically have fitting space and capacitor for eccm. it's not hard to do, and scimitars themselves are easy to kill if you bring the right tools for the job - i.e. long range webbing and assault frigates, which will happily tear them a new one.logistics are already quite time intensive to train properly in themselves - how many people bother to get logistics v?players already have skills that effect logistics - both resistances and buffer are defining factors in how successful logistics ships can be in their role, so pilot fits and skill points truly matter.in terms of a pilot being more active in a repair scenario, how many pilots actually overload their hardeners properly when being shot at? this changes the repair amount significantly, but not all pilots are savvy enough to do it in the heat of battle or in time, let alone use nanite repair paste mid combat successfully. that's quite a bit of micro management right there, when you're also trying to follow shot calling.personally, after flying with rooks and kings, i would suggest that bringing more people is not really the solution, but looking at tactics that will cause confusion and break how the logistics team work. i've seen this happen time and time again. there are also clever ways to overload the broadcast stream if you use dps properly shot calling properly. quite simply logistics pilots can't keep up, but alas, most shot calling is fairly rigid and predictable.i think the real issue here is, tactics. and how they are used in fleets. most fleets are run in a fairly rigid way, which is not how you will break a logistics backed fleet. the trouble isn't in the mechanics of eve, but in how fleets are working as a team to counter them properly.consider the historical differences in infantry tactics between the two great wars. in the first world war, tactics were rigid and inflexible, relying on sheer numbers - exactly as you are suggesting and i guess seeing as a way of 'breaking' the opposition.by the end of that war, tactics had started to change, to small teams of soldiers working in a far more flexible way, the tactics of which were evolved in the second world war, so that it was no longer about sheer numbers, but how small teams worked together.we are still in a situation where fleets are run in exactly that same, inflexible, rigid way. to win against logistics you have to think differently than most eve corps and alliances are currently capable of.i would suggest the solution is in adapting how fleet leadership, organisation and tactics and brought together in fleets, rather than problems with eve itself. it is just a matter of fcs and corps evolving, which is why eve is so brilliant, that it can create this sort of challenge.\"the game is mostly played by men - 97%. but 40% of them play as women... so thats fine.\" - ccp t0rfifrans"

"instead of forcing people to fit otherwise useless niche enough to be mostly true modules to get some love, why not limit the amount of reps a given ship can benefit from?introduce yet another attribute for ships: nanobot adaptability.differentiate it based on hull size obviously, meta level ex. navy hulls may be better at managing incoming nanobots, race and lastly specific hulls. fitting an active unit could then signify that the ship is already prepared to funnel bots through its systems, thus gaining a bonus to said attribute.extra fluff: with a separate attribute like that, individual ships like the myrm and hype for example can be given a truly unique tank potential .. been mantioned a lot that their active bonuses be swapped for incoming rr ditto.no to forcing specific fits, yes to mixing things up."

"wolodymyr: my original example with the geddon and falcon only showed what happened when the latter was to use 1 jammer. if you placed a second jammer on the target, the combined jam strength of the modules on the target would be cumulative although, as stated, subject to some diminishing returns. to illustrate further, if one racial jammer has a strength of 13,5, then two would have for example 24, while adding another would give an even smaller gainkeep in mind, the actual ship and module stats on tq are not designed around my proposed change although if you think about it, the change isn't as drastic as some claim. all i proposed was a redesign of the mechanic and described what might happen with the current set of data. fine tuning the formula, diminishing returns, ship and module stats etc. would of course still be up for tweakingi don't think it would be as urgent to give eccm modules more bonuses. what's broken is in my opinion ecm, not the counter to it, although i do understand your meaningand of course, i totally like your low optimal, high falloff idea."

"good idea, except for one part:it turns fw basically into null-sec style structure bashing, something many fw pilots are really trying to get away from. also the firepower required to efficiently take over a station would attract a guaranteed hotdrop.much better to make the system ownership depend on the fw guys shooting ships of their opponents the one thing they care about the most. i think a more incursion style of crowdsourcing to claim a system would work much better. with fleets competing at sites to claim them like now happens at vanguards, except with fw you can shoot each other as well. and with a 20-30 pilot mom-site at the end to make the final claim.it would also help against blobbing because oversized fleets you would just get no lp for the site like with incursions and oversized ships for the small sites just can't get in.the idea of fw-only stations is brilliant.with tons of benefits to it's stationservices, well defended by npc, and ownership depending on whoever controls the system. if the system flips, the pilots have 24 hours to get their stuff out.operation write down all the things!!! check out the list at"
"it does nothing of the sort. nothing. when you lose an outpost/system in nullsec you are completely ****** and inable to live in that system whatsoever until your blob alliance retakes it, if they ever do. in the proposed system, the owning of the outpost simply gives the owning militia an advantageous position from which to continue the effort of war and death in that system and systems nearby by providing a relatively safe, beneficial location to dock up that the enemy can't touch. it doesn't stop the enemy docking elsewhere in system, basing their ships elsewhere in system, getting repairs or staging from that system, like it would in nullsec; this just gives you a clear, immediate and tangible benefit in the form of free repairs, tax-free market transactions, and free cloning among others, in a station that is harder to camp by turds with instalocking arty tornados, of which i am one. as for the structure-bashing, this already exists and there really isn't any fair way to do it. by giving these \"garrisons\" a reinforcement timer it at the very least allows the defending militia time to prepare a fleet ops. militias love timing fleet ops because often fighting in militia is an irritating quagmire of random people being on at random times. knowing the system will become vulnerable in 12 or 24 hours gives you time to plan accordingly and put together some impressive defense fleets that we currently almost exclusively get during pos attacks which are boring as hell. it also means a system can't be turned in 7-8 hours by a handful of dedicated people with too much time on their hands, which is currently the case. to expand on the idea you can keep the current plexing mechanics of constant plexing causing the system's sov to deteriorate until a certain point is reached in which the owning npc empire begins to pull out of the system after taking too many losses and the garrison outpost goes into a 24-hour timer, after which point the enemy militia may assault and incap it, turning the system. it'd be up to the defending militia as the ~last line of defense~ to stop this from happening. ~the notorious z.v."
"exactly what i want if possible. i think easyer would be as i said in another thread maybe as a first step or try out:- one station for each militia locked for the oponent and neutrals, maybe camped by the occupancy-holders npc officers or station guns"
"the ccp presenter eluded to changing the station makeup in the warzones to accomplish this, which i like. i also like the idea of having the stations that change hands to be militia-only. that would be a tremendous asset to the holding militia and make them a rally point, especially if the station guns shoot all non-militia ships maybe that will be a system upgrade?. if neutrals can dock, both militia and non-militia will exploit it. yes, you run the risk of getting ships trapped in them, but that adds excitement and meaning to the fighting. if they keep enough non-militia npc stations around, it shouldn't have a drastic effect on neutral gameplay. however, i think they should drop two constellations from the caldari side and at least one from the gallente side to reduce the implications on the cluster."
"there seems to be two sides to this, one that wants nullsec-esque consequences, and one that doesn't.the timer mechanics themselves allow for engagements like hotdrops, bubblecages, etc.if you look at the original comment in the op, this is the original guy who presented the idea:ccp's goal was to force egagements, confict, and player vs player interaction. i think zv's idea is fantastic."
"i don't like this idea, because this idea means that anyone can attack the outposts, regardless of whether the attackers are involved in fw. this would only be a loss for fw as one of the problems with fw and low-sec in general, is outside, much larger entities coming in. this disheartens younger players who are in fw to learn pvp.i like the idea of flipping fw sov on systems with points, because it means that people have to be directly involved in fw to make a difference."
"additional to docking rights for the militia stations.. why not."
"this is far too complicated for the general militia population, myself included. it needs to be quite a bit simpler.what i envision being one of the best alternatives is having a capture system that is a merging of the current method, incursions, and nullsec sovereignty: systems are made vulnerable the same way they are now more or less, by plexing. plexing should also give an lp reward. when a system becomes vulnerable, it initiates a vulnerability timer of 12 or 24 hours. when this occurs, an incursion-like process happens; a sovereignty bar is used to show the scales of power in the system, defending npc military \"incursion reinforcement sites\" appear. the attacking militia must run these incursion/reinforcement sites with fleets. every reinforcement site completed tips the sov level of the system in their favour. they should get a good bit of lp for running these sites. that lp should only go to members of the attacking militia, never neutrals. this can be made \"even more interesting\" by having a final big boss battle where a defending npc military carrier jumps in. the defending militia can defend the system by disrupting the fleet ops of the attackers with their own fleet, or even just slowing them down enough that the initial 12-hour vulnerability timer runs out before the attacking militia can run enough reinforcement sites if the attackers are ultimately successful, this triggers another 12-hour timer, at the end of which sovereignty fully switches to their faction. this is to give a bit of flexibility for people to evac their ****. the current \"bunker\" is replaced by a \"garrison\". this is an outpost-like station it can even take the exact same location, literally replacing it. it should have the standard lowsec complement of 2 sentry guns that will shoot enemy militia and pirates, but not neutrals. the outpost will only allow members of the owning militia to dock - no neutrals and especially no wts. this outpost may or may not allow the docking of capital ships. this outpost will provide owning militia with reduced cost/free repair, clone and job services as well as low/no tax market transactions. these services can also be subject to any \"lp donation upgrade\" system. all of this is broadcast in either the militia interface or the journal, or both. also, vulnerability and sov changes should be broadcast in militia channels. this imho provides the most all-round buff to fw. first, \"plexers gonna plex\" -- plexing fanatics can continue their diligent prowling of enemy space in faction frigs circling those stupid little buttons and feeling the self-gratification of making a system contested and vulnerable. second, it gives the defending militia a chance to organize some sort of defense, however it also gives the attacking militia the chance to blitz a system by running those \"reinforcement\" sites full-throttle before the defenders can organize a good counter-ops. but that should take some effort; imho a single basic 20-ish man bs/bc fleet should take 6-8 hours unmolested to run enough sites to turn the system. more fleets = faster, less fleets = slower. third, it gives an incentive to doing this in the first place -- a big lp reward for members of the attacking militia involved. fourth, it gives owning militias a real, tangible and immediate benefit to owning a system in the form of the garrison outpost, an awesome little place to stage fleets, get logistics support and disseminate cheaper market items to your militia. fifth, it provides adequate risk to that reward by possibly locking you out of your stuff should the system fall, but not a total and complete catastrophe like it is in nullsec -- you still have the npc stations in system you can put your stuff in, just without the benefits of a much safer and more beneficial harbour. you won't ever find your little garrison outpost bubbled and the system locked down with hundreds of enemies. get yourself an instawarp and you can more or less safely shuttle any ship out of there -- except capitals, but i'm for not letting them dock there in the first place."
"if fw is to be taken seriously, then when an enemy comes into a system that is owned by a faction, the pilot should not be able to dock in station. it just makes sense. all others, however should be able to.i love the idea of having the hub in addition to the station as it gives a focus for the invaders and something of intrinsic value to take down. it also gives the militia of the system their own station to do with as they please for the duration of their ownership. this makes it a valuable asset to protect. no taxes, manufacturing slots, clone bays, etc... each of these are either added via time of ownership or given all in one go by just taking the system though i prefer earning it via ownership in time increments. if you had to shoot every station in system to own the system then amamake may as well be permanently minmatar as no one in their right mind would want to shoot that many stations, ever.i agree that it is a bit of 0.0 and i don't mean fw to be 0.0 light. there are, however, elements of 0.0 that can and could be implemented in low sec and be made fun.other ideas that could be implemented is that local chat favours the defender in that intelligence tools radar, satellites, gate personnel, etc... can forward information to the fw hub and be distributed to the system defenders. it's not meant to be easy to take a system, but once you have earned it, it should be fun and profitable to hold. these hubs should be free of non-fw personnel as well as defended like a deathstar pos to avoid camping of the exits. anyone that fires on fw personnel within station area get scrammed, webbed and shot at depending on defenses. these defenses perhaps should also be earned over time. hold the system for 60 days and you earn more turrets in minmatar systems or lasers in amarr systems. station can be of jovian design so that it has a bit more cache to hold it.anyways, just a few ideas..."

"i've had an idea along these lines in my head for a long time, but could not find the right words to express it.i think the whole pve system should be more dynamic like what courthouse here is suggesting, so that the eve universe will more like an ecosystem in constant flux and less likely to reach a point of stasis where nothing evolves and meaningful content ceases to emerge."
"i like this idea but... this is going to create a situation that ccp have already taken action to remove. dynamic payouts sounds like an idea that will encorage people to move around but will that actualy happen? or will other factors that goven where players chose to run their missions take precidence putting us back to where we were with agent quality?not so long ago agents all had a quality rating that effected rewards, and most of the highest rating agents where not in high sec, people still stuck where they were safe despite the finantual incentive. so to get people out of high sec is going to require a prity servear profit curve.access to trade hubs to sell salvage and buy supplies, proximity to players established hording stations, and corperate obligations are all factors that goven where people chose to run their missions as well. all of those are going to limit player willingness to follow the profit as well, so even within safe space i think people may just stick to where they are.so if people stubbenly stick to their haunts, as i suspect they will, this will reduce the isk constantly injected into the system but not realy get people mooving so much.as people wont be mooving we will be prity much back to where we were with agent quality though. as ccp already got rid of that are they going to want to bring it back?"
"i had wanted to stay away from posting numbers in the op as i'm not a game designer and people who are smarter at maths than me can do that better, but a decent example would be to use a +/-20% distribution. so, let's say for example that guristas are the #1 most botted popular faction to shoot. they would pay out at 80% of a \"normal\" bounty/mission reward/lp. let's also say that mordu's legion is the least popular option. their stuff would pay out at 120% of \"normal.\"that would mean that mordu's agent was 50% more profitable to run than a caldari navy guristas faction nemesis agent. that would be a pretty significant difference and when you're looking at things that may disincentivise botting, having rats worth a lot less than moving elsewhere, potentially to a place that players can potentially police better than motsu/sobaseki is good for everyone."

"i don't know about you, but i see my cloak module stop running immediately. i've never had to wonder whether i was cloaked or not."
"i do hate afk cloakers... that said:+1 for op...not knowing if you are cloaked or not is a bad feedback from the interface.and that green flashy light well , try to determinate if you are cloaked or hit the cloak button if you are in a 10% tidi system... good luck ...dissonance is recruiting members:"
"if you're warping into a combat situation and you aren't certain of the status of your cloak, you aren't paying close enough attention. you will typically have ten seconds or more of time in warp to make sure your cloak is engaged. if you're blindly stumbling about making assumptions about your ship's operations, you earned your losses.i frequently multibox a pair of cloaky pvp ships. i maneuver them both in close proximity of targets, decloak them, and engage the enemy with very little trouble. i'm still getting the hang of catching two ships on ambush, but that's just going to take experience.a simple voiceover of \"cloaking failed\" used both when a cloak didn't active and when it was forcibly deactivated wouldn't bother me too much. it won't help afk cloakers much mostly because they're ***afk*** but also because they're going to be in a safe spot where the only way cloaking could fail is if someone bumped them. by the time they were able to respond, they'd be dead."
"here's how i would balance the titans.- remove any bonus to xl guns. they can fit them, but they'll do average dps.- keep the logistics clone vats/etc and leadership bonus. this should be the titan's primary role.- have the doomsday consume ammo. not just oxygen - actual ammo that'll take several weeks to research and manufacture.- have diminish returns on doomsday depending on how many titans are in fleet. prevent more than one doomsday per 5 minutes from being fired in the grid.- add drone bandwith to field fighters.a single titan providing logistics and leadership to a cap/sub-cap fleet is great.but too many titans in the same space should hampers their effectiveness. you only need one for leadership."

"primary/secondaryamarr: lasers/missilesminmatar: projectiles/missilesgallente: hybrids/dronescaldari: missiles/hybridsi think this is slightly more accurate."
"it's not that simple. for caldari, missiles and hybrids are far more equal in importance, relative to the two weapon lines of any other race, where there's a clear primary and secondary divisons.with caldari, there are entire lines of hybrid and missile boats, and, arguably, a third of ewar boats."
"the talos uses hybrids, and has a small drone bay.the naga cannot use missiles, but it used to, in the test server phase. - it would make perfect sense to be able to use missiles, besides hybrids and it would add more interest to the ships and you would expect the caldari tier 3 battlecruiser to use the guns that made caldari famous for, the missile launchers.and wile you're at it, all new tier 3 bc's should have a small drone bay, anyway, not just the talos."
"just throwing this out there, if the naga is such a perfect hybrid boat, y do i never see any in sov space? i mean i see a lot of drakes, so would it not say that there are a lot of naga capable pilots? or do these drake pilots not like the naga?oh and thanks for all the posts.. :p"
"with t3's having induction nullifier subsystems making them immune to bubbles this gives them at a huge advantage over cov-opts at scouting. i propose that covert opts frigates not bombers be given an immunity to bubbles as well. this idea came from watching fanfest where ccp said t3's shouldnt do a better job then their t2 equalivents."
"good post. it makes sense that a ship designed purely for scouting/probing should have some advantage over t3's that are customized with with subsystems to provide this role as well as heavy tackle, or other cloaky recons.what you said falls inline with what was talked about at fanfest in the ship balancing presentation.id like to see this happen as other ships at this time can do a better job than a ship designed for this purpose."
"personally i would prefer the removal of the interdiction nullifier subsystem or to have it modification to allow a skill/bubble strength modified chance of it failing to counteract the effects of a bubble rather than the buffing of covert ops frigates."
"you'd have to remove it outright to make it less effective a scout than a scout ship.either that or give a covops a unique bonus to scouting, and force recon a similar bonus.i would suggest - not showing up in local, or showing up 'unidentified' in local"
"making cov ops frigs minus bombers imune to bubbles would be a neat thing.cov ops frigs are the worst combat capable ship in their line....for obvious reasons....not exactly a bad idea.but i'm a bit hesitant to throw my hat in for the mere fact that its hard enough to catch the buggars.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"they should give that to all t2 cov ops ships. as to local, that shouldn't be a cov ops only thing, everyone should be removed from local chat regardless of ship type."

"so, after all this mess, the end result is that a huge mass will remain with their voices unheard in the next council. even if ccp wont adimit that, this rendered the council totally not representative of the playerbase.and that will happen just because theres no logic system in place to replace someone that opt out his position.taking the next in line is not the best method. and, leaving the position unattended like ccp wants is even worse.in real life elections, usually a candidate has a vice, a seccond in line that supports his views and standings, and is able to carry on his work in case the worst happens.the proposal i put forward tot he csm is simple:let from now on the candidates to csm appoint a vice. should anything happen, this vice would be able to step forward, keeping the representative system intact and thus not disregarding the will of the voters who chosed one candidate over other."
"the existing process is democratic, using first-over-the-line, in order of votes. just because your alliance bloc-voted for a candidate who self-destructed doesn't make the process non-representative. you as a bloc could nominate two or three candidates and vote them in, thus you would not have all of your representation eggs in one candidate basket."
"hello all, i'm succub. while chatting in the caldari provisions corp chat, an idea for adding some really nice terrain-effects came up. simply put, it is implementation of terrain-substitutes such as solar flares, radiation fluxes, and etc. some of this can be seen in the recon mission where the environment deals damage to the ship at intervals and to complete you have to tank it and run for the gate.so that is the mechanic which is already present in the game. the implementation could be focused on creating actual terrain-substitutes which would add another dimension to eve and i think one that everyone would come to appreciate and enjoy if, and only if, it were implemented with the 'level-playing-field' principle at all stages.random solar flares could be used to intrude on the the environment and create opportunities for advanced game-play such as sneeking and peeking around storms in a system which itself is known for its many storms... i'm suggesting addition of such well-known phenomena that occur in real space rs sneeking and peeking around an environmental feature which is in fact a terrain-substitute.it's very flexible and apparently already exists in game, just needs to be tweeked to provide the terrain-substitute effect i'm trying to describe.so here is a copy of the chat convo, see what you all can add to it.\" succub > hi all... so how many 'sciece-fiction starwars-defense' suggestions have we got from the fanfest? any drunk/laid ccp types coming up with anything good? eurus ingram enaka > lol? succub > nice weather we're having today, looks like ... spacesuccub > be nice to have a few random solar flares and cosmic storms interfering once in a while, be more immersivesuccub > losing tgt lock because of solar flares... good ideatdz15 > o_oaleks81 goblin > ?? ??? ???? ????[17:46:51] veni4ek > ????? ?? ??? =[17:46:56] veni4ek > ?????*[17:46:58] eurus ingram enaka > or suddenly having your ship 'knocked out' for a few second during a magnetic storm[17:47:12] tdz15 > bad idea... d:[17:48:07] reiterpallasch > more like annoying[17:49:00] succub > if it happened to everyone at once, aincluding whoever else is there... then it might be a way to add some real fun... think of what wud happen with everyone not able to fight for 10 secs[17:49:21] tdz15 > that'll be fun xd[17:49:22] succub > oh sit, solar flare. ..[17:49:51] tdz15 > when the storm is over, all lock on to the biggest threat d:[17:50:05] eurus ingram enaka > or flee if youre getting destroyed[17:50:13] tdz15 > *locks on to shuttle*[17:50:24] reiterpallasch > i'd only accept that if radiation shielding modules became available[17:50:33] eurus ingram enaka > that t3 amarr shuttle is deadly bro[17:51:04] succub > yes shielding on ships... and mods... ... also thought maybe a weather forecast for systems.... some systems have more than others[17:51:54] succub > some systems you have to sneek and peek around the storms... adding terrain effects to the game[17:53:05] succub > just a thought... ill shut up now ?;-[17:53:22] tdz15 > keep it comming[17:53:27] tdz15 > sounds interesting :d[17:55:00] succub > or maybe we cud have sneeking and peeking around planets... but i think the storms for terrain-substitute is better... much more flexible. ok now ill hush up[17:57:36] vendash > doesnt sound to bad[17:58:16] vendash > gives small haulers a nice bit of help in low sec :[18:00:15] succub > hiding in a solar flare/storm? i dunno i actually kinda liike it also... after thinking abt it[18:01:05] vendash > opens up new fleet tactics all around aswell[18:01:27] vendash > lure a fleet into a storm or hide backups in a storm you cant scan in[18:01:32] succub > it wud be important to make sure the effects evebd out over time, meaning if my tgt gets away today cause of it, them i will get away tomorrow because of it... it has to be applied equally to even out[18:02:57] vendash > hmm[18:03:03] vendash > makes sense[18:04:17] l3aal > there are no things such as a storm in space -.-[18:04:21] l3aal > .. just radiation[18:05:36] reiterpallasch > you could have dust clouds that mask the presence of ships within, sorta like in homeworld 2[18:06:31] notagood negotiator > yo reiter you play armored core?[18:06:55] reiterpallasch > yes[18:06:59] eurus ingram enaka > ^[18:07:07] notagood negotiator > high five hahahaa[18:07:12] reiterpallasch > you're like the first person to notice[18:07:19] eurus ingram enaka > lol\"typ.s. - i started to remove the timestamps but too much trubble. sry."
"interesting, but wouldnt that warrant that things like los be implemented as well?i mean, everything on the grid is fair play and can be targeted ans shot, no matter if theres a station or other objects in between. to sneak and peek, players would have to be unaware of the other's presence, wich the overview would spoil.now, the other things are interesting, like a hidding place in system, or disrutive fenomena that would interfere on the playfield.it would be interesting if a fleet could also chose a better terrain position, like positioning it in a place of less interference so the attacked would be at a disavantage - like more interrupts."
"so much derp here i'm not even sure where to start."
"sigh... this argument may be old, but it still stands.the caldari invented and primarily use railguns as their turret system.the gallente invented and primarily use blasters as their turret system.the tier 3 battlecruisers were all meant to be large turret equipped battlecruisers.there is no anti-caldari bias here. everything is working as intended. a couple of notes on lore, as that was touched upon earlier...yes, the caldari favoured one man fighters over the larger, more cumbersome ships used by the federation navy.the federation began to research drones, which started out as basically little more than rudimentary ai controlled bombs. in response the caldari began to upgrade their fighters, both sides upgrading their respective technologies over the course of the war until the drones used by the federation were almost up to hobgoblin standard and the one man fighters used by the caldari had evolved into the first generation of caldari frigates.on a related note, the federation has many lumbering slow ships... in my experience the domi, mega and hype are all slower than a simillarly fitted raven.anyways, to cut a long story short, railgun ships work well when you're skilled up for them, and the 5 second reload cycle makes them even more effective. the naga is a good ship even without giving it torps or cruise missiles... while it may mean that caldari pilots have the same miss chance as the other 3 races... i don't see that as an issue.eva yang... seeing many drake pilots does not in any way mean that there will be many naga pilots.... that is like saying 'you can fly a cruise misile raven really well.. so you should be able to do just as well in a rokh' ... see where that logic fails??unit xs365bt. designated communications officer. unit commune."
"basically: the naga is fine as it is, stop trying to fix what isn't broken."
"bad start, this is completely untrue.leaving disappointed."
"you may love this idea, you may hate this idea, but do please read and think before you reply. perhaps a new system is needed, one much like jury duty might be called for, one where you are called on to play your part for the community.a simple system is all that is needed where you may or may not accept the role.everyone who is interested registers and is placed on a live roster.you must be an active player in the game for more than 2 years to register for the live roster.the standing csm panel place all names from the live roster in a hat. a draw is made until all places are filled.this way we get a more balanced system.a better mix of csm membership from the player base cannot be ignored.enough of this virtual political bs, the csm should not be about virtual political gobshites who think they are president of some ones and zeros.the csm should be about bringing forward the players concerns, nothing more.no flames please, i<U+FFFD>ve been flame resistant for a long while now so you'll be wasting your timethis idea does not mean i am saying the current csm or past did not do a good job, it's just my thoughts that maybe it's time for a new system.thanks for reading."
"i sort of like this idea. i would add some sort of minimum number of endorsements by other players to be eligible for the draw. anyone who gets above x votes will get their name in the hat or something like that. this way, there is some commentary from the player-base who can be trusted to do the job well, but it won't come down to who can get the most people to vote for him/her."
"that's a really stupid idea. randomly picking people even people who have put their names in to be on the csm is a horrible way to pick people. there are way too many troll csm candidates, it would end so badly it's sad.besides, i've spent enough time dealing with eve's rng to know that it delights in screwing over players as best it can, lol."
"those who desire power and high office are precisely the ones who should not hold it..... so how about we do this and then just randomly pick from the rest of the population..."
"agreed.its bad enough we have populairty ####storm votes....now we add randomization to the mix....no thanks.pass.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"i also agree.... while i understand your notion that those that seek power are often those that shouldn't have it, you method is extremely flawed. first, the csm doesn't exactly have power, but rather priveledge. as the release of incarna proved, ccp can completely ignore what the csm suggests/proclaims/demands, etc... they do have influence, as ccp has wisened up some to realize they aught to take the csm suggestions, complaints, and warnings seriously. however, the csm doesn't have veto power over anything... they only have the ear of ccp. secondly, if you don't have to be elected, then you don't need to put in any work into getting on the csm. as such, the csm could easily degenerate into a group of people looking to get free tickets to iceland and backstage passes to ccp, rather than a group of people dedicating their time to better the game. currently, most csm members actually put quite a bit of effort into being a csm member, and i want that to continue. imo, the only way to ensure the csm's continued efforts is to require a certain amount of effort to become a member. with a voting process, people first have to convince thousands of people that they deserve to be there, and if they don't live up to expectations they wont be re-elected. any moron with no real understanding of the game mechanics, game play, and current issues can toss his name into a raffle. frankly, there needs to be a vetting system to ensure a minimum quality of csm members, and who better to vet the candidates than the players of eve??"
"by that logic...that would mean all of the csm canndiates are already \"vetted\"i'm going based on the definition that vetren implies time spent in game...expierence..age.the issue here is personality...agenda...motives...etc.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"i'm not sure what you're trying to say... i'm not using \"vetted\" to imply veteran... although that is one defiinition. i'm using \"to vet\" as in \"to appraise; to verify; to check for accuracy, authenticity, validity, and/or ability\". the csm candidates were \"vetted\" by ccp for their eligibility to run.... and the csm members were \"vetted\" by the players through the votes they received. so, yes, i consider all csm members and alternates already \"vetted\". i don't consider them all veterans, i don't agree with some of their view points and play styles, and i don't think they are all ideal candidates to send to ccp! however, i think the support/votes they received says there is a sizeable portion of the player-base that does.... is our current voting system the best possible method? no, but its way better than the raffle proposed!!!"
"then you won't mind if we tell you that your idea is stupid and in no way would it reflect a balanced voice of the players."
"erm...how is it any different than the current voting system?we choose to vote whom we want....perhaps more info on the subject?================ stop the evemail spam!"
"i was stating that there needs to be a vetting system inherent to the selection process, which the ops proposal completely lacks. our current method does that through the voting system. i wasn't proposing a new selection method... i come from a small nullsec corp that had a csm representative on csm's 4 & 5. and while i think the current csm voting blocks are mostly tilted towards large nullsec alliances, i don't think that's necessarily a problem with the system, but rather a problem with how candidates gain exposure to voters. if you're in a big alliance, you share forums, you share vent, and you have regular contact with a larger amount of people.... smaller groups have to work much harder to gain the same exposure, although the debates, the forums, and player channels exist to help get your name out there.... democracy has the most potential for being fair.... the problem is, people in general are ignorant, panicky, creatures of habbit. if there were a method for the cream to rise to the top of the selection process, i think it would improve people's view of the electron processes. imo, the biggest potential problem with our system is too many candidates can water down the system, leaving voting blocks supremely powerful. the solutions i can think of:1. randomly select x number of candidates out of everyone who applies to appear in the official ccp election.... this would be a little closer to the op, and would still allow the the playerbase to chose the final members... at the same point in time, i want to be able to re-elect candidates that did a good job, i want to reward people that put up a good election campaign, and i don't really care for a random selection process. the at uses a lottery like this to select the initial candidates, so the event is manageable. 2. have a preliminary voting period, where the most viable 28 or so candidates can move on the the official election. i don't think we have enough candidates that this is a problem at the moment, but if there were 70+ candidates for an election of 14, it will be. the problem is, i don't think ccp wants to spend the extra resources to do this, hence the get-likes scheme they attempted. also, voting blocks will still dominate this process... 3. partition the csm into official seats and have candidates run for specific seats rather than for the general csm membership... unfortunately, dividing the seats into 9 or 14 areas that properly balance the eve playstyles is non-trivial. i think this is probably the best method if we start gettting an extreme number of candidates. given 9 or 14 seats: how many for high sec, lowsec, nullsec? how many for pve vs pvp? sov? fw? wh? indy? ... i think that ccp wisely left this up to the playerbase originally... if i were to implement it tomorrow, my \"off the cuff\" partition would be 3 highsec seats 1x indy, pvp, pve, 3 lowsec seats 1x fw, pvp, indy, 3 nullsec 1x sov, indy, pvp, and 1 wh seat, with 4 general election seats. let people chose a seat to run for, top votes get chair, top 9 votes get official csm seats, bottom 5 votes get alt seats.... you can only run for 1 seat, and every player would get 1 vote maybe 2?? to cast. voting blocks could still dominate this process... none of these steps are necessary unless we start getting an extreme number of candidates running.... 40 for 14 places is not all that problematic... however it's getting up there... reallly, there just need to be more aware voters, and good \"media\" sources so people can get exposure to the voters..."
"wow there is a lot of sb hate here...the sb is and never was supposed to be an iwin frigit platform. its a pack animal. use it alone and it will die, run with the wolves and it well never go hungry.from an rp standpoint:-----------------------rp bull bellow read at own risk-----------------when sleeper tech was first discovered by the empires they try'd all technologically possible ways to integrate the new systems they found. unfortunately the current ship designing methods would not allow or even enable them to fit these experimental subsystems to existing ships of the line. what was universality decided, after many failed tests costing 10s of trillions of isk and millions of navy servicemens lives, that a totally new design method was required to make these subsystems a viable asset. each of the empires turned to their top research divisions for this answer. the result of this was the 4 t3 hulls. these base hulls are basically sleeper cruisers with empire paint jobs, their electronics and mechanical systems are all unique thus fitting one races modules to another is currently impossible, this is not to say that i cant be done, its just that the resulting electrical and fluidical feedback would be catastrophic. on the front of the interdiction nullifyer.it was noted in initial encounters with sleeper craft that they would run from a fight. to counter this the navies fielded top of the line interdction ships not currently available to the greater capsuleer community however the sleeper craft would repeatedly jump when affected by this module. however when a pod capsuleer from the amarrian millita was met with this problem he decided to to focus all his warp disruption strength on to one target. as a result of the pre existing \"infini-point\" the sleeper craft was stopped from exiting the field and disabled for capture . the ammarian empire considered the ability to leave the field of battle un hindered by warp disruption bubbles to be an exceptional advance in this field so naturally kept it to their selves.as we all know there are always greater forces at work in eve and soon this tech was available to all of the empire factions.to date the interdiction nullifieing tech is still in its infancy and no way has been found to reduce its size without uncompromising its unique ability. as for any current ships of the line there is still no plausible way for sleeper components to be fitted to them------------------end of rp duchery----------------------tldr:dont be hating on sbsinterdiction nullifying is a trait unique to a sleeper subsystem its experimental not in wide commercial usethe hardware for this ability is just to big for use on a frigit hull"

"[quote=weiland taur] when did it become \"who can be the bigger ******* in space?\" [/quoteer... isn't it exactly the point of the sandbox? eve was designed to be morally ambivalent. what are we humans other than a bunch of gigantic douchenozzles when it comes to our fellow man? have you seen the news lately? the things we do to each other for any reason or no reason is staggeringly brutal and cruelnew eden needs conflict to make us go there. conflict implies people are going to be stars ************ - actually typed stars, not something that was censored in space. the very nature of conflict is the desire to not be nice to one another. you cannot have it both ways. \"let's be nice to one another while we shoot each other\". it doesn't work like that. you're not exchanging recipes when you're shooting each other in the facei find myself agreeing with op's post. mittens was drunk, i mentioned somewhere else that this should be a mitigating factor. i still think it was a boneheaded remark but it's nothing more than thatif eve attracts more players than the current player-base, we're going to see people coming in who have the wrong expectation of the place. they will expect to be catered to. \"don't hurt me!\" i got podded in my first hour, i was stupid. no way was i going to whine about it and have the game mechanic changed so that it could not happen againif new eden turns into the gigantic rubber ball that's world of warcraft, where the kids whine about how difficult it is and why don't they have a titan right away, then we're through. do i have to make that point to anyone herethe pod pilot should be resilient. if they have a genuine pathology or they feel at a weak point in their life, and i'm not joking about that, the best idea is to stay away for a while. the best idea is not to change the way everybody else plays the game just because our feelings got hurti know someone who stayed away for a while after suffering a significant in-game loss. it should not be 'free', there has to be a consequence. we cannot dumb down the environment because of personal sensitivitiesat fanfest we mentioned during one of the round tables that the players should be made aware by aura that this place is not like other places, where acts by and large have no consequences. it's not for everybody and it shouldn't be for everybody. the player accepts the consequence or stays awaymaturity should not us be more civil towards others to spare their sensibilities, most of us are nice people anyway in my now 4 years of experience, maturity is the guys coming in understanding the nature of the place and embracing it. or noti talked to some of the female pilots at fanfest and their sentiment was: don't change it. no whining, no moaning, no slobbering, no pleading. class acts, every one of them. with them i agree there's nothing wrong with new eden [other than some game mechanics] that needs to be changed to make it 'easier'. it's fine the way it is. the words of a few among us should not be the defining characteristic of what it means to fly in space."
"quoting myself from elsewhere a little:a sandbox means you can play in it anyway you like and use the toys provided any way you like: there is no one way to use any particular toy or a predefined plot you have to follow. if you start to call other kids names and throw sand in their eyes, though, a kindergarten teacher comes and picks you up and puts you on the timeout bench, and no amount of screaming about how it was your sand and your free play time will not save you.i think the line needs to be made very clear like this, in some newbie information bit: \"you can do anything in the game except things that ccp explicitly forbids as exploits. if another player makes your ship explode, there is no party but other players you can complain to. you can be denied undock access, forced out of systems, etc. however, you are not allowed to say anything. ridiculing other players, using racist/sexist/homopohic slurs, referring in a derisive manner to someone's real life situation or details, can get you banned. please petition it if someone behaves towards you in a way you find unacceptable or if you believe someone is using a mechanic that counts as exploit. a ccp employee will determine if the behavior was out of line. note that you will not be notified of the outcome, but that will remain between ccp and the player you reported.\"ps. for the record, i am female in rl. i don't think this issue has much to do with genger. having spoken to people whose ooc genger i know, there's both kinds in all groups of opinion it's fine as it is, limit words but not actions, pls maek me wow in space. whatever you do, please for the love of gods do not make changes in order to \"appeal to more women\" or \"make the game more welcome to women\". the last thing female gamers want is pink ponies and adolescents behaving in a phony way because they think women are incapable of understand terms like htfu or dps."
"ccp should just change the eula to: if its in game, its fair game."
"unlike people like to think, what is \"ingame\" and what is not is not always clear.for example, you are invited to speak on stage because of your ingame character is some high honcho in some famous alliance. you speak of another player character. you then refer to that player character's ingame mail to you about his out-of-game situation and encourage, while you are on stage and out of game, other players to take part in an ingame action in order to cause an out-of-game consequence. you are not clearly in or out of the game there, but a little bit of both.as another example, i do not consider pointing and laughing in the game on local channels at someone who is obviously out-of-game upset about ingame matters, like losing a ship, to be \"just ingame\". there is a real-life out-of-game person trying to make another real-life out-of-game person upset for real, and it has gone beyond just blowing up their completely ingame pixelated spaceship. i know not everyone agrees with me, but that just proves my point: the rule \"if it's ingame it's fair game\" is meaningless, because it does not mean the same thing to everyone."
"the whole argument behind the 'eve is real' is exactly the root of the problem. while the rpers aren't a huge percentage of the residents, everyone in eve is rping inasmuch as they are imposing their will onto the rest of the galaxy. thus, it could be said that everyone is roleplaying; your computer is your interface to your ship, and while you are engaged with the game you are roleplaying your character which often times is simply roleplaying yourself.which brings me back to the point of my op. there needs to be a written consent agreement that people can, will and are going to be complete assholes when playing eve, and when you initiate your interface with the game, you acknowledge that you can handle it, regardless of what it is, or if it's going to hurt your feelings."
"i am a roleplayer and i would rather you did not involve roleplay as an argument in this.what makes roleplayer a roleplayer, instead of just someone who plays a role because in eve you cannot avoid, is the separation between in-character and out-of-character, even when playing. an actual roleplayer is the one who is able to step aside when banter gets too hot for one guy, and drop the verbal being an *******, and go do something else. it's people who don't have a real grasp of roleplaying who think they should be allowed to do anything as long as they claim \"it wasn't really me!!!!\"again, i am in favour of that agremeent as long as it concerns gameplay. i think the idea that we must let anyone say anything to anyone else as long as they do so using the game client is laughable. not to mention it is probably illegal in most countries - such an agreement would not be binding."
"the main point here is not a matter of what people do or say in-game....its the fact people tend to forget that it is a game....and when you forget that detail and callously tell someone to \"off themselves\" in real life....you should pay for it in spades.it is one thing to greif...smack talk...scam....blow up someones stuff.it's an another to carry that attitude and motivation to real life outside of the game.can't get much simpler that that.the tricky part is...most people don't give a rats ass about many things in real life...and forget that those things come with consequences.example: robbing your corps assets/wallet is a common thing in eve and accepted as normal...of which consequences are inconsequential.robbing a bank would land you in prison in real life....and likely will have a permanent affect on your life.backstabbing a team mate and podding them is a normal thing in this game.murdering someone however is not in real life. they don't re-spawn after all. reality tends to lose its meaning when you spend too much time here. believe it or not...i actually encounter people who don't keep this distinction. they claim it..but in reality....they quite literally don't give a ####.changing the tos to reflect the boundaries would not have much of an impact because people tend to lose that sense of discernment.too busy \"spai-ing\" and can flipping/backstabbing/robbing to care....because that makes eve what it is....it is eve online.the \"eve is real\" crap however might be going too far.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"i can''t completely agree on this because this is the best way to let some important things loose their value and for some this should never happen.how or when should we consider that calling a native born german ss is a cause or a reason to open legal sanctions?how or when should we consider the shoa and when can we aloud ourselves to use \"words that don't hurt your flesh or bones\" to play with and say whatever?how or when should we consider as pejorative term the regular adjectives used to point someone's colour, origin or culture?so to make it simple and to return to latest \"biased thread\" about fanfest events, how and why should we consider collectively where the line is when we are already incapable to accept others differences and always think our own point of view is the only that should prevail? edit: while i'm a defender of liberty on the internet and in general because i think we're in a far police ruled world where our simple liberties are being lost by stuff like this discussion brings up, i also agree something must be done against people that have no limits or are incapable to impose themselves certain limits.this conscience of what is good or bad being inherently dependant of each one's education, collective responsibility and charge of that education is as different as you can have nations or ethnic colours even if some traits are common we don't share the same values of life and we should start by admitting this simple fact.but then i'll have to do a wall of text no one cares, witch is one of the many problems we can also add."
"i do not think that it is contradictory to say that people should remain calm in the face of asshattery, and to say that we want less asshattery. we do not have to choose between letting anyone say anything, and wishing people did not get too upset when someone does say something stupid. implying that wishing for less asshattery means that whoever wishes so does not think people have any responsibility to step back if they get too emotional is a false dichotomy and not helpful to the discussion about community standards at all."
"without attempting to defend mittens' remarks during fanfest, though it's in the same vein that we need to address;'hyperbole play /ha<U+026A>'p<U+025C>rbli<U+02D0>/ hy-pur-b-lee;[1] greek: <U+1F51>pe<U+03C1><U+FFFD><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+03AE>, 'exaggeration' is the use of exaggeration as a rhetorical device or figure of speech. it may be used to evoke strong feelings or to create a strong impression, but is not meant to be taken literally.'mittens didn't literally ask thousands of people to convince this guy to kill himself, he was using this literary device when making the comments though i'm sure he wasn't thinking such while he was saying it per se, though the underlying thought was there. he was, through hyperbole, making a joke [albeit in very poor taste] about the fact that it is indeed just a game, and that one shouldn't get so broken up over losses.again, i am not trying to defend mittens, i am merely trying to discern a line of thought which could be applied both in practice and hypothetically."
"attempts of hyperbolic jokes that go too far are in practice inseparable from genuine asshattery. ;that said, i do not think many any? people believe that mittens really wanted the guy to really die. i think most accept it was his idea of a joke. what we disagree on is whether it was an acceptable one. the fact that something is humor or intended as such does not make it automatically fine."
"which is the root of the issue -- who says what's ok and what's not ok? i'm on the side of the fence that says there shouldn't be anyone setting that precedent."
"ccp does. and no matter how many rules you make, there will always be judgment calls involved in specific cases."
"which is why we need some language on the subject -- there needs to be a framework for those judgement calls, with additional language outlining exactly -- and that's key -- what is a bannable offense, especially in-game.i know there are international speech laws that are supposed to protect against cyber-bullying though i am loathe to use the term because of it's blanket implications against negative language, and i know that ccp is legally incapable of nulling those things, however, as ccp does own the space, the isk, the ships and we are simply lessees; and that as a game with unique interactions between it's players, they can stand as landlords and inform those entering their space read: new eden should expect x, and case y i.e. making direct real-life, physical threatse.g. 'if you don't drop that can i will come to your house and kill you' will get them banned for z days.to take this particular case, the gist of what mittens said was to harass the pilot because it's fun to stress people out in eve. that's the whole core appeal of the game -- risk and stress management. get too stressed, and someone will ragequit; but that is wholly and completely at the discretion of the person stressed out. the same goes for suicide -- it's wholly at the discretion of the person who is contemplating it to go through with it, and, quite frankly, if they fail to grasp the gravity of that situation, then they have external problems that stem way beyond the scope of the game.the closest thing i can think of that can apply to this kind of subject would be the epilepsy warning that some games carry to alert those with epilepsy to the possible health risks that come with playing the game. i'd like to see something similar implemented in eve to the tune of the present discussion."
"current eula reads, btw: which part of that you think is not enough?"
"excellent find. i would just move it into it's own window, by itself, to give it better visibility.productive thread is productive?"
"i was actually looking for something completely different the use of rp as an excuse for being a jerk is explicitly bannable offense, who knew, when i stumbled on that. it's way down there with the epilepsy warning, which i suspect no one manages to read before playing either :p"
"in most games there is a clear distinction between acceptable behaviour in public vs in private.in private, corp/alliance/private channels be as bad as you want to be, it is up to the people in charge of those channels to set and enforce the rules for them.in public, local/constellation/help/trade chat channels there are standards set and enforced by the operating company, and these usually reflect irl norms for acceptable behaviour modified slightly for the game environment what would eve be without smack-talk in local? but even such banter can cross lines of acceptability.because words can hurt people, for real. anybody who says differently is fooling themselves."
"think about the way a police force works in real life: there is a limited number of law enforcement officers who need to be allocated effectively to protect a large area, with the goal of reducing the total amount of crime as much as possible. they use crime statistics to identify 'hot spots' and then move more resources to those areas.i propose that concord should work like this. within the fiction of the eve universe the resources of concord are limited, so they are forced to prioritise certain systems and neglect others. wouldn't it be better if the system security ratings were adjusted regularly ie. monthly in response to the number of criminal acts being committed in each system?for example: a 0.4 system that experiences frequent acts of piracy would be raised to 0.6, allowing concord to respond to the threat. a 0.9 system that hasn't had a crime recently would be lowered to 0.7 to compensate.i believe this would force the miners, carebears, traders and pirates to move around frequently if they want to stay in their comfort zone. the concept of avoiding low-sec will become a lot more difficult when system security status can change. pirates and gate-campers will have to find new hunting grounds when concord invades their favourite trade route choke-point. mission runners will have to choose between finding a new agent in a safer system, or accepting the risk and higher rewards when their high-sec agent becomes a low-sec agent. miners will be forced to explore new systems rather than sitting in the same safe belts day after day.comments?"
"i think in order for this to work they would need to first find a way to remove the stark line between high sec and low sec game behavior. if they could find some way to convert the safety into a more even continuum then having security status shifting would be a fun mechanic. though that would mean they would also have to look at all the anchoring/cyno/cap rules too.still, i love the idea of space being a bit more dynamic."
"i like the basic idea you're proposing, but...should it be updated frequently every 15minutes? every hour? or would it just be calculated at downtime, which might accidentally make it last a bit longer? personally, i think having it change at down-time would work out best, so you don't set a course for somewhere, and then suddenly one of the systems on your route becomes low-sec. that would just annoy haulers, while changing it at downtime might even be easily justified through lore. ccp would just need to say that concord evaluates every empire-system once a day and updates security levels based on how many crimes they've responded to the more crimes, the more people they station there. the more people they station there, the higher the security-level."
"i like the idea in principle, but you need also to bear in mind that sec status also has an impact on resource levels in particular as well as the level of concord policing, so you'd need to find a way of doing that in a fair and sensible way."
"in the current eve it wouldn't be worth trying to implement"

"i'm trying to wrap my head around the argument that the person who is providing the basic resource that drives the economy in new eden by providing minerals to the market for building the machinery of eve would not be 'doing something real'.ccp created the mining profession. either they mean that and they stop debasing the profession by giving away minerals gratis as a byproduct of other activity and they make it meaningful by making the miner a key constituent in the new eden equation. or, they remove mining from the environment altogether, we give all our money to the people driving the drone regions and accept that as the cost of doing business. it's their call.i always get a hearty laugh out of 'care bearing' and 'risk free' out of the mouths of people who shoot ships that have no guns. hulkageddon is an event. i'm not speaking out against hulkageddon. it is emergent behavior in new eden, it should totally happen if people want to do it, but don't call mining a risk free enterprise when you, the pirate, are introducing that risk.ccp, from the design stage, should have made mining an integral, and essential, part of the process of running an alliance. because logistics are important. \"amateurs do tactics, professionals do logistics\". resource acquisition for alliance manufacturing should be a key component of alliance operations. that would show who the real leaders are. that would be real life in new eden.the comment that always comes back is: mineral prices would go up, ship prices would go up. doesn't that stand to reason, fellow pod pilot? isn't that what risk versus reward is? is that not what i have been saying? if the cost of production goes up [cfr. hulkageddon], the price of the product should also go up. you should most definitely have your fun, and more power to you, but then you also have to bear the cost associated with the activity. and then i also want to make it clear that i don't agree with some consequences of the newly proposed crime watch mechanic that would turn empire space into a gigantic plastic ball to cushion the blow and make it safe for players. it is the slippery slope that dumbs down the experience and we don't want to go there. i have always considered the great risks i'm taking flying anywhere and that should always be the case.empire should be 'safer' than the rest of space, it should not just be 'safe'. let's not become politically correct."

"tonight i listened to eve radio where the csm spoke about the mittani scandal and then the mittani and nyphur talked about the consequences and fallout of associating real life name with overly sensationalist terms. the conversation was much less dramatic than i expected and i'm very thankful that nyphur was so willing to work with the mittani. eventually they even made up and almost e-hugged. how cute.however, there's an important take away to be had here: what could have been a story about a drunk mostly anonymous * making an exceptionally stupid comment at fanfest became so much more because of the use of a real name. the news elements fed off of each other with all making various untrue allegations towards not the mittani - but the player behind the mittani. and really, this is hardly the first time that someone's real life name has come up in terms of their actions on the csm - for instance there are several people who have been accused but not \"convicted\" of breaking the nda and now their real life is similarly affected. so effectively: the use of a real name takes things to the next level. and this is going to be true any time someone's real life name is used - whether that person is the mittani, jade constantine, liang nuren, or yours.at any rate, at the end of the show, someone posted the mittani's real life address and someone else said they were headed that way to * the mittani's wife. this isn't the first time i've seen something like this said, but i've learned a lot about the way ccp handles it since the last time i saw it so directly. and just to be clear: ccp takes these threats very seriously and i wouldn't be surprised if someone's received a visit from their local law enforcement tonight.so with all of this in mind, i believe that the csm white paper should be amended in such a way that the csm candidates and eventual csm members real names and countries of origin are not given to the player base as a whole - but strictly to ccp. the real life information of current csm members is already available, but that's no reason for future members to potentially be put in similar real life situations.we as a player community have proven that we are not responsible enough, not mature enough, and not sane enough to be trusted with this information and this proposal is meant to help our upcoming csm candidates - those whose real names aren't known yet. maybe even people like you.-liang"

"i generally agree with the need for caution, but i do have one issue with this, and it might even be the reason why ccp chose to publish names in the first place, i dunno.if the real names off applicants are removed from the process, doesn't that increase the chance of a player with a poor reputation using an alt to run for the csm?there may be players who would not vote for a certain candidate because of a past action say the mittani or because of a poltical association a certain alliance etc but who would vote for his publicly unknown alt that is 'untainted' by a colourful past.while revealing a real world identity could be abused, it also helps to identify individual players from largely anonymous character identities that can be legitimately bought or sold. if real names were removed from the process, there should be another means of identifying players beyond the character name they choose to compete with.an alt of the mittani would still benefit from the channelled support of goonswarm, but be freed of much of the current controversy now on his shoulders. is that right? the jotunn risi are now recruiting, brutor ancestry required in order to best represent the brutor interest. join channel joris to learn more!"

"you forget one thing - controversy does not mean someone cannot get elected. as long as this was not dodging a ban on running for csm - ccp would need to investigate, using real names and billing info which they and only they should possess - then there is no reason why mittens or darius or anyone else who has made themselves infamous by their actions should be able to stand.plus the alt would need to develop a good reputation before non-voting bloc members would vote for him. if mittens stood for election for csm using an unknown alt, and commanded all goons to vote for him, he would receive goon votes and maybe a dozen more of so. if he stood as the mittani, he would receive all goon votes and hundreds, if not thousands, of non-goons who like his attitude or policies.as shown by the voting results of csm 7, an unknown toon without the support of a voting bloc will gather no votes. even high profile but inept candidates received a pitiful number of votes. to get elected, you either need the support of a voting bloc - goons will vote for the mittani, whether standing as the mittani or an alt - or you need to be a competant, high profile candidate who has been a key part in the community for a number of months, potentially years. so these concerns about alts 'abusing' the system really are minimal, especially compared to candidates personal contact details potentially being abused, a la mittensgate."

"i do not mean to say that someone should be rendered ineligible for election simply for being 'controversial'. the only reason they should ever be ineligible is if they have broken the eula/tos and have not served out the penalties.i agree that what i am talking about is likely to be a fringe case, but it is something i can see being manipulated by a determined enough player in order to side-step a poor reputation. it might be difficult, but that would not make it impossible. a player might be an infamous forum troll/griefer/suspected or even once banned exploiter whose real name is known to some at least for insert reason here with one character. but in a relatively short space of time he could become a prolific incursion running fc with another chracter and then use that one to run for csm. isn't it fair on the voters to know who they are supposedly voting for?note: i do think there could be a solution to this scenario that doesn't involve listing real names/country of origin publicly. the jotunn risi are now recruiting, brutor ancestry required in order to best represent the brutor interest. join channel joris to learn more!"

"an over-reaction to a particular event. fanfest is over. let it go.i prefer my own anonymity, as do we all. but i am not particularly ashamed of anything i have ever said or done in any of the mmos i have played over the last decade. i'll keep my anonymity to the extent i can, as long as i can, but i don't want any scary gaming company police-state apparatus erected to enforce it, as some in this thread seem to be calling for. internet privacy generally is an illusion and becoming more so every day. fact of digital life. get used to it. don't expect to be able to lead one life one place and another elsewhere and never see the two put together.if someone wants to stand for election to represent players to a company and to the larger world via the gaming media, i think we should have a right to know who they are and, if we wish, check them out in \"real life.\" i don't want to see some known troll from somewhere else e.g., second life elected here just because no one can put the pieces together.if you can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen. as for the mittani, his real name was not just revealed as a candidate and member of the csm, he used it himself in making his apology and trying to draw a distinction between the amorality of his game character and his shocked real moral self. that someone posted his address is reprehensible and, if done in-game or on a ccp forum or other asset, that should fall well within the kind of harassment that already can be sanctioned under ccp's current tos/eula. if the tos/eula need to be amended to make that clearer for the future, ok, i'm fine with that kind of limited change.but don't expect or ask ccp to set itself up as some kind of world-wide-web gaming police-state to ferret out and protect its players everywhere they might ever be mentioned. it won't happen and would lead to a nightmarish witch-hunt atmosphere of suspicion, accusation and counter-accusation, and dirty-trick fraudulent postings. actual rl threats are a different story, entirely. those are matters for the police, not to be dealt with by a gaming company."
"you dont want to give up your name, dont run for csm. you run more risk of being harassed on facebook then you do being on the csm.any irl harassment that may occur on can easily be taken care of by the local authorities and a petition to ccp. most of the fallout and continued fallout can be laid squarely at mittens feet. that eve radio stunt was pathetic. next time try having someone one with an opposing view point that wasnt bullied into changing his tune on. it was nothing but propagandist fluff by cheerleaders.**space wizards are real, they can make 10058 votes vanish. \"and for a moment i hurd 10k goons cry out, then silence\" **"
"/signedbecause if it's true that real life candidate names and addresses are now being circulated in a way that could result in violence against candidates/their families, that should raise concern.if i was a brat, i'd ask whether the real life candidate information was circulated by posters using their own real life names, or if they were hiding behind anonymous internet identities. posting disagreeable or potentially threatening material anonymously can be seen as a calculated way to avoid accountability. for all we know, ccp & the csm may already be thinking along similar lines.re this whole panel drama, part of being human is making mistakes and then having to take responsibility, make things right with any injured party, accept whatever punishment comes down, and then with those things done, to be being allowed to move on better and wiser than before. i'd want the same for myself, so i'm hoping this community settles down soon. i've been avoiding forums with all the neverending rage and bickering. that's all i have on this.pixxie t>^^<viva small alliances!![b]~~~ new player podcast ~ pixxie's eve online podcast ~~~ latest episode episode 10*swtor, diablo 3, inferno, hulkageddon* ~~~~~~~~ on itunes and at"

"/signedtotally support this, bringing someones real life location and information into the public eye is serious business, and while what mittani did wasn't right, what others did to him with the threats of violence and other \"retribution\" were even less right. responding with an \"eye for an eye\" attitude is not right. sure you can kill someone repeatedly in game and generally make their in-game life suck, but the instant you take that into rl, you have crossed that thin red line. and you should be dealt with swiftly and to the fullest extent of the law, one might even say cold-calling someone and delivering a death threat is a \"terroristic threat\" there is a clear separation between the game and rl, it should never be crossed.legal definition of a terroristic threatchapter 42, classification of offenses, penalties; delawareall states have a law that is pretty much a carbon copy of this, but basically, a terroristic threat is a felony, and is punishable by up to $25,000 in fines and up to 2 years in a state penitentiarysp? and a notation for a felony on your criminal record, try to get a good job with a felony on your record. also most crimes that would land you with a felony tie into other criminal charges, i.e getting charged with terroristic threats is a class g felony, and also nets you a charge for a class a misdemeanor, which is up to a year in class v incarceration and up to $2,300 in fines along with your felony charge/sentence.think before you decide to take something from in game to the real world, kiddies.edit: posted info to back up first paragraph"
"well, ccp will still always have the rl info it's a necessity, due to the requirement of passport copies as proof of ability to travel to iceland, so it wouldn't be difficult to include info like \"ran preivously as old character\", or \"character name has been sold to a new player\". it's a bit more work for whoever handles it though not much, but it's hugely preferred to publicly releasing rl details.that said i don't really see that being a problem anyway, as anonymity is pretty much your worst enemy in something like this. take a look at darius iii for example - he's certainly not someone known for positive things in his previous term, yet because his name was known, because he made his presence felt and used actual things he had done or not done as a hook to have people talk about him, he managed to get elected. had he just rolled an anonymous alt to run again, he wouldn't have any of that to grab anyone's attention, and he'd probably be somewhere in xenuria territory votes-wise."

"i am pretty new to eve and from a new players perspective i have to say null sec feels right, and so does high sec, but low sec feels wrong.i dont understand why we even bother with this middle terminologoy. seriously am i missing something? the only difference i have noticed is gate guns that really dont do anything to begin with. is this supposed to make me feel somewhat safer in low sec than null sec? i really feel this middle ground is the part of eve that feels the least realistic. i would honestly tell a new player to just call everything null sec, because honestly low sec doesnt feel any different, and i feel it should.i am not looking for a safe path to everywhere, i am just saying when there really is no difference to null sec and low sec than why even bother having it? just call them all null sec and call it a day.i suppose my proposal is some kind of adjustment to the guns, i suppose to make them bigger to make some sort of safe spot in low sec because otherwise we might as well just call them all null sec."

"hello all and this is my first proposal and hopefully a good one in the csm assembly hall, my name is calvin cook and i propose something that may completely fix the \"csm vote stacking\" problems of people voting for a candidate with multiple accounts!i propose to change the way accounts and multiple characters on accounts work.currently an account may have a maximum of 3 characters, and only one of those characters may actively train at once. this effectively makes multiple characters useless for reasons other than: a alt posting on forums and b anonymous grief and/or shade tactics in-game, i may be leaving a few reasons out but for the most part this is what the 2nd and 3rd character slots are being used for.i propose that new accounts have only one character slot, and that you may add additional character slots that increase your monthly fee, and all characters on your account may actively train skills. i believe this would help the multiple account voting problem we currently have, aswell as make multiple active alts much more convenient. i am aware that this would not extinguish the multiple account voting problem, but i believe it would lessen it.an additional option would to allow customers/players to pay for individual characters on their account, and if you don't want to keep paying for certain characters, that character on your account gets \"frozen\" because that specific characters subscription has run out. this would allow for \"individual plexing.\"a quick example:account with 1 character, $15.00/mo.account with 2 characters, $30.00/mo. both characters on account may actively train skills.account with 5 characters, $75.00/mo. all characters on accounts may actively train skills.please tell me what you think, eve community!"

"was mittani roleplaying up on stage? he had his +1 sexterity hat on, right? maybe he was rp'ing a sparkly vampire? i hear wow will let you rp. is that where he will get his rp'ing fix while on his \"vacation\"?\"the best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average goon.\" - the mittani"
"interestingly, it is part of his defense that the character mittani is who is an *******, while he himself alex g isn't. he did apologize though, so it does not count as using rp as an excuse, but it does mean that he agrees with the fact that it can happen that we take our eve personages too far."
"now what i keep asking me is: why should some weirdo, who has some 20 accounts and real life issues and who is so connected to the game that he threatens to kill himself when things don't go his way be the responsibility of a player anyway? when ccp see a mail of a player telling some other player, that he wants to kill himself, isn't it their duty to react?i wonder, if people ingame start crying and tell me how sad their lives are and how they only want to kill themselves, what am i as a player expected to do? stop playing the game like i want, just to comfort those random internet people that i will probably never even know by name? no sir, i don't think so. i will keep shooting and camping and suiciding or whatever it is that got the guy mad in the first place, and and i will invite all my scumbag-comrades to the party, because that is, what i do. welcome to eve online, buddy.if someone can't cope with an internet spaceship game and wants to kill himself, thats a case for a psychiatrist or even the local authorities, but not for the csm, not for the players and not for me."
"*sigh* i am starting to get tired of repeating this, but:the mittani was not punished for shooting the miner in the first place. he was punished for what he said about it. according to ccp stance on multiple threads, they are not asking you to stop shooting someone's ship if they tell you they are suicidal or whatever. they are asking you to not encourage other people to go after him in order to drive him to complete the threat.so if you are camping and shooting someone and they ask you to stop because they are suicidal, what you should do is:- report the threat of suicide to ccp,- not answer the player,- continue playing normally including camping him if that's what you were doing before, and- not share the communication with any others.you can block him or report him for petition him for spamming if he keeps on giving you these messages.ccp has also said they will take steps against people they find using that kind of threats arbitrarily in order to make people back off from banter, because they have to take every case seriously obviously and it's a whole lot of work. so even if you find that the request to stfu this one time, rest assured if you petition the incident, he won't do it many times.it seriously cannot be this hard to separate between an ingame action firing on a spaceship and words said about it in public to other players \"if you want this guy to kill himself, here's his character's name, look him up\"."
"and then? ccp actually saw the mail, and didn't do ****. even ccp didn't know what to do or not to do. how can you expect a player, who is just paying to play the game and have fun to know better?to make things clear - i don't care about the csm, i don't care about mittani, hell i don't even like that guy. this is not about the mittani, this is a very fundamental topic that concerns all of us. and for me, fanfest is not just all that serious and real-life-ish. if i met you at fanfest and you threatened to shoot me, laughing, reeking of alcohol and wearing a wizards hat, would i call the police and have you arrested because i felt totally threatened? hell no! this is still eve, right? it's fanfest after allalso - if it is that easy to draw the line between ingame actions and real life actions as you say, why did the mittani get a 30 day game ban for a what was labeled as a real life act? also - will the guy who threatened to kill himself read: made a real life threat ingame in the first place be sanctioned or will he be coddled and protected from the bad eve playersit is not as easy to draw a straight line between real life and the game, especially not with a game like eve. and that's what this is about."
"1 they did not see the mail at the time it was written, which was months before the thing, because instead of petitioning it goonies used it to make fun of the writer.2 you do not know and it is none of your business to know what has transpired between ccp, the guy, and local medical/legal authorities.3 if you need ccp to tell you that it is not ok, under any circumstances, to publicly mock someone that might really be suicidal and entice others to go after him, you are the one who should not be playing eve, because obviously you do not have the mental capability to differentiate between ingame shooting/banter and stuff that might be actually harmful that this kind of a game requires."
"they saw the mail \"before the thing\", months, days hours - who cares. they didn't have a clear rule to follow, how can you expect a player to have one? hell, they didn't even see the problem. \"hey mittens, about that mail there - that could be a problem, don't show it\" - they could easily have said that, but they didn't. they didn't know, but a player has to pay for not knowing. that's why i would like to see some kind of insurance in the tos.and that doesen't mean they should have a clear rule for every case they can or can't imagine, that is obviously impossible. but people have to understand and agree, that this game might neither be easy nor nice to them, when they start playing it and that there is a thing that we call metagame, be it fanfest, eve-kill, eve radio, forums, 3rd party software or whatever. and that they should either gtfo or htfu if they can't handle that.psjumping to my mind right now: you are right, what happens with this specific player is not my business, but what i have to expect, should a case like that occur again is. my question about him was purely rhetorical, as i care about his person as much as i care about the mittanis - not at all. but i care about him in the role of a player, as i am one of those and might find myself in a situation similar to this one sooner or later."
"and that is where the problem is. because the existent rules are not clearly defined so players have a big manoeuvre margin, witch leads to gm appreciation when you've crossed the line or not. now let me ask you, who the hell is random \"x\" named \"ccp something\" to decide when the line is crossed and based on what does he takes that decision?-icelandic laws?-icelandic way of living?-icelandic vocabulary?you guys should know where i want to go with my question. thing is that without clear and proper rules it's no man's land wide open for a lot, real lot of things and stuff.eve is in need of some defined rules of behaviour you should not try to overcome. you'll have to at some point."
"if you updated it every day, not only is it a lot more work, but individual battles can change the sec status of an entire system because of the short time-frame. essentially, with less data to go on, anomalies have a greater effect.i think that the original proposed change-over time ie: one month would be much better here. it also makes the whole thing less crazy and anarchical, as players actually have a chance to move somewhere else safer or riskier, depending on the player before it all just jumps back again. if you changed it every day, we'd essentially have a situation where every hisec becomes lowsec, and every lowsec becomes hisec as in hi people don't fight and in low they do so then the next day the systems which had been high two days ago would become high again, as in the day before they were low and hence more fighting occurred there. think of it a little like the vc and the americans in vietnam; whenever they took an area from the vc, they'd leave and the vc would just move back in.no, i definitely think a daily update would be frankly ridiculous. a month is just right."
"didnt they mention a way for players to see a recording of the battle afterward? maybe they would have a way of sharing thee videos?"
"flash would be a bad idea. better to stream it to the cq video screen."
