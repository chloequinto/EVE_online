this is an excellent idea 1
and clown makeup but we still seem to have that
i did you suggested if a person has 20 million clone the killer gets 20 mill so if a alt kills the bountyed target they lose nothing and they take down the bounty what i suggested is half of the value of isk lost that does not come back through insurance is given to the killer would make farming ones self with a bounty a money losing venture one tweek to payouts removes a huge portion of exploits
oh well spotted ill amend the op
hi there i apologize in advanced if what i am about to say has already been said i havent got the time to read through the whole thread especially given the length of the average post in here although i have skim read over most of itfirst i would like to say that i support this suggestion but i think if you are going to make bounty contracts they should be kept separate from the system that is already in place i was in the process of writing up a very similar suggestion when i found this thread so for the sake of simplicity i am going to post what i was going to post anyway below for you guys to consider splitting the bounties this way solves some problems you were discussing earlier if you use contracts only for people who you trust then you dont have to worry about people accepting the contract just to void the money also why not just have the money in escrow and have it returned if the contract expires or is cancelled public bounties would never run out so you wouldnt have to worry about thati would also like to say that i dont think having kill rights on someone should be an essential part of making a bounty contract if someone scams you or war decs you repeatedly or tricks a n00b into stealing from a can and blowing them up etc etc it would be nice for them to be able to put a meaningful bounty on that person it will help newer players feel empowered where at the moment they feel helpless i also think that adding killrights into the equation over complicates matters also having the bounty payout as a  of their total loss is important because otherwise players can use it like the old insurance scam where people used to pay for platinum insurance and then kill themselves because it saves selling the ships out in empty nullsec or whateveri was also going to suggest that locator agents be added to the agent finder to make bounty hunting a more plausible profession i am always surprised to find that even some older players have never used a locator agent or some didnt even know they existedin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
the problem with allowing anyone to put a bounty on anyone assuming that the bounty system is itself worth a damb is that it can then be abused to harass innocent playersfor instance i say you are a corp thief yes you you dirty thief and im putting a bounty on you so that random strangers are now incentivised to kill you on my unsupported word good luck ever flying a small ship or a hauler again buddy
well this is true i would argue however that your in a similar situation already assuming you dont get your alt to claim the reward back then you cant travel in your pod in highsec for fear of suicide ganking without transferable killrights it is only suicide gankers you have to be careful of there and then you only have to be careful of them if they can kill you in something where their loss is less than 75 of yours you are right this is a potential griefing mechanism but its in no way worse than the current war dec mechanics or suicide ganking or scamming etc etc i would argue that if i were a corp theif which i might be  it would be cheaper for you to pay a merc corp or get your corpalliance to declare war than it would to put a bounty big enough to hinder my progress in highsec or probably the cheapest option is for you to suicide gank them yourself you would have to be really really lazy and really really rich to do it that way even then your better of paying merc corps for a war dec moar tears that way aswelljust something to think about i personally think your better off doing it this way than to introduce killrights into the equation or make all bounties by contract onlyin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
kill rights must be part of the equation but i am not sure they need to be the only partwith transferable killrights the killrights system gains some value it does not currently havei do see malcanis point about bounties being used to grief and there is certainly an issue with that i am not sure how to resolveit would be great if there was a way to place a bounty on a corpthief but there is no ingame method to discern them from honest corp members with access to a wallet any suggestions i have that would address this problem bring what i think is excess complexity to this issue bounties could be tied to isk taken from a wallet but that doesnt cover shipsitems stolen you could be able to select certain corpwallet withdrawals and secure container log entries and label them theft and that covers almost everything but thats really complex and hard work for ccpfor now i think limiting it to active killrights 1 secstatus and possibly wardec participants internal corp wardec bounties would cover all the reasonable options with the idea that it could be improved if theres a better way to cover the less obvious badtypes
assuming that people dont use the obvious and failsafe workaround to negate the bounty the bounty could be a problemyeah no as said above it would be good in principle if there were a way to put bounties on characters for crimes that dont involve sec loss and kill rights but its just not really possible as i asked on the previous page how do you design a mechanism that allows a bounty on a corp thief but that disallows one on a corp director using corp funds legitimately how do you have a mechanism that allows a bounty on an ore thief but not a bona fide haulerso far as im concerned youll just have to do it the oldfashioned underthetable way by paying mercs directly on the plus side assuming we get a working bounty system there will be many more players who will specialise in bounty hunting who i am sure would be more than happy to use their experience and assets to undertake such unofficial jobsof course that would mean that the bounty hunters would risk getting bounty contracts placed on themselves oh the possibilities
the true purpose of the last post i made of which you took the meaning of one sentence and then assumed the rest was rubbish is the followingi just think the potential for griefing really isnt a problem i do think however that adding killrights as an obligatory part of the bounties makes them just as useless as they are now and horribly complicates the matter having to mechanize when bounties can be used makes them practically useless i dont want to put a bounty on some chap who killed me in lowsec as far as im concerned im fair game to him people want to be able to put bounties on people who are just s or who scammed them or suicide ganked them repeatedly war decd them etcin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
you said it yourself  without killrights bounties only matter to suicide gankers either the bounty system is effective enough to allow griefing when bounties are unrestricted or it isnt decide
in highsec  bounties would change the equation for suicide gankers drasticallyyou would know that the target was worth x amountit wouldnt be subject to random drop chanceit would be in addition to any other loot droppedit would apply to all ships from the lowliest pods to the most expensive officer modded shipsin effect applying a nokillright bounty to a player in highsec means they would have to recalculate their own value as a suicide gank target to compensate and as the bounty would likely stick around for a long time  they would either be repeatedly suicide ganked or they would have to fly around in much cheaper or tougher ships all the time it would be a major hindrance to playit would also affect poorer pilots adversely much as they couldnt afford to try to clear the bounty an older character could afford to placepilot a 23 years in game bored places a relatively trivial 1bil bounty on newbie pilot b 112 months in gamepilot b now is in danger of being ganked constantly since he is worth extra as a suicide gank targetpilot b has this problem for the time it takes them to reasonably amass and then lose over 1 bil in assetsps this system does with killrights allow you to place bounties on people who suicide ganked you you currently get killrights for that
you paint it in a rather black or white way which it isnt really you sir are manipulating my words i said in highsec yes which means that the bounty payout must be sufficiently high for anyone to want to try and kill someone in highsec or high enough to warrent the bounty hunters corp or bounty hunting corp taking out a war dec in order to complete the contract you said it could be used to seriously grief people i didnt say it couldnt i said it wouldnt very often and isnt as bad as other methods of griefing not that it wouldnt happen i just said that it isnt a problemit would make it difficult for people to collect bounties in highsec but shouldnt it be difficult to kill people in highsec anyway with your system it will be nearly impossible to hurt people who plague you in nullsec because people with 90 isk efficiencies out there often have high positive standings and never give kill rights difficult is not impossible if you build killrights into the mechanics it will be impossible rather than difficult to put a bounty on some people ccp like open ended gameplay and so do iin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
not with the system talked about so far if your getting paid a percentage of their loss putting 1 bill on a n00b would mean you never got that money no matter how many times you ganked them they wouldnt be a worthwhile targetps touchUFFFDin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
i love the idea of a constructable module for taking down dead poss or pos modulesindestructible no simply because the hack should be contestable by the pos owner or anyone else who comes across it and wants it too its eve it should be possibl
hmmm it seems everyone is obsessed with optimal training times blah blahis it really that important to be so ocd about training time differences of a few days just play the game and have fun and the skills will come in time
been running without implants for some time now just havent bothered to waste my money on buying new ones yet
or even negative feedback will help to improve the concept if you explain your reasons for disliking the proposal as long as it focuses on titan balance without bringing supercarriers or other regular capitals into the discussion i should be able to continue to improve the concept
your proposal isnt bad tyran and it may be able to address the issues behind the ability of fleets to kill a titan and therefore limit their proliferation by increasing the number of titans being destroyed however these fleets would need to be made up of more titanssuperscaps this would therefore increase the number of titans built and not limit their propagation in evewhat it seems to me you are doing is effectively creating is another tier whitin eve subcapital ships will no longer matter in capital fights as is the case now and once titans get deployed in a fight it will be a matter of how many more titans the other side can deploy to counter this that is one of the points made by mechael in his postinstead as with the subcapital system where smaller ships can be immune to larger vessels and be useful in fighting them so subcapitals need to matter in capital fights therefore the answer in my opinion would be to make adjustments to the current capital ships to make them less effective against subcapital ships remove tracking or damage done to subcaps whilst allowing subcapital ships to have some effectiveness against capital ships ewar tackle damagehow this is done i am unsure and there are certainly a lot of threads exploring numerous options if the removal of immunities reduction of tracking and nerfing of ehp arent applied then there were notions of a subcapital ship with bonuses against the capital ships  or perhaps these ideas in tandem may restore some balance between these two classes
and here comes the up csm candidates i hope youve read that and agree with this little thing which wont be hard to implement
supported
the game already awards certificates that you can choose to display on your info pagewere something like this to be implemented there could be displayable medals corresponding to elite certificatesotherwise it should be all playerdriven give ceos another reason to hand out medals to players that do good stuff for their corp
1 supportednice idea here
you obviously have a problem reading as well as i stated the fact that my idea didnt go down too well with the majority of people that posted is fine life would be a little boring if we all agreed on everything it is people like you that obviously have no ideas of your own either valid or otherwise who decide to post in these threads just to throw accusations insults and whatever other garbage you can find in that miniscule brain at those who are at least attempting to be constructive if you dont know what constructive means ill help you out if you see an idea here that you either like or dislike then post and state your reasons one way or the other and move on if your post recieves a counter argument then again answer in a constructive manner its called intelligent discussion or do you have a problem with that
i wrote a long and detailed rebuttal but the forum ate itsimply put your idea hurts everyone except the people you target it atyou would provide a buff to active vets and would cause new players to fall further behind than ever beforeyou would provide a buff to bottersall of this is blatantly obvious if you apply the tiniest bit of critical thinking to your suggestion
i dont post ideas because they are crap and yes i have posted a couplebut i can smell a crappy idea when i see oneand i smell one right herei have yet to see you answer everyone elses argumentskeep on crying those tears stop the evemail spam
what amarr and caldari prefer has no bearing on what slot arrangement a minmatar ship should have also while the ships faction matters when choosing the best slot arrangement a lot more hinges on what the ship is used for electronic warfare ships generally have a lot of mid slots because ewar modules are mostly mid slot modules and are never low slot modules except for the modules that boost the power of the mid slot ewar modules as far as i am aware there are zero electronic warfare ships that have more low slots than mid slots and the only ewar ships with the same number of mids as lows are the arbitrator pilgrim crucifier and vigil three of them are amarr ships while they would want mid slots for tracking disruptors they are also likely to use energy vampires or neutralizers the arbitrator and crucifier do not have energy transfer module bonuses but the arbitrator has a slot setup suggesting that it might be fit with those the crucifier looks like it could use another high slot but thats a topic for another discussion also all three of those amarr ships have more armor hp than they have shield hp the vigil however is almost entirely dependent on its mid slots it gets a skill bonus to target painting and due to its small signature radius high speed and agility and low hit points in comparison to the other t1 ewar frigates it can be assumed that it was intended to use speed to survive with a propulsion module it only has 2 mid slots remaining it can fit 2 target painters but that leaves no room for stasis webifiers which stack extremely well with target painters alternatively it can use 1 painter and 1 webifier in which case it does not stack multiple effects from the same type of module at all and only one of its modules actually gets a ship skill bonus finally there are no low slot modules that will boost the effectiveness or range of a target painter or stasis webifier so with this setup a vigil on the field is about as effective as a stasis webifier and target painter fit onto any other ship say a drake that had a loose enough fit to put them on meaning its using up a whole pilot to fill a redundant fleet positiondo you see now why it makes sense for the minmatar ewar frigate to have more mid slots than other slotsto recap its target painting bonus requires mid slots to be used it and the hyena have the amarr ewar frigateelectronic attack ship slot setup while the gallente slot setup is inbetween amarr and caldari minmatar ewar is both target painters and stasis webifiers and relies strongly on their cumulative effects when used together either one alone is less crippling than all other major ewar modules  ewar frigates almost invariably will be fitted with a propulsion module if they have any desire to stay alive through an engagement

stasis webbers and target painters give a damage boost to your whole side of a fight having 3 4 for your t2 mids 1 for a mwd one for a painter and one for a webber gives your whole gang at least 5 damage boost this type of ewar is really minmatar as it just helps you kill the primary even faster and helps projectiles as they do most of there work in fall offthe problem is not that you dont get enough ewar its the platform is poor at delivering said ewar all it would take to make them good is the ability to survive long enough to make the boost to your gang count even if you give the hyena 5 mids and enough cpu to fit it all with webbers and painters it still gos up in smoke the moment some one locks youi think losing a bonus doubling the webber range bonus and doubling the base lock range would do far more for the hull than even 3 mids ever could

tell me more about the risks you take avoiding pvp its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
not enough room on this forum to tell you everything about it
i have a couple ideas that could fix the problems and avoid removing the implants entirely1 make pirate implants cheap and illegal so in nullsec they can be used freely with a small amount of discretion while highseccers will be stuck with the bland highsec implants everyone with a pirate set already could be refunded whatever it costs to get them i dont even know how they are obtained but there should be some refund policy even if theyre using it in nullsec because they paid a lot for it2 make the jump clone timer go both ways so you can jump twice per 2 days if you join fleets less often than once per two days you could jump to null for the duration of the fleet and then jump right back but i like the above idea better
come on ccp my amarr drones are feeling unloved and are likely to go on a suicide run into the nearest serpentis fleet if you dont give them reason to be used more
fix amarr drones 
why would my proposal require more titanssuperscaps than we have now yes there would be more ship options for capital pilots but i dont see how that impacts titan production rateswhat makes you think this would be the case my proposal removes over half of a titans capabilities and the only ones it has left cant harm subcaps at allthis is not quite correct frigates are weak to destroyers which are weak to cruisers which are weak to battlecruisers which are weak to battleships which are weak to frigates to continue the concept subcaps are weak to capitals which are weak to supers which should be weak to subcaps regular capital fleets should be able to crush a subcap fleet while a super fleet should be terrified of a subcap fleeti really hope you meant to say supercapitals because if not you would be removing the counter to subcaps just as the titan currently has no counter actually as ive pointed out there are already 3 classes subcaps capitals and supers
since you split the role of one titan current into 3 different titans proposed it can be a valid assumption that this would lead the current titan pilots to want all 3 ships to retain their full capabilities unless these ships would each require a different stream of skills specific to their class i would say it would propagate the titans furtherthe only counterargument would be that the current csaas are already spitting out as many titans as they can which would therefore force them to streamline into one of the 3 titan types each time they build one however where there is a demand there will inevitably be supply and your proposal increases the demand for titans threefoldyes your proposal streamlines the current titan into 3 separate ships but without further clarity around what exactly their capabilities would be i can only be lead to assume that the superdreadnaught 3rd titan suggested which you mentioned would retain the current titans combat capabilities  if appropriately fitted and boosted would still be able to hit and 1shot subcapitalsexcept they are not as soon as titans get on the field subcaps cease to matter again it would seem that at least one of your titans suggested would still be able to maintain this imbalancemy mistakeagreed however classrelated oversights aside  the current ability of subcapitals to affect supers in any meaningful way is very limited and in my opinion your proposal unfortunately does not address this problem
my proposal splits the current titan into a titan mkii a mothershipworking title and a superdreadnaught the mothership is a vanilla capital akin to the rorqual the titan mkii and superdread are supercapitals which each have half of the current titans combat capabilities both of these two supers would be undockable under current game mechanics making it impossible for current titan pilots to have more than one of them this was all outlined in my proposalgo read post 2 in this thread it outlines precisely what abilities go to which ships and also asks for suggestions improving said divisions i rearranged my post just this morning and you may have read it during the changei said should obviously they arent currently which is part of what this proposal is designed to fixas laid out in post 2 in this thread superdreads would have the titans capital weapons systems and the ability to siege they would be based on an upgraded dread hull and as such would have a dreads tracking stats the titan mkii would get the superweapon and fleet bonuses the superweapon needs a rebalance too which is noted in post 2 and i have a suggestion for the new superweapon in post 3edit actually looks like the mention of the superdread being based on a dread slipped through he cracks somewhere fixing that now
why not just replace the arbitrary 24 hour timer with an arbitrary 12 hour timer
i support this idea in all of its detailsccp are always saying they need new skills for vets to train and this would be an obvious onesome people are saying it makes people too mobile and that it causes less kills because people wont be traveling through space i disagree i think if its dangerous to do on their own people just dont travel there at all better to be able to jump down to a pvp centered area such as out in nullsec than to not have people out there at all i think it will encourage pvp not hinder itin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
not quite sure where you were going with this and what relevance the packaged programs on windows has to playing evei seriously doubt windows users play the game any less than mac or linux users as they pay to play the same as everyone elsebased on statistics they actually play more as there are more of themlinus users as already stated make up a very very tiny part of the eve community and it really isnt worth ccps time to support a client solely for this
i do believe i mentioned above that last time they tried they didnt put enough resources in to do it right and made a pigs breakfast of itid rather they not make another partial attempt but it would be nice if they took wine compatibility a bit more seriouslyjust a tiny bit
for me a recent linux adopter learning how to get eve running through wine was an important educationi understand your good intentions but id rather a programmer at ccp was informally assigned to raise issues with wineorg rather than a whole team dedicated making a new clientalthough i am a bit worried that the sisi test server client crashes for me in wine at the moment
yeah does the same to me too sucks having to switch to windows to run sisi something in the last patch seems to have broken wine somewhere along the way
heh another awesome drake post i will try to be more tactful so as not to hurt anyones feeling but i think this one is a dead ideaeveryone that posted here for the most part hates this idea and have given many good reasons whyyou the op have still to explain why this idea is actually needed when the current system isnt broken and is probably the best feature of eve

uhoksoyour upsetyeahdont like losing your ship to a disconnglitchyeahyou come herepostinga rantmakinga demandand you expected what againyesyou should be embarassed stop the evemail spam

and you think yours does stop the evemail spam

we looked at the logs and unfortunately the logs show nothing

block himyou are correct in your statement of his opinion as for your post i agree that ccp may need to reasses the refund policy on ships if a server outage caused the loss of ship and it is clear that this is the case multiple people were kicked or whole systems went down etc then the refund should be a clear and easy thing to do dont refund the moneyput the ship back and reverse any loss of implants or skills the response of the logs show nothing was old many years agoif you cannot prove that it was caused by ccp by either their own admission or with evidence of others being kicked from the server then things may not be as clear cut if it was something like the comcast fiasco then ccp should still replace the ships since it was a widespread issue out of the customers control and ccp are the only ones that can do anything about it if the server went down and ccp knows it then there is no reason at all why they should not refund a lost ship due to a server outage
your opinion aparently doesnt mean much to ccp eitherso making a demand here fixes what again stop the evemail spam

i can understand your frustration at losing ships due to a disconnectlaggremlins and although it seems like there would be no cost to replacing your ship what about the cost in time it takes to review agree then replace that ship of yours by an employee of ccpnow imagine this across say a fleet fight of 1000 players all losing ships to disconnectslaggremlins the cost in man hours would be huge if ccp reversed its long standing policy of not replacing shipsas a player of eve i would love it if they replaced ships who wouldnt but there is a cost that has to be consideredas much as drake is his ever tactful self drake you crack me up dude  he does have a point putting this post up just makes it look like you are having a rant about this and it will go nowhere fastit would probably be best contact ccp direct about your ship losses and seeing if things can be sorted from there
i dont know the threshold of evidence but i do know that ship replacements do happen some timesmaybe they just need better logging
couldnt have said it better myself o7 stop the evemail spam
not to be rude or a troll but i have an honest question how many ships have you lost over how long due to ccps issues in your opinion
im reposting this to streamline my points about minmatar ewar vs other race ewar because i received a large number of replies that were highly misrepresented and generally offtopicpoint 1number of mid slots on electronic attack ships by raceamarr 4gallente 5minmatar 4caldari 5number of types of mid slot modules represented in skill bonuses on electronic attack ships by raceamarr 1gallente 2minmatar 3caldari 1the overlying point here is that regardless of how good the modules are the minmatar ewar frigates dont have enough module room to put on enough ewar to outshine some other random ship you could be flying instead thus regardless of their other attributes they are valueless ships that put nothing on the field and yet waste a pilot the obvious solution is to move one of their low slots to a mid slot and decrease the effectiveness of the modules to balance
im confused your title talks about all minmatar ewar but your post refers only to the eaf your proposal does not involve boosting minmatar ewar per se but the minmatar eaf instead please can you clarify your proposal other random ships do not get web range bonuses so they can never replicate the web range of a hyena many would say that this holds true for all eafs you are arguing for a boost to the hyena only this can only be justified if it is agreed that the hyena is significantly worse than the other eafs you need to support this assertion alternatively you may decide that all eafs need help
oh dear godthis a request to buff minmatar eafsyou said it wasnt a buff to eafs in your other post and our replies were off topicas you were told in the other post by the way cross posting is frowned on by ccp changing the slot lay out will not help the eafs in the slightest the problem with them is they die as soon as someone in jita sneezes they have no range on the ewar mods so have to fight stupidly close to anything that can kill them and with no tank youd be better of flying something elsethe fact remains that all of the eafs need attention and ccp has already acknowledged thisas it stands minmatar eafs are no better or worse than any other racesthey all suck as they standagain not supporting this proposal
dont quote post 1 here youre clearly too inept to understand it so pretend it didnt happen focus only on what i said in this onemy first post was about a lot of things and you all ignored the vast majority of it therefore this one is only about one thing for every webifier that the hyena fits there is a target painter it is not fitting its bonuses represent three separate kinds of modules thus unless it has all three present it gets less than 4 bonuses that leaves very little room to stack multiple effects on top of each other thats my whole point here not just a little part of it thats my whole point a hyena only paints significantly better than random fleet member x if either random fleet member x hasnt fit a painter or if the hyena has fit more than 1 painter same with the webifier and on the point of range while its range is much better with multiple fleet members having webifiers equipped there is generally a good chance that any given primary will have a webifier in range from one of the fleet members other than the hyena if you dont get this just say i dont get it but dont make a huge rant about how im missing points that youre too lazy to read about in my postsonce again claiming i didnt support why hyena is worse than other eafs because youre too lazy to read the part where i did and even after i condensed it for you
this is incoherent you tell me not to quote post 1 then you tell me to focus on it you sound confused why does your thread title refer to minmatar ewar in general but your op only talks about eaf please clarify thislike the keres you mean i dont understand why you regard this as acceptable for the keres but not for the hyena there is a logical fallacy here i think and a fundamental failure to grasp that ship balance is determined by more factors than adding up medslots you have not shown why you believe the hyena to be worse than the other eafs because you have not mentioned the other eafs
1 lets put that risk vs reward concept into more things then just pew
while i get the motivationyou are aware that your going to make a severe change to the market right stop the evemail spam
prices might rise a little to offset higher production costs but since the aim is to provide a reward for lownull indys for their increased risk in the form of a larger profit margin compared to hisec indys thats not bad imhoso yes im aware
a little noalotyesdont underestimate the marketeven a slight pebble causes huge ripples of iskthis idea is all good and fine but in the end its likely gonna cause more harm than goodbut im not gonna make a judgement call on this just yetthink ill sit back and observe for a bit  stop the evemail spam
actually yeah after going through a few wardecks the only people who actually fight back are people with stuff to lose in space this would actually add risk vs reward to highsec a corp would have the choice of a working out of stations only knowing that if anything bad happens all their valuables can be safely dockedb have a more efficient and cheaper pos out in space that can get shot at and needs defending well assuming ccp reworks wardeck mechanics and a pos fix would be nice tooi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
poss are playerowned why should they have taxesi support this topic and in fact have actually brought it up before there are generally zero researchmanufacturing slots available of all types in my whole region including lowsec given how many total slots there are i can only assume this is because there are players putting various blueprints into the slots for months at a time when theyre not getting any significant bonuses out of doing so simply because they arent paying anything either that would explain why there are blueprints with say 200 material efficiency when its tritanium cost is the same at 25 material efficiency or less
yes ewar frigates need some sort of survival buff however i didnt bother to address that in this post because it is a complicated issue i dont even have a good answer for but the point i was making was not that 3 mid slots is not enough to do good ewar rather that it is not enough to make the ship have a stronger ewar effect than a fully fit nonewar battlecruiser if giving it more mid slots makes it too powerful then nerf the target painters andor stasis webifiersthe bonuses you mention would have a much weaker effect without those mid slots being added no matter how much you boost the lock range and web range you arent fixing the heart of the issue which is that its ewar is only marginally stronger than a drake with a target painter and webifier the drake however contributes far more to the fleet than just its ewar it also has far greater survivability in almost all situations and for only slightly more cost than the hyena
you really cant compare a bc especially one of the top two in the game currently to a support frigate its just not a fair comparison
oh gee let me see where i got that fromah yesso basically you are stating only eafs arent used for their intended roles if so why not just ask that eafs be fixed along with about 20 other threads in here asking for the same thingany buffs to ewar modules will benefit the recon ships as well they already work very well for their intended roles except dampenersbuff eafs not the ewar modules themselves otherwise you will make recons very overpoweredas already stated adding more slots or rearranging the slot layout on eafs will not help them in the slightest they will still go down in flames as soon as anything locks themthey either need a buff to range of the ewar mods or a buff to their tank
i can because the point i am making is that they both have approximately the same ewar impact and the difference in what they add to the fleet other than ewar is tremendously clear thats the entire basis of my statement that the vigil and hyena need more mid slots to make them better at ewar than nonewar shipsif the drake had say three times the effective hp of the hyena it would last about as long as the hyena in most engagements as its higher hp are perhaps just enough to counter its larger sig radius and slower speed if it also fit about the same amount of firepower as the hyena and someone was arguing that since the drake had a resistance bonus and missile bonus that it should therefore have better tank and dps than a hyena would you actually try to dispute that
this isnt a thread about electronic attack frigates though it has sort of turned into one it was supposed to be a thread specifically about balancing minmatar ewar with other races ewar in the case of the hyena and vigil they differ from other ewar frigates by bringing nothing to the field they are essentially a redundancy and waste of a pilot it is rather indisputable that all other ewar frigates for all their shortcomings are better than nonewar ships at ewar
this is the only intelligent thing ive seen anyone else post yet on this whole threadyou were right about that i concede otherwise everything else that has been said by you guys has been vapid at best and dead wrong rather often
minmatar ewar is finestalso eafs dont need more slots if you want to be better at ewar buy more expensive ship your problem is solved right away they are throwaway crap you fly when you want to explode dont ask them to be some kind of blueballing shipsplease move to features and ideas
you really need to make up your mind whether you want to buff ewar mods or you are talking about buffing eafs because so far you have veered one way then the other even your post above says buff ewar but you then go on to eafs againas as already been stated by a few people here all of the eafs are not used that much because they die very quickly so dont really help in any fleet minmatar arent any different from gallente caldari or amarr eafs in that respect when was the last time you saw a sentinal kitsune or keres in any fleet actually doing its intended role ive never seen them used in any fleet since they appeared in gamethe t1 ewar cruisers do a better job and actually live longer so why even bother with any eafsyou really really cant buff the ewar modules themselves as you will make the recon class ships stupidly overpowered huginns and rapiers already do very very well at their intended roles why make them even betterthe only ewar module that really needs fixed is dampenersi think you should reconsider what you are actually asking to be fixed then come back and be very specific about your fix and why its needed otherwise your idea will get shot down in flames again
holy crap i didnt see this one and i cant believe you actually compare a bc to an eaf seriouslyso your newest idea is give eafs the tank of a bcyou are missing a very important point here the eafs are frigates that have zero tank in comparison to a bcthe bc will out live an eaf by a country mile so will seem to be better than a dedicated ewar ship even without its bonusesif the drake had the same bonuses as the kitsune does then that would be the only ship to be flown in eve awesome tank moderate firepower stupid ewar capabilities why fly anything elsei now think you are just trolling well done i fell for it 1 internets to you sir
very much this if you are not saying that the huginn and rapier are unused and need to be buffed then why are you proposing buffing them via blanket changes to ewar modsif you are instead saying that the hyena needs to be buffed then you need to decide whether the hyena is poor relative to other eafs or whether the eafs as a class are poor if its the latter which it is than the solution is not a buff to the hyena alone instead you need to decide how to buff eafs in general
im done here no matter how many times i reiterate the same rebuttals you guys completely ignore what i say and make the same alreadyrefuted arguments against it im going to make a new post to get rid of this nonsense im going to streamline the entire thing and take out all that juicy intelligent stuff i said about balancing and instead feed you a ultraconcentrated shortform mass of text that will clarify exactly why you guys are wrong and im right and moreover will reveal to you the idiocy of everything you have said here im telling you this here so you know what to look for when you read it later
well make sure it is very clear what you want to fix and more importantly whythis proposal was a mess from the start
i would like to propose a cumulative bonus to hulls of the same faction working together in fleet when a command ship is boss this in the interests of improving the effectiveness of command ships and encouraging same faction fleetsedit withdrawn
yes homogenous fleets is what eve needs lets remove any variety and force people to train for very specific fitsseriously even by ah standards this is an extraordinarily bad idea
you have a point groups training specific complementary skills for the purpose of getting an edge are playing the wrong gameand variety is not imposed by the chaos of real life in any way
yeah i cant really see this ending badly fleets cant consist solely of one faction as they would be less effective not morefor example say you have an all minmatar fleet in arty canes how do you stop all of the enemy fleet just laughing at you and warping off sure you could use a sabre but that sabre isnt going to live long in the middle of an enemy fleet well outside logistics rangethis is why you see a lot of lachesis in large fleets for a massive range on the point to hold ships long enough to kill themquite a few gallente ships complement minmatar ships gallenteminmatar recon combination is one of the best in the gameeven in small fleets this would be a bad idea ecm is prevalent in small fleet warfare so by bringing all the same faction you make the kitsune blackbird falcon rook and scorpion pilots lives so much easier as they just fit one racial type for jammersthere are lots of different reasons why a same faction fleet isnt a good ideai am sure others will come up with more examples for younot supporting this proposal
yeah we really dont need to penalize fleet diversity not supported at all
as more experienced voices have been heard to voice legitimate arguments against i respectfully withdraw the proposalthank you for the consideration
i am pretty sure they can at the moment on stealth bombersas to 60km on other ships not sure that would be that great sniping torp ravens would give me nightmares
i cant really speak for your corpalliance but in mine i normally find out about fleets because1 my ceo screams at me to join or i get tarred and feathered 2 my alliance chat is spammed to hell and back with the fleet 3 the fc screams at us to join fleet or else 4 my corp chat is spammed with the fleet 5 corpalliance people scream at us on comms to stop being terribad carebears and join fleet6 planned ops are posted on the forums in advance to help the terrible spies we have7 really important ops are usually sent out in an alliance maili dont think adding any more range to the fleet finder is really necessary unless your corpalliance only have secret fleets you are not suppose to know about
1 theres no rush to add new sounds but this is something ccp should eventually look at i think it makes it harder for new players to take the game seriously the effects arent bad theyre laughable reminds me of cheesy 16bit console games i played
id love option 2 supported
thank youhopefully csm 7 will show some support for this proposal
and bump for exposurei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i like a lot of this ive always wanted some type of rts eletment to eve available to playersa couple notes thoughthe bank should not be able to generate any isk from nothingany setup where it does is wide open to abuseallowing moon goo to be extracted from whs would likely crash the market for it unfortunatlyalso related to whs supercaps should not be able to be built in whs and heres whyat the moment it is very difficult to conquer anyone entrenched in a wh due to mass limitationsthe reason for these mass limitations was to promote some of the small gang pvp that everyone lovesallowing players to build supers inside a wh would make said wh essentially invincible if even one were producedfinally as much as i hate to say it it took ccp years to give the assault frigs a little bit of love i doubt theyre going to go doing anything as big as this unfortunately 
taking a peek at the files on the client i see cached texture maps i dont see cached skeletons though i expect that this means the skeletons are either packed and i missed them or more likely theyre stored serverside in fact they must be stored serverside for that view full body button to work that means that to support mods theyd have to change to local skeletons or support uploads of playercontributed skeletons which could easily break things either way its a fair bit of dev timenow adding an additional few bones and some mild weightings on the other hand should be easy
my hobgoblins and warriors are picking on my acolytes now they are sobbing quietly in the corner as we speak the hornets are staying out of it as they know it could be their turn next this is your fault ccp they need some loving
there are no amarr drones
this so much this dplease ccp implement thisis there anywhere more formal we can post this because it is such a good idea
ive said this before and ill say it againthe only thing ccp needs to do is stop allowing capitals to refit in combatas it is currently tracking titans if primaried just switch to a tank setup
no not every pos in eve bookmarked i have gate tacticals for almost every region in eve when you live in null sec as long as i have you tend to collect bookmarks and will end up having them for everywhere you have gone and lived in honestly we have seen more people hitting these limits this is whyand no im not going to clean house on a collection of bookmarks that have taken me 67 years to make
shame you cant export your bookmarks so that you can just load them up as and when you are living in a new region
you can just copy them then drop them into a can sadly the cans only hold 1000 per after that it will tell you that you have hit your limit then you have to do that more and more we are talking about 1500 per region or so including the hour it takes you to remove them and the 5 to 10 hours it takes to reinstall themjust asking for ccp to give us more room how much would it take to actually allow this
ffseverybody always talks about fix titan trackingortheres too many titansor other  like thattheres a simple solution to thisnot allowing capitals to use other capitals fitting servicestracking titans are rediculously easy to kill seriouslythe problem is that if you shoot one they use the fitting service of another nearby super and instantly have a wtfpwn tankthe fix isnt fancy its quite basic easy as that
eh maybe not outside pos shields its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i was there and it was awfulin my opinion we should push in the direction of getting wine as an official platform among the other windows versions this would also include the mac clientthis way there would be only one clientalso there is not much needed to get a better integration in distributions a small open source installer that can be packaged by distributions and after accepting the licence or whatever downloads the client via zsync already exists for the repair tool per userjust my 0000003 of a cent
no prenge star wars was more akin to the elder scrolls which is again a unique skill ssytem just like eves its waht set the agme apart from its competitors you levekled it by doing it nge made the gaem just like wow adn that is when the gaem died dead killed i as a player of swg from precombat upgrade all the way to a year and a half after nge can attest to that ebing the reason for its deathso no the reason that other companies dont use the same skill system as eve is becasue eve caters to mature players with patience not mister 12year old add kiddy who wants to get his xp bar up for a shiny new levelother mmos are aimed at the shortterm player the lowest denominatoreve is aimed at the amture the intelligent the planning those who have goals spanning years instead of only going to next weeks dragon raidso please try and propose even one reason why your proposal is even remotely a good idea id love to hear it
everything has already been said herelvl 5 skillsspecializationcasual playstyles
some very low sp guys join us and do great in fleet fights you dont need 100m sp to have fun you dont need 100m sp to be effective in pvpone of eves core principles is the way skills work it attracts players who cant commit huge amount sof time to the game you would be punishing the casual player so much that they would simply leave

erinput from whomall ive seen is mr sm grin included making a remark but not saying muchyouve basically called me an ignorant idiot for the mere fact i pointed out that your just as bad as i am and your ranting on behalf of someone else of which you have not suffered yourselfdoes anyone see a problem with thismust be eve online forums stuff status quo  stop the evemail spam
actually they are reimbursing ships pretty wellprocess can take over a month thoughit is however very unlikely you get reimbursed if you lost ship because of lagdisconnect caused by the usual fleet fight and that is okay since you should know by that point when theres more than just 10 people in system that it might just happendisconnect and crashes are just common in fleet fights when i started playing it was normal to crash in fight when you got more than 20 people in fieldi think common principle is that if you lost your ship in pve you get reimbursed more likely than if it was a case in pvp and it makes sense ive also seen ships reimbursed pretty well if it was a case of unexpected server slowdown or bug however again your personal client crashing in fleet fight doesnt count on it if you participate in fleet fights you eventually crash one day and lose a ship just get over it and dont fly anything you cannot afford to lose d

it wasnt a troll he was just being brutally honestno thats not my opinion its the truth
this coming from someone who speaks for someone else who hasnt posted hereand then resorted to eve mailing me with a childish trollthe only child hereis the one who denies itif you cant handle the heatas they sayget the  outyou have no business making demands of anyone or ccp herewe post ideasrationalsanereasonableyou show up here and rantemorageand then act like you have some sort of authority to call us stupid for telling you that your wasting your timeif anyone needs to grow upyou are sure one hell of a bad example of what not to bewelcome to eve online forumsand to my block list stop the evemailUFFFDspam
lol i see this thread went south in a hurrydrake was being honest with you not trolling you brutally honest and very blunt but honest none the lessif you dont want peoples opinions which can be positive and negative by the way then why post this in the forums at all
you havent a clue what youre talking about so how do you expect anyone else to understand what you are talking aboutthis is solely an attempt to buff one ship over the rest why should the hyena only get a buff but the other eafs get ignoredguess what this is eve where you have to make tough choices about your ship fiti would love to have a full rack of 425s ham iis 4 neuts 3 td iis 4 ecm and a bomb launcher on a hurricane but i cant because the ship doesnt support itthe hyena doesnt support all of its bonuses at the same time so you need to choose tough life really seriously you need to stop posting about this now
this is a horrible distortion of the actual data your 3  types of mid slot modules represented in skill bonuses on electronic attack ships by race is including the mwd sig reduction since prop mods are something every frigate fits youre presenting a distorted viewpointheres another way of looking at that same datadistinct and bonused ewar modules per racial eaf hullsentinel 3 tds neuts and noskitsune 5 4 different types of racial ecm and multispec ecmkeres 3 point scram and dampshyena 2 web and tptotal number of slots per hullsentinel 12kitsune 12keres 12hyena 12so by your logic since all of the other eafs have more ewar modules they are bonused for then all but the hyena especially the kitsune really need more slots personally im not trying to say anything about the slot requirements of the eafs im saying that presenting data only from a slanted viewpoint that backs your position is shoddy posting at best you should bring real logic and all the information to the discussion not just the data that supports your positionthe eafs are relatively balanced atm but theyre all balanced in being papertanked primaries its not that the hyena or any of the eafs needs a buff its that eafs as a class need a buff until the eafs as a class are buffed talking about individual ones is completely pointless
eaf do not need buff it is a good thing they are paper thin primaries thats how they only get used in situtations they are probably meant to ie in a small frigate gang they are pretty coolif you want a ship which survives in a bigger gang take a recon shiptough world you cannot wtfpwn everything with frigates so sad
yep the least used ships in all of eve dont need a buff  i mean ffs even titans supposedly meant to be super rare are used more often which is usually a sign that the class needs some loving
i love it when people come up with an idea that in theory is completely viable then jump on the forums  fail horribly at explaining it but its everyone elses problem for not understanding their gibberish
this would be a nice fill to a hole in the logistical aspects of warfare in new edeni am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
sir i have to correct you eve players are extremely intelligent moreover a fair amount of former players now work at ccpi would not be so arrogant to suggest to us that this could never be incorporated into eve since the new direction ccp is headed inplus one from methere are no stupid questions just stupid people ccp goliath wrote

i tried very hard not to snigger but the juvenile in me could not resist a smirk at your begging for your wormholes not to be interfered with
bump again
since you bumped this heres the thingit might look cool when prerendered but i think it would end up looking kinda  for pretty much everyone involvedremember that from your perspective all youd really see is the grid disappearand from someone elses perspective all youd really see is their ship disappeari dont think that the effect would look quite as cool as you think when implemented i mean its all well and good when the camera is already hovering in the exact spot you need for an impressive flyby but from a realistic standpoint it wouldnt end up looking all that impressivenow to a practical standpointwhen you warp in and have the deceleration it gives you a few moments to grab your bearings before everything goes to hellsimilarly when somebody is trying to warp on top of you as it stands you have a couple fractions of seconds to make a decisionimagine ongrid warping for a second youre in sniperhacs around 70km off their cr fleet they will try to ping off and get a warp in on youthey ping but because theres no acceleration or deceleration they just kinda pop to a new spot especially if theres a lot on grid and things are getting a bit framey youll just see ships teleporting aroundwhen they warp on top of you same thing they can warp and bubble before you even know they warped theyd just teleport right on top of youthis would break the already dubious state that sniping fleets are already at
here is the ideasame like with corp wallet make personal wallet divisionstwo divisions should be enough one like active master wallet for paying and stuff like that and other for your money you dont wish to spend by mistake but want to keep handysome people are holding their isk in corporation wallet to avoid accidentally hitting a scam or putting wrong number in buy order it would be easier just to put isk in new division in players wallet then to create corp then managing corp wallet moving money here and there etchell even in real life you dont go around carrying all your money into wallet call the other division credit card for all i care dlooking from programmer stand shouldnt take long to implement and personally i think it would make things better and it doesnt even touch balance of the game
ambivalent on this one will be back later strongly supporting it after i drunkenly spend all my isk on something stupid1 though
its been talked about and widely supported many times  were just waiting on the devs 
this would only mask the problem and we would still probably see partially tanked partially tracking fit titans that would still be able to 1 shot battleships and even then it only applies to the tracking issues
i propose a boostable to fit warp disruption field generators50 bonus to focused warp disruption range per leveltitans die everywhere limiting numbers regaining ballance also trit price less inflation
this is already a part of the proposal if you read post 2 i suggested this for the superdread
all youre doing here is cementing the status quo by hindering new entities from building their own titans to catch up with the existing fleets
all id ask is that they not break it entirely on wine cq seems broken atm but who cares about cq i currently cannot get on test because it crashes but i havent done a full reinstall yeti will not use windows to keep playing if they break wine support
how about instead signing your silly petition we all give you 1 dollar so you can buy windows might even get enough for new wooden pcto give out a bit more explanationfor example lots of stuff works differently on other os do you know how much time devs would need to write a linux client and test it i dont and i sure as hell wouldnt even like to know simply enought play it on windows or on mac if i wanted to play dust or god of war i would buy ps3 i wouldnt go on developer site and say you know what i am starting petition you lazy aes go and make it for pc
windows costs 100 not worth the price for the pain of trying to get windows to run right in the first place let alone getting it to run evewhenever eve compatibility with linux breaks i just unsubscribe so its probably a net win for me since then i have more time for other stuff
i personally lean towards risk vs reward high sec is safeer then 00 and low sec so therefor your income per hour should be lessbut lets put some numbers on it incursions are in a well run group 75m per hour   correct me if i am way off baseso if that is an accurate number are you comfortable with that should that be the basis for other levels of income in eveif that base is maintained and other areas of eve are buffed by ccp that would also cause inflation no also are we using the pricing of plexs as our goal post should the average person be able to pay for an account in a few hours of playing eve while residing in the safety of empire interested in the csm candidates responses as well as others
you lost me with this sentence your gender is irrelevant
drake draconis often speaks the truth note often not always however he usually does so with such a lack of eloquence or art and upsets many people along the way this doesnt mean he is wrong it just means he has no people skills lolanother thread derailed drake dont ever not stop posting
supported and added to my csm agendacheers
i can see this as a real problem that is having gamebreaking realworld negative impact on players and seriously needs a real solutioni realize this thread is not very many days old but reading here i think this deserves some good discussion also i realize im new to the forums but i think i may have some good ideas about this
i think someone in the other thread was basically on the right track when they interpreted what the op said in a slightly different way where instead ofif your minimum amount is 100 of the quantity of the order then you have to put 100 of the isk up for escrow regardless of your margin trading skill level thinking of it this way seems to break the point of having margin tradingit is actuallythe minimum amount cannot be set to an amount that would be worth more than the amount of isk you put up for escrowthis simple semantic difference in the interpretation of the proposed solution much more obviously does not break the margin trading functionality and it doesnt allow for this catastrophic gameruining flaw to harm the customers in a gamemechanic sanctioned wayits not like you were gullible and trusted a player saying something rediculous in a chat you trusted the ingame market mechanics that are supposed to be the method that prevents you from harm  the very thing that you are supposed to trust but then that very system is what harmed you it was not the other player who scammed you it was the game itself that scammed you on behalf of the other players wishes that right there is the very difference between a legitimate scam and a straightup sploit
having the system kill the order if you no longer have the funds available seems like a good idea at firstbut i think the whole point of doing margin trading is so that you can buy things without having the money or rather not directly buy things but place buy ordersi think the problem here is with the resolution of an order that is being fulfilled when it was a margin trade to let people spend so much time and money going around to collect up a saleable cache of items in response to a buy order only to have that buy order killed because the buyer didnt have enough money thus causing all the harm to the player who thought they were engaging in a trustworthy activity is just poor design
so now if the existing method isnt reasonable we get into a discussion of how do we properly resolve margin buy orders that get fulfilled when the buyer doesnt have enough money to pay for ithow about the seller sells the items and gets the money just like they deserve to for going through all the hard work to fulfill the orderthen the buyer gets the items for which they paid the escrow and for which they have the wallet funds as for the rest of the items well those go into some sort of postorder escrow limbothen in order for the buy order to serve its purpose of buying things and in order for the margin trading to serve its purpose of buying those things without having the money the moment the buyer who of course didnt have enough money to pay the buy order and is therefore sitting at a balance of 0 gets any isk at all it automatically goes into the limbo order until they reach the point where the order is fulfilled and the items are taken out of limbo and delivered to the buyerthis way the main that does this can never do anything else until they fulfill the very responsibility that they have ordered to be required to fulfill when they placed the order in the first place thus forcing them to live up to the responsibility they agreed to take onthen if people try to find ways to exploit this method it can be dealt with by having limbo items only last a certain time say 30 days and the items go out of limbo and up for general sale at the location where they are for the amount of money that was paid to the seller for them that way the items go into the game the isk eventually goes back into the game and no one gets hurt in the process and that can give rise to another skill that allows you to extend the amount of time by so much each level etcso in that case if an alt tries to do a margin buy order and ends up leaving a whole bunch of items in limbo and that alt gets biomassed all that has to happen is those limbo items instantly go up for sale or just say sorry you cannot biomass this character at this time because it has outstanding buy orders or something like thatevery proposed solution has the potential of being exploitable so the developers would have to figure out how to do it righttrouble is any time you allow people to buy things without actually having the money for it you get into dangerous territory unless you force them to pay asap
they arent active theres a lot of systems out there now with newbie corp stations and nothing in themthey are sad and lonely places
please remember that bumping threads are prohibited according forum rule 12
i dont think jack was bumping i think he was highlighting a need for further exposure to a good idea and was very eager to garner more support by keeping this topic in the eyes of his peersif he was i am sure he meant no offence or to break any rules as jack is a very fine and upstanding player of eve that would never break any rulessaying that this is a good idea and i doubt it would break the the game to have a ship dedicated to the moving of other ships another isk sink that ccp is very fond of
i believe adding a bone or two  no pun intended  and mild weights as you suggested is all that it would take it does seem rather odd that they would store skeletons server side usually they would be stored on the local client to make rendering easier something like breast movement would strictly be a client side function not rendered by the server i wouldnt want ccp to open up the client to modding of the charactersthat leads to all sorts of problems
yes i like this ideaeither fix the damage mods on amarr drones or implement this ideaid be happy with either
i support this idea id always thought have it even simpler would help 1 jumpclone and skill level  how many times a day you could jump seemed simple enoughobviously youd get the whiny but i have slave implants in 6 jumpclones waaaah that would veto this idea no pun intended verone

thank you ccp for dealing with autopilot to station and the warping through planets additions that have been overdue for years those make my current predicament seem petty but in the interests of helping ceos encourage industryminded n00bs get into that career by allowing them to install jobs from the corporate hangars without needing factory manager role ccp needs to prioritize fixing the corporate roles as it currently stands the role factory manager is needed for many actions specifically cancel job whether it be rd or manufacturing and installing corporate jobsccp needs to alter that so the role to cancel a job is a separate role than install that will fix that problem this game is wonderful because of the element of risk but its also interesting because of the level of effort one needs to put into doing anything  please correct this insanely easy way to grief that scares any sane ceodirector from giving factory manager simply to allow someone to take advantage of those players skills in research and manufacturingtheres other things about corporation roles that needs work so an overhaul is strongly recommended at this time now that autopilot to stations and that eyesore of flying through planets has been solved
i think when talking about super caps we need to address super carriers and titans separatelysuper carriers are getting a lot better but titans are still waaaaaaaay too overpoweredas far as game design goes i think that dreads should be reworked to be the counter to titans mainly because all they are used for now is structure bashingfirst dreads need to be able to survive one titan doomsday zap that either means more ehp or a damage reduction into doomsdays second titans need to be more vulnerable id vote against boosting dread dps too much for fear of creating another overpowered ship id reduce the ehp of titans by a lotoh yeah fix titan tracking and get rid of the ewar immunityi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
why should combat ships have builtin penaltyfree wcs thats restricted to noncombat ships such as transports and that funny skiff thing if supercaps want to keep their infinistabs then their combat capabilities should be removed leaving them as giant logistics or ongrid ganglink vessels
eve uses directx like most games do porting it to opengl would be the only real cross platform solution however this wont happen since there is no business reason in doing thatwine emulates directx on top of opengl there is not much ccp could do to provide better emulation as what wine already providesgood intention but it wont happen sorry
so on one side we have few of users canceling their subscriptions which equals some small number of money for cpp and on the other side we have days and months of work and paying cpp workers to get linux running client for those small number of players i would rather lose small sum of money then pay large sum of money to keep getting small sum back yeah i am sorry for you but look buy a windows or continue emulating on linux why do you expect to get everything on a plate
1 im not the op2 ccp actually is pretty responsive they dont have a lot of resources dedicated to it but the development team is at least sympathetic and doesnt deliberately break stuff3 im the guy who doesnt want it on a plate if i was computing in easy mode i wouldnt have to pay extra to get windows
you must be a genius you are probably the first one that came up with this idea after all we all just use linux because we can not afford a windows license also i consider wine the superior win32 implementation and support for it isnt asked that much after all they support several implementations by microsoft that challenge each other for the title of the most broken osbtw what are you doing in the eve forums dont you have to fix uncle bob and his mums printer problems you windows genius
1 i didnt say you cant afford but somebody mention as a reason 100 so if that is your only reason would be easier to petition for 100 then to do whole game for another operating system2 i own both pc and mac and no i dont fix stuff for my relatives if you do  then thats your problem and i would like to see your uncle bob printing on linux3 if majority of users are windows users you can only expect windows versions of majority of software yeah windows are far from perfect i have both windows and lionos and both have advantages but this isnt one of those topic all in all to much effort and time would be needed to make linux client while there are many other issues which needs dev attention
frankly i dont care if ccp decided to start supporting linux again or not but it seems rather silly for them to devote that many man hours and resources to the small fraction of people that play on linux they would need to be making enough money off of said fraction of players to make it worth spending money on the resources to develop a linux client and maintain the support with each expansion i understood this to be the reason they dropped linux and even mac support and i doubt that has changed much
i will attempt to avoid the negativity in the thread and try to point out why your idea is misguided the idea at its core is based on two views that are fundamentally flawed  skills make a huge difference and bigger is better these are both woefully wrong but are unfortunately views that are held by most of the players that try starting an eve character what separates a successful happy eve character from someone who quits early on and the bittervets is that successful players have separated themselves from this viewpoint you obviously have not which means you are either a new player as some in this thread are professing or you are one of the paradoxical old players who for some reason continue to play a game that they fundamentally do not enjoyany new player who jumps into the game with the mentality from other mmos will fail there is no endgame and there is no grind between you and actually playing the game i feel this is something that gets ignored a lot since im tired of typing other mmos im just going to say wow since its what everyones thinking anyway with a new wow player with a freshly bought game you cannot do anything other than be led around from quest to quest and you cannot play with any friends until you reach max level the leveling experience is nothing but a grind you have to pay your dues so to speak in order to unlock the real game for someone who knows the game and knows the most efficient leveling path that is 5 days of played time for a new player who doesnt know how things work that can easily double but lets pretend its 5 days played time for someone who can log in two hours a day which is probably about average the basement virgin 12 hours a day dudes are offset by the huge numbers who can only play on weekends this means 60 days or two months before you can even play the real game at this point it is at least another 3 days played time probably more before you grind out enough gear to participate in whatever raid or pvp that your friends are doing well you can do the pvp but until you get the gear you will literally die after five steps that adds about another month giving us effectively three months before the average player can really do much with his friends now those friends can take pity on the newbie and run him through heroics to farm his gear effectively carrying him so lets ignore the gearing up portion and say two monthswhy did i lay that all out because its important eve offers new players the unique opportunity to do almost whatever they want within a couple days of playing yes highend pve content such as incursions wormholes or l4 missions will not be doable but each of these are only better ways to make isk anyway as someone earlier pointed out it takes very very little time to be a useful member of a pvp gang within a few hours of creating your character you could have a frigate fit with point web and mwd making you a tackler these are always useful members of a fleet within no more than 5 days you can have most skills relevant to a pvp frigate to level 3 or 4 giving you a solid frigate that can even contribute a bit of dps while tackling this is an opportunity unavailable in other mmos and unfortunately because new players are so used to how other mmos work they dont avail themselves of this opportunity the assumption amongst new players generally seems to be that if you cant fly a bs you wont be useful which is patently false but unless someone explains otherwise thats what youll keep believing for the lucky few that figure it out the universe opens up you can do whatever you want to do pretty much right from the start as long as your goals are realistic much like real life reallywhats all of this mean changing the skill system accomplishes nothing is what it means as was repeatedly pointed out the best autologout function that ccp could build can be circumvented easily with even a rudimentary understanding of script writing so effectively such a change does nothing to benefit anyone but will harm players who are unable or unwilling to write or download a simple script that keeps their character logged in while theyre off at work or asleep the only change that would actually accomplish anything would be to remake the skill system into a grindbased system that gives you sp for doing tasks basically an exp system from other mmos and i can guarantee you that such a change would murder eve so quickly that ccp wont even have time to ask what happened
yup they allowed making playlists unfortunately one cannot alter the current soundtrack playlist
seriously you necro a thread thats been dead a month to add in yep whats wrong with you
i have been in fleets of all machs logi and an off grid booster that can bang out a site in under 3 minutes and thats just joining random pubbie fleets20 sites an hour comes out to 200 mil an hourthats right folks if you get in a faction battleship fly to an incursion and hook up with the dudes in local  200 mil  hourno wonder nullsec is turning into a ghost town with the occasional tech moon fight here or therei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
nullsec becoming a ghosttown well i guess the endless hordes of noobs finally got tired of being exploited by their more advanced hierarchy that told them the good moons go to the alliance ie top brasstheres incursions in nullsec too and they pay much better i live in lowsec and have no trouble keeping in isk quit trying to make this game easier the rest of us like the challenge
i am sure that lots of players out there dont use cq because they like their ships and they like to spin them all the timeso where do i think we can improve thingsas it happen when you dock your focus changes to enter captains quarters button and if you were typing a message in chat just before you dock and press enter to send that message when you dock you will see loading bar and you will need to wait some time for your character to appear standing on suicide ledge in captains quarters sometimes you really need to dock up fast change ship and get out and this location change is really annoying since you need to wait additional time so suggestion is just remove the focus from that button
if you find yourself doing rushed dockundocks a lot disable cqfortunately it is also possible to set hotkeys to switch between cq and the hangar view while docked so you can have it turned off by default and switch to cq when you have time and want it
i have cq disabled but there is still that button which gets the fucus when you dock so it then switches to cq

perhaps issues and workarounds would be a better place to discuss the margin trading  market buy orders problem
i think option 2 or as you called it the complex option would be a great idea for new players to be able to experiencethe young never do as they are told the old never do as they say
ehh oopsbut as menace said i was just trying to keep this idea in the eyes of my peers to garner more support for something that would be extremely useful and nongame breakingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
each bank will be connected to a wallet division of a corporation or a players wallet it can only supply isk for approved loans if the wallet has the fundsto this end banks cannot generate isk out of thin air since they would need the isk to begin with the only isk that could be generated out of thin air would be the interest payable due to corp adjustable interest rates this is the profit the bank makes out of the loanbut to prevent abuse of interest spamming no trial accounts would be allowed to take out loans and if the character that took out the loan does not have the needed isk to repay the loan or is biomassed the bank will reclaim that isk from your non existent wallet and put it into a negative balance regardless of your characters status i also think it would be worth while to flag all characters that get loans approved this loan flag would prevent the character from being biomassed during the loan period or until the loan is repaid with interest dueloans will be subject to the interest rates they were approved under in this way a banking operation cannot extort more interest out of a loan than it agreed upon even if they hike their interest rates during the loan period this will not deter scamming tho since the banks should by setup be allowed to hide their interest rates from their would be loan shark victims in the making prior to signing the loan agreement once the agreement is signed any descriptions would be listed as such while the actual interest rate would be displayed along side it this would make finding reputable banks harder to find in a world of perpetual griefing pvping scamming and right down ruthlessness as much as security status is a part of jihadding so too should reputation be a part of banking all it would take is one post chainmail or eve news cast with less than favorable publicitywhile this suggestion is by no means a perfect system and would probably only serve as a foundation for expanding into the future beyond i believe this working version is pretty air tight for eve any cracks that could be identified and or exploited going forward should be considered a legitimate risk of banking much like scamming is a legitimate risk for trading
serverside skeletons would be necessary to support serverside portrait rendering and use of an avatar from more than one install of the client they cant not have them on the server there shouldnt be a gigantic amount of data in a skeleton or at least theres little enough that looking it up in the db and zapping a copy to the client takes a few seconds at most probably less than that all rendering and animation would be done on the client as youd expect
you would have to make a special exception for primarily concord based kills you dont want gankers shooting friends to scrape bounties when they die to suicide ganks
what kind of exception the whole point of a bounty system is to encourage other people to shoot at the guy who committed a crime against you suicide gankers will be the most likely candidates
i mean  normally when concord gets a kill any player who so attacked the victim of concords attack gets kill creditthey should not get bounty for this kill since concord did all the work as it would be easy for a friendly to use an agressive mod to ensure they got bounty prize on the kill helping offset the cost of their own ganks with bounty prizes
seems like a good idea and doesnt break anything 1
agreed would be convenient
sounds like a good idea
can be effectively done already with bank alts but bank alts shouldnt be necessary 1
strangely i like this ideayour drones are as good as your skills and you choose the damage type you want to fieldcreate more drone modules and rigsalso now that lag isnt so much an issue anymore with tidi allow a ship to field more than 5 drones with the proper modules to allow this
meh you would still be better off with hobgoblins it would be easier to tank the warrior iis which would off balance thingsme i say make the worst attributes tie for all drones
i also like the idea of having it just straight cut in half at level five thats 25 which makes the cooldown timer 18 hours which i believe is not really worth it if people are doing two ctas a day 18 hours will still conflict quite a bit 10 a level is good at level four the cooldown timer is 144 hours about fourteen hours and fifteen minutes which i think is more reasonable 1 from me 24 hours is ridiculous
your idea and view on how to reduce the time for jump clone use with out making it an easily exploitable system seems like a fair way it would give those that are mining and who want to be able to jump to a clone for pvp a chance to do so at a shorter time frame with out as you said letting people just create several clones to jump around through eve to do other things with little to no recoil from their choicethe young never do as they are told the old never do as they say
trouble with that idea is you still need to carry the can around with you if you want to use the bookmarks againtheres already a facility in ship fitting and market to export to a file held on your pc so why not have that for bookmarks then you wouldnt care too much about the limit as you could load the bookmarks on the flyjust a thought
i propose that the leadership of the goonswarm federation be detained on charges of war crimes comparable in scale to that of sansha kuvakei against the gallente federationminers in gallente sovereign space are a solid and highly valued constituent of our society should the goonswarm directorate be found guilty in court or in absence of ordering the interdiction and destruction of assets furthering the freedoms of the gallente peoples we ask that faction standings be adjusted sanctions be imposed to reflect the gallente peoples disapproval until such a time as damages equal to the value of destroyed vessels are paid to the office of the president via the devout and respected mining advocate chribbagallente law is hazy at best when dealing with the rights and restrictions of capsualeersi call upon the vocal and enthusiastic support of gallente loyalists capsualeers everywhere to support this action and make right the wrong done to our people iUFFFDm just playing with you guys the point is this in a sandbox  if you throw sand  donUFFFDt be surprised if you get some in your own eyes in a roleplaying game  if that is what this is  your actions should have consequences beyond game mechs in fairness arbitrated by game masters edit further much needed explanationedit nerfed the penalising faction standings language and replaced it with the more nebulous term sanctions see final thoughts
i think this would cause a problem for how some people choose to play the game some players like the freedom of being able to play how ever they want and not worry about such things only having to worry what the corporation of the person they attacked would do next if this sort of system was enacted it would change how the game is played on many different levels instead of people dueling it out in space over a contested action there would be court cases and sanctions that would hamper some players style of playingthe young never do as they are told the old never do as they say
i would hope so somethingawful has happened to how id like to play the game yes and no the game is already being played at this many levels and more check out how all the rp candidets have been knobbled in the csmquoteinstead of people dueling it out in space over a contested action there would be court cases and sanctions that would hamper some players style of playingquoteyeah its called being held accountable for your actions and being true to game lore there is nothing wrong with what goons have done there is nothing wrong with what im proposing pirates ask for ransoms all the time getting this proposal enforced without a shot being fired is how id like to play  but somehow dont think that is going to happen

what is even going on here am i being space subpoenaed now
with all due respect i have to disagree here whilst most of us dont go around talking rp style with for the empressfederationiskfalcon when we fly into battle we are all actually role playing here whether you realise it or notneither you nor i am actually spaceship captains i am not a ceo of a mighty warfaring corp of killers im a guy sat at a desk playing as one therefore to at least a small degree i am playing a role therefore am roleplayingso there it is folks technically we are all roleplaying to some degree the only variable is how deeply you roleplay most of us its just barely for sure but stilltake for example all the hard men on the forums they are almost all going to not be hard men in real life i bet drake draconis is a mild mannered guy who wouldnt argue face to face same as most people here so they are roleplaying on the forum behind the anonymity of the internet again roleplaying by definition being someone you arnt in real life
only if you want to bein all honesty ive lost interestlets all just go back to whatever mundane routine we were faffing with before
are we all roleplaying here to some extent yes theres no doubt about that however is this thread worthless yes also no doubt about that wtf is op trying to prove anyways eve is not about law order any of that crap if you want that space barbies are over there eve is about a sandbox its about pilots flying around in space trying to gain isk nothing more nothing less trying to bring some sort of new space court would be worthless bullshit also  even if you wanted to try this how would you actually extradite goonswarm leaders from nullsec you might as well extradite the pope from vatican city because he condones the abuse of altar boys which unfortunately wont happen either stupid ideas like this belong in features and ideas discussion not assembly hall
should not be allowed in combat or at worst should generate losskillmail or capitals and supercaps should have longer timers something to make it less appealing to the foolish
i have to disagree with this view point it should be at the choice of the player if they want to be able to self destruct during an engagement removal of this option would make the self destruct command nearly useless for there would be few other reasons to use ityou are not guaranteed the rights to a kill unless you can successfully make the kill this would be about as bad as how players of fps games like call of duty complained they only got the assist for a kill when putting a player in to final stand and not the points for the kill itselfif you do not finish off the kill you do not deserve the kill mail or the rights to itthe young never do as they are told the old never do as they say
i propose we remove this proposal from the assembly hall and move it to the trash binas a member of a small pvp corp you do not deserve to tackle a ship worth more in isk than your whole corps combined assetsvalid game mechanic working as intendedspace poor tears best tears
well linux has the same print facility macos has does it sucks to print with a macwhat some of us propose is the support of wine as a platform instead of a separate mac linux and windows client thats 1 client so it would produce less effort for ccp there would only be the windows client or win32 client or whateveralso it already works for years its just that it isnt officially supported
a linux user with no idea how commercial software works well i never
a commercial software user with no idea how software development workswell i never

i would like to propose an addition free cargo amount to the cargo windowpresumably as small popup when you mouseover the cargo bar in the top right cornerpros fasteasy to implementwould please a lot of peopleconsnoneprecious time taken from other projects
the only thing harder than math is making basic ui features
it is relatively small fix that would benefit a large community similar to how the cargo bar was implemented too in fact i think implementing cargo space bar was harder that implementing this mouse over

i remember some year ago some old player say to me you began really to play at eve when you have about 12 m sp and this is true the new player must be have the possibility to add some extra skill point when they began eveexemple some new storyline or epic arc when the player have finish them give them some extra sp to atribute maximum 4 epic arc to add some extra sp if you have less then 6m spfirst epic arc give 1m sp about 60 mission to dosecond epic arc give 075 m sp about 60 mission to dothird epic arc give 050 m sp about 60 mission to dolast epic arc give 025 m sp about 60 mission to doall mission must be in empire or the last epic in lowmission you can have the choice between mining trading or fightingextra skill point if you make the 4 epic arc  25m speve need new player but a lot of new player stop eve because its really difficult to began
fixdand yes im sure you didnt mean thatbut that is what i think needed to be said p stop the evemail spam
in my opinion whole war declaration system should be change or rather split1 if target corporation have hq office or pos in low sec should be totally free war zone there its outlands where law dont exist or are just rules of borderlands where you must take care about yourself by self where everyone fight for they place resorces systems and defend they interest by own without empires above2 if target corporation have hq pos in high sec aggresor should get standing hit to faction under what target have hq or pos also hit into security standing because you start war in zone where law exist3 casus belli system if someone steal something kamikaze you or do other stupid activity than your corp get casus belli to punish such corporation even in high sec without restriction of point 2because if some corporation waste time to upgrade standing to some faction and start pos under they wings so why some bored people can easy declare war to us for silly small price let be more war declaration restrictions if someone want to fight and test his pvp abilities why he dont search equal fight in low sec mainly this high sec wars looks like this that bunch of old bored eve veterans killing some random carebear fresh players not everyone have hard lower of backs or so many isk at start to handle heavy losssorry for bad english
i would not really call that an exploit but instead smart thinking and planning it is always a good idea to keep your isk earning toon in a npc so it can not be wardeced so it can support the toon in the corp being wardeced that is just smart business management therethe young never do as they are told the old never do as they say
youve been allowed to make playlists for as long as ive been playing eve which is over a year and a half i think i found that feature on day 2 nice one op
the idea of ship mass being prohibitive isnt necessarily an issue we are talking about a tug after all which is really nothing more than a cockpit and engines with a framework in between to attach ships not really a terribly large amount of mass there the anchor points wouldnt even need to be enclosed you dont see it with towtrucks or even most auto trailers for semis and this is basically the same idea
a tug ship for the rivers of space sort of like how a river barge needs a tug to tow or push it along but in this case the ships are housed within the tug if i am understanding correctlyit could be a novel idea and would facilitate moving fleets around easier and would open up a new market i agree no launching from the bay would need to dock up at a station before the ships could be unloadedi think the 06 should only be on a t2 variant though or it would be to strong against a fleet trying to lock it down once the skill was maxed outno on jump drive for a t1 variant but maybe on t2 variant it would be feasible the young never do as they are told the old never do as they say
this is a great idea not that it will benefit me personally since i live in wh but its still a great idea 1
look at it this way im an average null sec grunt i have a ton of ships all fitted out and i need to go on deployment i want to move a bunch of them in one go and i dont want to repackage them so i can send them via jfright now i can do it in a carrier which is great but thats all what i use my carrier for and it doesnt fit that many rigged ships in it when were talking battleships sizeswe sort of already have it its a carrier what i think we need is another carrier type for each race which has a much large ship maintenance bay but reduced or removed drone bay and a different set of bonuses to reflect its role
as a hisec missioner id love to see this i change my base of operations from time to time following contacts or for rp its a gigantic pain in my backside to jump each of my ships system to system from a to b while also having to plan on bringing enough shuttles with the first transport so i can shell game my way back and forth until theyre all moved i already have a mammoth for hauling goods to rens for sale and for shuttling my own cargo with plans to upgrade to a prowler for losec runs if i could have something analogous for my personal fleet it would simplify things immensely and let me get on with the business of blowing things upexcellent idea i hope to see it shake out in the ship reorg
why thank youi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
as a 10 pirate i think this is a good ideai cant tell you how many people hesitate to join us for low sec pvp with the thought of never going back to hisec so this would be great to get a lot of people to pew withthe real pirates could still grab pods which would make ransoming into a more formal affair so only the higher ups who have high sec alts would point the pod and prepare for ransoming rather than everyone pointing it and someone always shooting by accident before the ransom is initiated hate when that happens along with this everyone who shoots without aggression will slowly get a negative sec status which by your change can thus be shot at without penalty therefore everyone in lowsec who shoots at those who are non agressed can have fair pvp rather than those upstarts that religiously keep their sec status just above 5 so they cant get shot at without penalty but still kill stuff frequently in low sec as well low sec shouldnt prevent frigate warfare currently you cant use them on gates 90 of the time because you will get instapopped but now people who actively pvp in lowsec will have a negative sec status so frigs would be viable to shoot them i dont see why a shiptype should be blocked off to a large extent frigate warfare is great fun and this change would make going out in an assault frig gang in search of other negativeseccers an actual valid option for pvp not saying it should be possible to camp a high sec gate with interceptorsthat would take away the classic hic pilot fittings needed to point people quickly which are a great part of low secmoreover this proposal reinforces a style that does not force people to have multiple accounts just to be able to function this is good only thing is there would still need to be a scout for high secsupportedtundragon  low sec piracy since 2003  youtube  join us
if everyone has a maximum of 2 everyone can just go into high sec and follow them unless they have true 10 from killing pods which is understandable assuming pirates shot at you first you have the right to aggress them be it high sec or low sec if you shot them first and they ran awaythats your own error if a pilot successfully deagresses and jumps through a gate they should deserve to get away anyways be it into high sec or not tundragon  low sec piracy since 2003  youtube  join us
this isnt going to fix lowsec it will make it easier to pvp lowsec  which would fill it with predators feasting on predators an unnatural sht storm that will keep all but pvp players from going to lowsecwe need to bring all types of pilots to lowsec for many reasons not just pvp precisely if you want consequence free pvp regardings sec status you can go to nullsec join a war in highsec become a mercenary or go to low and only engage flashiesyou and i are on the same page and this too i have been ranting lately that the falloff from 5 to 4 is way too steep when it comes to risk i beleive there should be some relevant risk from 6 all the way down in varying degrees to 1  risk of attack from other players and risk to those agressors as wellfor example pirates cannot go on a raid into 5 and 6 systems without getting completely demolished by concord as a consequence but in 4 there are only gate and station turrets to worry about if there were roaming npc naval patrols in 4 the risk of unprovoked attacks on say miners could be noteworthy but perhaps still worth it same for 5 sec  perhaps a very minimal concord presence in 5 would bring the shadey types out of low and  the power of concord should be put into the hands of real players to some extent there needs to be player based faction police forces where combat pilots of good standing can patrol 6 to 1 and get paid doing itminers with good empire standing need to be able to transmit a systemwide distress beacon to call in either the npc or player based patrols patrols with police licenses what this would do is add a nice spectrum and variety to the borders of empire space especially as police patrols are on the move playing cat and mouse with raiding piratesyahsee  piracy in eve is starting resemble less and less true piracy piracy in rl can be defined as theft on the high seas  translateably in eve to theft in deep space there arent enough soft targets for pirates why cant we make lowsec more like the wild wild west yah got treasure seekers gold diggers outlaws sheriffs gunfighters train robbersthats what i want
fantastic idea dont see a downside
well the problem here is that lowsec is still empire space supposedly  some technology from concord is still big brother  watching you and pulling your sec status down as you commit criminal acts it as if the law still applies but there is no one there to enforce it that is what is brokenbut otherwise sure players should be able to work for these npc pirate groups and maybe get a tatoo d but also stand to profit from doing work for them
i am with you except for the above  hmm so this means that ratters and miners will be far more deterred from lowsecyah know your scaring off all my sheep and i dont like it one bit it might work ifif see my solution about distress calls 2  3 posts back
this change would benefit the gameplay of casual pvpeven tho such changes would go against the eve storyrp background those things should never get in the way of good gameplay in mmo the story part has to revolve around gameplay not other way around
i am just a noob nobody compared to you but you of all people cannot see the flaw of this ive heard you say at the last csm debates on everadio that mining although miners are at the bottom of the food chain is one of the most important aspects of the game and i beleive you were one of those who beleives the reward for missioning and mining needs to be increased in lowsec this proposal will destroy the prospects of new miners coming to low even if the rewards were increasednow since i am newbish  can someone please assuage my concerns i feel as if i am standing in front of a stampede that is about to run off a cliff

we see eye to eye on a lot of things but this we do not this eve mail spam problem is so infrequent and cspa charges are fine as isive spent a lot of time tooling around in major trade hubs and eve mail spam is so incredibly rare i might receive on average about one per week and my cspa charges are turned off i dont know what youre doing to receive the amount of eve mail spam but youre obviously doing it wrongim guessing youre angry that a csm candidates sent mass emails out to anyone and everyone asking for votes summary of eves last four expansions

yeah but you need to relog then all the time even if you have 2 different accounts chances are you still need to relog
i really do want to reply with the obvious thats what your regular wallet is for but i can see how it might actually be useful for budgeting purposes i tend to spend all my isk forgetting i was saving some of it for something else1 just because this cant possibly be very hard to implement and doesnt detract from anything else in the game

logging on to an inactive skill queue is one of the worst things about evethis commonly happens because of loss of internet broken pc or unexpected afkpersonally im a truck driver so some times i can only log in once a week this makes it very hard to train skills taking over 24 hours ccp wont increase the queue time and you cant change skill training on a mobile device both of these would be the best solutionmy proposal is for skill points to accumulate at the base rate whenever the skill queue is inactive these skills points would then be available as unallocated skill points
not saying it is a bad idea but it has been suggested many times before and has been shot down just as many times frankly i dont see why notother than because ccp wants you to log into the game most people will just call you lazy stupid or just tell you to queue a longer train while you are out personally i think it would be useful to have a pot of unallocated sp when you forget to set your train i think perhaps the sp should gain at a reduced rate though
yes i know training queues are brought up a lotlike many people i didnt have a problem with them when i had daily access to the eve clienthow ever in the last 12 months ive lost a load of training time because of work commitments internet problems and pc breakdowns yes we known people will exploit longer queues the same people that will bot their way to sc glory no doubt why penalise the many for the crimes of the fewthe train a longer skill argument is valid to a point how do you suggest i get to the longer level 5 skills though when typical the lvl 3  4 skills take more than 24 hours but less than 5 days to train these i lose a few days training time per week trust me im not lazy ive spent 7 months juggling long skill buts its very frustrating when you want to train for the current alliance fit and it takes months instead of a few weeksyes i was suggesting a reduced rate so its at least some compensation to those of us who pay for account but only play at weekends or have long afk times
the skill queue is intended to allow players who are actively playing the game to avoid 3am wakeup calls for those pilots that are too obsessed with the game youve been at work thats great im glad that you have a job and things to do in this struggling economy remember first and foremost that eve is a game not a job you missed some training and youre mad about it then youre missing the point the point of the game is to have fun unallocated sp is always a bad idea except for the rare case when ccp deletes a skill such as the learning skills and is simply for people who want fotm right away paying for an account doesnt guarantee you sp it guarantees you the opportunity to earn those sp if you actively log in and play enough to update your queue also not to trollflame but in 2012 with the fact that wireless is nearly everywhere and a decent laptop is cheap i dont believe that you dont have the option of bringing a computer with you and occasionally you can take 5 minutes when youre at a rest stop that has wifi to update a queue if youre not willing to do this its fine however its a choice that you make and that you need to deal with  its not a game problem its a user problem tldr nope never going to happen ps  please use the search function on the forums  this has been suggested countless times and is always shot down also this belongs in features and ideas not the assembly hall
better make the skill queue 3 skills or 24 hours whichever is longer
not a terrible ideabut likely wont flyeve should still require interaction on some levelbut as far as this idea is concernedill keep a neutral stance stop the evemail spam
im not mad about it im putting forward a view from personally experience and from what i hear from people on commsthe skill points system is full of contradiction and annoys many eve playerstroll  flame responsei live in england and i can tell you that eve capable laptops certainly arent cheapif i could park a 50ft vehicle in mcdonalds car park to take advantage of their wifi then i would because wireless internet isnt cheap eitheryou also have no idea about trucking rest stops not in this economic climate parking is roadside because nobody will pay for parking thats if laptops are allowed many companies dont allow them because they are fire risk flatten batteries and have adverse affects on a drivers rest time
i agree that interaction is essential thats why im not directly calling for 7 day queue im suggesting that a small accumulation of sp equal to perhaps the sp per hour that a new player experiences would ease the frustation of inactive skill queues
if i had to hazard some sort of acceptible levelperhaps a 10 of the whole sp acculimationan encouragemnt to be activebut you wont be pissed if you miss a dayreason i start very lowbecause we dont want this to turn into an char bazar where people get toons with a shitton of sp to spend stop the evemail spam
ccp stated once that the reason why the skill queue is limited to only 24 hours is to get players to actively log in and play the game but ccp missed the point entirely shocking i knowlogging in to adjust skill queue then logging off does not constitute player activity ingame so yes im all for this change to the skill queue especially since im active duty military and occasionally go on lengthy deployments with zero internet accesssummary of eves last four expansions
agreedbut as i saidif its done impropperlywell you think rmt is badyou aint see nothing yet stop the evemail spam
i notice that over last several months ccp put some effort into improving actual gameplay but they completely ignored all the cyno mechanics stuffwhy is it still acceptable to have disposable kestrels that can light a cyno and let unlimited number of ships jump thru instantlywhy is it still possible to jump thru cyno instantly when it lights up even 15 second delay would be enough to bring some level of balancwhy is there still no way to prevent cyno activation on tactical level no short range cyno jammers no module at all to prevent the enemy from lighting up and channeling a fleet instantlycyno travel is supposed to be more strategic than tactical and like everything else in the game its supposed to have some counters other than a system wide jammer that can only be installed by defending alliance i can understand if the players fail to see the flaw of this design but why cant the devs see it how can ccp still not see after years of the problem getting worse and worsenot asking for anything radical here just some delay in jumping and some short range counter module and maybe even up the cyno module requirements so kestrels cant use them
id ask why is the above a problemim aware of a few issuesnone of them listed in your postand i keep hearingseeing cyno ships get vaped and trust meits a pita when your on the other side of the damn cluster to get it replaced stop the evemail spam

the tracking of a blaster erebus with 3 tracking links fitted with tracking scripts is pretty much the same as that of a maelstrom using 1400 howitzers so i dont see how a ship moving at a higher transversal velocity would get hit i also dont see anything bad with this given it scales properly with turrets of other sizes
hi everyonei hope im bringing this to the right place earlier today in jita local someone said if one voted for darius iii hesherecieved a plex so while not expecting it to be true i contacted darius iiihimself and to my suprise he confirmed the deal well i gave it a shot and it turned out to be a scam no sht my question here is simple is it legal for darius iii to harvest votes throughscammingyoursrobin
so your first idea is to post a link to vote for darius iii i smell a troll looking for people to click the link without realizing that itll vote for himand while i dont think its technically against the rules to scam for csm votes i think its a pretty dirty practice and that i would never vote for someone whos trying to scam for votesoh and if you want to be taken seriously dont post on an alt
darius is that youwellit is eve and scamming is a legitimate business in eve i guess that just goes to show youif he is willing to lie to get in the csm then how could he possibly keep his word as to what he intends to do with the csmthis is also an idiotic grab for votes for darius you fail try posting with your main darius
first of all i just questionned the legitimacy of the vote harvesting thats all this is not an alt related to darius iii or anything close i removed the link since it apperently serves no additional value to this thread just read and answer the goddamn question thank you very much
rly its your fault youre dumb scaming is alowedbtw should we make separate topic everytime someone was scamed in jita
and another joins the ranks of incompetants did i say something similar to omg ive been scammed blablabla no i just wondered if he was allowed to harvest votes through in game scamming you following me so far just checking capiche
nope stop the evemail spam
wtf is this in assembly hall damnit drake that thunder was mine sniff
i only used 1 wordnot like you couldnt upstage me  stop the evemail spam
given that its how he very publicly got his votes to get into csm6 and they didnt change the rules yes it is totally legitalso if you had taken a quick look at general discussion or crime and punishment you would have seen several threads alot like this one which is why you are getting trolled alot
thank you tallian that is what i needed to know
so now vote scamming is allowed are you freaking kidding me scamming in game fine but scamming your votes to a csm place is not
your missing the pointscamming is legitimate as far as eve is concernedbeing fooled into thinking your going to get  for doing  just means your a dumbthats no different than paying ransom to not get poddedthere is absolutely nothing wrong with thatbecause you chose to respond and make that decision stop the evemail spam
sorry but i have to completely disagree scamming for votes to get on the csm is going a little too far
againyou fall for the scamyou deserve to get scammedso point there ofdont stop the evemail spam
im all for scamming and the victims of scams deserving it for being stupidhowever a csm candidate who is votescamming just seems a bit shady even for eve players definitely in the grey area as to whether its allowed or not ccp might have to chime in on this one for or against it in the same way they needed to chime in on dust514 beta key scammingsummary of eves last four expansions
the issue people are hinting at is use of metagaming to get votesits testament to their agendaand all it means is they dont give a  about youthey just want their free ticket to icelandlike it or notccp wont stop itunless its an actual exploitabuse of game mechanicscase and pointspammingim not itnerestd in picking apart the idiot that did itim interested in preventing its abuse for anythinganyone else as a resultthis therad is a jokeas ive pointed outits no different than ransomingjust because they said you wont get poddeddoesnt mean you wontno one said you had to vote for himgetting bribed is a clear sign that you dont deserve to vote at that ratethe true idiot here is the one who fell for itnot the one who initiated itits eve onlinethere are no gaurentees stop the evemail spam

as if you are one to talk you rarely if ever have any clue at all as to what you try to talk about i say try because really all you do is come on the forums and start raging and flaming at people like a prepubescent child and then stomp and cry about things that dont go your way this is what i get for clearing my blocked listi was however incorrect in my statement of mac not being supported

if you can figure out how to operate and configure linux you can figure out how to get windows on your computer for a lot less than 100 bucks hard drive space is so cheap its not even funny but no lets expect a company to bend over backwards for just a small percentage of its users that way theyll have less time to fix the issues that apply to all of us
sure they canthat isnt the point wine can easily be used to run eve the problem is that eve doesnt run very well on wine the solution is to either make a client that runs better through wine or make one for linux so wine is no longer needed it is a legitimate complaint but from a very small portion of eve playersi remember when they announced they would no longer support linux a few years back at fanfest they said the linux userbase was something like 002 of all eve players just wasnt worth the time or money
why because i am not an ignorant dipshit and can admit when i am wrong unlike you i actually think about things i say how others may feel about the topic and try not to treat others with disrespectyou being the obvious exception to that
i build my own computersa windows license costs around 100i could in theory get windows for less than the retail price but id either have to put more than 100 worth of my time into it or get it illegally that and not having used windows regularly in over a decade its actually easier for me to fix wine problemsymmv hand
i would love to be able to separate my ships out into t2bsby race etc  trawling thru the entire hangar for the correctly fitted recon is annoyingpretty pleasethanks

why not just name your ships and then use the search box to find that particular named ship just make sure no two ships have the same namethe young never do as they are told the old never do as they say

a ship that carries things perhaps instead of a tugclass vessel we could call them carriersfor highsec its called a freighter the charon is pretty much as big as you can get without being able to fit packaged capital ships it can fit 3 bcs like you suggest just fix the whole thing with not being able to haul it without using a courier contract and everything is fine
this needs to go into the game11000 if i could
great idea and a great proposalthis is like building an entirely new game but would fit really well with the ever expanding eve universei would have to say that there would be very little chance of ccp doing this just based on the massive amount of work it would be but even a striped down version would add so much depth the the eve universe and it could always be upgraded to what you propose gradually over several expansionsthat is if eve survives the implementation of dust 514
i guess the question i would have is why are we worried about low sec mining you could put low refineries at 900 output and the life expectancy of a hulk in low sec would still be about 5 secondsi think he addresses the real issue people dont spend a lot of time in low because fighting back at any length means not going back to high sec not everyone wants to spend tons of time managing sec status eliminating this worry will encourage casual pvpedit if anything giving people more freedom to fight will encourage them to even try mining since they are allowed to protect themselves
if a miner or missioner doesnt agress of course they can protect themselves just as things are now they just cant jump or dock for 1 minute and if its a criminal they can even shoot first i see no problem with this nowand yes the current state of the game has no benefit to lowsec mining for that you have to go to nullsec i would bet that this will be fixed in the near future this will diversify lowsec and provide targets for real piracy occasional greedy miner and large mining operations for the well organized minersthis proposal is great for pvp certainly it is but if the goal is to bring a diversified group into lowsec as the csms have stated over and over is an agenda then this will not do itif this goes through i hope i am wrong and if you can tell me why i am wrong then maybe i will not be so concerned
youre right about the mechanic as it stands now there is nothing particularly broken the issue is making it appealing to as many people as you can changes to mineral quality will only get so many people to enter low sec that are not already there since any mining op would need enough protection to fend off any amount of pirate attacks very few corps could or would be willing to pull that off given how saturated low sec is with pirates someone like aaa could match anything you put out there and would love doing so it would just be a lossif you start eliminating the major objections people have to spending real time in low sec you will begin to see more people there you will also dilute the danger posed by aggressors simply because there are a lot more targets which will make things like industry and mining more feasible to more corporations creating even more targetsyou can already make a lot more isk in low sec than you ever could in high sec through mission running exploration and pi that still doesnt bring people in doing something with the security status hit will imo

well there is an option to stop ppl contacting you from a direct chat perspective there should be one also for mailsbut you can of course have checkboxes that allow corpallianceperhaps use the same functionality as the fleet finder filter
simpler fix let me set any chargecurrently maxes at 5mil iirc and let me have the isk that is chargedif you dont mind you contacting me i will happily refund to 100 mil isk cspa charge and if it was unsolicited mail sent out to 200 names on a list i get 100 mil for dealing with it
aside from the obvious well duhim talking about stopping the first initial mail smnot the second stop the evemail spam
thisi dont think anyone will speak out against something like this not game breaking just allows an extra level of personal organisation if one so wishes the ability to turn it on off or just be able to add divisions at will up to maybe a maximum of like 5 or something
this proposal is already here for like 3 yearskeep coming those spam threats
i loved the idea when it was proposed by the devs and hope it can be implimented soon 1
i had a similar problem the other day lost a few hours sp due to unforeseen circumstances but its only a game a thousand sp here and there wont make any great differenceas much as it would be great to log in from a mobile phone just to change the skill queue i dont think it would be that great for the game overallyou may say why punish us all for the crimes of the few that would abuse it but the fact is once you put temptation in peoples way they will useabuse itskill queue is fine as it is real life comes first and sp should be the least of your worries in this worldand not meaning to troll or be funny op but you dont work 24 hours a day so why wouldnt you be able to change the skill queue at worst you will suffer the loss of a few hours as i did
but it does make the average online numbers bump up which in turn makes the game look busier which is what ccp wants in hopes of attracting more players
character selling is unlikely to be an issue as i suggested an accumulation rate equivalent to a new player a character seller would get far quicker results with cheap implants
wrongstop thinking short term stop the evemail spam
skill queue editing via eve gate or api pleaseproblem solved
i would like this idea betterif i recall there was even a dev blog commenting on this being possible not to long ago
i would love to see a striped down client that could be installed on the android or i phonethis client could allow market access for order updates access to skill training eve mail chat channels etc but not capable of undocking or flying a shipeven just give us access to skill ques and mail etc through api and we can develop our own apps to handle the rest
you have access to the mailpart through evegate maybe adding a basic function to add skills to the training queue though that would likely be too much of a botherbut i support having an eveonline lite for tablets and smartphones i dont know how often it wouldve been handy to have a small client to chat to corpmates while forced out on shopping might actually make it worth going to those hugeass malls with wifihotspots
this is actually among the most pressing issues in my agenda i suggest you check it out m8being supporters of free speech and free and open csm elections we removed fon revedhort from eligibility ccp april 2013
i completely agree a spool up timer on a cyno 15 seconds would honestly be a good amount of time a bridge on top of a fleet would likely diea bridge off gird but close couple hundred thousand km would give quick fleet hacs just enough time to get there and pop it before ships start coming througha bridge a few au out would allow fast ceptors to get there and have a small chance of popping a small shipa bridge many au out already gives the fleet a lot of warning of incoming shipswith a spool up timer i dont think a small anti cyno field is neededhowever portable system wide one might not be badnot sure to be honesti definately think it should be a little bit more dynamic though not many fleets fly around through gates any more p
why would you think that any of this would be a good idea
i think someone got hotdropped by a cyno kestrel
i think its worth a look into by ccp force projection is a big issue in eve right now this might help tone a bit of it down
cynos placed on ships made of paper machUFFFD and prayers function quite well the ship dies to a single volley from my tornado for example and thanks to server latency only a fraction of the enemy fleet manages to enter system to be brutally butcheredi cant support any proposition that makes it more difficult for our enemies to get into a fight with us
certificates arent award they are more like a gradei think ccp underestimate power of medals for example if they had add medal for n kills on a certain ship this would increase an interest for not popular ships we all know how screwed low tier battlecruiserscruisers now if ccp would made medals here wont be so much pink pony 1337 pwnz noobsstyle medals and if displayed they will actualy show that owner deserves some respectalso medal management might be improved so players could removehiderename medals
to be honest i think the best thing ccp can do for target callers is to make the broadcast target and remove battleship from overview not be right beside each otheri think anybody whose fcd using broadcasts has misclicked
especially when you open up the ol hangar go make some coffee read the newspaper walk the dog fix yourself some breakfast and maybe just maybe itll be loaded when you get backmost of you likely dont experience this special version of hell but those with slow internet connections or extremely large hangars our people who fit rifters feel a marvelous variety of pain when they open theirs have a tough time of itive recently heard that people who live in wormholes have this hit them especially hard the problem with this is we all know its a problem but we dont know how big of a problem it is i suspect this problem is huge and needs a lot of attention but id like for you guys to tell us a bit about how this affects youinformation gathered for this will be used to determine if this is an issue we need to focus attention on as player reps or if its a fringe issue that can be fixed when people have spare time if you feel strongly about this either way please post in this thread and tell us how it impacts you
i think its a database caching issue that cant be fixed i personally resolved it with a very large number of station warehouses to sort things intoincluding the one i keep my station warehouse bpo in
dont worry about this part for now the results of the thread will be helpful regardless of your opinions on this one
we noticed this when corp bookmarks were created and we were transferring over tons of bookmarks to get our building corp a copy of all our important spotsanyway this bug is very noticeable when you have a ton of bookmarks in a hangar or any bookmarks for that matter edit it doesnt seem to matter if those bookmarks are in cans or in that hangar something about the bookmark item bugs any kind of item holding containerthe whole way eve organizes items in game is pretty rough folders would be great not just containers folders trying to load 1000s of items cant be good for any interface systemdual pane idea click
i always try to keep my personal hangar tidy and lowasset but i do experience this issue on our corp hangars its really tiring to have to wait for a long time on each hangar load until you can see whats in there
i came across this issue being in rvb and buying stuff to fit 10 incursus 20 catalysts and 6 vexors and i am sure this is small compared to manyso yes there is station warehouses and cans where you could dump this stuff the problem with this which would apply to folders too is that i found that i was loosing stuff  i would accidentally drop a gun in my ammo can etc  and wonder where the hell it wentif there were tabs or quick and easy filters the problem would be solved i sense that ccp may already be looking at this
have to agree here this idea is most definitely posted in the wrong forumsif you are really being serious why would anyone want to even do this people would honestly want to roleplay a space lawyer judge bailiff etc do paperwork rather than shoot things and making things blow up in spacei personally think this would be the dullest thing bar mining sorry miners ever in the history of gaminggo make your own game of lawyers in space if you want it that muchthis does just smack of more antigoon propaganda they play the game their way and have fun doing it learn from themi am not a goon alt before anyone asks
perhaps iUFFFDm not explaining myself clearly this was never an argument i could win by winning and iUFFFDd like to thank you for taking enough interest to post this thread was raised not to ask for a new feature it was to to give an example of the weakness in a fundamental assumption that eve is a mmorpgwhat the discussion above demonstrates is how hostile eve online has become to roleplay by subscribers some people just donUFFFDt get it when anyone other than a gm takes the part of of an npc entityin my discussions in korvinUFFFDs campaign thread it became clear to me that the only rpers that could gain respect are those that are willing to fight for sov holdings in nullsec empire loyalists in empire space are just not coolthis thread raises awareness of the situation for ccp and the csm to discuss in accordance with ccp spitfires stickied so you want to raise an issue  proposal tips and faqs topichowever i do agree with the mittani that there are much more pressing issues and that must be addressed for the term of csm7 rpers will live out their fantasies whether you like it or not it would just be nice if ccp rp dept were better supported more fully staffed and nudged the static areas of highsec more often in response to player actions
to answer the question noone has asked yet from my rp perspective mining and ratting bots are no different to any other ai in the game they represent lives in the eve universethe reason i picked on goonswarm for my opening tirade was because in interdicting ice miners in highsec they stepped into my world this is me paying back the complement i could have easily have chosen hulkageddon as the focus but helicity is not around to be irked
yes rp should be in the rp forums i apologise for dismissing you out of handi was being overly defensive because i expected your reactionthis thread is not about asking for a new featureit is not about asking goonswarm to play space court with meit is about asking the csm to investigate why highsec appears to be a rp deadzonethe mitanni and the goons just make a handy targets soz guys
or to put it even more simplywhat does it take to get the bloody titanic squddie out of luminare dont explain your philosophy embody it UFFFD epictetus
me rping as a lawyeralso we all know the only way to kill a titan is with more titans so that one is untouchable edit btw empire loyalist rpers are pretty welcome in fw
i dont think you need a trading hauler pilot on the front lines but thanks for the offer geana tem my alt has already spent some time bringing liberty to historically significant ouperia and will be again when stuff gets fixed
someone has to haul pos eggs and the like to the front lines to be staging areasmight contact some of those fw corps and get some blue standings so you can haul supplies to their markets
if we can have drones used for personal defense or defense of a specific other ship in fleet why not set them for fleet defense in general they can focus fire on the target that would be the groups best weakest target if flying pvp the fc may do this same thing order all drones on a target if pve or mining instead of everyone having to f their drones on the target have them set to auto defend the fleet in general so why not add a feature where you can pool your drones into defending the fleet in general instead of a specific ship you know have all the drones defend fleet and focus fire so all drones knock out rats no matter who in the fleet they attack
this would be an awesome feature to have but would at the same time make afk mining and bot mining much safer i can not in good faith support a feature that would be so easily exploited by bots and afkers no matter how much i might like it
trebor daehdoowi do not appreciate nor will i tolerate you mass spamming characters for your election also your link   use this url to vote for me 
yeah i have to say im really not a fan of the spam mail myself it seems like a pretty weak propaganda scheme
me neither but you dont have a cspa charge for nothing so u can solve the problem yourself
one message is not spamtrebor is a great guy we need him on the csm to balance out alexs ego
cspa charges dont work if you send to a group
i tend to agree but getting unsolicited mail advertising him for csm forced me to choose seleene as the superiour choicewho didnt send me an email advertising himself that i had to scroll through a page and a half of other peoples names to get to the body offelt just like the junk mail my dear ol mom forwards me only without a punchline or a cute picture of a cat
i guess you really dont understand do you ok not everyone has a cspa charge and if they do they have a small amount set as its not feasible to set it at a high amount for obvious reasons so he would only need to spend a few million isk to spam 1000s of people not a bad trade off is itwhat gets me is how did he get all the information was it from evewho because he even spammed alts that i dont really use or have used his statement that he selected people is absolute nonsense what he prob did was get info from evekill to get the corp names and alliances that are active then using evewho information spam everyone in that corpalliancetbh i dont mind too much i guess its only one mail but if he constantly spammed or i got spammed by all csm candidates i prob be pied then
its a great tradeoff if the cspa charge is never applied which they arent when you send to a group of people instead of individuals go ahead and try it
you got one email you will get over it
yes it is spam  unsolicited mailalso i got it on every single alt i own thats just annoyingtrebor i like your platform but your methods are distasteful
i too got this mail on a number of altswhen asked his thoughts on certain aspects of eve or on ideas he responds with cant do it now the votetoo busy spamming for votes to do your jobmmmmkay
this stop the evemail spam
this is spamdo you hate it
yes the single eve mail i got has crushed me i have been left utterly unable to do a thing due to the gigantic sapping of effort caused by this one single eve mail i trust no one sends me another solitary mail about something or i may be outright killed by the sheer magnitude of spam that one eve mail is
are you sure you want to increase the time it takes to create titians i mean the man spent two years on the assunta isnt that long enough
ccp beat us to making a new topic about removing ship tiers and changing allot of everything with shipshere is a link
to be totally fair how is scamming for votes any worse than an alliance coercing its members and their alts to vote for their candidatethe csm is really just a sounding board for ccp to listen to peoples views from the front lines just because someone is on the csm it doesnt mean that they will get anything changed any changes are still down to ccp ccp will do whats in their interests as a business and if they can make nice changes along the way that makes players happy then thats just peachy
this being eve its legal to gather votes by scamming blackmail intimidation extorsion payment pier pressure campaigning torture sexual favours bribery false promises true promises selling your soul and possibly human sacrifice
there is no grey area its its clear cut black and white scamming is allowed got d3 into the csm last year and people complaining about it just makes sure his constituentsthe scammers and griefers of eve know he is still doing his thing and so they will vote for himsomething to be aware of not all the people posting that he scammed him are real people he got caught sock puppeting once last year iirc i wouldnt be surprised if some of these threads are the same thingedit to be clear d3s whole platform is that scamming and griefing are good and should remain an core part of eve and so he runs his campaign as a giant scam
who are we kiddingthey all sock puppet stop the evemailUFFFDspam
over in the ship rebalance thread i found evidence that ccp yttrbium is snot shot as well as noticing another alt he accidentally posted on
the self destruct should remain in placeone reason for it is so that if someone is being a massive  and is clearly going to kill you but wont he cant hold you there for the entire dayimagine if there wasnt a self destruct option people would grief by just holding someone tackled forever this is augmented by the new logoff mechanicsso no there should always be a self destruct option availablehowever i do agree that a killmail should still generate
i usually finish that mission in about three salvos because i read the instructions and shoot the conveniently placed barrel of explosives not the station sorry about having a laugh at your expense
was gonna say  stop the evemailUFFFDspam
sorry op but the blurb for the mission does tell you what to do to complete this mission before you die of old agenow if only i could place those barrels next to a red pos
remove the barrels and note in the description that this is what sov warfare is like
bumpedif hans gets a seat he will no doubt look more into this
iirc the cspa charge doesnt go to the char its an isk sink
this is currently true hence my proposal for a simpler fix i dont think it works that way now i think it should work that way
i would love this if it was the caseinfact i dare say id be quite content to receive spam mail if it cost them a fortune stop the evemail spam
having seen that more than one csm candidate spammed people for votes ive changed my mind and will support this nowit will cause problems for everyone if this becomes the normthe simple fix to have i am guessing an unlimited cspa charge that goes to the person that received the mail is a good onelike drake i will quite happily deal with spam if i am paid for it
exactlythis isnt to do with 1 csm cannidatethis is to do with the system of how they allowemploy itif people start to abuse itits gonna make life nasty stop the evemail spam
updated proposal to reflect cspa solutionoption  stop the evemail spam
they should have left at the same time as learning skills 1
agreed except the cheapo ship thingtravel changes are in need of a much bigger overhaul than that in fact id make it easier but also more riskya single ship like carrierjfindustrial command ships would be able to self jump without cyno at same distances than today but heres the interesting thing jump portal cant be re activated for 5min after jump and disrupt systems harmonics preventing any other jump capable ship to jump in to that systemfleets shouldnt be able to use this mechanic the why harmonics crap stuff and titan bridges should be completely removedcapsscstitans fleets would only be able to fleet jump if they have a cyno and a black ops to set the bridge the fact of using a fleet cyno would remove the jump portal and system harmonics penalty thus enemi fleet can jump in and spank your assincrease solo mobility for expensive capital ships would be good for the gameremove or make harder force projection by removing titans bridge ability would sudenly give local small entities a much more important role would bring black ops to fleets and make those and asset you must not loose if you commit your capital fleet in to a fight cyno capable recons instead of kestrelsthis is just an idea nothing serious right
look at all you babies cryingwhy is it fair to allow hundreds of sub cap ships to blob a gate and allow them all to jump in without some sort of traffic timerwhy can massive sub cap blobs traverse mutiple systems in the space of a few minutes when they cry about capital jumpingwhy is it acceptable for sub caps to be built in hours when caps take weeks if a battleships can be built in 8 hours caps should be built in less than 5 dayswhy is it acceptable for sub cap ships to require plain minerals to be produced and not have components like capital ships dont they have sub capital armor plates sub capital propulsion engines and so onthese are all questions that are on top of my priority listpersonally i say allow caps to jump without cynos to massive celestials remove cynos jump bridges will work the same way no more precision dropping or jumping
balancing caps  hotdropping is p simplegive all caps a base spoolup time for their jump drive egcarrierdread 5 secondssupercarrier 20 secondstitan 30 secondsthen have different sizes of cynogen like guns with appropriate fitting reqs that modify the spool up timesmall 5xmed 3xlarge 2xxl 1xvoila now small disposable cyno ships force a longer spoolup for jumps and arent as useful for hotdrops instead someone trying to hotdrop needs to risk a larger ship to reduce the delayedit oh yeah this also adds scope for posbased cynogens to have different spoolup modifiers depending on which level upgrade you install and how much you pay
i think they should make it so rookie ships can not equip cynosit is way to easy to time a self destruct so the cyno is only up a few seconds if this was not an exploit then why the 10 minute timerthis would still be possible but not with a free shipall you need to put a cyno on a rookie ship is a aux power core very low cost for a hot drop
the answer to that lies in the fact that their jump direction is entirely predictable and easily scoutable with a little effort you can know how big the force is on the other side you can even get 10 second warning when they all start jumping before they actually appear in the other system with cyno there is no way to effectively scout incoming force unless you get lucky or use spies you dont know whos jumping it where they coming from and how many there aresmaller ships are supposed to travel faster than large ones with cyno mechanics the cap ships travel much faster than even interceptors that isnt rightthat has nothing to do with cyno mechanicswhile that is an interesting idea its too radical to be considered as a fix and should be proposed separately
i like medals there is no lag associated with displaying the character photo so go for itit will only affect those who want to participatesupport
bumping for prefan fest discussion
consider this a probe to see how widespread an issue this is if its a widespread problem we can make a case to put resources now to fix it as compared to later when time is available
you obviously have way too much stuff vile ratcan i haz your stuffz to fix your problem actually i have encountered this problem recently so it would be good to know the extent of the problem so ccp can take a look at it
i do have a somewhat tangentally related issuewe should be able to stack all items in a corp hangar  drone bay thats nearly full just like we can in a cargohold its really frustrating having to pull items out of a corp hangar then drop them back in again just to stack them together  especially when youre in space and this involves dicking around with jetcans
do it boss i for one want to shoot some amarr
there are reasons why i cant take the whole corp inbut there has got to be better ways to make your sympathies known than huzzahing in local bashing out a bio typing up a storm in the intergalactic summit  which you never see me do anyway because whats the point  or being flashy orange on the overviewthose are the only ways to communicate your identity with a factionfaction liveries bought with loyalty points would be a start but even shiny paint jobs are ineffectual against a titan in highsecif you dont empower roleplay with a vigilant gm team  you might as well be the barman in the cantina saying your kind arent welcome here
well the op won hisher own thread with the above statement fantastic i do understand what you mean by the rpg element being a bit weak in eve your op wasnt very clear by the wayi am hoping with the new patch that the rp element will be kicked up a notch war is good for that sort of thingmore interaction with the npcs in the eve universe would be a good thing for those that want it
well thanks i was beginning to think i was talking to myself or maybe one of my split personalitiesas exercises in futility go eve is one of the more engaging  and could be betteyou may have noticed that im not much or a rper mainly because there is no good reason to be but i would like to champion the art for those that aretrue it was probably for the best that died horribly rather get anywhere near adopted i regret trying to bait supermits and cohorts into a debate about the transcendental nature of identity the opening act was appropriately rubbishedabsolutely its just not entirely clear who you are fighting for or why omnipresent threat for no reason kills creativityim not sure i agree on that score id rather we ditched the npcs and let the subscribers take up their rolesi know that would blur the line between empyrean and the mortals of the eve universe but i think it is time
i shouldve expanded on that one a littlenpcs i mean the factions gallente minmatar amarr and the carebear one ummm yeah caldari someone else suggested that it would be good if there were border skirmishes with the factions along the border regions that players may choose to get involved in which is a help to the rp side of thingsmight work it might noti personally have no time to rp in eve nor any inclination to i log in long enough to join fleet and kill things and thats about it
you know what i actually agree with this i am not a roleplayer in fact i find the idea a bit weird personally but i do agree that because eve is very much based on the sandbox ideal and as such i think there should be more ripples to your actions as ccp so elegantly says it in their adverts i would go a step further and say that there should be a new feature i think that faction standings should change for large alliances as a result of their members actions suicide ganking should not only effect the players standings in that factions space it should also affect their alliances standings in a very small way so that prolonged suicide ganking from an alliance would eventually lead to consequences for the alliance and its members as a wholecorporation and alliance npc standings should matter morealthough this discussion has started around rp it seems to me that it is ultimately about the effects we have on one anothers game experience i know im probably not looking at this in the same way as everyone else is but i cant help but feel like there should be some political implications for actions everywherein the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
you know what your probably onto something there it seems to me that nullsec alliances spend a lot of time adjusting standings in relation to their neibours because it is vital for defining how they react to one another id argue the nullsec alliances have forged their own strong identities and are rping by default because they have tobut in highsec standings are not nearly so meaningful perhaps they should bemaybe part of the new player experience should include a section on setting standings and bearing grudges against a can flipper that crossed you half a year ago
standings between players and npc should definitely be more meaningfuli wish you hadnt brought up the goons and their ice interdiction makes me uncomfortable as someone who has played as a rper in mmorpgs when i get the slightest scent that rp is being used as an excuse to get the game mechanics to protect and insulate gamers from hostile actions of other players i would like to see the game lore reflected in the game mechanics but the lore is the framework in which we interact with the game world not a means of regulating and enforcing good player behavior the only thing worse than that is roleplayers that create a story and expect it to be insulated from other players or the game world itself always reminds me of this group in shadowbane called dragonscale they claimed to have a scale of the great dragon under their city and some how this would help them defeat said dragon should it ever return to destroy the world again well great most other players dont care problem was their city was in a desert region home to a large number of player groups roleplaying irekei vicious red desert elves who by the game lore worshiped this great dragon well the irekei all declared holly war against the dragonscale group which in turn lead to much dragonscale members whining about griefing so called roleplayers complaining about other roleplayers playing their role rp should be part of the sandbox not isolated from itin short there has been a lot self proclaimed rpers in mmorpgs that have deservedly brought down the scorn of other players and tarnished what roleplaying is or at least ought to be in these games
if you tolerate this then your children wil be next will be next will be next will be next will be neeeeeext
thats strange cos when i replied to everyone  telling him to feck off i got a cspa charge for them and it was only about 200k so thats what he must of paid
dear siri was not surprised when i logged on around a week ago to an alliance mail from hans jagerblitzen asking us to take a look at a good post you had made on the eve forums ever the community builder hans is never shy about promoting something that is good or meriting discussion even if it comes from a candidate he is running against though we all support hans here at late night alliance many of us were willing to go take a look and offer an encouraging word to another csm candidate specifically yourselfwhat did surprise me was the solicitation i received several days later where it was obvious that my characters name and the names of fellow alliance members and pilots had obviously been stripped from this post this was a different mail then the one sent to the eve community at large the following day in this mail you solicit our help stating that you need to grub for every last votethe following day i received a second spam and must admit that i became somewhat irritated at this point and concerned that ccp was allowing this spam to continue what will be next recruitment spam every morning contract solicitations by setting the precedence on this matter ccp is opening a huge can of worms im afraid that based on your example people are going to realize how easy it is to spam and that our inboxes will someday resemble jita local chati could argue that your spam is indeed in direct conflict with the terms of service of eve onlinei could explain how spam in general specifically the precedence of your solicitations that will eventually cause additional solicitations directly interferes with the ability of other eve online subscribers as a whole to enjoy the game spam interferes with other legitimate communication between players it is also extremely frustrating to pilots who cannot easily filter such unsolicited communications  filtering that most companies readily and eagerly offer their clients in this day and agei could explain how your mail could be considered as a promotion of solicitation and that your open urging to forward this spam mail on to my corpmates and friends resembles the making of a chain lettera practice specifically prohibited by the tosinstead im petitioning your good graces i am petitioning that you do not contradict the very things you state in your mailfor how can i believe you when you saywhen you send spam that most decidedly does not improve the game and does not benefit the entire eve community but instead frustrates and annoys pilotshow can i believe you when you say when you defend your spam mail even though a large number of people have expressed their opinions against this act when you knowing took a calculated risk knowing full well you would be going against the opinions of a large portion of eve pilots when you blatantly shoved the opinions of eve pilots aside for the benefit of your own interests how can i believe you when you say you want to push for uswhen you openly disrespect the eve player base by openly grubbing around for votes and spamming instead of using that time to engage the community in honest open discussion about game mechanics and players issuesnot even the troll voters want this kind of spam in their inboxhow can i ever again engage you in conversation on the eve online forums without the fear that the very act of posting on one of your threads will lead to another spam maileven the mitanni built his name recognition through game philosophies reputation and action not by sniveling computer programs and scraping macros that smell of desperationso i petition you please stop unsolicited mail sent to the eve player base at large and petition ccp to have this considered an exploit to prevent it from happening in the future please take the time to build your own mailing list as other candidates have done through hard work and community involvement where you can openly engage with people who desire to hear from you please start listening to us again and please please stop spamming me with your desperate contradictory propoganda sincerelysusan blackwwwgamerchicknet gamerchick42
cheers susan i second this
i am going to go with a wild stab in the dark in here you got spammed by a csm candidatehope robert woodhead pays attention this may very well backfire and cost him votesi take it back drake i may support your idea after all
this is beyond stupid you obviously did not read trebors open letter to the community on why he did thisseriously get busy living or get busy dying  just stfu about things you are clueless aboutkthnxbai
fight the power flying spam filters ftw
you forgot to mention that this thread doesnt belong here but thats ok  stop the evemail spam
i received this kind of thing from trebor last year so it didnt surprise me that he did it this year the people who trebor offended are the minority but raising the issue of the spam exemption for csm candidates is importantthis does raise the issue of how well the large alliances can organise behind their specific representative the rest of the players essentially need to get behind o e or two candidates when the counting is published i have no doubt that a large majority of the votes in the first 20 hours will turn out to have come from null sec blocsas offensive as trebors campaign is to some people it is necessary on order to secure a seat for someone whose support base is the whole population as opposed to singleissue candidates such as the mittani death to all supercaps two step wormhole population hans jagerblitzen faction warfare mintrolio csm are joek et ali voted for trebor since he will at least communicate with the players as opposed to mittani who figures no one is worth his time well except when he has an opportunity to appear as a stool pigeon on a ccp propaganda video
it is one thing to get the populations attention to participateits an entirely different matter to shove that message down peoples throats without permission or authorization thereofi find trebors moves disgusting and insultingif he was interested in winning the hearts of the common pilothes got alot to learn about politicshe likely will win mostly on nullseclow sec votes anywayas for the csm in gernalget a clueseriouslythe csm has always been like thispeople are likely more turned off than ever when it comes to participation and the underhanded tactics they use just to get a damn ticket to iceland and sit there and look prettyat least those such as mitanni and a few others are actually doing something for onceeveryone else traets this like a laughing stock of a jokeif you want to win the hearts of the common joe pilotthen you do so by your actionsnot by your flipping wordsyou get out theretalk to peopleconvo themand eventually by word of mouth they will show upforcing them to vote by means of spamming is going to  people offhell id sooner vote for darius who scams by promising plexes to get them to vote for him as opposed to people who fill my eve mail box with their  smelling campang messageswhy because darius is using a eve mechanic that is widely known and respectablewell in most circiles aside from noobsspamming with eve mails is not respectable or considered a mechanic to be widely nown and usedits an exploitprue and simple one that ccp will beat around the bush about and pussy foot when it comes to reasoning as to whether its allowed or notthey gave a grey answernot black or whiteno no or yesetclets get the facts straight peoplethis is par for the course herenothings going to changejust going to make more people demand csm disbandmentand thats just the tip of the iceberg stop the evemail spam
if a player can commit 50billion or whatever for a titan and 100 for fits triple the amount of mineralscomponents needto build it make capital components much more expensive in materials costhaving a titan must be an exceptional asset but should have much bigger access difficulty than now by its price if tomorrow you have to pay 500billions for a titan im quite sure youll see only a few outside because everyone and his grandmother will want to kill them by any meansbuy a 30millio sp alt to sit it in is a difficultytitans price with the number of plex flowing is dirty cheap and are not dieing enough battleships need to be cheaper to build have more hitpoins as speed and 25 more dps againt capssuperstitans wouldnt be too much
i think that the older bitvet guy that has at least 1 pt in each battleship racewill get free prerequisite in each race he has that point will it be lvl3 or 4 well seenow the same bit vet has battlecruisers 5 dilema because he also have 1pt per bs in 3races and 1 to 5 because carrier will this scrub get racial battlecruiser 5 in all races malcanis law also battlecruisers 5 and destroyers 5 in training folowed by frigs4cruisers4battleship 1 where its needed to be sure you will not have to train stupid amounts of time for something where another one spent a few hours only
personally im fairly concerned about the changes to dessies and bcs specifically because i have bcs 5 and was considering training dessies 5 soon i just dont see this change to them ending well either i end up getting the sp back for training one of them up to the level that i have now and get robbed of access to the other three races due to an arbitrary change of ccps or i get sp for all 4 of them and younger players have to train 4x as long to get access to the same stuff personally i prefer the second option but neither one is a good solutionpersonally i think they should just leave the bcs and destroyers how they are now since it will cause the least pain overall otherwise someones going to end up getting pissed off and hurt either wayi do like the idea of the tiericide though im hoping they balance and execute it well
the tone of the comments from the devs indicates that they intend to err on the side of generosity
this is eve where life isnt perfect upon sd substantially reduce the chance of loot dropping to almost but not quite zerokillmail yes since the sd pilot would not need to allow sd if they were winning or thought they could escapeno insurancealso because suicide ganking is legit and certainly a lot of people support stiffer sd penalties against the attacker i also agree it would be cool and good to have a selfdestruct pulse that damages the attackers as one destructs whether concord shows up or notsince death is meaningless in this game in a sense every attack is an investment just because concord isnt around doesnt mean the soontobespacedust pilot shouldnt get a last swing on the way out
maybe ccp should relook at how the market and item system is organized this is probably a simple suggestion that opens a leviathan of database manipulation but there are some oddities in the market like the fact that you find nanofiber hull conversions in the hull upgrades section while it is true that this is a hull item no one uses it for its beneficial upgrade to your hull its basically a propulsion upgrade if your fitting up an interceptor you need to go to both propulsion upgrades and hull upgrades to get the fittings you need additionally could we have weapon upgrades either subcategorized or have the modules in them placed into the same folder as the turret type they bonus i think this is a help the noobs kind of thing to so we dont have gallente noobs flying hybrid ships with heat sinks in the lows thinking theyre going to helpim sure there are other oddities in the market system but those are some specific examples i think it would be a good little uiusabilitynoob disambiguation project
another thing about this proposed vessel is that it will unlike carriers be able to operate in high security space and wont require ships to be packagedi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
this is very good idea signedi hope the devs have the same thoughts on this they should take notes of this topic
at a minimum drop gcc for plexes and anomolies anybody ratting and hanging out at a planet is asking for trouble anyways they are either looking for a fight or are going to get ganked by somebody if they arent careful i guess i would follow the suggestions here and keep sec status hits to points of transit  stations and gatespocos pos if youre not going to not implement gcc at pocos then dont implement it at a pos i would prefer to keep gcc for structure attacks since they theoretically encourage low sec economic developmnetbut this is all details great idea overall
i only lead with the goons and the ice interdiction as an example because i know they are a hardy bunch and are very able to speak for themselvesi personally think they have done more or the game than many other group the ice interdiction was just sound strategy period an rper could adopt it as a personal motive for revenge but they would be daft to do so because in all likelyhood they would be outmatched in every way but say they did want to take the part of a gallente national outraged at their callous behaviour what are they gonna do go the the intergalactic summit and file a public complaint what good will that dopersonally iUFFFDm in favour of abolishing the intergalactic summit because it segregates rpers from gamers and fosters a feeling of preferential treatment what is is for if if it not a tool to make the life of gms in charge of pandering to rpers life easiernoone is going to look in there for a reason why they are getting shot at kill it off it is doing more harm than good
i guess it is hard to accept a debate from someone who has not made their motives clear from the outsetyou are right ship combat pvp does not interest me motives and causes interest me eve gives plenty of reasons for people to shoot one another in the face but you can rarely be sure exactly why you are waking up in a new clone at any given timerpers make good leaders because they set impossible standards for themselves and get frustrated when other people dont see the beauty of their idealthe thread you linked was an interesting read except swtor is not nearly as deep as eveso here is my ideal i want to take the markets from jita  the citadel and bring them to everyshore for gods sake why  because game lore suggests that is where it should be and if i pull it off ill get a sense of achievement like no otherheres the problem i played fw because it was new and exciting now my corps standings are shot to hell with the caldari faction i guess ill have to convince someone else to do the hauling you see plenty of people wtriting their own eve related stories outside of the game for that reason rping in eve is every bit as hard as acting is in real life
what pretty sure rping in eve is not remotely the equivalent performing on broadway
didnt you know eve is realyour probably right my time on stage is limited to selling religion
i was very annoyed by his message esp since i do follow the forums and what csm candidates were saying etc very honestly it left me with the impression of disgust more then anything second was the it reeked of desperation i dont like my candidates to be desperate people space wizards are real they can make 10058 votes vanish and for a moment i hurd 10k goons cry out then silence 
ouch hell hath no fury like a woman spammed
susan you will find my reply to your concerns posted herebest regardstrebor
there is much anger and upset with this one
with pi shifting from high sec to low sec i propose allowing a module to be constructed onplanet in low sec and 00 only that allows jettison of 4000 or 5000m3 into space we are starting to see corps setting up dozens of customs offices over wide stretches of low sec and allowing them to sit collecting high tax rates the larger the corp or alliance the less chance anyone has to dispute their claim i feel if a corp is going to lay claim to an area and profit they should have to protect their interests by allowing space drops you create a new profession of smuggling when dust arrives it provides an option for corps to hire high ground forces to raid and destroy these illegal facilities in space they would need to police their own skies to prevent smugglers from circumventing their customs duesas more products are introduced requiring pi goods quality planets will become more valuable smuggling will then become more profitable and more dangerous as large corporations will be more inclined to protect their assets from theftedit just noticed this is the 666th topic for the assembly hall not sure if thats good or bad
im afraid there are some obvious problems with this suggestionfirstly anyone in lowsec gets shot at whether they are doing pi or not so there would be no policing only business as usual secondly we have no idea how dust is going to work in relation to eve yet anyway and so making suggestions this far in advances is probably a little prematurealso if such a mod were to exist then everyone in lowsec would be using them and so it would make the customs offices largely pointlessin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
okay so like basically um like back then people like used armor so like this was good kinda you know but like now people are like using umm shield tanked ships more cause there like more awsomer and like faster and can like totally stay away from the big fat mcdonald eating armor ships i mean armor ships cant like use nano fibers and like overdrive injectors cause they like need them for there big mcdonald eating tanks and there like plates already slow them down enough i mean its seriously like totally unfair also i kinda like think if this maybe umm happened people would like fly armor ships more you knowso everyone show your like support for the rarsbremovearmorspeedbackdraw proposal and we can all like use armor ships more kind of
trimarks should retain the speed penalty active tanking armor rigs should however have some other form of penalty id be in favor of max lock range
likewhatevermannot supporting for the time being stop the evemailUFFFDspam
simple logic you weld a bunch of armor plating on something its going to be heavier and thus go sloweralso with a shield tanked ship once the shield goes down its game over for that ship 1 due to idiocyi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
with t2 battlesips as they are probably except for pve people who a marauder luckily the changes will make it easier to balance say blops and make them worth flying
in reading the feedback thread and this one it seems the major objection people have is time spent retraining assuming we dont have to retrain or the retraining impact is small is everyone in favor of these proposed changes
if there will be a new battleship design i want it to have bonus to medium gunslets face it for most ship to ship combat cruiser guns offer more damage than battleship gunsthe only practical uses of battleship guns now is fleet sniping pve and maybe some pos bashing  all of which are well covered by existing shipsa battleship with cruiser gun bonus is going to be different enough to justify its existence its something new
i though d3s whole platform was do nothing contribute nothing achieve nothing
i really hope that such a ship would never be allowed in highsec its already too easy to move halfway across the galaxy eve doesnt seem very big anymorewhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
back to the top  some good ideas here lets discuss this some more  op updated with mxzfs suggestion
i like this idea it would almost have to be a change in the way mission are distributed changing tag requirements still wouldnt address the lack of tags on the marketstill i think people tend to avoid tag missions in general because they dont want to be restricted to one part of high sec not sure how to solve that issueone thing they may want to consider is reducing or even eliminating the faction hits with these missions they seem like a needless restriction and are the reason you cant find tags on the market they would be fine if we had an economy that was spread even but we dont a gallente mission runner needs jita a lot more than a caldari mission runner needs dodixie
ah see there theres the thing  there are people probably not many like myself who would exclusively run antifaction missions if i the option was offered to us and ii the distribution of the missions namely a gallente agent offering anticaldari missions and vice versa if these conditions were changed the tags would flowtrue there would be some tag value deflation with increased availability but of course not everyone will want to run the antiempire missions dont forget that this proposal diamaht is exlcusively concerned with increasing the tag supply via the choice of exclusive antifaction missions its not about looking at the tag requirements in the lp stores as the increase tag supply will rectify the disproportionate requirements thanks for your support
i am just waiting for the afk cloaking tears to show upbasically if you add a 1530 second spool up time on jumping into a cyno then whenever you get hot dropped by a lone dude with s scram  web  cyno then there is s slight chance that you could pop him and livei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea

snowflakei think it might be worth reposting this thread as a proposal at some point you could work out the details here with others constructive criticism in this thread i dont have a strong knowledge of how standings work so youll have to bear with any questions or ideas i talk throughi would propose that this would get you your wish if goonswarm just as an example im sure there are more criminal alliances actually possibly not were to commit enough crimes in highsec their members and the alliance in general would have some accountability and eventually would be seen as enemies in highsecobviously people could still create marta corps to avoid attention but thats a sound political strategy even from a rp basisin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
it shouldnt just be the where thats important but the who taking the ice miner example were those miners really pod pilots that the gallentean authorities really care about let alone really count as their own some maybe that had high standings were part of gallente npc corp thus providing taxes perhaps some had been in the militia but the rest there could be quite reasonable rp explanations why the gallente might actually welcome a group into their space like goons to kill off certain minersnpc reactions to players shouldnt just be based on the history of a players actions towards other players but also a players history towards npcs the rper in me questions why that ice and minerals is freely available in high sec in the first place being that it is the most built up established part of civilized space where are the mines in the real world theyre rarely next to major first world cities they may have been there long ago but have since been depleted the current mines are out in the middle of nowhere in the wilderness and the frontiers of modern civilizationanyway if you want to come up with ways to improve rplore in eve stop trying to figure out a new ways to protect high sec pveers from the likes of the goons and start coming up with ways to make the game more immersive where all player actions and choices have meaningful consequences that also make sense within the game lore
i would argue this idea would add immersion to the game it wouldnt really be a nerf for pvp alliances and such it would become a lifestyle choice it wouldnt protect highsec people because there will always be people wanting to kill highsec players whatever the consequences but it would mean that those corporations and alliances would have to be generally located on the fringes in lowsec you can still highsec gank using wardecs if you want without incurring these penaltiesit would give pirate corps a much more authentic feel because lets face it plenty of pirate corps have people flying around in highsec without a care in the world sure maybe not many of themi think it would make for much more interesting options when joining corps having to choose whether you wanted to join an hardcore infamous pirate corp that can not go into gallante space or some mild mannered alternative that tries to keep its relationships all hunkydorry with the factionsi really dont want to protect highsec players if you have any alternatives to make this kind of thing work throw up some ideas thats kind of the pointin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
if your idea was to replace concord as a form high sec policing and that the standing hitsnpc reaction was based on who the aggressor and who the aggressed are to the npcs rather than just where it happens i would consider it a potentially nice improvement ultimately a system that is built to promote immersion and the game lore shouldnt distinguish between player actions towards other players and player actions towards npcs game mechanics that have the gallente npcs outlaw the mattani because he blew up a hundred or so ice miners in their space but give a free pass to some other player who blew up a thousand gallente navy ships running caldari missions never was about the lore or rp
im sorry im afraid im not bright enough to follow the technical aspects of standings youve described in your postspeople seem to be under the impression ive got something against goonswarm i really dont the ice interdiction was the most exiting thing to happen in my neighbourhood in years the fact that they announced the action allowed me to protect the vulnerable people in my corp i want to encourage interaction between small highsec corps and big nullsec alliancesthey did not couch the interdiction in rp terms because quite frankly they dont have to there is no advantage to it but that should not stop someone from trying to interpret their action in terms of game lorequite frankly im jealous as someone has already pointed out they are having more fun in this game than i am and the reason is they are in no way tied to game lore and they are not stuck sat in highsec out of necessity thats my beef game lore should be a story telling driver not an impedimentwhat bothers the hell out of me is that no one can offer a satisfying response to the ice interdiction except take some ships up to their stronghold and shoot at themive argued myself to a standstill because there really is no place left to goplayers cant take the part of the empires in empire space bacuase they have very little control over the environmentthe gms cant take the part of the empires without being called out for favouritism they are few in number and have to be painstakingly careful not to upset the balancethere is something very very wrong i cant see a solution  maybe you can
this is the major difference between a sandbox like eve and a theme park like wowin a theme park story is the driver in a sandbox players areoh and according to game lore capsuleers are not citizens anyway they are pretty much treated as 1 man sovereign nations by the empiresedit i am trying to be real nice about this but ultimately this thread comes down to you not quite understanding that eve is a pvp sandbox even mining is supposed to be a form of pvpgetting the ore before the other guy and ice mining is one of the thing that break this paradigm anything that you can do with no real competition or threat breaks this paradigm
ive never considered it in those terms before maybe it is the ice mining mech that needs to be fixedthank you folks for adjusting my thinking without pissing me off too much i wish you all the best in every endeavour
except roden is an empyrean capsuleer  see templar onei really tried not to point that out but the geek won over
great point but i would qualify the statement somewhatin the themepark mmorpg the story beginning to end is predetermined the tracks are laid out for the player and although there may be different tracks to follow you can never get off the tracks and set your own path to an unknown outcome also because of this the developers are under constant pressure to lay down new tracks content because players arent given the tools and freedom to create their ownthe sandbox mmorpg players are more free to create their own story and that of others or to have their own story shaped by other players willingly or not however all this still happens within a framework of the game world its not pure imagination land where anything goes just like the real world theres laws of physics a backdrop of history and culture a framework that builds up a virtual world that allows us all to interact with it and each other in a meaningful way its in this context that the game lore is a legitimate story driver in the sandbox mmorpg albeit unlike the themepark its up to the players how they deal with itput yet another way the ultimate themepark is like a disney landsix flags that builds new rides so fast that theres always something new when you get bored of the last one and just like dave and busters you get cheesy prizes at the end just for playing the ultimate sandbox is star treks holodeck which is the better venue for roleplayingin eves particular case ive long argued that the games areas delineated by security rating should rather be divided according to how much the players can manipulate the sand in the box wormholes and sovereignty nullsec are the purest player sanbox parts of the game and should remain that way empire space high sec and low sec and npc nullsec should be driven by npc politics that is to say in this space the game lore drives the story or perhaps better put the game lore drives the players to create the story

if you can just dodge the taxes on your own then why the hell should we bother to set up a customs officeyouve obviously never been to lowsecmore dudes  more people to fight over something imagine thatyou mean like having to defend each office every time it gets shot at translation my idea might be balanced once some hypothetical game gets releasedi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
please make this topic sticky
this is not caod
thanks
increase the material requirements since people wont lower their prices any futher the titan price goes up
oh look yet another thread that should have just been in the dev blog feedback thread
i think that faction hits could be balanced a bit using that as a way to adjust the supply of tags if this was implemented but i think the faction hits are good to have because it gives you a tradeoff bear in mind that you really can buy pretty much anything in any of the four major trade hubs though some stuff is slightly marked up i havent been to jita in months myself and everyone does have three slots on their account tossing together a jita alt doesnt take much efforti think that this proposal would go a long way towards making the tag market actually work well due to people being able to choose to go for antifaction missions and would love to see it implemented the faction hits can be rebalanced after the market stabilizes if it turns out theres too muchtoo little change in the tag market
this is true however you would then have the issue of tanking a drone that does em damage as opposed to explosive thats almost as fast as a warrior ii but does more damagemaking drones suck even more wouldnt be that great for gallente pilots that use drone boats the problem is that the warrior iis are doing more damage than they are supposed to due to a mix up with the damage multipliersfix that and amarr drones will become useful again
ok could some of you hitting the like button tell me why you like it or what you would like to see improved
i disapprove becausebreaking down the titan into multiple 1 trick ponies that are good at pvp against a modest 3 hulls carriers dreads and supers at the cost of 50 bil isk or so per ship is nerfing the titan into a pitiful state similar to what the black ops is in now and that is underwhelming for a ship that costs half a bil to say the leastyour moaning in this topic because of tracking abilities while being buffed in fleet  titan fits that allow those ships to shoot at smaller ships you justify this emotive demand by pointing out its lack of role and the fact that it should be rare as per designlast time i checked eve has less than 1000 titans out of how many hundred thousand players yea that sounds pretty rare to meso your idea of breaking the titan down will fail in the long term because people will want the underwhelming ship to do more later down the lineyour justification fails because the ship is already rare even if allot of them are owned by a small number of alliances within the powerblocks
please no no more supercapital size ships there are to many in eve already and with the amount of isk around the botting the ability to buy isk online means those will just get blobbed as well eventuallybest solution for titans  remove them
my solution to the problem probably hard to implement but here goes1 nerf capital turret tracking to the level of sieged dreads for structure bashing only2 add another rack of turret slots to titans only being able to fit bship sized gunsor double damage bonus from 100 per level to 200 per level for capital turrets and make titans fit only half number of capital turrets  marauder style and leave the rest of turret slots for bship sized guns with appropriate bonusso you would have a massive ship able to fit anti cap and subcap weapons wich only makes sense subcap weapons although highly bonused  100 dmg per level and the equivalent of 8 bship sized turrets  would inflict far less damage than the current capital sized weapons but would still add a huge advantage at a proper cost 1 titan  50 bil hull firepower equivalent for 5 bships compared to a bship costing 150m i say its only fairas for the massive ehp titans have just remove their ability to receive remote repairs forcing them to fit a local tank or just a massive buffernow titans are both very useful not highly overpowered and should start dyingproblem solved
still think the simplest way of fixing the titan issue is remove the damn turrets it still has the dd for virtually instapopping capitals and structures why have it shooting at subcap fleets at allthey were never designed to be taking on a fleet of subcaps why else remove the aoe dds of old if ccp still wanted them to take on fleets solodo this and the titan still retains its usefulness in fleets and theres no need to remove them or redesign them
lolyour logic works the other way as wellmore isk  more disposable sub caps  bigger and more frequent sub cap blobsfix the blob and delete all spaceships from evewis for everyone yay o
actually my proposal would make the mothership cost about 7 bil the superdread about 18 bil and i left the titan up in the air as for price until someone else came up with a reasonable suggestionedit you mean carriers dreads supers and structures also of note only 2 of the proposed ships are for combatthe only time i mentioned tracking was to say that its a problem that needs to be fixed but doing so will not magically fix titans like some seem to think it will plus my point is that it is currently balanced as a rare ship when it no longer is and as thus needs a rebalancei would define rare in eve terms as any time you only see 35 per fleet given that we regularly see more than that i would say that it is no longer rarei would like suggestions to prevent making the ships underwhelming while allowing them to be balanced effectivelyplease go reread my proposal it appears to have been updated since the last time you looked at it
too many people have too much isk invested in buildinghavingflying titans removing them from the game would dump trillions upon trillions of isk back into the game and would massively screw up the economy as such this is a bad idea
the reason they have massive ehp is to account for the fact that they cost 50b for a hull if you nerfed their survivability you would also have to nerf their price tag along with various other things to compensate
i would like to thank tallian saotome of fatal ascension and snow axe of goonwaffe for their ideas i almost forgot to thank issler dainze for allowing me to run this idea in her postwhat i am currently proposing is that all newbies enter a pool effectively like that for the rookie channel probably using the same info that allows people onto that channel except with the added requirement that the account the character is on is not a buddy or other added account and isnt a plex accountand the account is less than 60 days oldat the same time allow people to opt in to a mentor pool give this pool some kind of criteria possibly a time frame like 6 months  active for the accountallow the newbies to do a tutorial quest to teach them how to use the mentor database have the mentor list showing things like name ageof character number of jumps away from mentor and scores previously given to the mentor by previous newbies also a button to allow a chat to be opened to the mentor before accepting also removing the mentor and pupil from the lists for the duration of the chat preventing a mentor from being overwhelmedhave a panel similar to this for the mentors to access with access to the newbie information like age of character amount of time played allowing the mentor to see if the current activity level of the player fits in to his own and how many jumps to get to the newbieallow a simple pop up like the one currently used for fleet invites to allow a mentor invitenow the hard bits are the rewards for the mentors i agree with tallian saotome that a corporate reward system is probably a good place to start this will allow ceos to set up a structure within their corp to allow newbies to flourish and give something to the corp as a whole im not sure about tallian saotomes idea of increasing tax rate mostly because of the current inflation in the game its self with plexs rising at a fairly allarming rate and mineral prices rising as well i suggested a leveled system for corporations to assist this as well but i dont think that is right either so what i am going to suggest is that corps should get a 1 reduction per newbie up to 10 in a reduction in the price of medical clones repairs insurance costs and production costs at npc stationsfor the mentor himself i recommend the addition of an ingame and inforum tag similar to the dev and csm tags you see on people nowas suggested by snow axewe need a corp bonus as corp isnt as likely to do this as they dont want dead weight screwing up their numbersunless it is a newbie training corp so they will teach the newbie to survive so they can help the corpi agree that a corporation is an integral part of this process for it to succeed corps have got to want newbies i also feel the need for the newbies at the end of their tutelage whether from time or they leave the current mentor need to be able to rate the mentors performance allowing an averaging of this score and possibly a pop up on comments to appear on the newbie mentor screens for others to seeto prevent newbie abuse i recommend that an easy ability for the newbie to remove them self from the mentor be established so that way if the mentor does us them as a personal slave the pupil can get out simply i also recommend the ability for either the mentor or the pupil to cease the relationship easily as sometimes personalities clashfor the future of eve we need not just us regular bar flies but need blood to move the game forward i personally hope eve will be around in the distant future so i have something to play if i ever make it to retirementin addition to this i feel that additional tutorial missions and and an expansion of the lvl 1 quests are needed to intice players to stay and play i have been playing level 1 missions for the last few days on an alt and they repeat so often to make you want to shoot your self in the face please feel free to leave any helpful comments and suggestions as i think this is a good idea on a way forward for the gamefrying doom
if they want such system they can jump in lineage ii and reveerse engineer mentormentee system that exists in that gamegood idea though this is missing and would be useful for getting new players in the game and keeping them here
curious but exactly what do you consider flood to be just how many minerals are on the market due to bots 10 30 60 05 before you accuse bots of being the reason for something you might want to actually figure out how much responsibility bots are contributing
there was supposed to be just a few of them but now alliances give them away certain alliances blob them and there is no answer to that theyve ruined sov warfare if you dont have them and a couple of titans to back it up you cannot hold sov
its like a pissing match doesnt matter how much  you havein the end nobody wins and  is all over the place the problem is the proliferation of supercaps and titans these are supposed to be the best of the best and very hard to obtain and maintain rareinsteadthey are all over the place in blob numbers the only answer i see to this other than completely changing the mechanics behind them is to make dreads the supercap destroyers that they should be
i actually think they should lose turret slots entirely and get the their dd able to target subcaps again one kill every 10 minutes per titan isnt huge but their blapping power is just sillylet them keep their ability to refit on the fly they have hundreds of thousands of crew member able to recalibrate partsbring entire systems online ewar immunity has to goand is till think titans should be tied to a fleet command role to activate any systems other than warpjump drives
its pretty bad for living out of a pos tower in wormspace yesthings that tend to cause the hangar to load extraslow if present bookmarks named cargo cans fitted ships anything uniquely identifiable reallynot had it happen to me personally but a few corpmates have had ship hangars refuse to load at all necessitating a relog to get at their ships
does affect me to some effect  i mostly alleviate it by spreading assets over most tabs to equal extentmore tabs might alleviate the problem to some extentsearch function without preloading  would only load what you need if you know what you needloading modules by type if you dont know what you neednothing else come to mind
just a quick related questionis red vs blues current popularity because of an absence of game lore and alliance politics  or because the enemy is clearly defined and you know what you are fighting for and against
popular because it gives casual gamers that have limited time for fleet fights to undock and get a fight there and then without the 3 hour form up and 2 hour roam 35 jumps away
the thing with botters is they tend to do their activities solo so as not to draw attention to the fact that they are bottingas to afk miners well it would be rare to have a whole fleet of them be afk possibly the odd pilot here or there but not everyonethis proposal would benefit fleet fights more than anything else but i am not sure how they would all focus fire on one ship if 200 ships of the opposing fleet opens up on you drones are pretty dumb at the best of timesif they did this i would hate to be the first guy to open fire as 1000 drones heads his way
because i got a lot of views on one of my particular blog posts i figure that i should bring it here for further considerationoriginal post
dont forget to mention that ccp forced you to read the mail and would not allow you to delete it it is now stuck in your inbox for eternity as an unread mail no matter what you do no petition will correct this it will continually suck your soul and reduce your sp over time it is also a ninja isk sink if you will notice the slow trickle of isk that is draining from your wallet at this juncture i would kindly direct your attention to virus alert
its one mail now but what about all the devious little tricksters in jita this will give them plenty of ideas such as mailing their contract scams to people that they know are gulliblehmmm thats actually a good idealogs into his jita alt
for the love of satans penis do a  search alreadythere has been enough ignorant and butthurt babble about this dont like an evemail that was sent to you dont  read it he didnt force you to you did that on your own you probably wasted more time writing your whine of a forum post than it would have taken a braindead monkey to read his mail and delete it i get spam mail every day of my life through both the postal service and all 3 of my email accounts luckily i am not such a little spoiled brat that i let it get to me otherwise i would spend my whole life making stupid posts like the op dont log into eve you might see chat spam for votes in localit might just kill you if you arent careful
not often i do this butgame mechanic working as intendedthink you should change your thread title to dodging tax on pi in low sec
as far as i am informed the player and csm part of the scrum is to provide ideas and priorities to said ideas said idea implementation as well as tweaking is one of the tasks done by ccptherefore without further adocreate a site similar to july 2011 prioritization crowdsourcing but with few minor changes every registered account is capable of voicing his own idea since only idea required  few words are necessary if the need to explain arises  link the idea to the corresponding forum topic every registered account is capable for voting multiple times limited amount on other players ideas whether votes will be for only or both for and against is up for debate said account holder can then modify hisher votes at any time  to reflect his new ideas on new patches or personal experiencethis would allow very robust and malleable system that can be accessed by anyone  and anyone would be able to see much more ideas per session with ever growing voting participation i expect high traffic with this idea as well previous crowdsourcing showed decent participationmain problem that i see is it can potentially grow very big perhaps it should have automatic purging of ideas that achieved very little response  too much negative response perhaps manual management requiredthoughts ideas
whats the difference between your proposed site and say a forum dedicated to posting ideas in
more consolidated information  and more easily availableyou dont need to read each thread to see the basis of the idea as well as general feelings towards it
how exactly have you been harassed by someone opening a convo or trade window in stationthese are legitimate game functions and without them communication and simple trades would become impossibleif you mean that someone is deliberately doing this to annoy you then why not block them would seem the easiest optionediti dont normally click on external links but in this case you kind of have to as op has missed a rather important point from his postthey are still opening chattrade even whilst blocked i know its impossible to open a chat to someone youve blocked but cant confirm it with trade i like just about everyone and only have a handful of morons on the block list so hard for me to checkthink you will need to explain whats happening fully before anyone can give you advicehelp
well it is simple  u block the guy who is annoying for u  and he is still able to open trade windows all around  even if u closing them the only reason he is doing that is to bother u no reall offer just opening the window u cancel it and he opens it again i have captured video and pics of him doing that u cannot write properly because poped windows moves ur cursorsolution is to have this  in blocking functionality or minimazed them by defaultand honestly if i block someone i really dont want to communicated with such guy even here on forums
ah so what you are proposing is that the block function should do its job properly and block trade requests as well as chatevemailwhy didnt you just say so
lol next time he does it put in a request for 100mil isk and accept see if he falls for iti wasnt aware that you could open a trade with someone you had blocked you learn something new everyday
you might also want to learn that the term is harassment theres no second h in harass it helps if you dont have blatant spelling errors in the central premise of your postand if the issue is that blocked individuals are opening up trade windows with you then just say so however harassment is a part of eve just as much as pvp dont expect ccp to make it impossible to harass someone but they will likely fix what seems to be a bug if it is in fact possible to trade with someone who you have blockedalso an easy way to get around this is just to minimize their trade window and ignore it they cant open a new one with you if you have theirs still open

current systemthe current overview settings allow you to colourtag and set a background for all pilots in the overview depending on standingfleetwar etcbackstoryin recent weeks the corporation i am in has been heavily running missions and then cleaning up with two salvagers what we have noticed is that the two salvagers are constantly locking onto the same wreck except only one can tractor the wreck we created a temporary fix by having a pilot abandon roughly half the wrecks so they would be blue allowing the two salvagers to divide their attention in between the blue and white wrecksmy proposal  basicadd new colourtags andor backgrounds to the overview settings that allow you to see what fleet members are locked onto in general as the system is already there i am assuming the implementation of this would not be as hard as creating an entirely new system as a lock cannot be cancelled during the locking stage i believe a wreck should be marked when someone starts to lock onto itmy proposal  advancedas well as adding the colourtags andor backgrounds for targets the ability to see if a pilot in fleet is already being supported would be useful eg pilot is being capshieldarmour transfereduses1 more optimal salvaging operations due to less wrecks being double locked with tractors2 more efficient fleet mining operations as fleet members would not be mining from the same asteroid as someone elsethis is more when there are 10 miners in a belt3 allow smaller targets frigatescruisers during missions to be cleaned up faster as the larger ships battlecruisersbattleshipsstrategic cruisers would be able to divide their firemost smaller ships can be destroyed in one or two sequential shots by larger ships however many ships may fire at the same time or be firing missiles which is overkill a waste of time and a waste of ammunition4 if there are multiple support ships in a fleet the transfer of capacitorshieldarmour can be divided more easily particularly if more than one ship is tanking damagesupport pilots would not need to keep resetting modules targets
that might be a fantastic idea for your small fleet of mission runners or miners but in a fleet fight were there could be 256 people per fleet this would make the overview even more of a nightmare than it already isbad enough trying to work out what the hell i have locked on the overview as it is when tidi and lag kick in how you could possibly keep track on whos locked what in a fleet of 256 would be near impossible i would thinkeasy solution for missions you have already found abandon your wrecks then theres no need to worry about the salvagersand seriously people still salvage missions is that even a profitable use of your time
i gotta sayfinding the vote site without the link from the login page of eve was a pain in the ass you wold think they would make it a front page link or something instead they bury it no wonder nobody votes
i am sure any of the csm candidates wouldve been happy to spam the link in which ever local they were in or mail you the link oh wait i think they did that already but yes i wouldve thought ccp wouldve made it more obvious
vote buyerscammerrunning around on my alt yesterday i spotted this in local is this allowed either way i think its disgusting
this is eve where every despicable act of treachery scamming cheating looting and vote rigging is not only expected its encouragedat least he never got around to mail spamming thankfullyenjoy your stay
uhhwait what are we talking about
in the space the mass is not importante and if you increase your shield like large shield exterder you need to add some extra generator in your ship this generator have some mass alsothis drawback its really a big problem perhaps the best idea its to put the draw back in the shield not on the agility and speed for plate
despite what you think is fact in space there is resistance and mass does matter if it didnt then we would be able to use rockets to travel faster than lightwe cantif you want to argue with me about it i suggest you first go read up about dark matter then read up about dark energy roflmao those dont exist you noob you might say google is your friend go read
first off dont write like a kid using like every couple words doesnt make you look cool or intelligent it makes you look like you dont know how to speak like an adult if you cant act like a mature adult dont expect people to treat you seriously this applies to life in general not just these forumssecond its called a drawback train armor rigging 5 and it wont be so severe theres not really much wrong with it its kinda annoying at times but not that much of an issue unless youre putting three armor rigs on a ship in which case youre probably overtankingthird armor ships are already used quite often both forms of tanking are relatively balanced right now in most classes of ships except capitals in which case the armor rigs are already considered superior they seem to be just fine asis
i would like to like this proposal like because like i am an armour tanker at heart but i have always like thought the penalties were there so like not to make armour tanked ships be like as fast as shield ships like lol ok okthis is like getting stupid no more likesas i as saying the penalties are there so that armour ships dont compete with shield ships for speed and agility make armour ships as fast and as agile as shield and hull tankedthey do exist trust me ships then why even bother with shield tanked ships ever againas much as i would love to wtfpwn everything in my gallente big ass armour tanked ships i think the penalties should stay as they arenot supported
if you increase the time required you will only see more csaas up to build more of them at the same timesimilarly if you make titans cost alot more its only a matter of time before the player economy expands to the point where they arent that expensive again changing the cost on a titan will only provide a temporary bandaid titans themselves need to be changed to provide a permanent solution to the problem
lollolwhile your at itincrease the build time on sub cap ships all of them introduce sub cap ship components to be used in building instead of plain minerals double the cost of sub cap bposthis will solve all blobbing problems true story
also pointing out that if breasts can be made either saggy or lifted in the character creator then it suggests that they should also movealsoamarramarr femalesdamned hard to make attractive props to any of you that have managed it because i spend a good hour on one yesterday with no sucess no matter what i did she always looked like a foot
i really wish ccp would spend more time in ah and actually comment more i know they dont like to as this was made for the csm but this is one of those things that kind of needs ccps input
ccp benefits from having offgrid boosting players buy another account to pvp with a dps logi etc ship while leaving less attention for a offgrid boosting ship for the other account offgrid boosting encourages players to make more characters and more accounts to increase efficiency without having to double the workload of focusing on more things at once since you can pretty much leave the offgrid booster afk at a pos and focus on your combat character your change is very unlikely to happen
i agree this is probably the view they have but its certainly a myopic one eve online dont press undock unless you have your dual box alt accounts runningthats pretty much where we are i am seeing allot of these boosters in faction war they are fast becoming a requirementi have had fights where they had the skirmish links plus a sensor damp making it so i was unable to even target them the whole fightthe thing is no one likes them they say they had to get them because others had them im sure most people who run with them would be very happy to not have to do that anymore its a real drag on the game as a whole make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i think on grid can be good but refund me the 5b spent on my alt or give me the sp back
how about thisoff grid boosters give half the effect ongrid boosters give full effect
id rather see something opposite implemented  replace all bounties with tags and then diversify the tags required by lp stores a bit so its not only the other faction tags but also pirate onesthis would have the same effect on lp stores as now youd have an abundance of tags however it would make 00 rating a bit harder where it wouldnt just be  kill rats receive isk but youd need to transport all your tags to empire as well to sell themit would also make marauders more desirable as you could get your tags while running missions  ratting would make ninja salvagers or rather ninja looters much more commonsuicide gankers would have more targetsyou could still convert those tags into isk by selling them at a concord or faction navy station but it would be a bit more complicated
i think youre talking about a rather more radical revolutionary overhaul of the lptags system than the evolutionary model presented here i think it is quite important to preserve rat bounties whether at their present levels who knows because as we know diversity is fun in a way too i think it would greatly overcomplicate things  imagine after a couple of months of missioning and hoarding you look in your hangar and are faced with dozens and dozens of different types of tag and you think wtf i believe that the current system holds the basis for a new workable tags system  give the pilot the choice whether to fly antipirate or antifaction missions exclusively or the current random system for those who truly dont care you must also remember that the distribution of antifaction missions for all factions is completely borked too by the way
if you want to run antifaction missions and get tags you can take them as they come in highsec move to lowsec and do fw missionsplexes or l5s or move to nullsec and do pirate missions theres plenty of options for amassing as many tags as you could possibly want
as a former mission runner some of the tag requirements for certain items are ridiculous youd find modules that require 400 tags of one type of tag additional 200 of another and finally another 100 making the cost of the modules astronomically higher than variants you can get from pirates that work just as well and are much cheaperthere is a reason why you never see imperial navy medium energy neutralizers and some others on the contract its just ridiculous to get the amount of tags needed to get them
thought i would carry this over from fid with the permission of the op
the 800mm and 650mm repeating artillery pieces are autocannons and require the large autocannon specialization skill to use the t2 variants this is confusing when there is also a large artillery specialization skill repeating artillery should be changed to autocannon or repeating cannon to avoid confusion
hmm you have a point there 
10
ccp are messing the names up anywaysthey will be called limitedupgradedetcetc depending on meta lvl in the future
this game has so many wonderful things about it super advanced things but for some unknown reason ccp cant think of a better system for character transfers current system requires you to send isk before you get the character opening yourself completely to be scammed you have to hope the seller actually sends it hackers are now hacking accounts putting up character sale threads receiving isk and not sending the characters i imagine they then sell the isk for rl money and could care less if the account gets bannedplease for the love of god fix how to do character transfers suggestions are welcome here
thanks dani
so essentiallysimply solution dont roleplay you know like 99 of eve players
well i know i support thisadamia
i fully support skins for ships but not by player selecting their own coloursif there is one thing i know about eve and other mmo players its that there will be a number of people who think its funny to make the most obnoxious horrible coloured ships to fly around in simply to make the game look ugly for other playersi can see it now giant pink thoraxes named p3n15 and things like thatget the art team to churn out a bunch of options for each ship and the players can buy their choice of thosejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
but thats part of the benefits people that need to be shot repeatedly by big fleets will identify themselves even more clearly than they do already
so long as the skins are restricted to dark evelike colours then i support that idea i dont however support the idea of n00bs getting penalized for having not played long eve already penalizes people based on time paying for an account im not saying the way it is now is bad just that we dont need more of it you could give rewards to proactive players as opposed to just old ones by making the main color free to change but any other colour customization could cost isk scaling up depending on how many colours you change and the size of your shipskins supported customization depending on account age not supportedin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

back when incarna was due to be released ccp had announced that the screen in the captains quarters would have functionality that would be useful both to new players and old vets as it stands that screen doesnUFFFDt really have much functionality at all i have a proposal that would make the screen vaguely useful with hopefully very little effort expended in the future this could even be iterated on to further increase the functionality of cq and the screen this proposal is that one of two thing should happen the first idea is that we could create channels the second is that we could create filter options for the screenchannelsat the moment the screen flicks between visuals of various different aspects of the game that might be dividable we have displays of playersUFFFD UFFFDwantedUFFFD bounty posters career agent adverts incursion warnings ship adverts epic ark mission adverts new pilot certification clone status alerts sov change alerts nex store adverts and UFFFDbuy plexUFFFD adverts if i missed any please let me know now i propose we slit them into channels and iUFFFDll give an example belowgeneral UFFFD all topics default channelnews UFFFD incursion warnings bounty posters sov change alerts new pilot certificationcareers UFFFD career agents epic ark incursion warningsmarket UFFFD ship adverts UFFFDbuy plexUFFFD adverts nex store adsnow it doesnUFFFDt need to be these specific channels these are just examples and the clone status alert should probably show on all channels because letUFFFDs face it that actually is useful these channels would be accessible by highlighting the screen where you would see a ui interface similar to that of the seat or the image of your ship that shows fittingcargoetcfilter optionsyou could also have a simple filter option where you tick only the types of displays you want to see on the screen for example i could turn all of them off and keep sov change alerts on so that i can watch for the slow and painful destruction of certain alliancesUFFFD sovereignty or if the bounty system worked i could watch the bounty board only for tasty pvp snacks this might give a reason for station bound toons to actually pay some attention to the screenbuy whyi imagine there are a few people in here who will be like UFFFDwtf cq is crap why botherUFFFD i would answer because itUFFFDs not going anywhere so we might as well make it useful hopefully with channelsfilters and perhaps some later iterations the screen itself could be used as a tool to improve gameplay or even your toons financial performanceimagine for a moment that youUFFFDre a trader now imagine that there are also item adverts now on the screen and that these new item adverts and the old ship adverts had the highest buy and sell orders in various regions displayed on them you could use the filter or channels to watch for these specifically and just watch for potential deals or trade routesalternatively imagine youUFFFDre a hardcore nullsecy just chilling out in your sov space with nothing to do now imagine the sov change ads had associated battle reports on them that you could click on whilst chatting or sifting through your alliancecorp kill board you can watch the political landscape shift and change as people blow each other up gloriousthrow your support or criticisms at the idea the more the merrier etcin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

thanks for the support of this proposal buzzy warstl is correct i checked a couple of stations where the old tutorial agents used to be located and now those stations are indeed empty aura npe had originally replaced them and now aura isnt even there anymore i dont see any reason not to reinstate the old tutorial agents and change their title to political agents

no there is a fundamental imbalance in the distribution of tags and the tag requirements in the lp store to effectively render most of the items in there totally unobtainable its not simply a matter of go and run fwlvl 5 missions
original post updated yet again due to this thread
still not a very good idea for exactly the same reasons everyone else and i have already mentioned all that capital ships need to do isfleet support and force projection ideally what carriers including tier 2 carriers aka motherships aka supercarriers would dostructure bashing and blowing up other caps ideally what dreads and titans would dowhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
this a thousand times this theres nothing i hate more than homogeneous fleets
i dont agree there arent that many titans that it would upset the economy most of the isk that paid for them will ill gotten anyway all it would do is upset a tiny minority of players who have amassive sway over the game were better off without them anyway
you mean the reasons of yours that i have already refutedthat would be the pipe dream yes but ideas for getting there that would actually succeed are nonexistent thus farmost of the titans out there were paid for with moon goo and as such you have to reimburse everyones titans plus all the bpos for titans out there too lets assume that betwen completed titans and titans in build that you would have to reimburse 1000 of them thats 50 trillion isk right there not to mention another 50 billion for each bpo and probably another 5 bil for every bpc in existance you cant possibly think that dropping significantly more than 50 trillion isk back into the market isnt going to have serious side effects
supported simple and effective
very nice supportedin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
supported i think there is a lot of people crying out to have the bounty system fixed
nice idea
abandoned your own proposal raziel let me give you a bump and even some content   switching squads requires the right to do so and its also a workaround and not a solution afk  re in chats makes it annoying for the fc to keep track of whos back and whos still afk thats an even worse workaround than switching squads as you miss information from fleet chat in the meantimemy opinionthe autoafk part should be optional for fleet members eg menu entry in the fleet window menu enable autoafkalso dont forget the re button next to the afk button in the broadcast toolbar
scamming in character transfers is strictly forbidden if you got scammed in a character transfer then petition it
i know it is and i have petitioned many many different times and i have got my isk back eventually ranging from 2 days to a week the point is thata plain and simple the character transfer system could be a lot better and user friendlyb the time saved from having gms answer these petitions is money in ccps pocketc players currently have to divulge account named players lose time waiting for petitions to be answered as well as miss out on any new characters they may want to bid on
petition itand pipe down bro stop the evemail spam
lol you guys are funny its my right to post yo
i wonder if ccp has had a look at reusing the gtc trading mechanism to trade characters that would make life easier for everyone including the elimination of having to provide your account name to the buyer in order to trade a character
added the point of having to giving account name to reasons why it should be revamped
apparently its your right to not read or understand english either stop the evemail spam
changing it to your idea would end up with them having a lot more work if a scam happened than currently reversing an account transfer is likely way more work than just getting isk back awful idea
i wouldnt object to a contractstyle system where characters and isk are immediately exchanged rather than the way it currently works that would also protect account names privacy issue and reduce petition loadthe question is is it worth the development time to implement it over the current system
that is a propper proposal indeed no the ops emorageranti could get behind that floppie  stop the evemail spam
lol drake this post was created to inspire new ideas on how to improve character transfers did i obviously go over the top on my original post yes did it work to bring people to read this yes
95 of the character scams are from characters that have been hacked so when a petition is filed and isk is reversed back to the buyer ccp looks at the account that scammed normally finding it was hacked and reversing the character back to its original ownerthis is directed at maru utamas comment
i like the way it isi have purchased one character from the market therefore my chances for being scammed are relatively small as most people have experienced if the deal is too good to be true it probably is if you are paying only 50 of market estimated value for the character know that you may never receive that character guess its part of the risk one takes in playing the markethowever for your first point maybe have an escrow account at a npc corp that holds the isk until the character transfer has been confirmed other than that its fine
while you may have brought people hereyour topic title makes you look like a kindergarden kid who looked like someone kicked his sand castle overperhaps if you bothered to clean it upyou might get somewhere stop the evemail spam
afk hauler the main point of this post is to change the system of how isk is handled between buyer and seller to say it is fine but change the way isk is handled is to say that the current system is fundamentally brokenalso afk do you agree with the fact that you have to give your account name in essence half of your characters account security awaydrake you clearly dont get the movie reference that is made in my title thats fine but constructive comments have already come from my post so i am winning
winning what this isnt a gamethese are the forumsspecial olympics perhapsmovie referencelast i checked there are no movies that speak or refer to eve online itself subtlecryptic muchmaybe you should to go cpi hear they have lots of these so called gamesif you refuse to read let alone comprehend what im getting atthen at least have the gumption to say nothing or a meme that would be appropriateotherwise your just digging yourself a grave concerning your intelligence on such thingsand to be quite honesttheres no issue with the system as it is nowfloppie came up with an improvement at leastbut that dosent mean theres a problem with itbut people who complain about it9 times out of 10are foolish in how they handled it in the first place stop the evemail spam
lol drake i didnt realize you were some kind of officiado of what works and what doesnt work in eve my post brings valid concerns about how character transfers are carried out in this game and just because for some strange reason you dont think anything is wrong with the system doesnt mean it is fine everyone has now seen what your opinion is of the character transfer system great no more comments are needed you are not adding anything new to this debateyou dont like my op i could care less as i said in my previous comment people are posting good ideas so the post format works no matter if you liked it or not
you really have no idea what is limiting my gameplayand im butthurt because ive been sitting scouring the forums for someone able to represent the alleged 1 you are so eager to dismiss
this
yeah that sound like a good idea you really cant see the colors anyways unless you look up close
because no one does political commercials that reach millions of people who dont actually want to see them amiriteoh waitthanks for forcing your political crap on people who dont want to read it right after complaining about people forcing their political crap on you there are threads for supporting your candidate and this isnt one of themat least some of the spam complainers have the integrity to not say gosh i hate having random political crap shoved in my face but let me shove some random political crap in your facevote for so and soi dont have a problem with the spam because i feel it will be kept under control by ccp
beat me to the punchwell said stop the evemailUFFFDspam

wheres the tax for posting untested and unvetted ideas in the assembly hall before posting it in ideas and discussion
so long as this doesnt get put ahead of more useful iterations then supported
thats cool and all but its also kind of besides the point the point is that the screen should have a use within the gamein the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
yeahno you can use your alt as an on grid fleet booster or sell it no reason to refund sp for a change like this
people would game the system the instant it went live  building in limits is the only way to prevent that  transferable kill rights tied to status set by whoever sets the contract is a specific fix to the major problem with bounties now they are worthless
then you would miss out on a part of the game that would actually be somewhat funi guess you could always do something else like rat grind roids hump pos shot pos bot missions and incursions or any other heart pounding internet spaceship activity
yes please ccp some sanity on the names would be most helpful 1

two things id love to see improved in the drone window1 drone damage visible for drones in bayit is tiresome to have to move damaged drones into a damaged group to avoid relaunching them after retrieval2 openshut state of drone groups remembered separately for drones in bay and in spacei normally like drone groups to be open in space and closed in the bay having to keep clicking to get this right is a paina couple more things that would be great3 remember the drone groups on the server not the clientfor those of us who use more than one computer its a pain to have to reset all groups when you move to a new machine4 flash the drones info when they are receiving damage just like the watch windowno explanation necessary a suggestion im not so sure about would be to split the hotkeys for logistic and combat drones engage simply doesnt work when you have a logistic drone out with your combat set perhaps not so relevent to pvp but for pve i sometimes tune things to the limitcomments anyonekthis proposal was originally discussed in speakers corner  im putting forward here after positive reception there
im all for 1 24 im less sure about but i dont see them as an overly bad thing though the ability to turn off the flashing damage warning would be importantanother thing ive mentioned elsewhere though i still havent gotten around to making my own thread for it is to make it possible to drag drone groups from the drone window down to the f18 hotkeys to let you launch a group of drones with a hotkey the button would be essentially the same thing as right clicking the group and clicking launch i think that would make drone boats with half a dozen groups of drones much more fun to use and less clicking different groups to launch
csm voting is in progress  up for the topic whoever will be elected for csm i hope this simple feature will be noticed by you
when you light a cyno which has a 10 minute cycle time it actually takes 10 minutes for the red ring around the module icon on the ui to cyclewhen you launch a bomb the ring cycles immediately and theres no indication as to when the module is ready to launch again you kind of have to guesstimate and hope that when you press the button again the cooldown has clearedproposalwhen you launch a bomb the module cycle time the period while the red ring fills up around the module icon on the ui should be matched the to time it takes the module to cooldowneve down under  a community for players in the autz
the one thing against that is that i believe the cycle time is tied to reloading the current system allows you to changereload bombs and not lose time i agree that there should be some indicator though
ah yes i see what youre saying there and how thatd be problematic oh well whatever form it takes i hope ccp gets on to iteve down under  a community for players in the autz
anything to indicate when i can launch my bomb next would be nice cooldown timer or just a pulsing blinking red light around the bomb launcher indicating that its still cooling down mmos come and go but eve remains garresh
just make the bomb launcher reloading time  the cooldown time  who cares how fast you can load a bomb if you cant fire it until cooldown is over anyway
because you can reload while youre waiting for the cooldown to end while offgrid and then you use the remaining cooldown time to cloak up fly to the spot for your next bombing run and get in position for the next pass
it is easy make the bomb deploy in the begin of the launcher cycle and make the cycle as long as the cooldownproblem solved new pos system new sov system
great idea vile rat  this is indeed an issue in hisec and whs  using containers is only a half solution since you cant really manage containers remotely like you can raw assets  so you lose a lot of flexibility using cans you gain some organization but lose being able to search contract repackage even view contents etcfolders that you can name and manage permissions on would be awesome instead
 says the guy in the smart bombing bs
lolmy vote is positive to thisbut definitively drones need more options like return drone bay if harmed protect fleet and autoatack player if standing is low new pos system new sov system

as vile rat has mentioned above the cspa charge no longer applies when you send to multiple contacts by definition what he did is spam ccp condones this for csm members while they are running for office though even thenpeople need to just grow a pair and quit looking for stupid reasons to be offended i figure most of the people enraged over this are kids that just dont have a clue

i can agree it needs fixing but what else can solo players do i mean shall we say you should fix the blob its very hard for solo players in eve due to local intel blobs gangs etc so we got to have some advantage right but yes i agree its not right for large gangs as such those nice loki boosters sat in a posso i suggestallow it for small gangs up to 5 people in fleet anything more its grid onlydo not allow if the booster is in a pos  at all

oo you didnt read the thread did you changing the cycle time to the length of the cooldown has been mentioned twice already in the thread three times including you and the core issue with it has yet to be addressed
show the cycle visually on the module allow reloading during the cycle as it is allowed now problem solvedsame thing with interdictor bubbles
originally this thread called for lic sphere launchers to have the same cooldown but i edited that out of the title i figured since a warp disrupt probe bubble lasts for the same duration as the cooldown give or take 2 seconds theres your indicator right therealthough i suppose if youre no longer on grid with the bubble you put up then it would be worth having the same indicator that theyd hopefully put on the bomb launchers so 1 for that addition tooeve down under  a community for players in the autz
uhh sure if you have interdictors trained to 0 then the launcher delay is 120 seconds just like the bubble duration if you have it trained to 1 which you need to even fly the ship then the delay is 108 seconds if you have it trained to 4 the delay is only 72 secondsso i would say the feature is as important for a bubble launcher as it is for the bomb launcher
resolve it by having allowing to have folders suchshipsammoetci know they have this for corp hangers not enough really but is it all getting loaded for every area or just the ones you look at if all do then thats silly no point loading something you aint gonna look at

why not also allow your guns to automatically shoot at whatever the game considers to be the priority target allow your reps to automatically rep whoever is taking damage and allow your ship to automatically warp off whenever you cant take it you wouldnt have to play the game yourself at all

i was about to post the same issue until i figured using the search tool would be a good starti myself have mused on this idea for a while now dealing with friends in multiple corners of eve id like to fly with when i get bored i can see how you dont want players hopping around that much but 24 hours is effectively two days of not being in the field as you can decide to jump at late night but you cant jump back until even later at night missing out on ctas or eventsskillbased or not i dont really mind as long as it can shave at least a few hours off from a full dayeve can be difficult enough as it is to cross barriers myself i live in a deep pocket in nullsec space it costs 35 mil for a carrier round trip to empire and going by conventional travel will take about 30 jumps part of which will be through hostile territoriesevery now and then my and my rl friends like to poke around in another corner of eve but in this current climate it takes too much time in preparation to spontaneously go ahead and have some fun something which i believe hampers my eve experience marginallysure enough one could argue that i should go ahead and live somewhere else but i think that it shouldnt be that black and white
simple effective and a great idea jc def needs looked at and changed to be more flexible this does the job 1
we can block posts from specific players but there is a strong need to be able to do the same for a corporation and alliance
i agree
ever since seeing the original concept videos for incarna ive always hoped for an rts minigame within eve to perhaps help fledgling fcs figure out tactics or even help show noobs how the big kids play evethe idea itself is simple a match is set up between 2 opponents with a certain number of fitting points up to a maximum amount these points would allow the selection of different classes of ships and eventually lead up to a simulated rts control style minigame where by each participant would take control of a fleet and a grid is selected say on a pos an asteroid field a gate a station once the ships and perhaps fittings for the ships were selected by both players the game would be played where by each player controls their fleet in a top down view slug matchthere could be a betting system in place where by the two players bet on themselves in how much they think they could win no additional skill points should be required and it should focus more on smallmid gang warfare so no capitals would be allowed perhaps have the alliance tournament fleet size rules in place although a bit more expanded to allow for fleets up to 256 or something along those linesan addition of this minigame would bring perhaps some actual use towards the cqwis concept and allow for those who dont normally fc get a somewhat better idea of how things interact in the real world

dear csm  ccp hello i fly a titan class vessel in a corporation with many titan class vessels in a alliance with the most titan class vessels my alliance uses titans more than anyother organization in game i am advocating the deletion of all ttitan class vessels full stop i am also advocating the deletion of all titan specific skills from the database  racial titan skill  doomsday device operation full stop i am also advocating the removal of all titan bpobpcs and titan specific component bpobpc as well as any and all doomsday device bposbpcs full stop in compensation to the effected pilots i am advocating the return of the minerals for the build of the titan and its doomsday device all equipped modules and equipment within the titan to be moved to jita 44 so effected pilots can easily decide what to do with the assets at that point reimburse all skillpoints from the deleted titan specific skills as has been done in the past with other skill deletions make this change at the exact same time compounds are removed from drone region npcs this will offset the vacuum left from that change and soften the potential flood of minerals to market from titan deletion with both changes counterbalancing each other  perhaps not perfectly after the deletion or at the time of deletion  if ccp can make it happen time constraints  introduce a new capital or supercapital platform this supercapital platform would have specific skills required to pilot it and specific bpos to produce it  this new platform would have no offensive capability only defensive its role would be a supportlogistic capitalsupercap it would do things such as create jumpbridges  provide gang bonuses  have a large corporate hanger and ship maintnence array to support its fleet my arguments for this are pretty simple changing titans to do this job is silly as not that many would be required to achieve having enough to support the role currently there are more titans in game that what would be needed to outfit all nullseclowsec groups with this important role furthermore a very large portion of titan pilots did not train for over a year or spend billions upon billions acquiring a hull or further billions upon billions acquiring modules to outfit a titan that has been deemed since inception to be a offensive roled hull to have it suddenly changed to a non offensive hull the supercarrier will retain the role as the dominant force in supercapital warfare specializing in laying waste to capital class vessels and sovereignty structures this is also a stealth buff for dreadnaughts as they will be used in greater frequency to shoot pos  sov structures in the abscense of titans i make the assertion with the complete removal of titans and a addition of supportrole supercapital we will see a more dynamic player experience with more specific roles for players to fill instead of titans dominating the battlefield of all typessincerelypaikaka manfred sideous

may actually be the best solution longterm the flood of minerals would be the big problem but it might be something that needs to be done sooner or later
the flood of minerals would be a temporary problem also it would be the end game considering ccp dont have a clue what to do with titans
i see what you did thereposting in a stealth give me my isk and sp back because youre nerfing titans to no longer be solopwnmobiles thread
yeah pretty much as the ship since its inception was based around its tenacity and devastating offensive capability as well as logistical support taking away a role that was the driving force for majority of players that sought them out and skilled directly for them is unfair actually highly unfair instead do the sensible should have been done years ago and remove them and introduce something better
it stil is an offensive weapon just not against subcaps if this makes you sad ccp does not care
to be fair thats what you and pl consider them to be everyone else at least after remote doomsdays were removed has more or less been using them primarily for logistics
sounds like a fair deal to me titan owners wouldnt get screwed that much by wasting that much isksp for a ship that they never signed in for and gewnies would save some tears for something else to cry overeveryone will be a winner
they give nice bonuses too of course having 30 titans doesnt give you 30x the bonuses but hey
ive got a better idea why dont ccp just make large fleets of titans extremely undesirable as they should have been all alongthat way the self entitled little crybabies that fly them will make a vast mountain of hilarious spergy rant threads which the rest of us can take great pleasure in then unsub and the titans will be effectively removed from the game without the massive influx of minerals caused by ship recycling or the rampant fotmchasing that a skillpoint reallocation would lead toseems like a winwinwin to me
eve is cold scouting enemy forces is for babies in empire real men run into fights blindits called force projection working as intended bring a bigger gang or deal with ityour there for pvp to begin with why would you need a warning that more pvp is coming your way so you can run awaycap ships jumping massive distances is perfectly acceptable simply because we take hours to align and warp and we cant jump by ourselves we cant use gates we cant really target you fast enough to be a threat even if we jump right on top of you infact you probably have a full minute or more to gtfo if you get dropped so i really dont see your problemyou all enjoy telling hulk pilots to align if they dont want to get popped maybe sub cap gangs need to stay aligned during a pvp fight so that the moment they see a cyno they can warp off or get owned

ewar immunity was a good mechanic back when there were  5 in game now with thousands of them its not a good mechanic and yes should be removed by either complete removal or letting a specialized ship project ewar against them
hadnt thought of thatwell then ccp make it for both types of launchereve down under  a community for players in the autz
to be honest the entire warpdrive mechanic in this game seems messed up to meto start why in the world are warp speeds labeled in aus instead of something like i dunno warp factors however i will say this about warping through planets the idea of a warp drive is that a ships warp engine bends the space around itcontracting the space in front of it and expanding the space behind it in this sense the ship is slipping through space in a bubble so warping through planetsstarts should be possiblehowever i also think that once inside a warp bubble we should not be able to see outside of the warp bubblebut i also think that once were inside a warp bubble no one can see us either also star treks rendition of the punch warp seems accurate to me because a warp bubble shouldnt be constrained to the classical limits of acceleration because nothing is actually accelerating its bending the space around it so i think it would make sense for a punch warp to be prevalent in this game lastly i think that aligning should stay the way it is it makes absolutely no sense that youd be able to skip aligningyou still have to be pointing the right direction to be able to travel that far accurately although i dont see why a ship would need to be travelling at 75 speed since maneuvering thrusters and a warp drive are 2 entirely different systems i could argue that a microwarp drive makes absolutely no sense considering everything ive written above but i guess it could be looked past if you think of the mechanics as the warp drive intermittently spurting a warp bubble so that the ship appears to be moving but is really doing very short bursts of a warp so that the ship is again just moving the space around it but in such short bursts that it never actually goes to warp kind of like the way leds can flash so fast that they appear to be constantly on yet they are off between flashesbut only for a very short timei know there are a lot of mechanics that would have to be changed to accommodate all of thisi just really like all of the science behind eve and it really bugs me when the science makes absolutely no sense like ships lacking any kind of inertiamaybe it would make sense if the ships didnt have any maneuvering thrusters and only used their warp drives to move like the way i described microwarp drives could work up there  however that would mean wed have to change afterburners maybe just change those to maneuvering warp upgrade module or somethingthe eve travelling mechanics are so messed up a lot would have to be changed for it to just make sense but it would really make me happy and probably a lot of other people too if it all made sense i know that warp drives and jumping are both theoretical anyways but they could at least make sense in lining up with the currently available theories on warp drive and jump gates its not even stated in game how the warp drives worksomething about energy but the commonly accepted idea is that warp drives have to use some kind of matterantimatter reaction but with that kind of reaction only a small amount of antimatter is needed to create a large amount of energy so it would only take a pound or two of it to sustain a ship for a very long time to anyone arguing for the mass effectwarp drive is a completely different phenomenon from the mass effect theory as that uses a theoretical element zero to increasedecrease the mass of something lets at least stick to the same theories we already use in eve

suggestions deny titans of capital weaponry keep them on dreadnoughts  carriers please a new supersupport device as a defensive option to diminish multiple titans in area being physicallyelectroniclysomethingly unable to have titans operate untimely within range of each other instead thered be sequential activations of say superdevices within vicinity of each other requiring communication to discuss your next titans next move fleets w titans have activation priority rights above solo titans and multiple fleets w titans have competitive activation rights against each other consider this as a militarized safety protocolvariations tech 1  standardized titan 1 per empire  foundations to specialized roles  economical flagship option superweapon device offensive new supersupport device defensivetech 2  specialized titans 2 per empire  specialized command gang linkstitan fleet bonus specialized logistics bridgingclone vattech 3  generalized titan only 1 this probably will not happen not even necessarily
ccp gave the titans their capital weaponry to give them something to do against structures since their doomsday was not really useful there if you want to remove capital weapons from titans you will need to change the titan superweapon to allow it to be more useful against structures my proposal does remove capital weaponry from the titan but only alongside a doomsday buff to allow the titan a consistent damage capability rather than a single blast every 10 minutesinteresting suggestion how would you make that worki think the easier and simpler solution would be a redesign of the superweapon my proposal only adds one super capital hull to the mix this would add 4 the best solution is most often the simplest solution that will be effective i cant support a suggestion that is more complex than my own but if you come up with a simpler solution feel free to post it
inherently quite possibly a low priority update though with recent blog of rebalancing eve one ship at a time i think this can correlate quite well togetherthe proposal is to betterdefine the differentiation of the battlecruiser from the battleship and the cruiser by simply renaming it there is much to a name especially in the encyclopaedia of names items that is eve online i questioned folks in deep core mining inc and they seemed ok with the idea of renaming battlecruiser from its inbetween similarity of cruiser and battleshipwhat would reindentified battlecruisers be known ascondition must remain a militaristic impressiongunboat english probably the only and the best reidentification of the list of battlecruisers it is still an impression of militaristic similarly to battleship yet curiously smaller than battleship and very much rolespecified by the name gunboatother titlesother foreign titles
why simply changing the name doesnt really do anything at all besides all the older players will still call them bcs despite whatever name there is on the group of ships which would just confuse newer players that are seeing gunboat abbreviated as bc
explained why if it were gunboat gb already and this thread existed to change it to battlecruiser youd likely say the same thing of it confusing players and new players and itd probably be more believable eg battlecruiser sounds like battleship be confusingseeit works plus it sounds rather awesome gunboat
what about missile battlecruisers they arent gunboats besides having a general gunboat name would cause much more confusion than battlecruiser since 7080 of current ships are technically gunboatsbut with battlecruiser name the name pinpoints the connection to the cruiser class albeit with modification  battle specialized cruiser i would be more towards changing gb into bc if it was the initial set up
handheld guns shoot projectiles projected from the barrelturrets shoot projectiles  lasers projected from the barrellaunchers shoot missiles projected from the barreltechnically equally battleships too yet its a different ship a battlespecialized cruiser can equally be a gunboat and a battlespecialized cruiser would be a tech2 variation specialized of a cruiser in eve online terms recently
just changing the name accomplishes nothing and is too trivial to waste the devs time onand your reasoning is a matter of interpretationnot supportingoh and no one ever calls a missile centric ship a gun boat battlecruiser  battleship makes a hell of a lot more sense at that ratejust look at the ships of the navy stop the evemail spam
modularity is for nich ships keep titans big fracking ships that can do allot of thingswith current change by ccp that will diminish them as being subcap pasters in solo fleetsthough big super ship should have some thing it does that other ships cant doas i suggested before allow capitals to dock inside them being that they are so huge a fleet should be able to fit inside them and or fit that in addition to its titan bridge and a huge corp hanger freighter size would give it a power for assisting fleets along with fleet bonus found on no other ships not a solo ship i win button but a big boast to top the balance
it figures that a goon would find fault in any solution that could actually help the game rather than specifically help goons then accuse others of being crybabies bit rich isnt it seeing as goons cried the loudest to ccp because those big bad titans that naughty pl fly somehow managed to shoot double lse drakes with microwarp drives how dare they shoot goons im surprised you guys didnt also demand the sig radius on drakes be lowered so that nobody can shoot back at you i mean hey theres only 7000 or so goons clearly you are outnumbered so maybe you should have also asked ccp for a nerf to alliance sizes while they were at it for every alliance except goons of course since you are all so special  note the capital s thereyes the big red bus will be along to pick you up shortly stop being a bunch of hypocrites and start using what little brain power you actually have and try seeing this from the perspective of all eve playersso onto the serious part yes this is a solution no i dont see it as being the only solution but you all have to admit it would resolve the age old question once and for all is the problem titans themselves or is the real problem the lack creativity that everyone else seems to have when trying to come up with a counter to themi dont actually think the problems are titans i think the problem is 2 parts politics 1 part ccp not having a clue about what they were doing introducing them in the first place seems almost like introducing titans was done similar to how the technetium changes were made eg lets try this and see what happensand if anything bad happens then we can always say its on our roadmap of things to fix the issues with titans are not much different from a lot of other ships it happened with battleships blobbing up and shooting everything else smaller happened with super carriers doing much the same and so on regardless of ship type what makes the difference is this someone who is better organised than you and not necessarily bigger is very likely going to come at you and if you arent ready or arent well organised then youll probably die its really that simplehow about we just remove every ship type higher than a bs that way goons can still keep up with their jihadi behaviour toward ice miners still gonna need isotopes for fuel blocks so plenty of room for market manipulation and they wont have to spend so much time whinging about capitals im sure there will be something else theyll find to complain about though
while reading all the forumsignatures of your alliance mates about this topic  i actually do get the impression that ccp does care if you cry long enough
your angry keyboard flailing about evil goony dev manipulation aside this bit i completely agree with ccp never had a clear vision for what titans should do in the game since they were first introduced and showed a complete lack of understanding as to how introducing them would affect the game if ccp had been running itself like a proper grownup company at the time rather than throwing new ships at the game with a design brief of lets make something kool and awesome with a lot of wildly diverse abilities but its ok because at 40bn per hull only the biggest alliances will be able to afford even one or two theres no way theyll ever be massproduced or thrown around casually we wouldnt be in this messthankfully this tracking nerf seems to be step one of ccp righting its longstanding mistakes and going through the process of giving titans a clear defined role
not sure if you are trolling or get what you are actually saying but where are titans in the process of getting a clear defined role when your just reducing their abilities besides the jump portal whohoo 100b pvp ship just to bridge other ships aorund there is literaly no purpose you cant just replace a titan with a different type of ship t3s are mostly prefered as a bonus supplier already since they are way cheaper easier to move and can give differentmostly more usefull boni dreads and scs do both better dps anyway so would you please explain why you think this is an improvment for defining the role of titans
this is easyif titans cant shoot subcaps then subcaps shouldent be able to lock titans exept hics of coursethen if you want to kill a titan you bring your own capitals ships a titan still can kill if you want to kill a titan you should risk getting raped in your own super capitals and not lean back looking smug orbiting in your cheap ass drake and think you are good at this game
its almost like you didnt read the tracking nerf thread or something
by ccps own admission the tracking nerf is a quick fix because they cant decide on a role for titans its almost like they dont read their own dev blogs and learn nothing from their past mistakesanyway  titans were always meant to be very rare in eve frankly deleting all existing titans compensating players by returning some titan specific skillpoints and some portion of their value in minerals is a pretty good ideaif you still think there should be titans in eve  and tbh i think there should be a ship class called titan  then give us a new properly designed and properly balanced ship that fills a role that doent completely unbalance large scale warfare most importantly remove bpos and tightly control the supply of bpcs to limit the number of those ships
the main problem i see is the greyscale nerf realistically reduces dps versus subcaps by 25 subcaps will still be blapped in short order this is a useless slap in the face in a long list of useless slaps in the face against titans every titan nerf the antititan parties gather in celebrations and countdowns to nerf day to only find out soon later that they are still getting ownzoned by titans if you read seleenes blogmy ceo  vote seleene you will see where the problem with this and pervious nerfs are basically ccp has done this over and over through the years with titans kick the can down the road however when they do so the titan falls down the list of priorities on the backlog allowing them to divert attention to higher priorities instead of repeating this scenario again for the 5th time lets just do the sensible thing delete titans as they exist now and everything titan involved problem solved then ccp can take all the lessons learned over the years and design a new titan that better fits into eve at that point the players will decide if they want to skill for or pilot the new titan its really that simple now i get it the antititan crowd wants vengence they are unhappy to have been subjugated to titan blapping they would like nothing more than to see the pilots punished but i say punished for what titan pilots used the ship that ccp put into the game no matter what ccps best intentions were reality is the titan has been a subcap smashing machine since introduction and will continue to be post greyscale nerf deleting titans is a victory for everyone and a damn sure sight better than kicking the can down the road again for the 5th time with a openended statement we will revisit these later we all have seen what that means18 month anyone as a titan pilot i can live with blapping with 25 less dps for another 18 months can youdelete titansseleenes blog

yes please also other things enable hotkeying launch of a specific drone group or as you say the ability to drag a drone group icon to the hud button rack being able to launch with one click instead of clickrightclickmenudragclick would be nice allow mining drones to use the engage hotkey if the target is an asteroid merge the silly mine and mine repeatedly commands who sends their drones to mine exactly oncenested folders is a horrid ui design for a combat function imagine if we had to open a folder of guns mounted on the ship then right click one and select fire gun in order to attack with a turret weapon absurd and yet this is how our drone weapon system works
because it actually iscynos are currently one goddamn problem when you try to fly close range ships like gallente for example or armor tanked shipsand the instant hotdrop fleetsupercap whatever doesnt just feel rightsure you have option to always fly kiting ships with falcons and so on gay setups but really cynos are fine hahhahactivating noncovops cyno on grid with enemy gang in any subcap should be nearly suicidal tbhnot that it would be enough with these instant travel jump bridges eithery u why not get back to real fights instead of blueballing the poop out of a single drake
i suggest a move of the motd to be moved from the client to the eve launcherit just makes more sense that way and it will be a quicker way to get information out to the playerscomments ideas and general feedback are welcome as always
dont know about you but ive already turned the launcher off
theres this little thing called progress i know it scares most people but advancements in technology especially given the current setting of eve would allow for such breakthroughsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i dont really care what the maneuver looks like i just think that we need to either a make all of the systems larger and make ships slightly faster in warp so that the acceldecel time is less pronounced orb make the acceldecel time much much shorter not instant as someone already showed how this is bad and is probably bad for technical reasons toowhy because right now unless the systems are very very large there is not a significant difference in the amount of time it takes to warp across them trying to catch someone is more dependent on lag and the size of the systems and not what ship you are flying this is bad as it makes a warpspeed stat kind of useless at this point they might as well basically be the same except for freighters but if youre being chased and your in a freighter you have another problemim not saying it should be instant im saying that the way it is now ships spend waaay to much time getting into and out of warp and not enough time at warp speedon the whole science thing its very easy to come up with a reason for the visual effects the warp bubble only lets in very high energy particles those being photons light and radiation the radiation coruscates providing the simmery white light and the light just appears as it is images other sources of highenergy particles are either not concentrated enough to be noticed or blocked by other matter as for the whole ships actually being submarines just pretend this is an alternate universe where the victorian era scientists were right and space actually a luminiferous aether that our ships plough through constantly slowing them down limiting top speed ships in eve do have inertia if they didnt have inertia they would travel the same speed even after sharply changing direction nanofit ships try to do this but dont get all the way to inertialess

time for abump
i dont know but i imagine itd equalize the mass devastation that their superdestructive weaponsa bring possibly an active forcefieldb like playerowned structures as one example which i dont know how they work or a specious active cloaking fieldc similar to those deployablesabc  massdestruction  massprotection  massevasioninvasionthis thought spawned from having titans not just a militarist presence but instead supporting industrialists and sovereign deficits budgets economists and all that financial babblebut it is applying a new gamerule to using capital superweapons it is a control to the chaos from which subordinate ships have more perseverance in combat without multiple superdevices being activated it is a control for balance and where balance and control exists produces a fairer game and satisfied gamers a fictional militarized safety protocol addressing the need to control the titan problem still they can be redesigned to target structures with this control solution inmind thats no problem
putting a pos shield on a titan seems a little overpowered to me so would a field that cloaks everything around itif you can solve the super weapon issue by redesigning it the new game rule becomes pointless and a waste of time and effort by dev teams who could be working on fixing other stuff
i support this idea
i actually like this option a little better that the ops or both ideas could be used in conjunction 2412 hour cooldown for long distance jumps and an 84 hour cooldown for going to the system next door
not supported nobody is going to gain anything from this and it wont change anything eitherbesides neither the drake nor the myrmidon coincidentally my two favorite battlecruisers and the only two i ever flybuy are gunboats the myrmidon is a droneboat the drake is a missileboat every other battlecruiser is a gunboat sure the myrmidon can utilize guns but it doesnt get any kind of bonus to its gunsat the moment gunboat is one of three unofficial classifications that apply to multiple shiptypes we have gunboats which are ships that have good guns we have missileboats which are ships with good missiles and we have droneboats which are ships with good drones and then we have the typhoon which tries being all three and fails horribly at itwhy should battlecruisers suddenly be renamed gunboats itll just create more confusion when people mention the word and actually talk about ships like the rifter or hurricane
id much rather gunboat be used for a t2 destroyer designed for killing swarms of frigates
cruiser battlecruiser and battleship are 3 different names with 3 different meanings for 3 different shiptypes with 3 different roles doesnt get much more different than that no renaming of an entire class of ships is necessarynow the idea of gunboats as a new class of ship might be interesting needs a purpose to create them though
ok sounds cool standard gunboat t1 previously named destroyer advanced gunboat destroyers specialized t2  multirocket masters advanced gunboat interdictors specialized t2  antiwarp masters
apparently you just dont get it either that or you are trolling which is violating forum rules and i should report you
dont like it no need to be judgemental and unnecessary about a harmless post just say no and move on now please its a suggestioni considered the name destroyer as a titled specialized ship like most specialized t2 are and so i suggest gunboat as being the more generic militarist impression as the new t1 standard of this group of spaceshipsunderstand my perspective now
you came here asking for an opinion and you got itif you dont like itthen kindly walk awayps if you cant take criticsim then dont expect mercy stop the evemail spam
i support this and something to know which asteroid my laser is on because when an asteroid disappears the laser doesnt stop and its hard to tell which laser isnt actually doing anything so you turn of a laser and pray and hope you didnt just cancel the wrong one
while at it maybe also show which rocks are being mined by others this would be a great help in larger mining operationsmining is too much of a waste of time for me these days but i remember on big mining ops how annoying it could be to be mining with 20 hulks in a belt and trying to find the rocks which arent targetted by others so mining is most efficient
no more wis content until fighting in station is implemented
you forgot to tell to us your alliance bought for rmt so many titan from morsus mihi when they leaving this gameso before you ask titan delete you need to ask delete those pilot accounts too from ccp
you forgot to learn the language that your accusing ppl stupid untruths with mate
tipical damage controlmy language is the main problem not the pls rmt supcap transfer from mm
your questionable reading skills might actually be the reason why you think pl has to rmt at all have you checked the technetium prices recently
because i know who sold those ships for to pl and raidenmaybe its time to check for the ccp those titans how they transfered without isk and without build to new proprietors
theres 400 titans give or take a few that in minerals is a fair amount but they need to get to market and back into the chain i bet youd notice a slight change in the market in some bits of null for a very short while then nothing ccp might lose 400 subscriptions big deal thats 0001 of the eve player base likely theyll just all become supercap pilots and the minerals will be used to build supercaps then supercaps will be removed
1counter proposaldelete all sub capital ships equipment skills bpos and bpcssolve the real hobo blobnow that would be win sauce
how about giving them some sort of flagship status titans arent meant to be something anyone can just fly theyre meant to be rare valuable ships that gives the pilot some kind of status strip it of its guns let it remain able to use all the fancy titanonly modules and give it superior fleet bonuses while keeping it too expensive to just bring to every battle this might actually give them the flagship status i always imagined titans having instead of the slightly bigger frigatestatus they have now titans werent meant to be something everyone could just get in fact removing all current titans reimbursing the sp and adding a flagshipclass with the same names and models as the current titans might be the right way to go or even better remove all titanblueprints but let the current titans stay when theyre gone there will be no replacing them which will lead to them eventually getting some status when enough are killed by smaller cooler shipsim not saying this is the only way to go but its definitely one way
ok so after the upconing and  titans nerf1 cannot shoot subcapitals why subcapitals will able to shoot titans2 alone can only kill carriers with doomsday and maybe dreads so doomsday device is now unuseful3 titan will take a lot of time targetting even capitals 5mm scan resolution its a joke4 titans dont receive at least an extra bonus like more damage or something like that  its a 7090 billion stuff what is the add value to have a titan basicly ccp is leaving a vessel only to shoot poses and do bridges lol we need to expend 90b to do bridges ccpccp are you really thinking what are you doing  i think nope csm guys are not doing his jobs for whole eve community thats is a clear statement pd sry for caps but for god sake this the more ridiculous nerf i ever saw in eve history this kind of decisions are killing the game or fastening his inevitable death
lolmaybe you should not participate on this discussion
yes please the drone window is depressingly ugly and hard to read
agreedbut i feel much more is needed drones need to be looked at not only from ui perspective but also as a weapon system as a wholeeven the combat rules for drones should be revisited for instance when drones are set to aggressive why is it that deploying them while fired upon will not make them attack your target automatically but once you manually tell them to attack they will move from target to target without being told to do so even if the target isnt being locked makes the game awkwardand i would love some kind of a visual indicator a small one on the drone window that tells me whether the drones are set to aggressive or passive without having to open the settings windowadditional drone modules would be nice too utility drones like the repair or neut ones could be looked at i dont think ive ever seen anyone use them same with webber drones especially heavies theyre not that greatin closing more drone love please
i totally agree that the character transfer system sucks
oh wow youre clearly really seriously and hardcore or something for yelling in caps scamming in character trade is petitionable this isnt even remotely a priority or worth developer time
yepwe should probably leak a list of account names acquired through character transfersthat might help get faster action on this issue
uronksur suth yeah yeah the post is in caps its doing what its supposed to and getting people to read this yes it is petition able but what i am saying is that a better system can be implemented so that you dont have to give your account name and also not get scammedby the way if your character does get hacked even if you get it back all the assets may have been stripped and generally are not reimbursed to you
bingo the pvp group of the game as a whole is the biggest group of whinerscrybabies in the game obviously not all of you but a good majority how about you keep your big mouths shut for once and practice what you preach like stated above you like to tell the hulk pilots what they should be doing but you are too stupid to do it and then come to the forums and cry about how you got popped and think the game mechanics need to be changedyou complainerscrybabies out there should probably just stfu unless you have a legitimate complaintidea for fixing things hell yes cap ships should hotdrop and travel large distances faster than the fleet but it requires a team effort to get them there even if it is an alt since they need a cyno 1 to the idea of having caps be able to jump to celestials at the same distance as a cyno id leave the cyno ingame though for more options lighting a cyno is more risky since you put up a beacon that says look here we are o right here come oni realize maybe the rant above was slightly unnecessary but im just tired of all the bing and complaining from people who can only think of one way to fix it nerf the hell out of everything that they dont use because someone else has an advantage someone else will always have an advantage someway or another so deal with it keep the ideas coming though some neat things being tossed around keep it positive and lets move forward instead of falling backwards nerfing crap thanksoh and ephemeron the bing and complaining bit was not directed at you sir just seems to be everywhere you bring up some good questions and i like the idea of the jump drive spool timers and mobile cynojammers
kestrel  dont be stupid a cynonoobship enough there so ridiculous this cyno mechanic insta travel no risk for cynocharacter because not need clone not need expensive ship just a noobship etcits time to change this
you look like you could be my longlost brother this is a good rational argument for a short delay between lighting a cyno and being able to jump just those few seconds delay make all the difference in the world tacticallyand for those who would complain about having to do it this way adapt or die isnt that what you tell other people
no cynos are notwe should not suffer or even entertain the stupid idea of making sub caps safe from hot dropping by pvp hungry caps or bridge gangsif you want sub caps safe from hotdrops move to highsec
not need spool timer but need travel time after cyno pop upadd after every one light year to 1 second to travel timethats mean the jump from 15 ly would be 15 sec time long if the cyno ship popped the fleet travel would be broken there where the fleet its travelingwhen they moving on a 10 ly route and their cynoship down at the 7th seconds the travel would be broken at the 7th ly and the fleet would arrive just there where they are just during the travel15 sec enough time to managing the fleet travel if the cyno ship open a cyno at safepoint because no one can landing there within 15 sec but when someone open a cyno at the battle or dangerous position need bigger ship than noobships or frigs for survive until their fleets do not arrives therenoobships open the cynos with pure clones thats unacceptable
personally im not fully opposed to this ideas but strict criteria should be met1 medals should only be displayable on actual uniformtype upper body wear uniform shirt field marshal coat2 those who dont have those items or dont want to display them on their avatar should have a display case in their cq for the display of their medals3 displayable medals should only be obtainable through the nex store to add legitimacy to it3a the nex store should also add things such as dogtags and hats militarystyle hats berets and other headgearif someone earned something from their corp they should have a means of displaying it with pride it adds to the immersion of the game and in and of itself is not gamebreakingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

new npc agent distribution missions specifically targeted to help enrich low security spacemission drug runninga new mission type will be added to specifically enrich the black market element of game play these missions will be tied into distribution agents that are present in low sec space however only players who have a security status of 30 or less will have the opportunity to be presented with one however they are not intended to be so commonthe mission will present a high isk and lp earning distribution mission where the player will have a limited amount of time to delivery some illicit drugs into neighbouring high sector system from out of the low sector area the target system will be random but the suggestion here is to at least have to penetrate a least a few sectors to give some potential difficulty due to security issues it may also be plausible based on the playerUFFFDs security status to therefore be offered a mission which will take them into hostile policed space a suitable awareness message may be helpful for these missions as a resultthe volumes of drugs as mission items are suggested to be relatively small though some variance to volumes associated with mission level difficulty is an obvious link to apply here
mission insurgent deliverythis is another low security distribution mission type available to players with a security status of 20 or less rewards can be as per normal distribution types here with perhaps a slight improvement in isk rewards ideally it probably needs to be a fairly uncommon mission offered to players due to its effectsthe idea is to deliver an insurgent hacker terrorist spy etc to a high security station in a system at some distance away eg up to 8 sectors or more but is not so much an emphasis on haste to achieve bonusesonce delivered the insurgent will UFFFDtemporarilyUFFFD reduce the effectiveness of that station for a small period of time minutes for the following specific features 1 escrow charges will be increased by a small percentage to everyone2 station offered refining yields will drop by a small percentageyou cannot apply multiple effects or compound effects due to multiple insurgents being delivered but the time will extend to the length as per the last delivered insurgent also effects will be more relevant and apparent to lower security systems than the higher ones ie 10 security systems will be less affected by this process than equivalent 05 security systemsto offset this feature other normal distribution missions in high sec will have other normal deliveries occurring in the form of security agents such that if a delivery of this type occurs at a station currently affected by an active insurgent it acts to cancel out any active insurgencies and when this does occur there is a substantial bonus applied to the reputation awards normally afforded for that delivery
corrections to current corporate hanger cargo holdsit is viewed as a need to correct the current ease of applied use of these kind of cargo storage areas eg orca to be made accessible to player scanners and be treated in a similar way as regular cargo space but equally applying this suggestionUFFFDs features to allow for a correct interpretation of smuggling possibilities for players

havent read all the details but i think this would certainly add welcome stuff and would thus add to the atmosphere to the rather monotonous content of eve eg if you compare the pve with the x3 possibilities although i agree that eve has its strong point in the mmo aspect while x3 is singleplayer
i believe that i made some smallmedium ammatar neuts at one point and even thought in my little head that i made a profit but most likely i was deluding myself lol  as funny as that is though its just sad that some of the frigatesized items are literally unobtainable due to the costs involved youre very often better off buying a faction or even deadspace item for the cost of the tags to get that small federation navy armour repairer or we this is a sad sad state of affairs  please fix it ccp
i miss my ywing from swg eve filled a big hole when i left swg even though eve is immensely more difficult to figure out than swg ever was but its internet space ships and theyre very important  im still learning stuff even now and ive played for years but alot of the freeflight pilots from swg couldnt adapt to eves strategic play style so i left literally hundreds of people that loved or hated me behind and made new friends here the key that kept me here is the people i met the first corp i joined was the one whos ceo actually helped me salvage a wreck i couldnt something that simple and i was pretty edgy about accepting the help because id had one guy try to kill me already that day after looting one of my wrecks his kestrel didnt last long under the guns of my cormorant i was a ratter in a destroyer they got me into mining and taught me that not all roids are created equal and a scanner can save time when youre not in a bargeall it takes is one person to give a newbie a leg up and it points them in the direction that eve is a social game more than anything else
itd certainly add something to mining other than to warp around lock the nearest shiney rock and shoot it until youve got it all in the hold then move to the next one id love to see this in as itll also make it a bit more complex for the suicide gankers to hit a normal miner id assume a botter program would have to scan every so often as an algorithm which would probably make it easier to spot as itd be scanning in a more regular pattern than a real player would the only losers would be the lazy people and potentially the botters if it was implemented as has been discussed here and the new players are taught to scan i never saw a tutorial for it though they might have one now
while we are fixing confusing gun names why dont we do somthing about the lazers medium lazers are light heavey lazers are medium and giga are mearly heavey i know of at least one frig torny kill mail that caused the acusation of cheet because it had an aparently medium sized weapon on it
hope this happens
i want old names back they added some coolness and made life easier to tell someone what you wanted i could ask someone to find some bloodclaws for me and theyd buy kinetic light missiles now i have to ask them for some trauma light missiles longer to type in and they might buy the wrong missile due to them all being trauma missiles i mean really couldnt they just have added kinetic light missile to the bloodclaw name or just bloodclaw light kinetic we know its a missile anyway so the word missile in the name is kinda redundantactually while im on a rant why did fofs get to keep their names
i heard some rumor that ccp might be making new turret models for missile launchers that would be a great addition to the game but some other improvements to missiles could be made as well to add all around improvements to the weaponcosmetic1 missile reaching its target it would be great for effect if each missile had a long white streak following it as seen in various movies and anime reference cowboy bebop outlaw star and if fired as a group they would look like a swarm and not just one hard to say if the missile model should change i would emphasize streaks being the missiles generally are moving too fast for anyone to get a good view on them also have the streaks be one of 4 colors depending on damage size changes depending on size of missile2 missile explosions some of them seem too large and the explosion is very transparent i would think the should explode with more of a concentrated punch like a ball of light function of auto targeting fof missilesauto targeting missiles should have a functioning targeting system currently they target anything including asteroids and npc structures did sloth from the goonies design the targeting systems give it it should not be perfect but seriously the heck it would be fixed 1 in missions target only rats and or turrets things with a red cross on them2 outside of missions list of acceptable targets can be increased or decreased default only reds and people being hostile to you to include neutrals as well blues and fleet members by default not targetable 3 the main group of missiles fly to the nearest target in range if target is destroyed they go to next nearest 4 base damage reduced to 90 of nonfof missile5 a quarter of all missiles fired do not go to nearest target but a random one at range fof skill can affect this at level 1 50 fly at random level 5 25 go random fof skill to level 5 gives access to tech 2 ammo that can be fired out of respective tech 2 launcher this would make the missiles useful for quick shots and convenience of having a missile target enemies on its own mitigating locking times and jamming the obvious downside would be the reduced base damage combined with not being able to focus where missiles go they are smart enough to shoot ships and not roids but not much else beyond nearest target and some ma fall of mark with added effort a person can with regular missiles lock targets for more damage and sure fire way of having them focused all on the right target with these changes the fof missile could have a role other than a joke weapon with advantages and disadvantages over regular missiles what do you think other ideas to improve or change missiles

um actually not always ive lost several ships where help from people in corp  alliance might have saved them there were standing fleets when i was out in 00 that basically listened for someone calling for support so that they could go and dock and cower in the station instead no matter how much we would have out gunned the attackers
sounds like someone is suffering from shitcorpitisalso the way the op keeps insisting that the beacon is sec status dependant and his constant use of the word piwates downgrades this from crap idea to gank butthurt whine thread

supported lets face it its a simple change to make that will make miners life that little bit easier also it will help the long neglected mining community feel a little better about all the recent patchesin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
im tempted to suggest having mining lasers pull in ore every few seconds instead of every few minutes just so there is less waste in a system poorly designed for player driving optimizationor at the very least automatically shut down a laser if the asteroid has disappeared
define too expensive when someone drops 20 titans on you thats well over a trillion isk you simply cannot balance titans by making them too expensive  that was just one of the fundamentally flawed assumptions made when titans were introducedbut yeah deleting existing titans and replacing with something truly rare and impressive again gets a 1 from me keeping the existing names and models makes sense
1 to deleting them and trying again same should be done with scs in all honesty
why not introduce something new make titans corpvessels operated by more users like a pos one guy fly it next guy fires frontguns next guy rear guns etc it would advance the game in a new experience of battle instead of nerfing it or deleting it transform it to a multiuser plattform
delete titans way to throw the baby out with the bath water i cant understand why so many people think thats a good ideajust fix them ffsby that  i presume you mean not deleting themendminirantin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
yesthis would actually be the best way to handle titans the people crying about the nerf would be reimbursed adn could respend however they want the people crying for the nerf get rid of their source of unhappiness
bahahaha  so because your shiny iwin button is being nerfed it should be deleted from the game altogether donUFFFDt be such a douche manny and go back to playing eve the hard way like most of us do
everyone feel the silence of pl crying girls after this post  d
sith8 the greyscale changes nothing really other than the fact that titans wont blap roaming gangs in fleet fights titans will still be blapping happily which makes the change pointless however what the change does accomplish is it lowers the priority for ccp allowing titan redesign to fall down into the backlog pushing real development further away this is not speculation its how ccp does things so rather than a pointless nerf that nobody is happy with just delete titans ccp when they have time can then reinvent them and introduce them again properly this solution everyone wins instead of the current status quo where everyone losses and then we wait 18 months for ccp to get back to the subject ccp has other things they are working on in inferno and obviously a redesign of titans is not on the table  clearly thats what predicated this bandaid nerf except its a bad bandaid as it doesnt actually achieve the goals of the nerf i mean you realize were talking about ccp here correct in regard to the comment you made directed at me i have fun fighting in eve in no matter what ship class my alliance has some new fleet concepts that makes fighting with titans seem boring solve the problem instead of bandaids
i and most people i know are p darn happy with the nerf and do not agree with you that itUFFFDs pointless on the contraryperhaps thatUFFFDs the complete opposite to pee lbut iUFFFDll give you that no one does crying better than you guys or at least you are the first to demand that a whole ship class with all class specific modules and skills to be deleted from the game because you canUFFFDt play with it like you used todeal with it pee l smug
i agree more drone love anyway i think its highly unlogical that my drones need bandwidth from the mother ship yet they attack ships even though i didnt lock them either they act as autonomous ai bots and dont need constant bandwidth or they dont act autonomously and need to be told to go there and shoot this and that just one of the unlogical things wrt drones

happens a lot in jita its a high sec war thing fighting on stations sucks anyway but this makes it even harder to competently fight anyone on a stationhappens all the time in lowsec anytime you get into a fight with pirates on a station they will undock a carrier to rep beli datmy apologies i did not mean fuel i meant strontium so you cannot have a reinforce cycle longer than the 24h it takes to circumvent the war declaration it happens quite a lot if you attack anyones tower in high sec with any know howyou lose money everytime you lose a ship even if it is insured and im not talking about large sec rises here and it should scale per ship size so you would have to invest a fair amount of isk and effort to exploit it
this would provide an intriguing method for making very deep safes which i am lead to believe are considered bad
very deep safe for what please tell me how can you kill a cyno which is open 8au from you15 sec really enough for you to kill it the cyno ship very deep safes blablatry it first1sec you need to realize to a cyno opened up in the system you starting to warp there with a fast tackler you need 12 sec align time and you need to travel at least 1015 sec try it23 sec need to leave the warp effect when you reach the cyno point and you cant targeting under this sequence when you leave the warp do you need target the ship if you are with a fast tackler such as a inty you need 08 sec target time to frig  you need to kill hima kestrel need 23 shot with inty thats 35sec minimumdo you think about it this is shorter time than 15 sec  no way and with a bigger ship the travel and align time is much longeri bet you you cant kill a cynoship under 15 sec if the cynoship open the cyno 5aurange from you because you cant travel there and kil him under 15 sec

when will ccp create a dislike button for these forumsyou suggestion doesnt suit me so 1
seems a lot of effort when its just so much easier to get a fleet of friends together send them through the gates ahead of the smuggler and get them to kill any customs ships that are hanging around they will suffer a sec hit but so what its fun and your shady goods get to jita ok i do have to wonder though as to what you would be smuggling anyway only thing of any real value would be boosters anything else just isnt worth the trouble
boosters are primarily the player related product that would be of most emphasis i guess and yes im aware of the potential move by ccp to legalise them or reduce the illegality associated with some to potentially open up this trade of course for selfish reasons of this proposal there would be an interest to maintain their statusthere are also a number of npc trade goods that have variable legality in empire sectorskhumaakprotein delicaciessmall armsectoplasmnarcotics various typeselite slavesslavesplutoniumtoxic wasteso potentially some aspect by ccp could be exploited to make low sec industry apply some profitable trade runs to other areas with these products where they dont already exist of courseit would be nice to see more player related products of course to expand on the possible illegal industry possibilitiesone idea i had thought of was cheaper counterfeit productseg some implants could have a counterfeit or black market equivalence they would operate in a similar way to their regular bonefide version but they would also have a negative effect associated with them to balance out a cheaper cost problem with these is they would obviously compete with regular implants to some extent and also would need to be labelled in the market correctly to make them stand out from regular implants so as to not confuse the twoas such the black market versions could be made available in low sec lp stores but have some illegal status to transport but not illegal to use there may be other more sensible counterfeit items that could be treated in a similar wayor there may be new opportunites similar to boosters which would actually expand on illegal products players can make sensibly and fit into the economy if you can think of any such items that might be useful id appreciate it ill keep it in mind of course but havent applied much thought to it as yet
i agree that smuggling  blackmarkets are a wasted opportunity in eve atm so read the pdf and heres my thoughtsi like the skill based approach it seems right that cloaking should be a prerequisite and i like the idea that its not 100 certain to workthe secret compartment module is a good idea as well although i think it should work a little differently consider that the more secret compartments you have on a ship the more likely they are to be discovered by customs so it seems backwards that having more of them would increase the chance of concealing your contraband i suggest you have two modules a lowslot and a midslotsecret compartment ilow slot module that adds x m3 of shielded storage space either in seperate cargo hold or in your main for each extra secret compartment after the first you receive a penalty to your concealment percentage like a reverse stacking penalty meaning that you can either transport small amounts at less risk or larger amounts at higher riskcargohold white noise emittersa mid slot module that emits a signal similar to a cargohold full of consumer electronics used in conjunction with a secret compartment to conceal the blank space in the cargohold that would otherwise show up on cargohold scanners adds x to the value of the concealment skillfinally i dont much like the idea of a ship that gets a bonus to concealment as it really breaks with the immersion in the game i mean if a company started making trucks with hidden compartments to avoid customs i think thered be a pretty good chance all such trucks would get pulled in for a check the whole idea behind smuggling is that it cant look like what it is so imo it should happen on all the regular ships in eve not some designated smuggler shipjust my two centsyargle
btw it also always bothered me that there are customs agents on all highsec gates that scan all ships if you are patient and careful enough and move with a scout it should be possible to plot a course through the 05 and 06 systems without running into customsalso itd be great with a mechanic that took into account how many ships are currently at the gate if youre moving through a gate with 60 people on it customs should be less likely to check your particular ship than if youre all by yourselfyargle
some good pointscan you expand on the seperate cargo space model for the secret compartments would you see it as like having an expandable bay area that needs these modules to become active and as such would be a new mechanic applicable to all ships that would only become applicable when these modules are applied would you see each module granting a fixed m3 rather than  care to suggest some maths to illustrate useagethis does make sense as a custom fitted design to ships that smugglers would use and i take the criticsim that a ship designed for such purposes would stand out i guess my purpose here was to give some incentive to use of the ship but i guess even as a fast equivalant it would be useful so id be happy to drop the dedicated role bonus if its not deemed to be sensible it would then be a case of how best to adjust the numbers as i had this factored into a role for the ship as a result
ideally it would be a new cargo compartment like the drone bay or the ore hold on a rorqual as this would be by far the easiest way to manage your concealed cargo the available space for contraband etcwith regards to secret compartments giving a percentage based bonus volume to the concealed cargo space m3 you can go two ways on that if you make it percentage based that will mean that you can carry more contraband cargo on a bigger ship if it is instead a fixed value you could argue that a small compartment is more difficult to locate on a large battleship than on a small frigate and have the ship volume somehow impact the concealment effectiveness of the compartment  either way makes sense to mei didnt work out any numbers my notion was purely conceptual and based on game immersion i think the very nature of smuggling is that you try to look just like any other ship out there also in my humble opinion there already are enough cookie cutter configurations out there in new eden id prefer more ways to use the ships i already havegreat ideas though and would work as a good base for the later implementation of a proper black market in lowsecyargle
my thoughts on the matter firstly bounty payouts must be payed when a ship is destroyed not just a pod i think that is something most people agree needs changing secondly the payout needs to be in line with the ship loss up to a maximum of the bounty set and insurance payouts reduced by the value of the bounty so it is not ever profitable to collect your own bounty with an alt or friendly 3rd partythose 2 things have to happen before any other changes to fix the most broken part of the system i agree that you should be able to set a bounty when you acquire kill rights from an unlawful kill regardless of the players sec statusaccepting a bounty should transfer kill rights to do so should cost a small  of the targets bounty and give you kill rights for 7 daysbounties should be acceptable for yourself your corp or an allinaceif someone else collects the bounty within those 7 days you lose the kill rights and your bounty acceptance fee is refundedpretty simple but really all that needs to be doneregards mike712 the battleclinic team
supported good idea to solve a long standing problem if ccp wants to advertise bounty hunting as a legitimate career path in eve they best make it one these changes would be a good move in that direction
hi alli was just looking at my skill sheet earlier and i saw the sp i wasted in defender missilesi think nearly everyone would love to just ditch that skill completely and get their sp back as its one of the most useless skills everhowever i was wondering why defenders are never used they were a good idea to provide personal defence im british thats how you spell defence here honest against missile spamming ships but 999 of pilots would rather have an offensive capability on their ship rather than waste high slots for a dubious at best defensive systemmy proposal is instead of having defender missiles only target missiles aimed at you they be able to destroy any missiles aimed at anyone in your fleet think of it as your patriot antimissile battery for evei should also point out this will only work for fleets it wont work against missiles randomly fired at npcsfcsccp that arent in your fleetthis will actually make defender missiles worth using on certain ships fleet scorpions loldps from cruise so have them be your missile shield instead as well as ecm as an example and it would also mean there would be absolutely no need to nerf drakes or tengus as there would now be a handy counter to missile spamming like there was supposed to beyour thoughtstrollsinsultsimprovementsapathy
it would be nice if ship defense included point defense hard points with turret and missile forms for missiles and drones or that pesky frigate but then special hard points would likely be needed and ships would need to be significantly rebalanced
i would agree with this however eve has a lot of  up names id frankly rather keep dealing with the odd names that currently exist than have to learn new ones the missile name up was an example of how  ccp is at changing that kind of stuff lets not invite them to screw it up further
of all the module name changes this one makes sense
i completely agree
yes agreed never understood why they went with artillery on autocannons
ship prices have already risen significantly and dramatically
yeah lets trash the economy cause huge inflation all so the four players who mine without bots gain 30 more isk per hour brilliant idea you should enter politics
so let me just clarify this you are advocating that the drone regions still drop drone minerals for refining that seriously deflate the prices of minerals to make mining unprofitable for the people that actually enjoy doing thatjust to break it down to its nuts and bolts you are happy that a few alliances in the drone regions have a virtual monopoly on mineral pricesbrilliant idea you should enter politics
dont get me wrong id prefer that drone regions never had mineral poo in the first place however it is too late now removing such a major source of minerals will cause the price of minerals to increase dramatically thus increasing the prices of ships and mods to increase dramatically  yay inflation unless ccp watch the prices of everything and raise the bountymission rewards etc to match this inflation on a weekly basis this move will screw over actual players in favour of mining bot owners and lets face it who is more valuable to the game  someone who farms drone poo by day warring by night or a bot
i can see your point but i think ccp are and should continue to slam the banhammer down on botssure for the short term shipmod prices will increase but once miners actually start to see profit for mining it will settle down before longhopefully
if this was combined with a boost to mining yield  or perhaps a reduction in the number of units of ore required for one reprocessing cycle or increasing the mineral output of a reprocessing cycle or something else to increase the mineral output of miners and another crackdown on botters then that might be enough compensation to lower the damaging effects of removing mineral poo from drones but simply removing mineral drops from drones as a single change will have more negative than positive effects in my opinionif ccp could give us concrete data on the origin of all minerals then it would help clarify this issue  it could be that mining accounts for a tiny fraction of the actual mineral output it could be that drone poo provides a tiny proportion we just dont know most reasoned guesses put mining at about 40 ish with drone poo at 30 ish and misc sources such as mod drops at 20 and those are very rough figures p
i know your trying to sound funny but there are alot of people that mine as a main source of income and alot of people that have the ability to but have moved on with higher mineral payouts will come more minersalso yeah a boost to yeild or reprocessing could help solve the drone region problem you stated
if they remove drone alloy drops i dont think this will be needed this would also likely need to be done by nerfing refining which i dont think anyone wants
then why did they change them in the first placethe old names were effective and people are used to them there is really no reason to change the names and do you really think a newb uses the market search feature to find missiles more than likely they will look in the browse feature to find missiles and just find the properly colored one
lol yes cloak seeking fof missiles ftw i can see the tears starting to form alreadyjust out of curiosity why the heck would you want to use fof missiles in missions in the first place they do quite a bit less damage that standard missiles and you never get jammed that often in missions for them to be worthwhilefor pvp on the other hand they are perfectly fine at what they do not the first time ive kicked the crap out of someones destroyer on a drag bubble with their cloaky falcon alt hovering nearby to facilitate risk free pvpnot so risk free when there are fofs buzzing around
this is very confusing and should be clarifiedthis page has a link called reporting scams and exploits when you click on the link you get the following instructionsif you notice someone using scams exploits or cheats within the game please file a petition to let us know however in the first link there is also a link titled scams and exploits which readsso why advise players to report scams via petition if there is nothing the support team can do for you yes we all know scams are allowed in eve as advised by the scams linkunless youre new the reference to scams should be removed from the links page first reference as well as the second link advising people petition scamsalso the wording in the page on scams and exploits is very confusing because it seems to use the word scam and exploit interchangeably instead of making a clear differentiation in some parts for example using how can i fight those who exploit me as a title for how to report exploits and then giving tips for avoiding scams in the same paragraph keeps the line blurred for new players while youre at it a list of all of the scam rules in the eula would be helpful instead of just relying on word of mouth or scattered infoposts to keep people from doing things like running gtc scams plex for good scams recruitment channel scams impersonation scams loan scams character exchange scams etc
the difference is ingame scams are perfectly fine out of game scams arentif you are scammed by for example clicking on a link that takes you to a webpage that steals your login details and all your isk then thats a scam you should reportbuying a used titan from a 3 day old goon for 10bil and never actually getting the titan is perfectly legal and shouldnt be reported you can however emoragepost on here so we can all get a good laugh it could do with a clearer definition on that page though but not sure how they could without literally posting a list of reportable scamsguess ccp just want people to use their judgementlol
not true scamming someone in the ingame recruitment channel is not allowed running a scam pretending to be ccp ingame is not allowed loan scams ingame are not allowed etc not to mention your point is completely invalidated by the language used if you notice someone using scams exploits or cheats within the game please file a petition to let us know there are only a few exceptions to the rule that ingame scams are allowed why not literally post them in one placein the link about scams perhaps theres room for 20 tips on avoiding scams but not enough for the 5 or so scams that are prohibited
sigh
i think youre confusing judgment with experienceknowledge how would a new player who has heard all about how its okay to scam on eve know about the exceptions you take for granted the things youve heard about the subject scattered over the time you have been playing
iirc the only ingame scamming that isnt allowed is scamming in the recruitment channel or the rookie systems claiming to be from ccp isnt a scam its impersonation of an employee which is a far different level of offense than scamming and theres no rule against scamming in a loan if someone lends you isk and you refuse to pay it back thats perfectly valid other than those two channels where youre not allowed to scam pretty much anything ingame goes as long as its using valid game mechanics not exploits
same way everyone else learned ask people in the help channel local corp alliance forums voices in your head etc etc etcand no i am not confusing judgement with experience judgement is something we all have even new players if you are in any doubt petition it simple as that
this just goes to prove my point loan scams were iirc deemed out of bounds by ccp back when there were loan contracts they were so confusing that ccp eventually ended up removing the mechanic entirely but the rule against loan scams is still floating around and quoted by people replying to questions about which scams are okay and which are not why not consolidate them
because people in the help channel alliance corp and local are so reliable reallyalso the whole point of the suggestion is to reduce the number of unnecessary petitions to ccp this would speed up the replies to valid petitions which is a good thing right i really dont understand the resistance to simply posting an official list of scams that are not allowed and then letting people use their common sense or the petition system to apply the rules
if you cant see why giving people in eve of all games information on how to scam then quite frankly theres little hope for you
ah so we have finally arrived at the heart of your true objections you want to see security by obscurity enforced when it comes to scamming and you object to clarifying the rules because you want new players who try to scam to get banned over the confusion caused welpi hate to break it to you but everyone already knows scamming is allowed on eve frankly if you ask any gamer who doesnt play eve if theyre heard of eve and they have they usually reply with something like oh yeah thats the game where you can scam other players the reason is all of the publicity the big scams get outside of eve its unfair to glamorize the fact that scams are legal on eve and then keep the rules about scamming so murky that a new player has a good chance of getting banned for violating a rule that is buried in a dev blog somewhere years ago i find your attitude of secretly hoping new players get banned for wanting to try something eve is famous for revolting i also find your lack of knowledge expressed in your very first reply sentence about how all ingame scams are allowed telling as to your knowledge of this subject and what you have to offer in this thread its just not trueprovably not true go troll elsewhereps my blog has a nice little guide on running some common eve scams it should be far more helpful than a list of the 5 or so scams not allowed and its in my sig so as you can see you and i have very differing opinions on the subject of providing info on how to scam to new players
loan scams arent offlimits anymore though loan contracts dont exist anymore therefore nothing relating to them can exist either as i said iirc the only scams that are existing in the game that are actually scams which are offlimits are scamming in a couple very specific channels and iirc the recruitment channel has a motd that scamming is prohibited and the rookie systems have longstanding rules against scamming or griefing noobs
you know if the last suggestion in my post was implemented you wouldnt have to keep qualifying everything you post with iirc hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmalso not only have you not addressed the primary subject of the topic but you have so far failed to make your point about why a list of disallowed scams in ccps page on the subject is a bad idea new players are far more likely to hear that scams are legal in eve than they are to hear longstanding rules that arent stated in the eula these new players are dropped into  where else noob systems so where are they more than likely to try their first scamagain why not just post the rules on scams on the page about scams
lol contradict muchwhich is it everyone already knows about scams or they donti get the strangest feeling that were talking at crossed purposes here i couldnt care less about in game scams post them all day every day in here or anywhere else for that matter these scams dont matter and ccp isnt interested in themi was referring to the nefarious scams that actually cost people their accounts and real money you know the really bad scams the ones that you really dont want to broadcast so as not to entice more people to try them after all if they dont know about them how can they accidently get banned you dont accidently steal someones account you are just being pedantic nowi didnt say all in game scams were allowed what i said was but thats not what this post was about it was a proposal to clarify which scams are legal and which arent i stand by my earlier postuse your judgement all intelligent people have this
sir i believe by your own standards you are disqualified
this is irrelevant everyone knows there are no more new players in eve only more alts that get created
i say iirc because im working off of my memory which isnt always perfect since i dont scam i could go look up the exact info for sure but it isnt worth the time to me id rather just use the disclaimer of iirc id say the exact same thing even if ccp did have a site to look up scamsand the recruitment channel has a warning in the motd warning against scamming last i checked atleast and a firsttimeoffender noob scamming in a noob system because he didnt know better wont get punished hell get a warning against doing it again and hell either learn from that and not scam there again or get punished for it if he knowingly continues and i didnt say im opposed to posting the rules about scamming anywhere but since its just one line no scamming in recruitment or the rookie systems theres not much point in it besides the fact that having a list of forbidden scams opens ccp up to people doing something thats not covered and then the player saying but you didnt specifically tell me i couldnt do that as an excuse the current system puts the burden on the players to follow the spirit of the rule rather thatn putting the burden on ccp to cover any possible loophole there might be
and the first person to resort to insults has already lost their argumentwelcome to eve enjoy your stay
and mxzf wins another thread congratulations sir basically this
i fail to understand why nobody has suggested that people who get the beacon and can warp to it arent 5s or 10s in corporationalliancepersonal standings list rather than anyone else
well as this idea is mainly for hi sec people it would be a nightmare setting everyone blue in local that says they may help by the time you did that theyd be dead anywayand eve pilots being the devious little souls that they are whats to stop someone saying they will help to be set 5 etc only for them to gank you anywaystandings are an indicator of intent not a guarantee of intent blues will nuke you for lulz if they want to
well the naming convention we currently have seems just finedont see the point of a pointless name change for the sake of itand just for your information gunboats would be most closely associated with cruiser size ships and not battlecruiser size so you would actually be renaming the wrong ship class anyway and causing more confusion
if someone cannot tell the difference between a cruiser a battlecruiser and a battleship then eve is the wrong game also they should not be allowed to vote or breed
this is crossposting from the ship  modules forum about the titan nerf and ccp doesnt like thatnot like pl would bend the rulesmechanics to suit themselves
it doesnt make the slightest sense no matter how you look at it because limiting the amount of titans in a fleet or in a system will still result in an ultimatum its either you get as much titans into the system first or create multiple fleets you can also decide to engage with 300 alpha maelsget owned then proceed to whine on you tube
drones themselves and the ui do need some attention from ccp1
i dontwhatok not sure what you are asking for here and seriously people fly the typhoon wow
actually you are really wrong if you know what it feels like to wait for weeks before receiving your isk back or even getting a reply then you wont post that comment that sounds like its coming from an ignorant individual or someone involved in the same dubious acta contract like system will narrow character transfer issues or scams to only hacked accounts the way it works is simple and sound if you can afford it then pay up but if you cant then move on anyone that doesnt get his character sold can adjust the price as needed the current mechanism makes it too easy to scam and put unnecessary work load on the gms this is time that can be used to address problems of new players that ccp is trying so hard retain and please all of these can be easily avoided a wise man once said if ignorance is bliss why arent there more happy people
wellthey used to have etc selling through the account management page where you assign the etc to someone and price you are asking for iti just wonder why other than the possibility to scam isk from the current method is considered business as usual this method was not adopted to the character transfers if you are auctioning your character on forums and then when the auction is over youd then simply assign that charactertobesold to a character i buy toons and stuff with the amount of isk agreed  and when the buyer accepts the character the character transfer fee is deducted from the sellers account and the isk is transfered or possibility to purchase character transfer tokens in advanceif the seller do not have credits at the time when the transaction would take place it would just notify the buyer that the transaction could not be made and inform the seller by email dude wheres your credit so the seller could then make approriate actionshowever all things must evolve or die away this whole thing could be taken to another level and implement the real character bazaarseller would put character up on auction with options auction time min bid reserve buyoutoptionally some sort of short sales speech field allowed as wellcharacters with negative wallet and other invalid data could not be put up on salethen normal auction controls for buyers bid x needs to be higher than min bid apparently  buyoutbidding would then reserve the isk bidded on the character till higher bid or buyout has been madethe auction would then provide information about the character in example skill list and queue corp history security status forum post count link to posts etc what is considered relevant optionally there could be search filtering when listing characters on the bazaar based on skills etcjust my few cents  love it or keep on hating j
as much as the transfer mechanics leave a lot to be desired you really have to ask yourself just how much of a problem is the current systemif it was affecting a large portion of the eve population then i would agree that it would need fixinghowever i suspect that this will only ever affect a very small minority of people that trade characters for whatever reasoni dont think it would be worthwhile for ccp to devote time and resources to thismy own personal opinion on this is that transferring or selling characters should never have been allowed in the first place because it is very open to abusecaveat emptor as they say

i like all these suggestions apart from the removal of ecm drones and removing login contact list
nearly all of these proposals have been brought up beforesome i like and mentioned as such in their respective threadsothers i didnt and again mentioned why i disagreed with the proposal in the respective threadyou can do a search and see what i put for each if you are bored and have nothing to drop your titan on at the moment
it is killing solo when you are flying with a booster alt in your fleet you are not solo there are a few places i dont eve try to get any fights anymore because there will be super charged hookbill orbitting me at 30k sensor damping me so i cant even lock it even though i am in a cruiser its ridiculous enough to make fine with not signing in there is no decent way for a solo pilot to combat that btw i am finding allot of great solo fights in faction war doing plexes once you learn how to avoid those with the booster alts you may want to give it a trythat said if they want to give crews that give the same exact bonuses as a maxed out booster alts but would be destroyed like other mods i wouldnt mind it would be a way that people who dont like flying with alts can still be competitive solo and wouldnt nerf the booster alts the booster alts would be the cheaper option in the long run make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
its not just solo that its killing its also harmful to new players and corps starting out in pvp because were in danger of getting into a position where people believe that they need a booster pilot to be able to compete the above reference to solo pilots needing a booster alt is evidence of that at which point theres a great danger of new players thinking this is stupid and of going back to pveing or logging offnow sure this is really a problem with warfare links in general rather than offgrid alts but ongrid boosters are more visible so easier to scout more vulnerable and are trickier to manage as an alt

we can continue to speak out against offgrid boosters ship  boosting alt is not solo
mothly bump
only if i can limit the range of the bookmarks shown i might want to see the ongrid bookmarks for the gate im fighting on but the dozen tactical bookmarks i made for the enemy pos on the other side of the system are just going to make a mess of thingsedit a month without a response and you think this thread was worth a bump sigh
qft the devs need to concentrate on finding ways to expand the sandbox to keep the curious and new players dont fly what you cant afford to lose isnt a very good recruiting mantra fostering the attitude of mocking other groups of players makes this mmo seem to be the haven of cyber bullies and douchebags
funny when i tell people they have to read through 191 pages of website before they can effectively start the game they fire up some lol or bf3much as eve has always been a go to wwwevecraplearningsitecom and figure it out game that doesnt actually keep people playing for more than the 15 minutes it takes them to read about tracking formulas and say ill play swtor for my spaceship fix because eve is complicated and the npe doesnt prepare you for thisyoure not gonna learn from 200 webpages worth of info you are gonna learn from experience and guidance give vet corps a reason to recruit newbs and train them and you will see an increase in player retention telling people here is the website have fun reading dry technical data for the next day is gonna make them rethink being your friend
why do botters only get a short ban of a week or two when they get caught bottingthis is basicly saying to people yea go bot but stop when ya get caughtpeople caught botting shouldnt be allowed to keep there characters simple
because the stats show that people dont offend againi think i read in one of the dev blogs that roughly 90 dont reoffend and then for those who do reoffend and are caught only like 1 of those reoffend and are then banned permanentlyin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
so ccp are saying that its ok to use a bot till you get caught
you may want to think about things before you voice themthats like saying your going to get concorded before you suicide gank where your going with your faulty logic stop the evemail spam
what im saying is if you only get a short ban for using a bot wheres the real riskthere should be no second chance if you are caught using a bot even onceevery man and his dog seams to have a bot for making isk meaning inflation on prices of almost every thing in game because of all the extra isk created from bountysif you get caught using a bot you should lose the account and all linked accounts if theres more risk of using a bot less people will use one at the moment the only risk when you get caught is a short ban
ok so what your saying is everyone here botsand because you think thatall should be banned on first offensewho died and made you judge againmaybe you should take the time to think before you voice your opinionsjust because you think they are a bot doesnt mean they areyou can come up with any number of conceptsproofsideas but when it comes right down to itccp will be the one to make that choicenow you can  about itor go shoot themand if you actually read the statements givenit is not a slap on the wrist you think it is try reading the whole message eh stop the evemail spam
and that is where ccp comes in place our job is to provide insight and ideasi like the feeling of it
they actualy work quite wellthe problem is it doesnt realy show in the eft and that offencive missile launcher does the trick is not to fit them on missile ships you should use them on the gun ships allong with some fofs and it can be quite a defencive system
dont forget renaming the pulse beams too such a heavy or mega modulated pulse energy beamor the small laser turret names what is called medium guns medium pulse laser
shield transfers use about 15  20  more cap per cycle compared to their armor counterparts that are in most cases mounted on ships with way better cap stability compared to their shield mates fix this then chimeras used in shield fleets wont run out cap 30 secs into a fight
counterpoint shield reps land at the beginning of the cycle allowing you to do a massive frontload on reps this mixed with shieldfleets being far more nimble than armor makes up for the slightly better cap and lower sigs with armorthese things are clearly not meant to be equal
i like how you troll the op for his ideas by picking on the weakest of them come up with no reasonable argument of your own manage to provoke the op into insulting you and finally when someone else makes a valid point immediately hide behind that excellent trollagethat said mxzf has a good point which addresses a flaw in the last of the ops suggestionsyargle

thisdust is comingtheres your fpsas for evetheres too much  to fix from the last 2 major patches that are having alot of people upinarmswis is a joke at that ratewe dont need a large lumbering piece of programming to make it worse right nowi wish an entire patch would be dedicated to polishing the game offnot adding more content to an already messed up gamedont get me wrongi like new stuffbut what good is new stuff if your game is fubard stop the evemailUFFFDspam
actually this exists in eve its called joining a corporation teaming up with an experienced fc and learning the ropes no minigame necessary all required code is already written stop trying to learn the game without having to actually play the game and take a risk or two
hold your horses program development is an iterative process
im afraid thats not very likely to happen ccp has never given anything back when they nerfed and they shouldnt start now just because titans are involved i remember spending billions of isk on a super sexy nano machariel training all lvl 5 navigation skills etc just so i could be the coolest and fastest nano pilot out there then cameth the nanonerf and suddenly my expensive ship modules and highgrade snake set were worth one tenth of their previous value its the cost we pay for humping the bandwagonso take your nerf just like everybody else adapt to the new situation and add a 1 to your bittervet statusyargle

heres a thought if you dont want em dont make em sort of an alliance peace treaty for all null sec alliances as an extra bonus ccp would be astounded if you cant do this then how can you justify deleting themjust cos people can make mustard gas doesnt mean they all use it
what do you guys think of a news feed in game that relays news like the ones you see in news channels not just because it looks cool but the biggest events that happen in and out of the game can be put in a small bar that you can open and close at the bottom of your screen most of the time i dont know about the biggest things that happens in the game i am aware of the side bar on the first page when you log in but i believe a news bar at the bottom would deliver news more effective to send information any thoughts
that can be explained by whatever scifi babble ccp cares to say in order to protect the delicate core processor of a drone it does all its data crunching and processing via a link to your ships central computer blak blah blahwhen it comes down to it there needs to be something that allows a balancing of what drones a specific ship can fly and for that we have drone bay size and bandwidthi would also like to add my support for the drone ui to be improvedjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
not sure about the actual proposal made in this thread dont use drones as much as i should but some sort of love must be given to that quirky little window all i think is the actual window ui itself needs a full makeover i can never seem to find window space for the damn thingoverall 1 for bringing this upand i hope those more experienced than me can debate the details into workable improvements soon

while i have only been playing eve for under 3 months now i have grown to love iti recently decided to restart my pi to do this i set up in a 2 space got it going and bought a primae after all it was created for pi was it notso i look at it no high power slots for a cloak no rigs to increase the hold even though there is space for pi commodities along with a hold for your command centers and no mid slotsam not asking for the ship to be over hauled into a massive cargo freighter am simply asking that this ship that in my eyes is unable to do its intended job be modified to were it can meet what we the players that engage in pi need
use a blockade runner you dont need to use a primae for pi
yes it is not need but it was created for it
no primae was created as a gimmick a free handout that everyone who claimed one got  this was almost two years ago i know it says it is designed for pi but thats a lie it was ccp going lol have free ship so you dont hate us for releasing a pointless expansion
im sorryim all in favor of traditional intended use of ship but lets be honest herethe primae is a piece of the noctis is its better brother and meant for salvageif i was going to do piid do it in a blockade runnernot only is it cheaperbut a hell of alot more safer with cov ops cloak abilitiyits common sense stop the evemail spam
i put them on my prowlers they do need some love though thats for surewhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
i agree that they should target shipstructure signiatures only and i have a feeling that the cluster effect on grouped missiles is something thats going to change with the new launchers anyway explosions also could use some love torpedoes are especially wonkythe rest of this is not so good friend or foe means that they do not discriminate between reds blues greens purples concord women children or pets if its a valid signiature itll track it down and hit itwhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
my experience with shield and armor fleets has made it more than obvious that armor ships have enough buffer which allows for enough time to react i see where you are coming from but literally my point is that remote armor reps consume less cap per cycle and the ships they are fitted on generally possess better cap stability before considering the effect of modsif anything change should be made at all it should be to capital shield transporters its fairly reasonable if the lower variants are left as they are atm
while im okay with the differences between armor and shield remote reps i know for sure that armor rr battleships do exist but i have yet to see shield rr battleships
rrbs is really a dead doctrine it was killed by logistics buffs
shield rrbs was always a bit silly because of crazy cpu use of shield transporters then logisticscapital shield rr suffered from the same problem too recently ccp cut the cpu of cap shield transporters which helped the chimera but you still cant get a sensible triage shield nidhoggur without a lot of fancy mods or a copro i suppose but the lowslots are really needed for cprs although this might be more of a problem with the cpu of the capital shield booster
there are jump freigters that cost 56 b isk that can fly in highsec jump to a cyno in low or nullsec and carries vast amounts of cargo there are rorquals that can be used as a transport of kind in low and nullsec they cost 225 bso they are expensive but fills a need for logistics of large cargos for large corps and alliances that also have the isk to buy them and to skill for themfor small but still adventouros corps with few members that likes to produce stuff mainly in lowsec there is a need for a smaller jumpcapable and affordable ship that still could carry more than a blockade runner but less than a jump freighter to keep up the logistics of fuel and material for production based on moon mining and still have time over for activities irl this would fill a need in eve this would enable entrepreneurs to move to lowsec compete with t2products on equal terms as the larger nulllowsec alliances etcin short they would work just as jump freighters but be smaller and less expensive the target customer group would be small corps for smallscale jump transports to and from lowsecnullsec and highsec lets say price around 600900 m cargo capacity as a iteron iv jump capable t2 with maybe only 2 rig slots possible to fly in highsec no cloaksa suitable name could be jump haulers perhapsccp and eve community  any thoughts around this

i agree with drake  there are plenty of logistics options already it sounds like you just want to make it easier if youre really producing enough to need a jf then you should be able to afford one pretty soon if not it just sounds like you want safety without having to pay the price of a jf which is a personal issue that doesnt need a game mechanic change

you are of course entitled to your opinion but you are mistaken as whining is not the reason for this proposalthe reason is as followimagine corps whose goal would be to fight piracy and not commit piracy and agression themselves corp that would be willing to police the areas that concord does not touch low sec especially in the current state of the game very few corps would do that successfully because there is no way they can scan and jump to the location of a fight if they would be willing to help defend a victim they do not know in timeby deciding to emit a mayday call that can only be visible to nonpirates and agressors at the time of the mayday there would be a mechanic for groups of vigilants to help out carebears these corps could establish patrols to help around limiting the feature because of sec gives a reasonable hope to the person emitting the mayday that they will not just add insult to injury sure newcomers could decide to jump in and take the ss hit but knowing that at the time of pushing the mayday button the ss status of responders would not be set that way is a psychological factor that is not negligeableright now this is mostly impossible to try to help a victim without already be in corpfleet because the time of a fight otside of major engagements usually does not allow scanning and jumping to the location hence the idea of the mayday beacon to help in that aspectof course i am totally seeing why piratesagressors would not like this idea and this is fine as i said everyone is entitled to their opinionas a late thought on this a mayday would only be usable in deep space ie not on grid of a station or a gate as options already exists in these areas for the victims and the locations are already easier to jump to anyway
in fairness i only troll crap ideas if an idea is actually decent i leave it alone or contribute constructively trolls should be allowed to tell moronic idea men they are morons
player elected moderators would just lead to more trolls and propaganda flag wavers telling us what we can and can not discuss the people who immediately flame anything that doesnt promote blowing up your ship and killing you speak the loudest and most often regrettably the greater masses of players want to quietly play the game they dont want to have to jump up and down flaming everything they dont agree with

there is already an rts game that was planned for wis it never saw the light of day thanks to whiny little bitches that shoot at statuesi am sure it will be in the game when they finish wis
bump
great idea lets see it sooner be the biggest help to bombers in the history of eve
train racial industrial level i and put your primae away
make it more useful for its intended role than any other ship that isnt intended to be used for pi please thankswhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
knowing that 100 innocent people get banned all the time making permanent bans would be kind of risky dont you agreelets be happy that if you get banned for no reason at all you are not permabanned
i never got banned when i was mining solid for my first month of the game and i cant tell you how many hours of youtube i watched while watching my ship on the other half of the screen eat scordite over and overwhats the general detection time on the mining bots hours days weeks sure if it was hours up to a couple days give them warningstemp bans but if its weeks do you really want to allow a bot to farm for months befores its finally taken from the game if the detection time is long then there needs to be something in place to heavily discourage bots but also a solid and effective appeals system so any legit player accidentally slugged has a fair chance to get thier account back within a day or 2  tops
1 replaces microwarp drivesafterburners get loved again 2 do you really want thisactually im not so sure general understanding and appreciation threadsuggestiveshow exactly could it workthey could work to simply jump to adjacent solarsystems only avoiding stargate campersmay be a module using charges similar to capacitor boosters limited use until station refillmay be a module using charges similar to capacitor boosters limited use until cargo refilland could this completely replace stargatesno stargates would be the interstellar minicynosural beacon of which jumping may have always lockedonno stargates support those without microjump drive fittingits function could be applied to microwarp drivesoverhauling modules in the future you said have the current idea of microjump drives function applied to current microwarp drives and then introduce microjump drives as a completely new thingbring afterburners back who could it be fortactical advantage for attackcombat shiplinenew tactical advantage for interceptor and clandestine specializationssecurity advantage for small  medium industrial shipline
no or only for blackops battleship that would be kinda cool
read the db dump its spools up and makes you jump a fixed distance forward
i dislike the fact that another module is required to do similar to ordinary jumpingid rather the current jump systems be altered to support shortdistance solarsystem microjumps like this as well as world map jumps because why the hell not why add more stuff all the freaking time god damn
im waiting for the days when cap pilots demand this be nerfed and the sub cap community goes ape with outrage
long ramp up time at end ship is jumped instantly 100 km directly forward ship maintains direction and velocity ship is affected by warp scramblers and warp disruption fieldsthisthis module will not allow you to jump to other systems or even off of grid for that matter i think this is one of the things they are trying out to attempt to fix the problems with blasters
i think it also might be to help with sniper fleets enemy scout warps to you everyone warp 100km away again
i would be so down for this change from what i know incursion fits look a lot like pvp fits just without points because its lame pve so it wouldnt even be that unfair i also cant honestly think of a reason to not do this chagealso it would give me even more incentive to fly my shiny sansha shipsbut could you only join one faction what if i want to join amarr fw and sansha fw seems illogical but i want all the pewpew i can get
this would make sense make incursions happen in lowsec lets face it if you want some sensible storuline concord would dive in and wtfpwn every incursion in hisec
actually its the normal missiles that will hit anything you shoot them at the friend or foe missiles are called fof missiles because they have the capability to determine if a target is friend or foe and make a targeting decision based on that determination
tldr making newer players overdependant on specialization is badccp on the whole has been doing rather well as of late however one of the biggest issues i have is the repeated statements regarding specialising in a particular ship and the new set of ship specializations feed into thishowever i think this is the wrong way to go for the starter elements of the game such as battlecruisersmy concern is that as a new player i most certainly did not know what i wanted to do in game i trained mining missiles some guns eventually found learning skills my skill queue was all over the place and i was not terribly effective at anything but i could do a little bit of everything and i did so because i wanted to explore multiple parts of the gamei fear that by pidgeonholing new players by forcing them down specialization routes to do anything at all that we would be short changing them of a lot of the variation that is to be had to compare it to a typical education the first things a person is taught are general fundamental skills reading writing numeracy when a child first enters school it is not decided that they will be for example a classical novelist and as such will not be taught numeracy and would have 30 hours a week of reading and writing instead it would obviously be very silly to do so the person has no idea what theyre going to do in life and those that do want to be astronauts or ballerinas which is unrealistic the specialization comes later much much later after the person has had chance to learn what they want to dotherefore i propose that the csm resists overspecialization of ships and training paths and ensures that its possible to enjoy the game without being a one trick ponyas a side note i personally love the idea of having a few more generic skills such as battlecruisers and destroyers they provide you with a tool kit which lets you be adaptive and when youre playing for fun surely thats much more important than having to sit out because your particular specialization isnt in need
you arent forced to specialize you never were and these changes wont really change it the only difference is that youll need to specifically train levels in bc and destroyer there were always requirements of racial cruiserfrig the racial weapons and the racial tank the levels of bc and destroyers have always been relatively minor in comparison to the total amount of training time it takes to actually become effective at flying the ship
pointless thread is pointlessas this isnt an actual proposal as nothing is being directly proposed can we have this closed to reduce the spam
overpowered logistics made rr bs and to some extent even carriers useless
too many jump drive ships already
i think it should not be allowable to scam people for their csm votesps
i like this 1
someone dig eyes out of my facegive back the old module names
ill keep it short id like an option to log out to my character selection screen and select an alt to log in with
i really like your ideas but instead of making a new ship class for smuggling that would obviously stand out to the cops why not let the pirate factions produce custom versions of the four races haulers specially modified to look like normal iteron sigil wreathe etc but actually fitted out with a bonus to concealment and extra agility or a covops cloak or warp stab bonus so the cops cant scram youthey could only be produced in low sec for example and the bpcs could be iliigal in high sec and obviously the bpcs could be offered through the pirates lp stores and drop from their complexesyoure cloaked can idea is pretty cool it would be nice if you could set them up as dropboxes for illigal goods and that would be one way to sell boosters etc on the open market in high sec hell it would be nice if you could have pos modules that conceal that you have drug labs in high sec as well but the smuggling variants of the haulers would help you at least get the goods into highsec easier
thanks for the feedback keep the recommendations and suggestions coming
something to keep in mind and this is what i hope my ccp crystal ball is right about  the new crimwatch 20 and the suspect flag when jumping through a gate it will be a very simple matter to flag the player as suspect if and when they are carrying contraband they then have to run like hell to the next gate dock or play dodge the probesthere may be some restrictions on cloaking and things of that nature how all that pans out who knows skills modules faction standings etc may and could be used as modifiers in all of thiswhat i hope is customs agents go away for the most part and the enforcement of contraband is put into the hands of the players this will create an entire new set of career options from faction white knight  gate camp gank for suspect flags and the assortment of pick up my contract full of contraband margin trade scamsnecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
bump and 1ive long supported the idea of a contract system for bounty hunters putting the burden of preventing exploitation on the player just like the market and trade contracts do good to see it supported by csm and combined with the asset destruction suggestion as well the two ideas work well together
shamelessly putting here my previously ignored proposal my take on bounty hunting with a cool name for iteve retaliationproposal 1 transferable kill rights sbdy shot you down you can transfer the kill rights to sbdy else to take care of the agressor for a pricethe kill rights can be transfered to as many undertakers as you want but bounty hunters taking them cant transfer them again why unlimited transfers to prevent the agressors from stealing the rights from the victim with a bounty hunter altproposal 2 the price of destruction bounties are claimed by destroying the agressors stuff not necessarily killing himup to twice the inflicted loss the reward is half the cost of the destroyed stuff practical case they blow your hulk you lose 300 million so you pay 300 million for sbdy to destroy 600 million worth of agressors stuff payment is due upon the destruction of stuff no kill no gainproposal 3 it sucks to be friends hirers can extend kill rights to any other target being hunted and who belongs to the targets corporationpractical case captain scum got a bounty on his head and is in the same corporation as vicious ganker who also got a bounty on his head by getting a kill right on captain scum miner malone can also ask the bounty hunters to target vicious ganker even if vicious ganker never did anything to miner malone the kill rights stand even if vicious ganker leaves the corporationproposal 4 you will never be alone bounty hunters on duty can track their targets via two new skills skill one network interaction allows access to the records of gates and stations so whenever a target jumps or docks the bounty hunter can read a track record about it the distance and time span of track records varies with skill up to a whole factions space and the last 5 dayspractical case with network interaction v a bounty hunter can read the records of every jump and dock carried out by captain scum in say minmatarr space for the last 5 daysthe access would have a concord fee so any hirer should pay some expenses to the bounty hunterskill two navsat interaction allows access to the local satellite network so whenever the prey shows in a local chat if even for 05 seconds while leaving a station the bounty hunter knows his exact location in order to do so the bounty hunter must deploy combat probes which will interact wiht navsats and tell where exactly was seen the target practical case captain scum is in a safe spot in a lowsec sytem accidentally trips off his cloak and then recloaks five days later a bounty hunter interacts with the navsats and learns of the last known location of captain scum bounty hunter jumps in and hes afk cloaked gbye captain scumthis skill is so powerful that it must be expensive say 30 days to level 5 of course bounty hunters only can track targets upon which they got a kill right from a hirersummary unlimitedly transferable kill rights if a hirer is fillthy rich and can throw 20 hunters on the agressor let the agressor have it picking filthy rich tradersindustrialists sucks pay for destroying the targets stuff not merely kill him once no longer selfkilling for the bounty unless youre up to losing twice the reward any other target in the targets corporation can be punished too if you gang together against bounty hunters bounty hunters can gang together against you bounty hunters can track the last moves of the target via stargates and stations it sucks to be hunted bounty hunters can pinpoint the last moves of the target via the targets appearences in local chat it sucks a lot to be hunted
looks like a relatively simple change that does make sense i have my evemail as open as im usually in lowseci have seen those spam evemails and they are annoying an option like you said to have more settings on it would be great
dude set you cspa charge at 1 million i never get spam mail unless i set the charge lower for ppl to contact me thats not in my corpallianceif your getting that much spam mail its your own fault plain and simpledid you try adding the spammers to block list not sure if that will work but worth a trytroll skill lv3 v
if anything is op its the damn dreads pushing out way more dps than any super atm whilst still having a good tank being relatively cheap and easier to produce nowadays it makes more sense to engage in a lot of dreads instead of a few titans and still come out ahead in terms of isk efficiency and general effectivenesstheres no need for the titan if itll be limited to a certain role especially when you consider all the effort put into getting and maintaining one i think all capital and supercapital production should be done in a capital assembly array itll even out the availability of capitals as a wholeps nerf titan turret tracking and increase dps dreads pushing out more dps than titans is unacceptable
if you use the primae in hi sec its fantasticif you are in low or null then blockade runners are a must for pi
i just got done listening to the war dec presentation and i have a couple ideas to make it more hardcore and possibleplease raise the taxes on npc corps on this launch to make more fights possible or make some players  i realize not all pay more to avoid them i believe a review of how a person can stay in a npc corp and avoid war decs forever should be doneplease put a cap on the number of characters you can have in a player corp or review the scaling of prices the scaling of prices for war decs will make it almost impossible to do so vs the big blocks in 00 the way i understood it i realize many of the people running logistics for 00 entities already use npc corps to avoid war decs but that is another reason to why i ask for npc corps to be looked at more
imitationplease break the war dec mechanic even more so for what i feel we should force people to doplease force all players to be involved in war dec stop the evemail spam
empire should be safe unless it is greifing sanctioned by concordwardecks should not be constant greifing for people who have no interest in it if limits to how long you could bribe concord exist and actual prohibitive costs to declaring it people wouldnt go the mile to pay 10 taxes in npc corpsmake not being in a npc corp suck less to draw them away from it
when i did hear right the proposal was the bigger the opponent the more you payi dont think this is the right way it should be calculated by the member difference between the corpsalliancesfor a big corpalliance it should be more expensive to declare war to a far smaller corpalliance than to a similar in size
i did not say force people into war decs i think we should have to pay to avoid them though and not just use a npc alt i am posting this from that kind of alt 
so this is primarily a bump post but i still argue that a cruise naga would be great and to be honest over half of these arguments are lacking any reasoning behind them its all ppl saying missiles suck and thats it come on ppl come up with some real content be it you hate missiles or not and caldari are missile based 
no it would be as bad as your post
exactly that
i dont have free medium slot for this p
actually i think this makes things worse for snipers people can already warpto at 100kmccp if you decide to make this a module can you also completely get rid of ongrid jumping or at least make it 250km for regular warp
actually from what ive heard they are removing the mwd and replacing it with this
ok so at fanfest they proposed having an additional 500k isk added for every player in whatever organization your are wardecking i think this makes large alliances far too safei say instead of having a linear increase in the price based on members make it a logarithmic curve instead
it made sense until i read it again theres no way ccp is going to implement a mechanic where a highsec system suddenly acquires lownullsec system characteristics there are more than enough lownullsec systems that way  so simply use the currently available wardec system if you must fight in highsec suicide ganking is also another option besides the social benefits of incursions over weighs any other reason for a possible pvp environment to be considered especially in highsec imo
i think incursions should both drop sec status and be subject to faction war type mechanics of concord aligned vs sansha aligned players however an easier approach from ccps perspective might be just to restrict incursion participation to those in player corpsalliances and with the new wardec system allow players and the sandbox to sort out the rest on their own
associations a stepping stone to corporations or squads for everyonewhat i propose is to formalise and extent support to something that basically already exists in a variety of forms in eve onlineover the years various like minded players have created chat channels to socialise in but unless you know they exist you can only find them by accident you can drop named cans outside popular stations or link in your character bio and spam local but these are very limited forms of advertisementnow a corporation can be advertised but possesses a great deal of functionality that is unneccessary and frankly bewildering to the unintiaited for new players especially all thats needed are the social functions that a corporation has access toso i propose a minminalised form of corporation that possesses no physical assets thats streamlined for easy of use and setup and can be advertised in game with all the necessary tags that can be searched and sorted for essentially a purely social form of corporation which we could call associations or whatever else you happen to preferaddtionally at the end of the new player career tutorials stick a new tutorial that shows a new player how to find or create an associationimportantly an association is just a glorified chat channel with a few extras such as fleet finder and calendar and recruitment advertising it doesnt preclude you being in a corporation as well or being in multiple associations so it cant be wardeced it cant setup a pos or have hangars or offices its just an addtional tool to promote social play
not true too many feking stargates is the problem stargates should all be removed and all ships should get jump drives of course just about every aspect of eve needs to be changed and reballenced to acomodate this and new mechanics need to be introduced to goven how jump drives operate and complicate their use but ultimatly we will all benefit from playing in a universe where clueless ideots get stranded without fuel thousands of lightyears from the nerist comunications link to local chatthat said untill the universal transportation redesign is implimented nicolo is right we dont need more jump capable ships in the interim
if local is at something stupid like 150 people can drones just not show up they still do what their function is but they are not shown we dont need a bracket for 5000 fightersdrones in big fights just makes people with low end pcs hate their livesthanks
my first post last sentence mxzf just expanded on my original post trolling only started after someone decided to get their panties in a bunch over something that wasnt really what the op asked
i will like to start with a quote that i use every day when i open eve clien background some times when i play eve online i few like i am a human bot repeating tasks repetitively some times i wonder why i have not been band from ccp for being a human bot any wayi would like to see a shift click option to remove some repetitive task like inventions manufacturing  copingin the case of manufacturing i would like to select multiple items using shift then right click then choose manufacturing you should only be able to produce a maximum based on the slots available and same blueprint on the manufacturing slots available for example if it is a 6 slot production pos module then you should be only be able to do that on 6 you could just repeat the process again this is 2 steps not 11i will end with a quot
bumpfor those who think this is a good idea and that this specific version of this idea is the best  go evemail the csm rep you voted for assuming they got in and make sure that they are aware this is how you would like bounty hunting to work and that this is an important change for you
dawwww
dudeits like so easy to get 1 millionlike dudeyour smartseriouslythink you could put a little more effort into your argumentdudekinda hard to predict who will spam you and who wontnot thinking this through are youall im saying is why not set it to 100 million and have that money go into myyour pocket eh stop the evemail spam
they are already rolling out a tracking fix and its to nerf all xl turret tracking by 50 across the board they are removing the 50 tracking penalty from the siege module thoas for your dread damage complaint i dont see anything wrong with it since they have to take a massive risk by going into siege mode to get that damage if you want a titan to be able to use a siege module to be able to beat a dreads damage output i could get behind the idea since it comes with risks
you are aware that ice used to be available in very hisec system ie jitaccp removed all ore from high traffic systems because of lag now the lag problem is fixed no ore has been put backif you look youll find that caldari regions have the least amount of ice already because of it
jesus christ are people still whining about thisill put it in simple words for a simple opa missile naga would be absolutely worthless it needs guns to compete with the other tier 3s and to do its job wellget over it
i know a lot has been said about this issue however ive thought a bit about the mechanic and i believe as many of you might agree the chance based binary effect youre either jammed or not is not in line with other forms of ewar therefore i came up with another way to normalize ecm in case the whole ideas been mentioned before i apologize in advance as i had not heard about itfor an explanation and further discussion i will use the following stats as currently on tqpda rigged falcon with a multi jammer t2 8967  9pda rigged falcon with a racial jammer t2 13450  135ec300 hornet 1ec900 wasp 2nonbonused racial jammer t2 45average interceptor sensor strength 104 max targets 4average recon sensor strength 275 average max targets 8average hac sensor strength 15 avreage max targets 6average battlecruiser sensor strength 178 max targets 7average battleship sensor strength 213 max targets 7average carrier sensor strength 74 max targets 6the idea is to compare an ecm module jam strength to the target ships sensor strength multiply the ratio with max targets of the ship and subtract the result from its max locked targets for example if you fly a falcon and activate one radar t2 jammer on an armageddon 17 sensor strength 7 max locked targets it would subtract 5 or 5558 rounded down targets from his max locked count therefore the armageddon would only be able to lock 2 targetscurrent max locked targets  round up  max locked targets 1  ecm module jam strength  ship sensor strength using more than one ecm module on a ship should of course be subject to some diminishing returns the reduction in jammer strength in falloff still applies the example with falcon and geddon is the top limit of the modules effectiveness bar for eos boosting a nonbonused racial jammer would only remove 1 target from the armageddon and a flight of ec300 drones without diminishing returns 2 targetsif this change would go through without any adjusting of ship and module stats the following scenarios could happen only a flight of ec900 wasps would remove all 4 targets from a claw though not from the malediction a falcon could in an ideal situation remove 6 ruptures from combat using 6 racial jammers an eccm module would permit each of those ruptures to remain lock on 3 ships a rifter with an eccm module and one racial jammer on him still retains 1 lock etcpros ecm mechanic no longer chanceluck based  no lucky breaks no lucky permajams extra use for automated targeting systems high slot module providing extra possible target locks thus reviving a seldom used modulecons cant think of any if the system was fine tuneddiscuss and support if you like the ideaps inb4 people saying falcons ruined mah game  nevah happened
as some of you are aware there are changes coming to the war declaration mechanici want to relay my thoughts before everything is set in stone so there are more chances any good bits would be includedcurrent proposed mechanic has few flaws promotes alts within corporations as new wardec shield makes bigger corpsalliances more safe from wardecing compared to the mediumsmall oneshere is my counter proposalkeep the pricing system same baseincrement but increment the price of war declaration not by the players of target corpalliance but players of the offensive corpalliancewhat would that do completely negates the possibility of altshield makes aggressive corps strive for smaller more efficient member lists offcorp logistics has to be tackled separately  logical want bigger revenue  use less people makes target corporations more even in terms of safety if they have more members  more chances to get attacked but more chances that they would retaliaterecruit defenders as well same process could be applied to new defender declarations  so you cant just easily get 1k player strong alliance to defend you for cheap more defenders  more money to payif you have some other ideas or want to changeelaborate mine  please post here
or the current system being in a giant alliance is a red flag for never ending wardecks by greifers at the jita 4 undocki think new system is good you pay proportionally to how many targets you want they should keep track of active subs and trials and not count them but beyond that no issue of having a real cost to making wars thats not pocket changefurthermore pvp get out of highsec seriously
true large alliances get wardecced often but if they wish for it they can always retaliate ive seen in happenwith new system large alliances could easily hire defenders and i foresee specialized corps and alliances emerging to fill up that nichewhile medium and small corps would get hit much more often now with this system even to the point where there might be a possibility of declaring wars on 1020 pilot corps en masse and waiting for them at same jita 44 these pilots usually would not posses knowledge ability and resources to defend themselves unlike larger alliancesand yes pvp yes in highsec  this is the entire intended purpose of war declarations one would not fix wardeccing by saying get out of highsec is not a solution it is abandonment of the problem
tldr you point out minor issues in their proposal yet your own proposal repeats them makes them worse and creates new ones but you conveniently ignore all that ccp has given this more thought and their proposal is betterim not convinced your proposal is better than what ccp has in mind yes it promotes the use of alts but the cost rises about 500k per character on a fully paid active account this can be used to ramp up the cost but it is in no way a decshield this can also seen as a good thing since you have incentive to get rid of the huge number of one man corps and create larger more fuctional corps as a response this is a good thing for the game and the playersit also doesnt make large entities more safe the reason being the cost increase per member isnt huge and cost also increase with your wardec count this balances it out since a large entity has to dec a lot of small corps in order to get equivalent funzis out of the system and the cost increases with the number of wardecs you have while the costcharacter is the same in a system like this its a bad option to dec every random small corp you come accross point being your issues with the new proposal are insignificant at best and they also have good side benefitsyour counter proposal also has the same weaknesses as the ccp proposal but in a different worse form since the cost is determined by the number of people in the attacking corp it makes manipulation of the price very easy in favor of the attacker all you need is a 1 person corp deccing people have people transfer to it after the bill is payed and keep on the war at minimum cost to the attacker its a system with another loophole that allows bypassing the intent and balancing in the system this is bad in general and is the reason we needed a fix in the first place there is no point intentionally bringing them back especially to fix trivial issues in the proposed systemas for the benefits you mention altshield it doesnt work in the proposal and consolidates players in larger more capable organisations this isnt a bad thingstrive to be smaller no it isnt a good goal to begin with and can be bypassed entirely by alt corpsbigger revenue  use less people as said you can bypass the limitation and same reward for smaller amount of people will bring larger gains in both systems this is just common sense and can be done in every sytem if the players so chooseequal safety for all corp sizes they are pretty equal in the new system too the cost increase per character remains equal and costs still increase with the number of decs youve made it encourages engaging entities that can offer entertainment for you own entity which means deccing 20 small corps vs 1 large one is a huge waste of money and offers comparetively very little entertainment for the cost so smaller corps are cheaper to dec and more vulnerable but they are very unattractive options to larger entitiesdefender declarations also increase in cost is this a good thing it seems it only creates a needless barrier for the defender and makes mercenary contracts prohibitavely expensive to use for the smaller corps basicly meaning they are in an unequal position since they cant afford to hire help from any large entity in the ccp system they can freely negotiate with any merc they choose and they provide help according to the contract in your system this would be hard since youd have to pay for the cost of 1k man ally even when the agreement is sending a few ships to hep defend against an aggressor this would create a heavy and damaging cost barrier that would punish small entities and cripple the mercenary contract system ccps system is simply better
retaliation meaning they haul a bunch of members to highsec so the jita gankers dock until they are effectively board and move back realizing this its not even worth responding being that the people looking for a fight are not really doing it if they were they would you know attack them in 00 how do you retaliate when someone isnt relay waging a real war which if they did they would attack your stuff and not camp a npc market but just greifing for easy kills among people moving stuff in highsec atm who didnt check the wardeck whos main money making and supplying chars are far away from the war if a empire war corp wages war on 1020 pilot corps en mass they would pay about the same if not more for a large alliance allot of effort for people who might jump corps being that in addition to scaling with number new system it would also scale on top of that with multiple war decks going on at same timealso the scaling issue isnt a absolute deterrent like multiple war decks scaling exponentially it just makes it so for equivalent number of chars you have to pay for access to them concord looking the other way more small corps can bring all alts in the same corp 3 per account max just as much as larger alliances if its 20 mil per corp and 500k per char you pay nearly the same for access to the same number of chars maybe even moreso a bit of a bulk discount where the cost for waging wars against larger corps is closer to 500k per member being that the main cost would be adding up all of the chars in the corpalliance if it is a smaller one 4 accounts 12 chars you would pay 2 million per char or nearly four times more money for less targets that will be a needle in a haystack to find and add to that targets less juicy than wealthy ones in larger corpsccp is fixing the game i say dont stop the music
signedi agree i thought it would be a half way between pve and pvp an attempt to get people to fleet up and work togetherbut its not its nothing like pvp fleets its utterly predictable its completely risk free and it can be multiboxed  botted its wow raids in space and it gives out to much money for no risk
loltrollyea concord can instapop tech 2 and faction players any part in space that they shot eachother but never touch those rats seen in regular missions by that logic should highsec missions be abolished while everyone just watches god concord npcs one shot wave after wave of invading npc rats before players ever get a chance to get a bounty the bounty money concord should get just like any player is used to get more concord ships concord should be controlled by a sentient ai that desires to take over the universe and secure all important resources for itself to maintain security and universal peaceconcord will be the game
bring back the juggernaut torpedo the old names were so much better
i have been playing since 2004 and i was very comfortable with the old names i was attracted to eve because it was mindnumbingly complex in 2004 playing eve was like being invited to speak at a mensa meeting you knew you were the best of the best and you played the elite game that others ran screaming fromso yes i miss the old names and i shudder to think of the lesser classes getting into eve dumbingdown eve is a loss to every player who struggled and succeeded at playing the best game in the worldnow any dumbass can pick it up in a few months and no more learning skills no more sixmonths of struggling to gain access to a ship worthy of a level four mission i still do not think there is any better game in the world than eve but the gap has been narrowed instead of being head and shoulders above the secondbest game in the world eve is now but a few hairs best how long will it be before eve is passestill playing after all these years aramis rosicrux
you mean they shouldits seems any item is an enemy to them any space flotsam that is not in your fleetthere is also the problem that you cannot fire them until fired upon
sorry never played lineage ii could you describe it better or is it exactly the same
i will mentor you for 500mil
even when spider tanking bs was in only armor bs had the option as shield transporters were and still are too expensive to fit
the only viable shield fleets of nowadays employ skirmish setups and this limits the variety of ships you can bring to such fleets its either minmatar variants or gtfo where is the torp raven i cant remember when last time i saw any shield bs fleets around armor has always been the favorable tanking style for brawling when using battleships and above this is also noticeable in heavy assault ship gangs any smart person nowadays is gunning for armor caps mostly because shield caps are pretty much sub par to their armor counterparts in every way that matters why should i use use a chimera when its cap tank and logistic ability are all sub par to that of its direct armor counterpart its too much of a setback imo and numbers dont lie they would be a balance in usage if these things were properly balanced in the first placeps the main reason armor reppers activate at the end of the cycle is because of the order of the various parts that make up a ship shield before armor and not a setback in anyway
ok thanks for feedbackyes i want to make it easier for small corps to compete with the larger ones in primarily lowsec space lowsec is very scarcely inhabited today and thats because the incitements for small corpssingle players going there are not present riskreward and logistics i have flown for close to a year in a fewmansingleman corp using cloaky blockade runners running poses for t2 production i have had absolutely no problems jumping through gatecamps with pesky pirates avoiding those beautiful discoships in rancer on the gates avoiding wartargets waiting in highsec etc its that easy today allready also its very very boring and timeconsuming i dont mind risks not at all  beeing a smallcorp industrialist in lowsec is risky posses do burn from time to time  so a suggestion for something that would balance the riskreward would be welcome ie reward beeing less timeconsuming having to jump those 23 jumps to jita 11 times in one day to fill up your posses fuel baysconcerning safety  a jump hauler can be shot in highsec if wardecced i dont think they should be cloakys also it would have to use a cyno to jump to so thats another place youre vulnerable going back to highsec means jumping to a lowsec system and flying to the nearest jumpgate finally the cargo hold would not be that big meaning many more jumps and increased riskopportunities for gankerspirates etc on top of that if you want to get to a small corp in lowsec  just fly in your dreads and kill the pos nevermind the haulersalso using a blackops would require 3 toons right one for the cyno one for the black ops making the bridge and one for the blockaderunner now im talking about small corps having 3 accounts or even 3 players online at the same time  then you are a medium size corp in eve 
your definition of small corpmedium corplarge corp is a bit of a errorsmall in my eyes would be 510 peopleas about half of them are altsmaybe 2025 perhapsmedium would be 40 to 50large is hundredsa black ops fleet to move cargo does require 3 people minimumbut that is the pointyour asking for something that means soloable lets be honest herebecause thats what your really asking foryour not going to get thatnow as far as my suggestionits quite goodand potentially funanything with a covert ops cloak can do thisyou can jump from high secand transport goodsif you happen to cross null sec youll get stealth bombers in the mix and its really funi realize what your shooting forbut in all honesty your removing the risk from the equaition with your ideajfs have it easythrow away cyno toons and a little bit of timing with scouts and multibilliong isk ships get off scott free stop the evemailUFFFDspam

i have a request for cloaky ships im pretty sure im not the only one who has these problems1 can we have a proximity alarm for when you delcoak so you know whats up its hard wif you have different overview sorting to keep tabs on the closest target nearly impossible to see in timethis is necessary because you begin to decloak long before your ship model is visible to you by the time you can see you are decloakingyoure dead its happened to me countless times i cant have everything on overview all the time so there may be a can or some crap that im next to and i cant see itsoif you are cloaked and some object gets within 5k of you start sounding it 2 can you make the cloak activated module look a bit different its so faded green and you cant see it all the time on green backgroundits bad and lots of other ones too make it all flash green not just the outline and if it turns off have it red pleasethanksps and all you hardcore players who well you need 8 eyes and 9 hands so better get used to it shove it 
no im afraid i dont agree the cloak is a powerful tool and needs to have drawbacks tbh more drawbacks than it currently has since it doesnt really have an in game counter yet anyway
overview management i have a cloak tab that shows everything and is sorted by distance im not surprised by something getting too close to me
simple the titan should not be a combat shipthere is just no way to balance it otherwise without making it either overpowered or obsoleteit should be a mobile station full docking and logging off at location corp asset like a pos titan bridge station services and both the old and the new doomsday weapons both very iceexpensive to use so emergencyonlybig alliances will use it as a frontline command post for reshipping and logistics small alliances will use it as a their mobile hq keeping away from the frontlinesoperation write down all the things check out the list at
i disagreeexpense should not be used for balancing on a ship that costs as much as a titan even if you made a single doomsday cost a bil to fire it would still get fired at every single cap ship it faced plus you would have people taking advantage of the cargo space you had to include for that bil worth of fuel
since you dont make any valid arguments ill just disagree with you disagreeingas for the doomsday yeah this is just because i think as a mobile station it deserves a good last line of defense anticap and antisupport and on a timer to make so theres a good risk of getting caught with your pants down if used willynillythough the biggest factor limiting projection of power is always operational cost when big enough and people will just start weighing cost vs benefit if the cost is too high to be used just to gank some carrier but low enough to be acceptable to be fired to prevent losing a station with possibly tens of billions of stored stuff from corpmates then it should be balanced the reason why this didnt work before was because there was practically no cost for firing the old doomsday nor could you run out of bulletsthe point is when you have people storing their stuff in it and logging off at it it will be way less likely to be used as an offensive frontline ship anywayas for the cargo abuse a station should have insane cargospace and tts not like theres no easy solution to your posed problem just turn all the ice into a doomsday bullet first before it can be usedoperation write down all the things check out the list at
this tobiaz guy seems to have a brain on himwhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
you didnt provide a reason why you believe that titans cant be balanced as a combat ship so i didnt feel inclined to provide a reason why i disagreed with youmaybe it would reduce the amount of titan hot drops specifically to dd something but alliances will shell out the money to fire the dds on fleet operations no matter the cost so your idea is really only going to nerf them in a solo setting anyway it might make pl add a titan ammo fee to their contracts tho true you can easily get around the first problem that came to mind but i really didnt feel like putting much effort into it when you didnt bother to explain why you dont believe that titans can be balanced as combat ships in the first place
heh we agree on some things mechael just not this topic his current argument doesnt really hold water the way he is describing it but he may yet come up with something good who knows

i support this ideamake the sites contain only one type of ore so people can look for orespecific signatures instead of stripping sites of only a specific ore and letting it despawngive sites a despawn timer unless they are mined out of a week this way it will reduce the amount of available resources in busy areas and create signaturerich pockets that explorers can search for or a few rare nullsec signatures in high seca big advantage of using this system is that mining involves more steps and types of players it is also much easier to tweak this system to modifiy spawnrate and locationoperation write down all the things check out the list at
already exists you can have as many members as your corporation management skills allow you to no need to put some new limit on it if anything make a rule that says that if a corp is at less than 10 members for a set amount of time their corp is shut down and the members will return to npccorps so they can keep doing their smallgang stuff at their pace of course then people would just pad their corps with notraining alts
i believe a review of how a person can stay in a npc corp to avoid war decs forever should be doneyeahriiiiightwhatever you say bro stop the evemail spam
tldr i should be allowed to force people to play eve the way i want them tono next
null bears will be protected they are sensitive flowers of pure pvp docking fury
i fail to see how this would benefit nullbears
leave npc corps alone if people want to be in them let them be in them they already pay for being in them it called taxes pay to avoid a war what kinda  is that youre the agressor you pay

it was a missile platform originally but since the theme was cheapish sniper the only alternative was cruise which are quite frankly horrid hence the change to gunsat any rate you should train guns regardless as most of the skills cover all systems and they are pretty much superior to missiles in the vast majority of cases
nice job just listing off arbitrary bonuses rather than looking at what the ships are actually meant to dotier 3 bcs are meant for midlong ranges and specifically sniping to do this they need guns caldari have hybrids as their alternative weapon system and the naga is a great railgun platform  so this works quite nicelya missile naga on the other hand is  worthless and if you tried to bring one along to my tier 3 gang id take a good amount of time to laugh at you before kicking you out of the fleet and telling you to fit up a proper shipyes yes there is and it works completely differently to the naga despite the shared weapon systemsthe naga has a nichUFFFD that the talos cannot fill anywhere near as effectively notice how it does this without using missiles and now punch yourself in the face and learn to playand just because i can im going to point out a few flaws in your list of missile boatscondorheron  is a probing ship the fact it has a missile bonus is purely incidentalkestrelcrowmanticore  is a stealth bomber all the stealth bombers have missiles regardless of race i dont see many threads from minmatar whining about how their hounds cant fit artillery do youhawkflycatcher  is a dictor and the fact its missile bonused makes no difference whatsoever to its rolecaracalcerberusonyx  is a hictor and the fact its missile bonused makes no difference whatsoever to its rolerooktengu  nice to see you listed this under both categories missing the irony that if the naga were made into dual missileshybrids the missile variant would be worthless much like the hybrid tengu isdrakenighthawkravengolemwidow  is an ecmjump bridge monkey the fact its missile bonused makes no difference whatsoever to its rolenaga  the fact its hybrid bonused means it can perform its role on par with the other tier 3syeah once cruises and long range missiles in general get their fix the idea of a missile naga might be worth considering but i dont see the point personallyalso iirc the first iteration of the naga was dualbonused to hybrids and missiles but the missile variant sucked balls

yes i realize that the missile version would be useless in a gangfleet unless you were shooting structures with torps i would like to have both options availableheronmanticore  i agree i only included them to avoid the omg you missed something postsflycatcheronyx  they do happen to be dictors but i also believe that they need to fix dictors so they can be used with the weapon systems they have bonuses fortengu  yep they need to fix the hybrid tengu as wellwidow  yep they need to fix black ops tooeven if you remove the heron manticore and widow my previous analysis stands unchangededit i could also point out that the falcon and vulture only happen to have hybrid bonuses as well one is an ecm boat the other a fleet boosting ship i included them anyway
supported wholeheartedly  but why not just have a general afk feature that works whether or not youre in a fleeti try to convo someone  i get a message back that person is currently afki browse through corpchat or whatever chat and i can see whos here and whos not immediately saving me the trouble of trying to get someones attention when theyre out dropping the kids off at the pool or somethingand so onwhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
with the recent uproar over the alliance panels drunken escapades this year at fanfest i feel this is an opportune time to address the issue of ingame conduct and its businesspersonally i found much of the panel painful in a trainwrecky way mostly with tests leaders presentation to be perfectly honest i glazed right over mittens comments about the mackinaw miner and didnt think much of it if youve been on the internet a while this kind of language is common and strewn throughout the great web and anyone with an ounce of sense can see it for what it is  childish thoughtless literally without malicious undertone insults constructed by those who cannot or will not apply more than a few braincells to its buildingi will be frank with my bias  i am a member of a cfc alliance and i happen to like mittens now that thats out of the way that kind of language is to be expected within eve online its just the nature of online gaming and anyone with more than a few hours of experience playing online knows this the internet is full of these kind of folk and id venture to say that many of them dont in their heart of hearts mean anything of what they saywhile the whole kill yourself thing is considered by many jurisdictions as cyber bullying many of you know just how dangerous that line of thinking really is there is a line that continues to blur every day regarding what is cyber bullying the very name of it belies its existence as a construct of those who just cant let something go they whine about words posted at their username take it seriously post youtube videos about it complaining about how much it hurt them and about how its sent them into a spiraling depressionthese things never used to be an issue and to borrow a phrase from modern gaming the internet unfortunately has been casualized it is now the casual user that everyone must cater for censor for and coddle this is abhorrent to me especially within eves context the internet this vast network of not only linked machines but linked people is easily the most important thing humanity has ever created we are able to share literally everything and anything a vital part of this is bigotry stupidity and their ilkwe must know these things see them and attempt to understand them if we are ever to hope to remove them completely without knowledge through censorship of this kind of madness we bury our heads in the sand and pretend they dont exist growing up as i am sure many of eves playerbase had i was bullied made fun of and occassionally assaulted what did i do about these things i learned how to deal with them and i became a better person as a result i know how to deal with these kind of people and how to communicate with them humans are mean vicious creatures but such labels are so heavily contextually based and subjective that theres no way to draw a clear line in the sand and sado not cross this it is indecent and offensiveccp has created a sandbox in my opinion the most sophisticated of the bunch we are allowed to control our own space our own internet spaceship destinies we came for fun we stayed for the serious bidness that said the very character of the sandbox is at stake when political correctness gets involvedthat said and wall of text aside there needs to be an addendum to the current or a completely separate tos acknowledging the bigotry the greasy and the extremely harsh nature of eve not to quell it not to condone it but to make sure that when someone gets involved they arent going to cry about it later and ruin this great experiment of eve it is a fundamental human right to speak ones mind regardless of what that speech is i hate to say it but the vast majority of those who cry foul at things that offend them especially when things arent going their way need to harden the  up and dealwithiti refuse to let people who cannot disconnect themselves from the internet ruin this sandboxi refuse to make this game so serious that were worried about what we say or doi refuse to condone any action that would somehow distort humanities true colours because in doing so you refuse parts of yourselfi simply refuse to do these things and i would hope that the csm and their chairman would see it the same way regardless of what theyve said done or feel on the matter
came expecting ganking tears left oddly satisfied i salute you sir
and here i was thikning this was yet an another rant about mittens remarksseems like hes echoing my thoughtsthat beingthe lines between greifing and verbal assaultsremarks are starting to blur a little to muchjust how far is too far is the question being askedsupported stop the evemail spam
wall of text aside i agree it may not have been the nicest thing to say but people need to go back to the old adage sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me words only have as much power over us as we choose to let them
i think the line needs to be between words and actions if the goons has followed through and the player actually received hundreds or thousands of mails suggesting he end his life something would definitely need to be done even if the player doesnt take that seriously coordinated harassment isnt allowed in real life and isnt something ccp should allow to happen to paying customersso a kid was mining one day got ganked and in a fit of rage and frustration let all his reallife drama spill over into the game world and said something about offing himself in a letter to mittens or some other goon who forwarded it mittens shared that and everyone had a good laugh so far no harm is done but if that kid had found himself suddenly under a barrage of stupiditythats different thats threatening ccps bottom line the more of that he gets the more likely he is to quit eve possibly taking friends with him and certainly telling everyone he knows that the community is terrible we need to be above that sort of behaviorremember guys ccp is running a business its in their interest to protect their subscribers mittens endangered their subscription rate with his behavior and thats something they have to consider nevermind the morality of it eve has never been big on morality
take it furtherin this countryfailing to report a suicide threat could land you in a boat load of troublesuch things should be reported to local law enforcementand when the law gets invovledi dont care if your in iceland or notits gonna come down on ccp like a ton of bricksccp takes actions as a resultthey yank the guy off evecall the police department based on his billing information and treat each and every so called threat of suicidemurderotheras real as it getsim hesitant to get any credence ot the mittens thingbut as i saidthe line is blurring a little too easily these days stop the evemail spam
well said and very relevant to alot of situations we see in eve there should be a definitive line that you do not cross
if one thing has come out of this is that mitanni has managed to bring the game into disrepute in the media and in doing so has painted eve players as being nothing more than bullies and drunken fools as long as he was doing this with just his buddies that was fine nobody really cares that much about goonswarm anyway but as a vocal representative of eve epic fail and bad publicity is bad publicity
reducing target locked down to one does close to nothing if they all have one target they can target and blow you upone target is usually all i target anyway unless queing up stuff
ok i like the idea of making ecm effect your max locked targets but i think your formula needs a bit of tweaking mainly because if you cant jam someone out under any circumstances its kind of useless to fit ecm if you are flying solo or even in a large fleet because fcs usually just call one primary after anotherthe way id do itfirst tie max locked targets to your sensor strength max locked targets  round up sensor strength  ecm so right now a hurricane has 6 max locked targets so give it a ladar sensor strength of 6eccm gives you sensor strength which in turn raises your max locked targets this gives eccm an extra purpose other than in case you get falconned bro this puts it in line with sensor boosters and tracking enhancers which have uses on their ownalso the amount of ships someone will have locked up is more often than not skill limited anyway so at most youre going to have 15 dudes locked if you are really pro and use up all your mid slots on eccmget rid of the automated targeting system or just lump it in with eccmnow all you have to do is calibrate the ecm module strength based on the max locked targets of most ships so to perma jam a hurricane with no eccm on it youd need a total ladar ecm strength of 6then id also suggest giving ecm a short optimal range and a large falloff that way you can tactically counter ecm by burning out a bit until you can lock someone up so if you are a decent pilot you can still fight through the jamming same as other ewar fighting against sensor dampeners you just need to get in close and stay there long enough to lock on to fight against tracking disrupters you need to pull a good orbit on someone or sit still and take a steady shotalso if the tactical counter to dampeners is getting close enough to lock and the counter to new and improved ecm is to get in close then youd see falcons and arazus pairing up and having to work togetheralso you could have this odd dynamic where your max locked targets is based on your total sensor strength so a hurricane with its natural ladar of 6 and maybe some gravometric eccm fitted for an extra 2 points would lock 8 targets but to jam it out youd need to hit it with a bit of multispectral jamming in addition to just hitting it with ladari honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
i suppose it would be even better if ecm jam strength was buffed up optimal severely reduced and falloff increased along the lines wolodymyr suggested you could effectively permajam a hull with a weaker sensor strength even in an unbonused ship using some ecm modules youd just need to get really close 1000m or smththerefore it wouldnt be as unviable to bring an ecm module and ec drones to a say blaster ship though it wouldnt be as good on kiting ships and snipersi dont however think that making sensor strength  max locked targets would be a good idea an archon with its 72 sensor strength and 6 locked targets can hardly be compared to a zealot with 13 sensor strength and same 6 locked targetsin response to sephiroth cloneiivif youd manage to jam your target down to 1 locked targets it means one of the following youre flying a bonused ecm ship and have several ecm modules thus you can afford to allocate another ecm module on him even a wrong racial one could push him down to 0 max locked targets much in the same manner as is done now  you put 1 jammer on a target if it doesnt jam him use another and another etc the other option is youre flying a nonbonused ship to ecm and only have a module or two in that case yours is not an ewar role the ecm module you have is to inconvenient the target just as you dont expect to win a fight by adding 1 nonbonused td or damp rare exceptions with bombers or frigs but then with the above range fix similar exceptions could apply for ecm if more pilots in your gang used that 1 unbonused ewar mod then they would make a bigger difference again making it possible to push targets max locked targets to 0
and the first of these targets would be the falcon which then dies in seconds oh wait not really there would be no reason to kill the falcon because its completely useless nowstupid ideaoperation write down all the things check out the list at
how about if we change the ecm around  instead of ecm being something you use on an enemy  ecm is a module you use on a friendenemy which makes it harderimpossible to target themthis could be used to counter primarying as an alternative and also counter to spidertanking and as you cant currently target yourself it would not be effective solo
you didnt read his proposal at all you would still be able to reduce a target to 0 locked targets it will just be more consistent and not based on chance contributer to eve is easy
yeah my idea does kind of fall apart at the capitol level unless you just want to bite the bullet and let big ships have a ridiculous amount of max locked targetswhatever we end up doing with ecm there are a few things that need to happen1 you need to be able to jam someone out all the way otherwise ecm becomes useless if someone can still lock up 1 dude no matter how much ecm is on them changing your formula from round up to round down would do that or maybe something likecurrent max locked targets  round down  max locked targets x ship sensor strength  ecm module jam strength  ship sensor strengthso if you hit your armageddon that has 17 sensor strength with 18 points of jamming youd get  7 x  17  18  17   041 which is less than 0 max locked targets so they get jammed out2 eccm modules need to do something outside of preventing jamming to bring them in line with other ewar protection sensor boosters tracking enhancers although by this logic warp core stabilizers and inertia stabilizers need to do something by themselves too3 there needs to be a way to fight through the jams other than just fitting some module the low optimal and large falloff should do this just finei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
it had been confirmed in a video interview that yes drone rats are moving to bounties and that ccp think mining is not a viable profession in its current statethank you ccp
a random internet commenter had a good ideathere is a better way for factional warfare to flip sovownership turn the current static bunkers into nullsecstyle outposts dockable only by the owning militia no need to lock off alreadyexisting stations no getting alts involved allow this outpost to give certain benefits to owning militia taxfree production free repairs and clones etc systems turned by putting this outpost into reinforced and popping it 24 hours later give it sentry guns to impede enemy camping make it a tactically important little piece of floating property if your stuff is inside when the system turns fight for it back or jump into a clone inside give it cloning facilities with the new owner able to revoke clone contractsthis is a simple easy way to tackle factional warfare
1great idea i would add that in system stations should not allow enemy to be able to dock
sorry that is way too elegant of a solution wasnt the proposal meant to avoid that it defuses the outrage currently in progress around the proposed lockouts
yeah actually
did the op watch the fw presentation from fanfest
yes the french dev was talking about ihubs which i am intimately familiar with when it comes 00 dominion sov warfare the problem with ihubs is that the lowsec stations will be flipped as soon as the ihub is down this adds a dockable structure supplemental to the ihub you must shoot the ihub it goes into reinforce give militia time to repair it if they cant repair it after the reinforcement timer is up you can kill the timer then you can incapacitate the militia outpost it goes into reinforce militia can rep it if they cant rep it then after the timer is up the other militia can drop their ihub and claim it
i hope that they do remove the mwd and replace it with this although really why the name change microwarp drive  you know  for micro warps it should never have been an overgrown afterburner in the first placewhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
i suppose its to differentiate it from the mwd to reduce confusion for new players
going by what soundwave said in the eve keynote the mjd will not replace the mwd rather it be a new option to mix things up a bit
i like ccps proposalgive me two reasons why a small highsec group wardecs a large alliance thats actually a trick question theres only one to grief them on the jita 44 undocklegitimate war is unaffected for the following reasons nullseclowsec alliances dont use war decs seriously thats what neutralorangered status is for just blob up pewpew and stay away from the sentries if applicable highsec wars between two independent corps is cheap enough as is one corp wardeccing a 100member corp  50mil extra dude thats chump change youll spend ten times that amount on ships to get blown up go run an incursion for two hours and wardec eveuni i bet youll still walk away with a profit highsec alliances who want to pvp wait do those even exist outside of eveuni fleet up head to 4 and pewpew to your hearts content just watch out for the sentries

not true we had a rather entertaining war with test a while back and none of the fighting happened in jita that i know ofbesides if a large alliance cant swat a couple of pests harassing them on the jita undock they arent as formidable as they pretend to bewell ours did until someone forgot to pay the alliance bill rip petition blizzard

my original post was largely hyperbolic in composition ill attest to the fact that legitimate wars can be waged between a corp and alliance but i will also point out that in terms of my experience ive never seen a corponalliance war dec that resulted in actual fighting it was pretty much a bribe to concord to let them shoot that shiny jump freighter that passes by every week or twothat would involve movement of ships and players to the jita undock which frankly isnt worth it when the most likely result is the griefers docking up and playing station games all dayalso ive yet to see a logistics run that is an alliancewide op most of the time its individual corporations making the runs which makes them easy pray for griefersin lieu of flowers send isk

this and other threads on similar topics continue to miss the key economic point  ccp has revenue issues and has to take action to address themevery hard core gamer who gets into this game ends up within six months or less being able to pay for his gaming by buying plex ingame with isk its dog dirt simple in fact  you only need to make 20m a day and that can be done in an hours play if youre ruthless enough even if your toon is only one month oldit follows that ccp makes all their rl money from a those players who dont play enough to make 500m isk a month plus b new players that havent figured it out yet and c new audiences such as dust 514 first person shooter gamers and d people who prefer to pay 15 euro a month in order to put the isk into their ships and toys plus e vanity players who buy plex for cash so they can have those shiny mods long before they can make the 500 million isk they costwar deccing for griefing presents a problem to ccp  players in groups a b and e get turned off and quit the game but ccp needs the revenue they represent so the war dec mechanics have to be tweaked to let these for now they might change carebears play the way they want togo ahead look up my toon ingame  youll see that im old enough to grief any newb any time anywhere i want to  and theres nothing the newb can do about my enormous advantage in skills and ships except either hide quit eve or band very tightly together with other players and do nothing anywhere without friends in at least the same system nothingccp can not afford to let new players who get enticed into eve quit in large proportions within 90 days or even six months they need the revenueergo high sec griefing must be limitedit rather follows that the ally system to combat war decs is going to be retained and some griefer corps are going to discover that theyve bitten off quite a lot more than they can chewnonetheless ccp must also address the mechanics of neut alt reppers and station games including bumping ships with neutsim ambivalent about the target sizecost issues  and ccp has to make a decision here that keeps newer players in the game and paying its that simple

thank you all for continuing the discussion while i was gonedestination skillqueueyes what you have pointed out are valid points but i think ccp can fix them as well for example if corporation has declared wars charge the newly joined members the proper increment fee at full amount this would prevent players bypassing the charges and make more stable corporations no more 1 today 100 tomorrow corpsi have played eve for 6 years with this character and 8 years total i have been in corporations that are filled with alts before it is a sorry existence  being in a 600 man corporation with 10  15 online all the time and corp chat devoid of life that is not something i would wish forabout equality  actually with base cost present the cost per capita decreases the amount of isk paid per person but the difference is negligible now it would be simply unprofitable to target large alliances with war declaration since no matter how much spoils you obtain the amount of isk spent on war declaration would overwhelm itwhat you have said about prohibitive cost of larger defender corps is true but they also could potentially strive for smaller corps that consists of only pure active pilots wo alt junk it would also possible to have defender corporations that specialize in specific timezonesephiroth cloneiivnow they would potentially retaliate by simply hiring the defenders and let the griefers and defenders wage war at jita 4viciouscyclewhat ccp wants is to have plex at low enough isk pricereason being ccp wants more people to buy plex  atm we do not have the shortage of plex at our hands main problem right now it the isk influx into the game  there is no good isk sinks atm in the gameand do not forget  you are talking about hardcore gamers  no everyone in eve is like that  there are some out there who have year old chars and perfectly fine paying rl money for the game it all depends on how much you earn in rl if you can easily earn 15 than 480mill isk then i think you might as well just pay for eve or even 9 if you have yearly subscriptionthis is an eve online  place where scamming is allowed  i think griefing is viable tactic as well i dont want carebear online anytime soon besides i personally flown industrials in high sec while beild warde
i think that the structure hit points on mining barges are quite frankly too low for example a hulk which is a t2 mining barge should have at least 10000 compare the hulk to an orca both store lose oreedited to include explanations for things i thought were obvious blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp

first off the hulk is an exhumer not a mining bargebut yes they are too easy to kill nowadays yet somehow i dont think adding more hp to their structure is going to help a lot sure theyll be less likely to die in highsec but they will still be killed with ease in lowsec nullsec and wh how about giving them generally more hp a bit more pgcpu and 1 or 2 more midslots so they can survive until their allies arrive in logis and hacs t deal with attackers doesnt help them at all against caps of course simply adding more hp wont fix them for when drones lose their compounds and miners will actually be valuable assets to any nullsec alliance they need a chance to actually tank a bit of damage until someone can come and save them this might also make it less likely to just send in one or two bcs with lots of dps to destroy the enemys mining fleetsno i dont live in nullsec and im not going to say this will fix mining vessels either but its more likely to fix them than just giving them more structure hp since highsec miners never fit damage control systems on their ships anyway
add to thatthe hulk is not a capital ship like the orcaso please do make foolish comparisons stop the evemail spam
technically the orca isnt a capital ship its an industrial command ship but due to its sheer size and lack of maneuverability it is classified as a capital ship on the market as far as i know its currently perfectly possible to build orcas in large ship assembly arrays although the components needed are built at capital ship assembly arrays if im not mistaken another thing is that orcas can enter highsec just like freighters and jump freighters why because theyre not capitals theyre just really huge subcapital ships built using capital components
an exhumer is a t2 version of a mining barge lol but if you want to quiblble then feel free mining barges should have a stronger structure i would add another low slot and make the structure 10000 hit points and that will do it i have setup a 00 mining hulk and they can tank a couple of bs rats quite nicelyi think it will make a big difference and means that people just need to fit a single dc to add to their survival and it makes sense that a mining ship has a very strong structure blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp

gonna have to disagreethe majority i hear from others is ships of that nature that are obscenely large and contain things like very large cargo holds and speciality hangers wwo jump drives and such are calssified as capitial ships you even said yourself it requires capitial parts to construct withits just they are given a speciial dispensation to be allowed to traverese stargatesgrantedi was like youfor a while i just referred to them as sub caps but honestlyi cant call an orca a sub capits just too damn big for that grantedsemanticsand not worth splitting hairsso ill just treat this as a respectful disagreement  stop the evemail spam
any ship in this game with some minor exceptions can take in oreyour pointyour argument is in vast need of work stop the evemail spam
i am working on the premise that an ore hold is a special hold requiring a heavy structure in the orca and that as the hulk takes in raw ore it needs a strong structure too surely you can work that back blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
you also need strong structure to hold explosive ammobombsmissiles of various kindsformsfashionsagainyour logic is reachingvery poor reasoning to buff structure points on a mining shipadditionallythe orca is not just an ore hauling shipit also has a corperate hangerand a ship maintence arrayits cargo hold is many times larger than mostwhile i wouldnt mind such things personally as an industriliasti always was under the impression you should have a fleet near by to protectyesnull sec logicbut then in high sec i never mine in high traffic zones stop the evemail spam
well that was annoying the forum lost all that i just typedlets try again your logic in terms of the ammo is flawed and has no relationship to large chunks of ore that are uneven and very bulky and of course are not constrained by gravity or special racks fitted to the ship anyway if you want to think that a hold for ammo is the same as a hold for ore than feel free but it does not make any sensei am very interested in the crimewatch proposals at fanfest because at the moment if you have a covering fleet in high sec you have to ask the ganker to flip a can so you can try to stop him i wonder how many would do that and in terms of out of the way places well i tended to mine in systems well away from low sec but i have not been in a hulk for over 6 months and even then that was only for a special reason until a hulk has a hull stronger then a wet paper bag i guess i wont be bothering at allbut i have no issues with hulks being ganked my issue is that they are so weak in terms of stucture that even a solo catalyst can now kill one and have time to get the pod too and my concern above anything else is that ccp decide to nerf tier 3 bcs which i do not want to see blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp

supported cloaking devices should have disadvantages interface ambiguity about whether or not a cloaking device is currently functioning shouldnt be amongst those disadvantagessurvivor of teskanen fan of john rourke i have video tutorials for eve online on my youtube channel
fck sake cloaky faggots got really huge advantages with cloaking and crying more options for cloak  lol
umm it seems that a lot of you cannot see the difference between better gameplay  interface vs tactical overpowered advantagesput your thinking cap on andhow does changing the color of the cloaking blinky thing make this overpowered and having a proxy alarm which can be turned off if you wish be also overpowered if the proxy alarm goes off you should have maybe 23 seconds to react so this unlikely to help you unless you are paying attention and know what you are doing right now when cloaked you have zero warning that you are being decloaked which is a major oversight there is neither a text or a graphical warning  either on the modules or the ship your ship is targetable but the ship model looks cloakedi mean wtf this needs to be fixed when you decloak you decloak you dont make the ship targetable but only lose the cloak 10 seconds later its purposefully deceitful hehe and besides decloaking by proximity objects is overall just lame the way its set up nowgive me some sort of graphical warning on the ship that its being decloakedlike i dunno some electrical discharges going across it what i would do is i would have the following1 when cloak is active the module glows a bright green itself not around it2 when cloak is being deactivated manually or automatically make the module glow red for 10 second3 when the cloak breaks because of proximity of objects  have the ship model decloak either instantly or some way that i can see it happening4 when proxy alarm is tripped have that nice neocon sexy voice say danger unable to maintain cloak due to objects being too close to the shipall those of you who see this as some sort of new uber cloaking tool im sorry its not this addresses the interface common sense and just plain better and more convenient gameplayi would classify this right there with the following in game warnings1 market buy warning for excessive prices  this shouldnt exist either right2 contract warning for zero price public contract  humm how about this3 steal warning  no this is overpowered4 module overheat display makeover  no no no just burn the guns overhead needs to have huge drawbacks its overpowered already5 jumping into low sec  nooo let the stooopid die6 autopilot being able to dock on its own as it can jump gates on its own but in a way that doesnt actually do everything for you  but not we must jump every jump docking is overpowered7 warning that you failed to jump because you are cloakedno but cloaky overpowered already let the sob sit at the gatei trust you get my pointif you dont then go minethe person saying fck sake cloaky faggots got really huge advantages with cloaking and crying more options for cloak  lol the point of being cloaked is that you have huge advantages but these advantages are heavily compensated by huge limitations unlimited cloaking times aside i do not agree with afk unlimited cloaking but meh its not up to mei mean really if anyone suggested that autopilot be able to dock on its own it would get a hail of opposition from the elitist ignoramuses who have no clue about making a game better because they are unable to see past their own experiences and limitations which is why they need to stay away from designing games

i wouldnt object to audible alarms where there are already text notices rather than pings or alarms or anything like that a unique cloakdecloakfailed cloak set of sounds would be finei play without audio so thats still no excuse to do away with the text warningsim pretty well against proximity warnings though if you cant manage your overview and know how far away things are then you dont need to be trying to sneak within 10 km of something cloaki frequently decloak inside of 3 km from targets the proximity can result in irrational behavior and trips up less prepared pilots i dont want persistent alarms telling me im at risk of being decloaked while im scraping past wrecks to get the range i want i know what im doing and if i do get decloaked im well aware of the risk and no adding a toggle to turn of such alarms is not a good idea weve got too many toggles already
alarm should be optional just like every other alarm is in eve we currently have alarms for shield damage armor damage and structure damage does this mean that you should do away with the alarms and not fight period if you dont want to lose shield and armornothe problem is not the risk of decloaking or the mechanics of it the problem is that you dont know when its happening why do i have to keep repeating myself
learn to read noob this is only a change in the clientinterfacenot in game mechanicsbut since your too dense to see let alone capable of understanding thatyellcry away stop the evemail spam
im not sure what youre getting all worked up about i just said ive got no problem with alarms for things you currently get text notices about that includes cloaking device deactivated due to  that i see when i bump something
isnt there already a  its called oh i am visible again as it stands this screams i want to afk cloak and be alerted when someone catches me with that said i agree i also think alarms should be added for a whole crapload of things including new reds neutrals and war targets in system
no it doesnt scream afk the problem is that you actually decloak long before you are visible you are targetable long before you are visible thats what im talking about try a cloaked ship and get close to an object your ship will still be cloaked on screen but its actually visible and targetable
well there is already a visible warning see that little green circle with the picture of a cloak in the middle when it stops being green and changes to red thats your cue to be somewhere else of course this is assuming you are not an afk cloaky if you are tough shouldve been paying attention as has already been pointed out this isnt really that much of a problem if you have your overview set up correctlyi do feel that it does give another advantage to the cloaked ship if you are afk cloaky and you hear a warning then you will change to that toon to see whats happening so its just giving afk cloakers another layer of protection that they really dont need
if youre incapable of moving your ship out of harms way without an audio alert im amazed you can manage to type your username and password to log into the client without physically damaging yourself
i searched for other bounty hunting posts and didnt find anything that was similar to mine so i apologize if this has already been proposed although i doubt it hasthe change i suggest is1 placing bounty on player ships a the full bounty cannot be collected unless the worth of the ship destroyed is equal to or more than the bounty on the pilots head this would mean that if a player has a 100million isk bounty on their head it cant be collected unless they lose a 100million isk costing ship when it happened thus if the player with bounty on their head happened to be flying a 50million isk costing ship the bounty payout to the attacking player would be 50million out of the 100million leaving 50million available for further claim b for obvious reasons self destructing would not claim any bounty prizes as well as npc destroying a players ship2 the option to add a bonus pod bounty capped at the current cost of the target players active clone ive put much thought into this and i cant really find a reasonable way to exploit this system on paper anyways i think this would put much more usage and gratification into the bounty system and give players more opportunity to lose ships  make money at the same time
also let me add to make bounty hunting a fully used feature and a viable profession i would also go so far as to make players with bounties on their heads free to attack in highsec perhaps once their bounty is of a certain value maybe ie bountied player with 1020million bounty can be fired upon without interference from concord
haha thanks shandirthat is very similar to my idea although i would say the linked proposal is a tad more complicated and still leaves plenty of room for exploitation i dont think bounty hunting should be viewed as a corpalliance profession first solo profession lastin my mind bounty hunting first means a bounty hunter going after a target  hence why my idea has no deliberate who is allowed to attack the person im putting a bounty on dynamic if a bounty can only be collected when an equal or greater value of ship is destroyed in the process the person with the bounty on their head simply will not be able to profit this also means players wont be required to destroy pods to collect which to me seems to be one of the current dynamics that turn a lot of people off from bounty hunting as there are only a small number of ways to go about killing someones pod quickly as opposed to destroying their shipbounties will cease to be free gifts to people that are deserving of someones revenge plus if finely thought out and tuned for longevity making bountied players somewhatsomehow attackable in highsec would naturally develop a sort of player policed environment thats a good thing imo

the current jumpclone cooldown is 24h this leads to a delay if you need to jump daily of some minutes sometimes you dont manage to login in time so its maybe even an hour this adds up until you cant really login anymore during night etc basically loosing a dayso i propose for us who jump daily to reduce it to 23h to compensate for thisof course reducing it to even less woud make eve a more flexible and elastic place
while i get what your sayingi have trouble understanding why an hour less than the usual timer would make a big differencedowntime is only 30 minsso stop the evemail spam
hes saying it leads to timezone creep for the jump timerday 1 log in at 1155 activate at 1200day 2 log in at 1200 activate at 1215day 3 log in at 1300 activate at 1305day 4 log in at 1155 cannot activate until 1306day 5 log in at 1200 cannot activate until 1307there is no way to nudge it back down to your original time without skipping an entire day so if ccp wants people to be able to jump once per day it really should be down to 23h or 2330 timeri dont really have this problem myself but it seems like an obvious usability fix  this is not so much a disadvantage as it is a bit silly and annoying
how or what is causing this time zone creepnever had this issue myselfbut then this may be a euro thing or something no offense intended stop the evemail spam
do the opposite increase it to 28 hours so that jumping daily isnt a viable option

they only pay taxes if they shoot npcs correct they dont pay taxes if it is a person mining market toon logistics  freighters  ect many people use npc corps to get around war decs is my point and not all of them pay those taxes you use an excuse
thanks for the support
good point i am curious how much a wardec would be against a capped out corp i do think it should take into account how many members the attackers have though as far as the cost vs a huge corp
ok well instead of forcing people in wardecs have people pay a mandatory monthly tax fee for being in an npc corp  tax missionbounty make them pay for being in the npc corp in the first place almost like a station office rental fee for player corps

there are more caldari turret bonused ships than there are gallente drone bonused shipsin short theres more to caldari than farming l4 missions with tengus the naga is currently a popular and useful pvp ship with missiles it would be almost useless
 umm what damage dealing isnt their job they have only token weapon systems as they do just fine at bubblinginfinipointing if they were doing decent dps theyd have to have compromised somewhere on the interdictor part of their descriptionwhat analysis you threw up a list of ships that are hybrid bonused vs those that have missiles and then declared that the naga should be missile bonused based on that rather than oh let me think here ah yeah being a good shipyou have no shortage of structure bashers available including the blasterrail naga in fact
the only reason you dont see caldari dictors fitting missiles is due to using up all their powergrid on tank modules i want to be able to fit the weapons systems those ships have bonuses for while still being able to perform the role adequately dps doesnt even come into it i dont really care about the dps i just want to be able to fit the weapons in the first placei am not arguing that all i am saying is that i want to have the option of using torps on the naga
wow this thread still goingi think its safe to assume that the naga wont be getting missiles anytime soonpersonally i think the naga is a kickass ship with blasters
if its an onyx  its really not that hard to fit if its a flycatcher  fitting weapons to it is a waste of money anywayso basically you want to open up a potential balance nightmare and take up dev time because you want a different graphic while shooting a structureyeah thats an awesome justification
this is a huge issue for me and probably prospective players in general but i dont feel like going on and on right now so here it is nice and simplecombat is over way to quicklywhen you see advertisements for eve you think big nasty epic battles in space but all you get ispopnew players want to get into combat and old 00 players want people to come in so they can blow them up but the game right now outright discourages players from participating especially newer playerswhy because combat right now consists of toggling on all the things asap then something blows upin secondsit is devastatingly underwhelming even pvp videos on youtube are just poppoppop pve is over before it starts too there is no time to make use of half the stuff you can fit on your shipsno time to attempt to use maneuvering to get an advantageno time to appreciate whether or not what you fit on your ship is even helping or hurtingit never even feels like youre in combat there literally isnt even time to give it lets contrast the current combat vs what it should be in my mindcurrentplayer1 enters lowsec looking for trouble gets lucky and starts a 1v1 vs player2 in same ship classplayer1 blows up 60if lucky seconds later player 1 is unhappy and devastatingly underwhelmed all that making isk fitting his ship and traveling for thatplayer2 is glad he won but also devastatingly underwhelmed all that making isk fitting his ship and traveling for thathow it should beplayer1 blows up after a several minute fight in which he had time to do things and stuff while getting into the fight receiving a nice adrenalin rush player1 is sad he lost but was entertained and has some plans for the next fight based on what he just sawplayer2 is pumped because he just won a drawn out battle decided on the battlefield as opposed to popping a little bubble in space in 60 seconds in a situation where the outcome was decided before the fight startedfix ships need more hit points all the way up to battleships a 1v1 battleship fight should be 10min in my mind battleships should be tanked by defaultfrigates feel more like fighters right nowits a messi am not entertainedi just want real drawn out and strategic fights not sometimes or in special circumstances all the timei actually just watched part of the presentation from the fanfest and saw previews of ship damage and shield effects the sad thing is my immediate thought was youll never get to enjoy those in game because those clips were actually longer than a fight lasts in eve 90 of the time
frigate fights tend to be very short and very brutal but fights with larger ships do tend to take awhile to come to a conclusion so i am guessing youve been on the wrong end of a gank or twoalso people need to kill fast in eve the reason for this is that the guy you are shooting and beating has probably got a billion buddies burning to you so its never really a good idea to hang around especially in low secive always rather enjoyed fights in frigates it would be boring as hell if you gave everything a million hp and had to spend an hour grinding down a frigate i think you should learn a bit more about the game before you make proposals that arent needed or wanted as the sub capital ships are fine for the most part

ive said for the past 34 years that logistics are a huge issue in game since theres very little about logistical warfare that promotes strategic combat so ive devised a way to keep the intent of logistics but boost active tanking and determine more about fitting decisionsthe 2 big problemscurrently active tanking has little role in the game everything in game is buffer with no incentive to fit active tank modules logistics are odd in their performance as they require no skill for the person receiving the logistics other than a timely requestso how would i change the conceptremove the direct transfer of armor and shields from logistics to receiver instead call it a nanobot armor or plasma shield transfer system heres how it works in order to utilize logistics i must have an active repair system on my ship a small armor repairer can receive the equivalent of a small armor transfer amount per module per cycle obviously it can have multiple remote repair modules working at once and each module can transfer more armor but no one remote armor transfer can send more than what the small repairer can receive however my active repairer must actually apply the transfer meaning a cycle time and application essentially the logistics shipsmods boost the performance of my repairer within respect to my ship size however i must have the capacitor and the cycle time to apply the repairthe same works for shield how do you prevent stockpiling logistics repairs on a ship over time its always cycle based so whatever logistics support you got during that cycle is applied for armor its applied at the end of the cycle for shields you always get that initial base boost then collect plasma during the cycle time to be used on the next boost why is this better there are going to be obvious gaps in repairs since its only your active repairers that apply no more consistent unbreakable stream of repairs but rather questions of can you out damage the cycle of repairit also means there are ways to break up logistics networks besides just eccmthe active repairer takes up a slot that would normally be dedicated to buffer tankwhy is this needed combat over the past few years has devolved quite a bit to very lopsided affairs far to often fights are skewing so badly that its frequently true for one side to hardly take any losses 510 in a fight where 100s of ships are on either side it develops a sense of hopelessness when one side can be so logistically strong that you cant break the chain of their ships and fights devolve to bring more people the goal is to provide more ways to break up and reduce logistical efficiency bring back some incentive and reasons to fit active repairers and reduce the very large buffers a lot of ships fitting im probably going to heavily refine this idea as i think more about it and see reply but the overall goal is to make combat less about that initial alpha strike to overwhelm a logistics team and more about tactical decisions and adjustments in real time
hey im downan interesting idea but alas im sorry but i disagreefirst off there is the fitting issues several ships are designed to be used in a fleet consider for example the abaddon a ship that isnt meant to fit an active tank which is why it gets 5 armor resist bonus then consider say a hyperion which does get an active tank bonus  a ship you rarely see in fleets for exactly that reason youd have to change several ships to really make this workin addition many fleet ships already have capacitor issues and by further increasing the reliance on an active tank as well  you will just end up with everyone fitting way more cap drain on their fleet ships and rolling out bhaalghornsin addition logistics ships can happily be countered by more than just ecm cap draining is a real issue if done properly and if they are at range sensor dampening as well as shooting them with good switching shot callingtwo of the logistics only work while cap shared so removing one causes real issues in a fleet and ships like scimitar and oneiros can be jammed by non minmitar ecm racials because they dont typically have fitting space and capacitor for eccm its not hard to do and scimitars themselves are easy to kill if you bring the right tools for the job  ie long range webbing and assault frigates which will happily tear them a new onelogistics are already quite time intensive to train properly in themselves  how many people bother to get logistics vplayers already have skills that effect logistics  both resistances and buffer are defining factors in how successful logistics ships can be in their role so pilot fits and skill points truly matterin terms of a pilot being more active in a repair scenario how many pilots actually overload their hardeners properly when being shot at this changes the repair amount significantly but not all pilots are savvy enough to do it in the heat of battle or in time let alone use nanite repair paste mid combat successfully thats quite a bit of micro management right there when youre also trying to follow shot callingpersonally after flying with rooks and kings i would suggest that bringing more people is not really the solution but looking at tactics that will cause confusion and break how the logistics team work ive seen this happen time and time again there are also clever ways to overload the broadcast stream if you use dps properly shot calling properly quite simply logistics pilots cant keep up but alas most shot calling is fairly rigid and predictablei think the real issue here is tactics and how they are used in fleets most fleets are run in a fairly rigid way which is not how you will break a logistics backed fleet the trouble isnt in the mechanics of eve but in how fleets are working as a team to counter them properlyconsider the historical differences in infantry tactics between the two great wars in the first world war tactics were rigid and inflexible relying on sheer numbers  exactly as you are suggesting and i guess seeing as a way of breaking the oppositionby the end of that war tactics had started to change to small teams of soldiers working in a far more flexible way the tactics of which were evolved in the second world war so that it was no longer about sheer numbers but how small teams worked togetherwe are still in a situation where fleets are run in exactly that same inflexible rigid way to win against logistics you have to think differently than most eve corps and alliances are currently capable ofi would suggest the solution is in adapting how fleet leadership organisation and tactics and brought together in fleets rather than problems with eve itself it is just a matter of fcs and corps evolving which is why eve is so brilliant that it can create this sort of challengethe game is mostly played by men  97 but 40 of them play as women so thats fine  ccp t0rfifrans

instead of forcing people to fit otherwise useless niche enough to be mostly true modules to get some love why not limit the amount of reps a given ship can benefit fromintroduce yet another attribute for ships nanobot adaptabilitydifferentiate it based on hull size obviously meta level ex navy hulls may be better at managing incoming nanobots race and lastly specific hulls fitting an active unit could then signify that the ship is already prepared to funnel bots through its systems thus gaining a bonus to said attributeextra fluff with a separate attribute like that individual ships like the myrm and hype for example can be given a truly unique tank potential  been mantioned a lot that their active bonuses be swapped for incoming rr dittono to forcing specific fits yes to mixing things up

fixed that for you if the story hits the ap cnn or some other mass media outlet let me know
i dont hate the guy i just wish hed not done it so publicly if you go to other forums on mmos etc you find people who think eve is nothing more than a spreadsheet game or that its new player unfriendly persuading them that this isnt true is hard enough without people pointing the finger for other things and the trouble is is that no matter how well the others do or how many things he has done that have improved things which i agree with btw the bad things always seem to take center stage over anything good that is ever achieved the guy is effectively an eve celebrity if anyone else had done that it wouldnt have mattered probably wouldnt even have been noticed
i think you missed my pointthe thing i wanted to make clear in my wall of text poast that i fear may have been missed in my ramblings was that that line is impossible to define in any way and that such definitions are meaningless and would detriment the game rather than help it id like to see every eve player agreeing to some tos wherein they acknowledge that they are entering a true sandbox  anything short of direct threats of physical violence really can and will be said that people are going to say mean terrible offensive things eg  cage etc and that to participate they need to accept that rather than a line id like to see a doorthesandbox  art happens inhere dealing withit is a requirementto participateoaccept ynto enter you gotta accept that this  happens and that youre able to take it like a grown adult

wolodymyr my original example with the geddon and falcon only showed what happened when the latter was to use 1 jammer if you placed a second jammer on the target the combined jam strength of the modules on the target would be cumulative although as stated subject to some diminishing returns to illustrate further if one racial jammer has a strength of 135 then two would have for example 24 while adding another would give an even smaller gainkeep in mind the actual ship and module stats on tq are not designed around my proposed change although if you think about it the change isnt as drastic as some claim all i proposed was a redesign of the mechanic and described what might happen with the current set of data fine tuning the formula diminishing returns ship and module stats etc would of course still be up for tweakingi dont think it would be as urgent to give eccm modules more bonuses whats broken is in my opinion ecm not the counter to it although i do understand your meaningand of course i totally like your low optimal high falloff idea
if ou can stack them then it comes close to the old ecm which was nerfed hard for a good reasonoperation write down all the things check out the list at
i think the ecm is fine the eccm should be need to changewhen the jamming unsuccesfull the eccm would be drop back the jammer effects to jammers
an interesting idea but it would essentially push fw over the edge toward being exactly like nullsecwhile thats not inherently bad it seems wasteful and a shame to start mimicking nullsec since the whole point of faction war was to create a new kind of warfare within the game a lot of people who are ultimately interested in taking sovereignty over space and doing upgrades and having outposts live in nullsec where there are actually resources and etc to merit them taking the effort to build something like that upwwwgamerchicknet gamerchick42
were not talking about tcussbus those can be absolutely miserable they can be ninjaed they can be sniped and i really dont wish that on anyone you originally complained about 8 hours not being enough time for people to react and form up for a response this addresses that and you still arent happy with it how would you innovate timers and system hand offs in lowsec for factional warfarewhat would your alternatives be
i originally looked in it and said yes i love this then i stopped and thought about it for a while and realised the best thing about it was the 24 hours to get your stuff out i fly in fw i want consequences for ownership but i hate the idea of a system being flipped while i sleep and then being locked out ccps current proposal while more convoluted than this would work imo as long as there is a brief window to get your stuff out after a system flips
good idea except for one partit turns fw basically into nullsec style structure bashing something many fw pilots are really trying to get away from also the firepower required to efficiently take over a station would attract a guaranteed hotdropmuch better to make the system ownership depend on the fw guys shooting ships of their opponents the one thing they care about the most i think a more incursion style of crowdsourcing to claim a system would work much better with fleets competing at sites to claim them like now happens at vanguards except with fw you can shoot each other as well and with a 2030 pilot momsite at the end to make the final claimit would also help against blobbing because oversized fleets you would just get no lp for the site like with incursions and oversized ships for the small sites just cant get inthe idea of fwonly stations is brilliantwith tons of benefits to its stationservices well defended by npc and ownership depending on whoever controls the system if the system flips the pilots have 24 hours to get their stuff outoperation write down all the things check out the list at
it does nothing of the sort nothing when you lose an outpostsystem in nullsec you are completely  and inable to live in that system whatsoever until your blob alliance retakes it if they ever do in the proposed system the owning of the outpost simply gives the owning militia an advantageous position from which to continue the effort of war and death in that system and systems nearby by providing a relatively safe beneficial location to dock up that the enemy cant touch it doesnt stop the enemy docking elsewhere in system basing their ships elsewhere in system getting repairs or staging from that system like it would in nullsec this just gives you a clear immediate and tangible benefit in the form of free repairs taxfree market transactions and free cloning among others in a station that is harder to camp by turds with instalocking arty tornados of which i am one as for the structurebashing this already exists and there really isnt any fair way to do it by giving these garrisons a reinforcement timer it at the very least allows the defending militia time to prepare a fleet ops militias love timing fleet ops because often fighting in militia is an irritating quagmire of random people being on at random times knowing the system will become vulnerable in 12 or 24 hours gives you time to plan accordingly and put together some impressive defense fleets that we currently almost exclusively get during pos attacks which are boring as hell it also means a system cant be turned in 78 hours by a handful of dedicated people with too much time on their hands which is currently the case to expand on the idea you can keep the current plexing mechanics of constant plexing causing the systems sov to deteriorate until a certain point is reached in which the owning npc empire begins to pull out of the system after taking too many losses and the garrison outpost goes into a 24hour timer after which point the enemy militia may assault and incap it turning the system itd be up to the defending militia as the last line of defense to stop this from happening the notorious zv
exactly what i want if possible i think easyer would be as i said in another thread maybe as a first step or try out one station for each militia locked for the oponent and neutrals maybe camped by the occupancyholders npc officers or station guns
the ccp presenter eluded to changing the station makeup in the warzones to accomplish this which i like i also like the idea of having the stations that change hands to be militiaonly that would be a tremendous asset to the holding militia and make them a rally point especially if the station guns shoot all nonmilitia ships maybe that will be a system upgrade if neutrals can dock both militia and nonmilitia will exploit it yes you run the risk of getting ships trapped in them but that adds excitement and meaning to the fighting if they keep enough nonmilitia npc stations around it shouldnt have a drastic effect on neutral gameplay however i think they should drop two constellations from the caldari side and at least one from the gallente side to reduce the implications on the cluster
there seems to be two sides to this one that wants nullsecesque consequences and one that doesntthe timer mechanics themselves allow for engagements like hotdrops bubblecages etcif you look at the original comment in the op this is the original guy who presented the ideaccps goal was to force egagements confict and player vs player interaction i think zvs idea is fantastic
i dont like this idea because this idea means that anyone can attack the outposts regardless of whether the attackers are involved in fw this would only be a loss for fw as one of the problems with fw and lowsec in general is outside much larger entities coming in this disheartens younger players who are in fw to learn pvpi like the idea of flipping fw sov on systems with points because it means that people have to be directly involved in fw to make a difference
additional to docking rights for the militia stations why not
this is far too complicated for the general militia population myself included it needs to be quite a bit simplerwhat i envision being one of the best alternatives is having a capture system that is a merging of the current method incursions and nullsec sovereignty systems are made vulnerable the same way they are now more or less by plexing plexing should also give an lp reward when a system becomes vulnerable it initiates a vulnerability timer of 12 or 24 hours when this occurs an incursionlike process happens a sovereignty bar is used to show the scales of power in the system defending npc military incursion reinforcement sites appear the attacking militia must run these incursionreinforcement sites with fleets every reinforcement site completed tips the sov level of the system in their favour they should get a good bit of lp for running these sites that lp should only go to members of the attacking militia never neutrals this can be made even more interesting by having a final big boss battle where a defending npc military carrier jumps in the defending militia can defend the system by disrupting the fleet ops of the attackers with their own fleet or even just slowing them down enough that the initial 12hour vulnerability timer runs out before the attacking militia can run enough reinforcement sites if the attackers are ultimately successful this triggers another 12hour timer at the end of which sovereignty fully switches to their faction this is to give a bit of flexibility for people to evac their  the current bunker is replaced by a garrison this is an outpostlike station it can even take the exact same location literally replacing it it should have the standard lowsec complement of 2 sentry guns that will shoot enemy militia and pirates but not neutrals the outpost will only allow members of the owning militia to dock  no neutrals and especially no wts this outpost may or may not allow the docking of capital ships this outpost will provide owning militia with reduced costfree repair clone and job services as well as lowno tax market transactions these services can also be subject to any lp donation upgrade system all of this is broadcast in either the militia interface or the journal or both also vulnerability and sov changes should be broadcast in militia channels this imho provides the most allround buff to fw first plexers gonna plex  plexing fanatics can continue their diligent prowling of enemy space in faction frigs circling those stupid little buttons and feeling the selfgratification of making a system contested and vulnerable second it gives the defending militia a chance to organize some sort of defense however it also gives the attacking militia the chance to blitz a system by running those reinforcement sites fullthrottle before the defenders can organize a good counterops but that should take some effort imho a single basic 20ish man bsbc fleet should take 68 hours unmolested to run enough sites to turn the system more fleets  faster less fleets  slower third it gives an incentive to doing this in the first place  a big lp reward for members of the attacking militia involved fourth it gives owning militias a real tangible and immediate benefit to owning a system in the form of the garrison outpost an awesome little place to stage fleets get logistics support and disseminate cheaper market items to your militia fifth it provides adequate risk to that reward by possibly locking you out of your stuff should the system fall but not a total and complete catastrophe like it is in nullsec  you still have the npc stations in system you can put your stuff in just without the benefits of a much safer and more beneficial harbour you wont ever find your little garrison outpost bubbled and the system locked down with hundreds of enemies get yourself an instawarp and you can more or less safely shuttle any ship out of there  except capitals but im for not letting them dock there in the first place
if fw is to be taken seriously then when an enemy comes into a system that is owned by a faction the pilot should not be able to dock in station it just makes sense all others however should be able toi love the idea of having the hub in addition to the station as it gives a focus for the invaders and something of intrinsic value to take down it also gives the militia of the system their own station to do with as they please for the duration of their ownership this makes it a valuable asset to protect no taxes manufacturing slots clone bays etc each of these are either added via time of ownership or given all in one go by just taking the system though i prefer earning it via ownership in time increments if you had to shoot every station in system to own the system then amamake may as well be permanently minmatar as no one in their right mind would want to shoot that many stations everi agree that it is a bit of 00 and i dont mean fw to be 00 light there are however elements of 00 that can and could be implemented in low sec and be made funother ideas that could be implemented is that local chat favours the defender in that intelligence tools radar satellites gate personnel etc can forward information to the fw hub and be distributed to the system defenders its not meant to be easy to take a system but once you have earned it it should be fun and profitable to hold these hubs should be free of nonfw personnel as well as defended like a deathstar pos to avoid camping of the exits anyone that fires on fw personnel within station area get scrammed webbed and shot at depending on defenses these defenses perhaps should also be earned over time hold the system for 60 days and you earn more turrets in minmatar systems or lasers in amarr systems station can be of jovian design so that it has a bit more cache to hold itanyways just a few ideas

what you mean a reason to not refine tagswhere will all my minerals come from then
ive had an idea along these lines in my head for a long time but could not find the right words to express iti think the whole pve system should be more dynamic like what courthouse here is suggesting so that the eve universe will more like an ecosystem in constant flux and less likely to reach a point of stasis where nothing evolves and meaningful content ceases to emerge
i like this idea but this is going to create a situation that ccp have already taken action to remove dynamic payouts sounds like an idea that will encorage people to move around but will that actualy happen or will other factors that goven where players chose to run their missions take precidence putting us back to where we were with agent qualitynot so long ago agents all had a quality rating that effected rewards and most of the highest rating agents where not in high sec people still stuck where they were safe despite the finantual incentive so to get people out of high sec is going to require a prity servear profit curveaccess to trade hubs to sell salvage and buy supplies proximity to players established hording stations and corperate obligations are all factors that goven where people chose to run their missions as well all of those are going to limit player willingness to follow the profit as well so even within safe space i think people may just stick to where they areso if people stubbenly stick to their haunts as i suspect they will this will reduce the isk constantly injected into the system but not realy get people mooving so muchas people wont be mooving we will be prity much back to where we were with agent quality though as ccp already got rid of that are they going to want to bring it back
i had wanted to stay away from posting numbers in the op as im not a game designer and people who are smarter at maths than me can do that better but a decent example would be to use a 20 distribution so lets say for example that guristas are the 1 most botted popular faction to shoot they would pay out at 80 of a normal bountymission rewardlp lets also say that mordus legion is the least popular option their stuff would pay out at 120 of normalthat would mean that mordus agent was 50 more profitable to run than a caldari navy guristas faction nemesis agent that would be a pretty significant difference and when youre looking at things that may disincentivise botting having rats worth a lot less than moving elsewhere potentially to a place that players can potentially police better than motsusobaseki is good for everyone

noob  maybe you moronwho talking about game mechanics  this is crying from an afk cloaker who want to hear when his ship uncloaked when he not at his computer crocodile tears
when i read the title of this thread i thought it was a simplerdifferent proposal im not against the idea you proposed but if your have your overview arranged by closest it shouldnt really be a problemi think there should be some kind of alarm though to notify you that you have been decloaked though often if i end up warping into a bubble there is some confusion as to whether or not i am decloaked and often warping away from combat to a belt will leave me decloaked and i wont notice warping back and sitting there like an idiot whilst someone blows me up isnt fun usually raging at the time i was cloaked how the f did this happen an alarm that goes off when you have been deloaked would definitely be useful proximity alarm might be useful but it would have to be something you have the option to customize or turn off if needed like the shieldarmorstructure alarms1 supportededit also for those of you who thinks this has anything to do with going afk whilst cloaked your an idiot if your safe up and cloak no one is every going to be in proximity to you ever you guys are crying n00b about this topic but it is obvious to me that it is you who are the n00bsin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
yeah unless youre an absolute moron afk cloaking should never bring you ongrid with something that can uncloak you much less 2 km away
i dont know about you but i see my cloak module stop running immediately ive never had to wonder whether i was cloaked or not
i do hate afk cloakers that said1 for opnot knowing if you are cloaked or not is a bad feedback from the interfaceand that green flashy light well  try to determinate if you are cloaked or hit the cloak button if you are in a 10 tidi system good luck dissonance is recruiting members
if youre warping into a combat situation and you arent certain of the status of your cloak you arent paying close enough attention you will typically have ten seconds or more of time in warp to make sure your cloak is engaged if youre blindly stumbling about making assumptions about your ships operations you earned your lossesi frequently multibox a pair of cloaky pvp ships i maneuver them both in close proximity of targets decloak them and engage the enemy with very little trouble im still getting the hang of catching two ships on ambush but thats just going to take experiencea simple voiceover of cloaking failed used both when a cloak didnt active and when it was forcibly deactivated wouldnt bother me too much it wont help afk cloakers much mostly because theyre afk but also because theyre going to be in a safe spot where the only way cloaking could fail is if someone bumped them by the time they were able to respond theyd be dead
heres how i would balance the titans remove any bonus to xl guns they can fit them but theyll do average dps keep the logistics clone vatsetc and leadership bonus this should be the titans primary role have the doomsday consume ammo not just oxygen  actual ammo thatll take several weeks to research and manufacture have diminish returns on doomsday depending on how many titans are in fleet prevent more than one doomsday per 5 minutes from being fired in the grid add drone bandwith to field fightersa single titan providing logistics and leadership to a capsubcap fleet is greatbut too many titans in the same space should hampers their effectiveness you only need one for leadership
i agree with this

let me explain assume i jump 1900 in the eveing every dayi wont be able to do this on the minute so it creeps back in time by 515 minutes every day sometimes even longerso at some point i am only able to jump at midnight or later or not at all because i am asleep basically missing one dayso in order to jump consistently every day the cooldown needs to be 23hi would love to have it even shorter but i guess that wishful thinking
so if im getting this clearlythe cause of the time creep is your inability to schedule your play timesorrynot supporting stop the evemail spam
if i get what youre trying to say if you try to clone jump when you come of work school what ever at say 1730 and need to jump you loose some time login in and jumping  after some days youre avatar availability to clone jump is delayed for a considerable timeshorting the clone jump time availability for a bit makes sense as it would give you time to catch up with youre rl schedule  1
agreed this would get my vote
that is a matter of opinionshrugi was bored when i joined this thread i want one seems as good a justification as any
its a squishy high priority target that can put out token dps at best and doesnt need weapons at all to do its job not really an opinion more like common sense if a ship has1 a very high chance of dying2 no actual use for said weaponsthen fitting them does indeed seem like a bit of a waste
amarr lasers minmatar projectiles gallente drones  hybrids caldari missiles  hybrids amirite
primarysecondaryamarr lasersmissilesminmatar projectilesmissilesgallente hybridsdronescaldari missileshybridsi think this is slightly more accurate
its not that simple for caldari missiles and hybrids are far more equal in importance relative to the two weapon lines of any other race where theres a clear primary and secondary divisonswith caldari there are entire lines of hybrid and missile boats and arguably a third of ewar boats
the talos uses hybrids and has a small drone baythe naga cannot use missiles but it used to in the test server phase  it would make perfect sense to be able to use missiles besides hybrids and it would add more interest to the ships and you would expect the caldari tier 3 battlecruiser to use the guns that made caldari famous for the missile launchersand wile youre at it all new tier 3 bcs should have a small drone bay anyway not just the talos
just throwing this out there if the naga is such a perfect hybrid boat y do i never see any in sov space i mean i see a lot of drakes so would it not say that there are a lot of naga capable pilots or do these drake pilots not like the nagaoh and thanks for all the posts p
with t3s having induction nullifier subsystems making them immune to bubbles this gives them at a huge advantage over covopts at scouting i propose that covert opts frigates not bombers be given an immunity to bubbles as well this idea came from watching fanfest where ccp said t3s shouldnt do a better job then their t2 equalivents
good post it makes sense that a ship designed purely for scoutingprobing should have some advantage over t3s that are customized with with subsystems to provide this role as well as heavy tackle or other cloaky reconswhat you said falls inline with what was talked about at fanfest in the ship balancing presentationid like to see this happen as other ships at this time can do a better job than a ship designed for this purpose
personally i would prefer the removal of the interdiction nullifier subsystem or to have it modification to allow a skillbubble strength modified chance of it failing to counteract the effects of a bubble rather than the buffing of covert ops frigates
youd have to remove it outright to make it less effective a scout than a scout shipeither that or give a covops a unique bonus to scouting and force recon a similar bonusi would suggest  not showing up in local or showing up unidentified in local
making cov ops frigs minus bombers imune to bubbles would be a neat thingcov ops frigs are the worst combat capable ship in their linefor obvious reasonsnot exactly a bad ideabut im a bit hesitant to throw my hat in for the mere fact that its hard enough to catch the buggars stop the evemail spam
they should give that to all t2 cov ops ships as to local that shouldnt be a cov ops only thing everyone should be removed from local chat regardless of ship type
this pretty much exactly mirrors my own feelings though i would say that calling covops combat capable is using the loosest possible definition of the term
you can fit weapons on thembut doing so is like begging to get podded by your corp stop the evemail spam
so in order to address the fact that t3 are broken and need revision you want to break the covops as well nullifier was a bad idea to begin with it might have had merit if it came with insane drawbackswhy the pure null bias covops are used everywheremake it interesting read useful everywhere insteadrolebonus 100 bonus to capacitor use and strength of ecm burst modulesgives you a very good chance of escaping your bubbles can be used to mess up enemies in general suicide but if a whole gangfleet can be saved  and gives us all a handycloaked flashbang grenade to toss around
their vision for t3s is so far away from reality its a joke lol at more flexible but not better than t1 or t2
ccp already did this years ago as zircon poetically stated they raised the hp of ships by 50 and what ended up happening was buffer tanking became vastly preferred over active tanking because you had more hp to work with and max out blobs got bigger andor gankier to compensate for all the extra ehp they had to punch through active tanking then became almost obsolete outside of solo combat because gangs over a certain size could alpha an active tanked ship far more easily than a buffer fit one people continued to die pretty fast ie none of what was actually intended with the hp buff came true
ehp is already high enough ive had enough of this stupid drakescimi bullshitjust goddamn tank your hulk you 
i find battles that last for a few minutes get old really quick the adrenaline rush of a 10 second quick death frigate dual is amazing with a fight lasting for a minute or more i find it falls off pretty quickly like lasers
the oper obviously doesnt know the first thing about pvpfirstly if you draw pvp out it will mean that you cant roam looking for trouble because help will be at hand whenever you attack someone in their home system numbers plays too big of a role in pvp as it is drawing pvp out would only make it worsepvp in eve is similar to how combat is in real life its about knowing when to and when not to commit to an engagement the result of most pvp is decided well before any of the mods are even turned on its about information gaining using your scanner deception knowing the ships youl be fighting and their strengths and weakness knowing what range to engage at knowing the environment your fighting in and knowing when to fight and when to fleeif you think pvp is about firing your guns and turning your mods on and hoping then youve missed the point entirelyi believe that these facts arnt highlighted to newer players well enough if new players were taught in the tutorial how to navigate low sec space in a safer manner and how to choose engagements then we wouldnt have this issue so much all the new players i ever talk to spend all their time worrying about how they dont have enough skill points or how they wont be good in pvp because they cant fly a battleship and daft notions like theseeducate people on how to pvp dont change the pvpin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

i support hinkledolphs proposal
i like this post
supporting this idea
well according to ccplooks like they followed through and took action on this particular subject matteri suspect this will likely spill over to tos documentation and suchif not further renforcement of policesjust an fyi for those who care about the idea and not the who
while i think its pathetic that the mittani is being made into a poster boy for the ugly side of eve even after he realized that he crossed a line and has made amends the situation begs the question as to why so many players in eve feel the need to be such complete asses its an internet space ship game when did it become who can be the bigger  in space the apparent urge to one up each other in the free use of any racial and or sexual slur imaginable the stupidly immature harvesting of tears does little to dispel the notion that eve is nothing more than an online reservation for the chronically badly behaved what is the point as eve players we seem to be making up for bad game design with even worse manners at the end of the day something is wrong when the scoreboard is populated by how miserable you can make another human being from behind the anonymity of an online game avatar and as long as that culture dominates eve will never be anything but a fringe galaxy with some pretty nebulae that having been said i hope the goons and others keep up all their nefarious content creation maybe they can just do it with a bit less crudeness im off to get my marshmallows i hear jita is going to burn 
i dont think this is much of a tos problem as it is just a general problem of the alliance panel acting like douchebags in general and being drunk with among other things poweri see their role at fanfest as volunteers and representatives of the community at large they dont just reflect back into the community they spill out into the world outside of eve fanfest is monitored by a number of mmo hubs youtube already has the whole footage of the event and these drunks represented usthe sad part is that most of them probably couldnt care less the eve uni rep was fantastic after that it slowly devolved into what ended up being the most revered player in eve drunkenly mocking other playersi sure am glad i have such stellar representatives of what eve is all abouti will rise to dreams of freedom and avow to return the treason that came under your reign
do i agree with miners being the main resource of minerals  yes do i agree with you being able to carebear for free and get more profit from that than doing something real  not so muchso idk if this will happen
if you add outposts as an alternative to getting your stuff locked out under the system that was talked about at fanfest militias would still base out of the normal currently exsisting stations anyway
nobody is going to base out of an outpost we might use it to rep up though so in that sense it would be valuable for the defender

the issuewhen some is logging to get another char online he has to put in the data for each restartet client this becomes very annoying when you for example have to swicth between cyno or miner chars on the same accountthe proposalinstead of login in with the client we should login with the launcher there should be a list of all accounts with username pw and for every account a button to start the client when you start the pc you fill in the login data and start your clients with the respective button when you switch between alt chars close the client and start a new one without logging in every time because the launcher has you already authenticateda more elegant solution buta more elegant solution would be a swicth to an alt char without restarting a client but this has obviously some technical disadvantages i blame ccp so this wont work in the near future

the more i think about this the more a notification about cloaking failure seems like a good idea people are in one of two boatsthe first say watching your cloak isnt a problem the second say it is if it isnt a problem for you then adding a cloaking failure voice isnt going to make any difference to you in which case you have no reason to object to this being added if it is a problem then you want it added there doesnt really seem to be any reason why not to and plenty of why tothis is essentially one of the paper cut changes ccp talk about a small change that will add some depth and make the use of cloaks more intuitive in the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

once the tracking issue is fixed do you think that titans capital weapons will still be broken they do still need to be able to kick the crap out of a dread if we are following the subcaps  capitals  supercapitals logic why make this changethis would still limit bridges to alliances that can afford a titan unless of course this was in addition to ccp adding a cheaper option for a bridging shipmaking the doomsday consume fuelammo isnt a bad idea its just that the cost of such should not be made into a balancing factor having it take a long time to produce said ammo wont really stop the production of multiples at once so i dont see the point in thatit would probably be simpler to just rebalance the super weapon than to implement this change so i would suggest that we start therethis sounds like too much bridging of the roles to me i would not be in favor of this change especially since titans just had their drones removed
i agree with purging inactive trial accounts that have been inactive for a large amount of timethese accounts are generally people who tried the game and decided for whatever reason that they were not interested in continuing i have also heard of people who decided that they had used too much of their trial time training the wrong skills and made another trial to start overclearing out the abandoned accounts will free up server space and a lot of names tldr  1 trials onlyunit xs365bt designated communications officer unit commune

so after all this mess the end result is that a huge mass will remain with their voices unheard in the next council even if ccp wont adimit that this rendered the council totally not representative of the playerbaseand that will happen just because theres no logic system in place to replace someone that opt out his positiontaking the next in line is not the best method and leaving the position unattended like ccp wants is even worsein real life elections usually a candidate has a vice a seccond in line that supports his views and standings and is able to carry on his work in case the worst happensthe proposal i put forward tot he csm is simplelet from now on the candidates to csm appoint a vice should anything happen this vice would be able to step forward keeping the representative system intact and thus not disregarding the will of the voters who chosed one candidate over other
the existing process is democratic using firstovertheline in order of votes just because your alliance blocvoted for a candidate who selfdestructed doesnt make the process nonrepresentative you as a bloc could nominate two or three candidates and vote them in thus you would not have all of your representation eggs in one candidate basket
hello all im succub while chatting in the caldari provisions corp chat an idea for adding some really nice terraineffects came up simply put it is implementation of terrainsubstitutes such as solar flares radiation fluxes and etc some of this can be seen in the recon mission where the environment deals damage to the ship at intervals and to complete you have to tank it and run for the gateso that is the mechanic which is already present in the game the implementation could be focused on creating actual terrainsubstitutes which would add another dimension to eve and i think one that everyone would come to appreciate and enjoy if and only if it were implemented with the levelplayingfield principle at all stagesrandom solar flares could be used to intrude on the the environment and create opportunities for advanced gameplay such as sneeking and peeking around storms in a system which itself is known for its many storms im suggesting addition of such wellknown phenomena that occur in real space rs sneeking and peeking around an environmental feature which is in fact a terrainsubstituteits very flexible and apparently already exists in game just needs to be tweeked to provide the terrainsubstitute effect im trying to describeso here is a copy of the chat convo see what you all can add to it succub  hi all so how many sciecefiction starwarsdefense suggestions have we got from the fanfest any drunklaid ccp types coming up with anything good eurus ingram enaka  lol succub  nice weather were having today looks like  spacesuccub  be nice to have a few random solar flares and cosmic storms interfering once in a while be more immersivesuccub  losing tgt lock because of solar flares good ideatdz15  ooaleks81 goblin     174651 veni4ek     174656 veni4ek  174658 eurus ingram enaka  or suddenly having your ship knocked out for a few second during a magnetic storm174712 tdz15  bad idea d174807 reiterpallasch  more like annoying174900 succub  if it happened to everyone at once aincluding whoever else is there then it might be a way to add some real fun think of what wud happen with everyone not able to fight for 10 secs174921 tdz15  thatll be fun xd174922 succub  oh sit solar flare 174951 tdz15  when the storm is over all lock on to the biggest threat d175005 eurus ingram enaka  or flee if youre getting destroyed175013 tdz15  locks on to shuttle175024 reiterpallasch  id only accept that if radiation shielding modules became available175033 eurus ingram enaka  that t3 amarr shuttle is deadly bro175104 succub  yes shielding on ships and mods  also thought maybe a weather forecast for systems some systems have more than others175154 succub  some systems you have to sneek and peek around the storms adding terrain effects to the game175305 succub  just a thought ill shut up now 175322 tdz15  keep it comming175327 tdz15  sounds interesting d175500 succub  or maybe we cud have sneeking and peeking around planets but i think the storms for terrainsubstitute is better much more flexible ok now ill hush up175736 vendash  doesnt sound to bad175816 vendash  gives small haulers a nice bit of help in low sec 180015 succub  hiding in a solar flarestorm i dunno i actually kinda liike it also after thinking abt it180105 vendash  opens up new fleet tactics all around aswell180127 vendash  lure a fleet into a storm or hide backups in a storm you cant scan in180132 succub  it wud be important to make sure the effects evebd out over time meaning if my tgt gets away today cause of it them i will get away tomorrow because of it it has to be applied equally to even out180257 vendash  hmm180303 vendash  makes sense180417 l3aal  there are no things such as a storm in space 180421 l3aal   just radiation180536 reiterpallasch  you could have dust clouds that mask the presence of ships within sorta like in homeworld 2180631 notagood negotiator  yo reiter you play armored core180655 reiterpallasch  yes180659 eurus ingram enaka  180707 notagood negotiator  high five hahahaa180712 reiterpallasch  youre like the first person to notice180719 eurus ingram enaka  loltyps  i started to remove the timestamps but too much trubble sry
interesting but wouldnt that warrant that things like los be implemented as welli mean everything on the grid is fair play and can be targeted ans shot no matter if theres a station or other objects in between to sneak and peek players would have to be unaware of the others presence wich the overview would spoilnow the other things are interesting like a hidding place in system or disrutive fenomena that would interfere on the playfieldit would be interesting if a fleet could also chose a better terrain position like positioning it in a place of less interference so the attacked would be at a disavantage  like more interrupts
so much derp here im not even sure where to start
sigh this argument may be old but it still standsthe caldari invented and primarily use railguns as their turret systemthe gallente invented and primarily use blasters as their turret systemthe tier 3 battlecruisers were all meant to be large turret equipped battlecruisersthere is no anticaldari bias here everything is working as intended a couple of notes on lore as that was touched upon earlieryes the caldari favoured one man fighters over the larger more cumbersome ships used by the federation navythe federation began to research drones which started out as basically little more than rudimentary ai controlled bombs in response the caldari began to upgrade their fighters both sides upgrading their respective technologies over the course of the war until the drones used by the federation were almost up to hobgoblin standard and the one man fighters used by the caldari had evolved into the first generation of caldari frigateson a related note the federation has many lumbering slow ships in my experience the domi mega and hype are all slower than a simillarly fitted ravenanyways to cut a long story short railgun ships work well when youre skilled up for them and the 5 second reload cycle makes them even more effective the naga is a good ship even without giving it torps or cruise missiles while it may mean that caldari pilots have the same miss chance as the other 3 races i dont see that as an issueeva yang seeing many drake pilots does not in any way mean that there will be many naga pilots that is like saying you can fly a cruise misile raven really well so you should be able to do just as well in a rokh  see where that logic failsunit xs365bt designated communications officer unit commune

you may love this idea you may hate this idea but do please read and think before you reply perhaps a new system is needed one much like jury duty might be called for one where you are called on to play your part for the communitya simple system is all that is needed where you may or may not accept the roleeveryone who is interested registers and is placed on a live rosteryou must be an active player in the game for more than 2 years to register for the live rosterthe standing csm panel place all names from the live roster in a hat a draw is made until all places are filledthis way we get a more balanced systema better mix of csm membership from the player base cannot be ignoredenough of this virtual political bs the csm should not be about virtual political gobshites who think they are president of some ones and zerosthe csm should be about bringing forward the players concerns nothing moreno flames please iUFFFDve been flame resistant for a long while now so youll be wasting your timethis idea does not mean i am saying the current csm or past did not do a good job its just my thoughts that maybe its time for a new systemthanks for reading
i sort of like this idea i would add some sort of minimum number of endorsements by other players to be eligible for the draw anyone who gets above x votes will get their name in the hat or something like that this way there is some commentary from the playerbase who can be trusted to do the job well but it wont come down to who can get the most people to vote for himher
thats a really stupid idea randomly picking people even people who have put their names in to be on the csm is a horrible way to pick people there are way too many troll csm candidates it would end so badly its sadbesides ive spent enough time dealing with eves rng to know that it delights in screwing over players as best it can lol
those who desire power and high office are precisely the ones who should not hold it so how about we do this and then just randomly pick from the rest of the population
agreedits bad enough we have populairty storm votesnow we add randomization to the mixno thankspass stop the evemail spam
i also agree while i understand your notion that those that seek power are often those that shouldnt have it you method is extremely flawed first the csm doesnt exactly have power but rather priveledge as the release of incarna proved ccp can completely ignore what the csm suggestsproclaimsdemands etc they do have influence as ccp has wisened up some to realize they aught to take the csm suggestions complaints and warnings seriously however the csm doesnt have veto power over anything they only have the ear of ccp secondly if you dont have to be elected then you dont need to put in any work into getting on the csm as such the csm could easily degenerate into a group of people looking to get free tickets to iceland and backstage passes to ccp rather than a group of people dedicating their time to better the game currently most csm members actually put quite a bit of effort into being a csm member and i want that to continue imo the only way to ensure the csms continued efforts is to require a certain amount of effort to become a member with a voting process people first have to convince thousands of people that they deserve to be there and if they dont live up to expectations they wont be reelected any moron with no real understanding of the game mechanics game play and current issues can toss his name into a raffle frankly there needs to be a vetting system to ensure a minimum quality of csm members and who better to vet the candidates than the players of eve
by that logicthat would mean all of the csm canndiates are already vettedim going based on the definition that vetren implies time spent in gameexpierenceagethe issue here is personalityagendamotivesetc stop the evemail spam
im not sure what youre trying to say im not using vetted to imply veteran although that is one defiinition im using to vet as in to appraise to verify to check for accuracy authenticity validity andor ability the csm candidates were vetted by ccp for their eligibility to run and the csm members were vetted by the players through the votes they received so yes i consider all csm members and alternates already vetted i dont consider them all veterans i dont agree with some of their view points and play styles and i dont think they are all ideal candidates to send to ccp however i think the supportvotes they received says there is a sizeable portion of the playerbase that does is our current voting system the best possible method no but its way better than the raffle proposed
then you wont mind if we tell you that your idea is stupid and in no way would it reflect a balanced voice of the players
ermhow is it any different than the current voting systemwe choose to vote whom we wantperhaps more info on the subject stop the evemail spam
i was stating that there needs to be a vetting system inherent to the selection process which the ops proposal completely lacks our current method does that through the voting system i wasnt proposing a new selection method i come from a small nullsec corp that had a csm representative on csms 4  5 and while i think the current csm voting blocks are mostly tilted towards large nullsec alliances i dont think thats necessarily a problem with the system but rather a problem with how candidates gain exposure to voters if youre in a big alliance you share forums you share vent and you have regular contact with a larger amount of people smaller groups have to work much harder to gain the same exposure although the debates the forums and player channels exist to help get your name out there democracy has the most potential for being fair the problem is people in general are ignorant panicky creatures of habbit if there were a method for the cream to rise to the top of the selection process i think it would improve peoples view of the electron processes imo the biggest potential problem with our system is too many candidates can water down the system leaving voting blocks supremely powerful the solutions i can think of1 randomly select x number of candidates out of everyone who applies to appear in the official ccp election this would be a little closer to the op and would still allow the the playerbase to chose the final members at the same point in time i want to be able to reelect candidates that did a good job i want to reward people that put up a good election campaign and i dont really care for a random selection process the at uses a lottery like this to select the initial candidates so the event is manageable 2 have a preliminary voting period where the most viable 28 or so candidates can move on the the official election i dont think we have enough candidates that this is a problem at the moment but if there were 70 candidates for an election of 14 it will be the problem is i dont think ccp wants to spend the extra resources to do this hence the getlikes scheme they attempted also voting blocks will still dominate this process 3 partition the csm into official seats and have candidates run for specific seats rather than for the general csm membership unfortunately dividing the seats into 9 or 14 areas that properly balance the eve playstyles is nontrivial i think this is probably the best method if we start gettting an extreme number of candidates given 9 or 14 seats how many for high sec lowsec nullsec how many for pve vs pvp sov fw wh indy  i think that ccp wisely left this up to the playerbase originally if i were to implement it tomorrow my off the cuff partition would be 3 highsec seats 1x indy pvp pve 3 lowsec seats 1x fw pvp indy 3 nullsec 1x sov indy pvp and 1 wh seat with 4 general election seats let people chose a seat to run for top votes get chair top 9 votes get official csm seats bottom 5 votes get alt seats you can only run for 1 seat and every player would get 1 vote maybe 2 to cast voting blocks could still dominate this process none of these steps are necessary unless we start getting an extreme number of candidates running 40 for 14 places is not all that problematic however its getting up there reallly there just need to be more aware voters and good media sources so people can get exposure to the voters
wow there is a lot of sb hate herethe sb is and never was supposed to be an iwin frigit platform its a pack animal use it alone and it will die run with the wolves and it well never go hungryfrom an rp standpointrp bull bellow read at own riskwhen sleeper tech was first discovered by the empires they tryd all technologically possible ways to integrate the new systems they found unfortunately the current ship designing methods would not allow or even enable them to fit these experimental subsystems to existing ships of the line what was universality decided after many failed tests costing 10s of trillions of isk and millions of navy servicemens lives that a totally new design method was required to make these subsystems a viable asset each of the empires turned to their top research divisions for this answer the result of this was the 4 t3 hulls these base hulls are basically sleeper cruisers with empire paint jobs their electronics and mechanical systems are all unique thus fitting one races modules to another is currently impossible this is not to say that i cant be done its just that the resulting electrical and fluidical feedback would be catastrophic on the front of the interdiction nullifyerit was noted in initial encounters with sleeper craft that they would run from a fight to counter this the navies fielded top of the line interdction ships not currently available to the greater capsuleer community however the sleeper craft would repeatedly jump when affected by this module however when a pod capsuleer from the amarrian millita was met with this problem he decided to to focus all his warp disruption strength on to one target as a result of the pre existing infinipoint the sleeper craft was stopped from exiting the field and disabled for capture  the ammarian empire considered the ability to leave the field of battle un hindered by warp disruption bubbles to be an exceptional advance in this field so naturally kept it to their selvesas we all know there are always greater forces at work in eve and soon this tech was available to all of the empire factionsto date the interdiction nullifieing tech is still in its infancy and no way has been found to reduce its size without uncompromising its unique ability as for any current ships of the line there is still no plausible way for sleeper components to be fitted to themend of rp ducherytldrdont be hating on sbsinterdiction nullifying is a trait unique to a sleeper subsystem its experimental not in wide commercial usethe hardware for this ability is just to big for use on a frigit hull

i agree and disagreei agree that specialised ships should be really really effective compared to versatile shipsi agree that cov ops should get a lot of love such as eafs but then this would make no sense when you bring recons and black ops to the discussion and you have to bring those because they share same mechanicsi disagree why stealth bombers should stay away of the discussion or be excluded from an eventual buff since theyre not much tanky than cov ops they share the same moving abilities and just like recons and black ops they shouldnt stay out of this discussion because if one has more tank than the second they all share the same base purpose gather intell in shadows this is why i like your idea but only if its applied to at least one variant of all t2 ships that share the same mechanics and lets say it this would be a very nice buff to black ops

support opccp please dont let immature children ruin this game if they cant handle a true sandbox with truly free and open interaction with other people they should leave thats the whole point isnt it to make an open environment where player interactions make the world let us make our world
quoteweiland taur when did it become who can be the bigger  in space quoteer isnt it exactly the point of the sandbox eve was designed to be morally ambivalent what are we humans other than a bunch of gigantic douchenozzles when it comes to our fellow man have you seen the news lately the things we do to each other for any reason or no reason is staggeringly brutal and cruelnew eden needs conflict to make us go there conflict implies people are going to be stars   actually typed stars not something that was censored in space the very nature of conflict is the desire to not be nice to one another you cannot have it both ways lets be nice to one another while we shoot each other it doesnt work like that youre not exchanging recipes when youre shooting each other in the facei find myself agreeing with ops post mittens was drunk i mentioned somewhere else that this should be a mitigating factor i still think it was a boneheaded remark but its nothing more than thatif eve attracts more players than the current playerbase were going to see people coming in who have the wrong expectation of the place they will expect to be catered to dont hurt me i got podded in my first hour i was stupid no way was i going to whine about it and have the game mechanic changed so that it could not happen againif new eden turns into the gigantic rubber ball thats world of warcraft where the kids whine about how difficult it is and why dont they have a titan right away then were through do i have to make that point to anyone herethe pod pilot should be resilient if they have a genuine pathology or they feel at a weak point in their life and im not joking about that the best idea is to stay away for a while the best idea is not to change the way everybody else plays the game just because our feelings got hurti know someone who stayed away for a while after suffering a significant ingame loss it should not be free there has to be a consequence we cannot dumb down the environment because of personal sensitivitiesat fanfest we mentioned during one of the round tables that the players should be made aware by aura that this place is not like other places where acts by and large have no consequences its not for everybody and it shouldnt be for everybody the player accepts the consequence or stays awaymaturity should not us be more civil towards others to spare their sensibilities most of us are nice people anyway in my now 4 years of experience maturity is the guys coming in understanding the nature of the place and embracing it or noti talked to some of the female pilots at fanfest and their sentiment was dont change it no whining no moaning no slobbering no pleading class acts every one of them with them i agree theres nothing wrong with new eden other than some game mechanics that needs to be changed to make it easier its fine the way it is the words of a few among us should not be the defining characteristic of what it means to fly in space
quoting myself from elsewhere a littlea sandbox means you can play in it anyway you like and use the toys provided any way you like there is no one way to use any particular toy or a predefined plot you have to follow if you start to call other kids names and throw sand in their eyes though a kindergarten teacher comes and picks you up and puts you on the timeout bench and no amount of screaming about how it was your sand and your free play time will not save youi think the line needs to be made very clear like this in some newbie information bit you can do anything in the game except things that ccp explicitly forbids as exploits if another player makes your ship explode there is no party but other players you can complain to you can be denied undock access forced out of systems etc however you are not allowed to say anything ridiculing other players using racistsexisthomopohic slurs referring in a derisive manner to someones real life situation or details can get you banned please petition it if someone behaves towards you in a way you find unacceptable or if you believe someone is using a mechanic that counts as exploit a ccp employee will determine if the behavior was out of line note that you will not be notified of the outcome but that will remain between ccp and the player you reportedps for the record i am female in rl i dont think this issue has much to do with genger having spoken to people whose ooc genger i know theres both kinds in all groups of opinion its fine as it is limit words but not actions pls maek me wow in space whatever you do please for the love of gods do not make changes in order to appeal to more women or make the game more welcome to women the last thing female gamers want is pink ponies and adolescents behaving in a phony way because they think women are incapable of understand terms like htfu or dps
ccp should just change the eula to if its in game its fair game
unlike people like to think what is ingame and what is not is not always clearfor example you are invited to speak on stage because of your ingame character is some high honcho in some famous alliance you speak of another player character you then refer to that player characters ingame mail to you about his outofgame situation and encourage while you are on stage and out of game other players to take part in an ingame action in order to cause an outofgame consequence you are not clearly in or out of the game there but a little bit of bothas another example i do not consider pointing and laughing in the game on local channels at someone who is obviously outofgame upset about ingame matters like losing a ship to be just ingame there is a reallife outofgame person trying to make another reallife outofgame person upset for real and it has gone beyond just blowing up their completely ingame pixelated spaceship i know not everyone agrees with me but that just proves my point the rule if its ingame its fair game is meaningless because it does not mean the same thing to everyone
the whole argument behind the eve is real is exactly the root of the problem while the rpers arent a huge percentage of the residents everyone in eve is rping inasmuch as they are imposing their will onto the rest of the galaxy thus it could be said that everyone is roleplaying your computer is your interface to your ship and while you are engaged with the game you are roleplaying your character which often times is simply roleplaying yourselfwhich brings me back to the point of my op there needs to be a written consent agreement that people can will and are going to be complete assholes when playing eve and when you initiate your interface with the game you acknowledge that you can handle it regardless of what it is or if its going to hurt your feelings
i am a roleplayer and i would rather you did not involve roleplay as an argument in thiswhat makes roleplayer a roleplayer instead of just someone who plays a role because in eve you cannot avoid is the separation between incharacter and outofcharacter even when playing an actual roleplayer is the one who is able to step aside when banter gets too hot for one guy and drop the verbal being an  and go do something else its people who dont have a real grasp of roleplaying who think they should be allowed to do anything as long as they claim it wasnt really meagain i am in favour of that agremeent as long as it concerns gameplay i think the idea that we must let anyone say anything to anyone else as long as they do so using the game client is laughable not to mention it is probably illegal in most countries  such an agreement would not be binding
the main point here is not a matter of what people do or say ingameits the fact people tend to forget that it is a gameand when you forget that detail and callously tell someone to off themselves in real lifeyou should pay for it in spadesit is one thing to greifsmack talkscamblow up someones stuffits an another to carry that attitude and motivation to real life outside of the gamecant get much simpler that thatthe tricky part ismost people dont give a rats ass about many things in real lifeand forget that those things come with consequencesexample robbing your corps assetswallet is a common thing in eve and accepted as normalof which consequences are inconsequentialrobbing a bank would land you in prison in real lifeand likely will have a permanent affect on your lifebackstabbing a team mate and podding them is a normal thing in this gamemurdering someone however is not in real life they dont respawn after all reality tends to lose its meaning when you spend too much time here believe it or noti actually encounter people who dont keep this distinction they claim itbut in realitythey quite literally dont give a changing the tos to reflect the boundaries would not have much of an impact because people tend to lose that sense of discernmenttoo busy spaiing and can flippingbackstabbingrobbing to carebecause that makes eve what it isit is eve onlinethe eve is real crap however might be going too far stop the evemail spam
i cant completely agree on this because this is the best way to let some important things loose their value and for some this should never happenhow or when should we consider that calling a native born german ss is a cause or a reason to open legal sanctionshow or when should we consider the shoa and when can we aloud ourselves to use words that dont hurt your flesh or bones to play with and say whateverhow or when should we consider as pejorative term the regular adjectives used to point someones colour origin or cultureso to make it simple and to return to latest biased thread about fanfest events how and why should we consider collectively where the line is when we are already incapable to accept others differences and always think our own point of view is the only that should prevail edit while im a defender of liberty on the internet and in general because i think were in a far police ruled world where our simple liberties are being lost by stuff like this discussion brings up i also agree something must be done against people that have no limits or are incapable to impose themselves certain limitsthis conscience of what is good or bad being inherently dependant of each ones education collective responsibility and charge of that education is as different as you can have nations or ethnic colours even if some traits are common we dont share the same values of life and we should start by admitting this simple factbut then ill have to do a wall of text no one cares witch is one of the many problems we can also add
i do not think that it is contradictory to say that people should remain calm in the face of asshattery and to say that we want less asshattery we do not have to choose between letting anyone say anything and wishing people did not get too upset when someone does say something stupid implying that wishing for less asshattery means that whoever wishes so does not think people have any responsibility to step back if they get too emotional is a false dichotomy and not helpful to the discussion about community standards at all
without attempting to defend mittens remarks during fanfest though its in the same vein that we need to addresshyperbole play haU026ApU025CrbliU02D0 hypurblee1 greek U1F51peU03C1UFFFDU03BFU03BBU03AE exaggeration is the use of exaggeration as a rhetorical device or figure of speech it may be used to evoke strong feelings or to create a strong impression but is not meant to be taken literallymittens didnt literally ask thousands of people to convince this guy to kill himself he was using this literary device when making the comments though im sure he wasnt thinking such while he was saying it per se though the underlying thought was there he was through hyperbole making a joke albeit in very poor taste about the fact that it is indeed just a game and that one shouldnt get so broken up over lossesagain i am not trying to defend mittens i am merely trying to discern a line of thought which could be applied both in practice and hypothetically
attempts of hyperbolic jokes that go too far are in practice inseparable from genuine asshattery that said i do not think many any people believe that mittens really wanted the guy to really die i think most accept it was his idea of a joke what we disagree on is whether it was an acceptable one the fact that something is humor or intended as such does not make it automatically fine
which is the root of the issue  who says whats ok and whats not ok im on the side of the fence that says there shouldnt be anyone setting that precedent
ccp does and no matter how many rules you make there will always be judgment calls involved in specific cases
which is why we need some language on the subject  there needs to be a framework for those judgement calls with additional language outlining exactly  and thats key  what is a bannable offense especially ingamei know there are international speech laws that are supposed to protect against cyberbullying though i am loathe to use the term because of its blanket implications against negative language and i know that ccp is legally incapable of nulling those things however as ccp does own the space the isk the ships and we are simply lessees and that as a game with unique interactions between its players they can stand as landlords and inform those entering their space read new eden should expect x and case y ie making direct reallife physical threatseg if you dont drop that can i will come to your house and kill you will get them banned for z daysto take this particular case the gist of what mittens said was to harass the pilot because its fun to stress people out in eve thats the whole core appeal of the game  risk and stress management get too stressed and someone will ragequit but that is wholly and completely at the discretion of the person stressed out the same goes for suicide  its wholly at the discretion of the person who is contemplating it to go through with it and quite frankly if they fail to grasp the gravity of that situation then they have external problems that stem way beyond the scope of the gamethe closest thing i can think of that can apply to this kind of subject would be the epilepsy warning that some games carry to alert those with epilepsy to the possible health risks that come with playing the game id like to see something similar implemented in eve to the tune of the present discussion
current eula reads btw which part of that you think is not enough
excellent find i would just move it into its own window by itself to give it better visibilityproductive thread is productive
i was actually looking for something completely different the use of rp as an excuse for being a jerk is explicitly bannable offense who knew when i stumbled on that its way down there with the epilepsy warning which i suspect no one manages to read before playing either p
in most games there is a clear distinction between acceptable behaviour in public vs in privatein private corpallianceprivate channels be as bad as you want to be it is up to the people in charge of those channels to set and enforce the rules for themin public localconstellationhelptrade chat channels there are standards set and enforced by the operating company and these usually reflect irl norms for acceptable behaviour modified slightly for the game environment what would eve be without smacktalk in local but even such banter can cross lines of acceptabilitybecause words can hurt people for real anybody who says differently is fooling themselves
think about the way a police force works in real life there is a limited number of law enforcement officers who need to be allocated effectively to protect a large area with the goal of reducing the total amount of crime as much as possible they use crime statistics to identify hot spots and then move more resources to those areasi propose that concord should work like this within the fiction of the eve universe the resources of concord are limited so they are forced to prioritise certain systems and neglect others wouldnt it be better if the system security ratings were adjusted regularly ie monthly in response to the number of criminal acts being committed in each systemfor example a 04 system that experiences frequent acts of piracy would be raised to 06 allowing concord to respond to the threat a 09 system that hasnt had a crime recently would be lowered to 07 to compensatei believe this would force the miners carebears traders and pirates to move around frequently if they want to stay in their comfort zone the concept of avoiding lowsec will become a lot more difficult when system security status can change pirates and gatecampers will have to find new hunting grounds when concord invades their favourite trade route chokepoint mission runners will have to choose between finding a new agent in a safer system or accepting the risk and higher rewards when their highsec agent becomes a lowsec agent miners will be forced to explore new systems rather than sitting in the same safe belts day after daycomments
i think in order for this to work they would need to first find a way to remove the stark line between high sec and low sec game behavior if they could find some way to convert the safety into a more even continuum then having security status shifting would be a fun mechanic though that would mean they would also have to look at all the anchoringcynocap rules toostill i love the idea of space being a bit more dynamic
i like the basic idea youre proposing butshould it be updated frequently every 15minutes every hour or would it just be calculated at downtime which might accidentally make it last a bit longer personally i think having it change at downtime would work out best so you dont set a course for somewhere and then suddenly one of the systems on your route becomes lowsec that would just annoy haulers while changing it at downtime might even be easily justified through lore ccp would just need to say that concord evaluates every empiresystem once a day and updates security levels based on how many crimes theyve responded to the more crimes the more people they station there the more people they station there the higher the securitylevel
i like the idea in principle but you need also to bear in mind that sec status also has an impact on resource levels in particular as well as the level of concord policing so youd need to find a way of doing that in a fair and sensible way
in the current eve it wouldnt be worth trying to implement
as long as such feature will not be implemented in eve itself its can be done through eve browser and stream broadcastingand all thats needed is to make this browser work with flashso we will be able to watch our orbital strikes

stacking several ecm modules on a single target with his proposal is exactly the same as stacking several ecm modules on a single target does in the current game maybe its a bit better for the ecm pilot because they get a literal permajam rather than 96 chance where there is a very very slight chance of someone catching a lucky break but that is inversely true with the opposite your carrier isnt going to get caught out by a flight of hornet ec300s anymore to put this into something more tangible a falcon 2x sda 1600 plate mwd utility mid t2 augmentor t1 dispersion 5x jammers with one radar jammer and 4 off racial jammers will keep an armageddon locked up at 968 chance contributer to eve is easy
im trying to wrap my head around the argument that the person who is providing the basic resource that drives the economy in new eden by providing minerals to the market for building the machinery of eve would not be doing something realccp created the mining profession either they mean that and they stop debasing the profession by giving away minerals gratis as a byproduct of other activity and they make it meaningful by making the miner a key constituent in the new eden equation or they remove mining from the environment altogether we give all our money to the people driving the drone regions and accept that as the cost of doing business its their calli always get a hearty laugh out of care bearing and risk free out of the mouths of people who shoot ships that have no guns hulkageddon is an event im not speaking out against hulkageddon it is emergent behavior in new eden it should totally happen if people want to do it but dont call mining a risk free enterprise when you the pirate are introducing that riskccp from the design stage should have made mining an integral and essential part of the process of running an alliance because logistics are important amateurs do tactics professionals do logistics resource acquisition for alliance manufacturing should be a key component of alliance operations that would show who the real leaders are that would be real life in new edenthe comment that always comes back is mineral prices would go up ship prices would go up doesnt that stand to reason fellow pod pilot isnt that what risk versus reward is is that not what i have been saying if the cost of production goes up cfr hulkageddon the price of the product should also go up you should most definitely have your fun and more power to you but then you also have to bear the cost associated with the activity and then i also want to make it clear that i dont agree with some consequences of the newly proposed crime watch mechanic that would turn empire space into a gigantic plastic ball to cushion the blow and make it safe for players it is the slippery slope that dumbs down the experience and we dont want to go there i have always considered the great risks im taking flying anywhere and that should always be the caseempire should be safer than the rest of space it should not just be safe lets not become politically correct

tonight i listened to eve radio where the csm spoke about the mittani scandal and then the mittani and nyphur talked about the consequences and fallout of associating real life name with overly sensationalist terms the conversation was much less dramatic than i expected and im very thankful that nyphur was so willing to work with the mittani eventually they even made up and almost ehugged how cutehowever theres an important take away to be had here what could have been a story about a drunk mostly anonymous  making an exceptionally stupid comment at fanfest became so much more because of the use of a real name the news elements fed off of each other with all making various untrue allegations towards not the mittani  but the player behind the mittani and really this is hardly the first time that someones real life name has come up in terms of their actions on the csm  for instance there are several people who have been accused but not convicted of breaking the nda and now their real life is similarly affected so effectively the use of a real name takes things to the next level and this is going to be true any time someones real life name is used  whether that person is the mittani jade constantine liang nuren or yoursat any rate at the end of the show someone posted the mittanis real life address and someone else said they were headed that way to  the mittanis wife this isnt the first time ive seen something like this said but ive learned a lot about the way ccp handles it since the last time i saw it so directly and just to be clear ccp takes these threats very seriously and i wouldnt be surprised if someones received a visit from their local law enforcement tonightso with all of this in mind i believe that the csm white paper should be amended in such a way that the csm candidates and eventual csm members real names and countries of origin are not given to the player base as a whole  but strictly to ccp the real life information of current csm members is already available but thats no reason for future members to potentially be put in similar real life situationswe as a player community have proven that we are not responsible enough not mature enough and not sane enough to be trusted with this information and this proposal is meant to help our upcoming csm candidates  those whose real names arent known yet maybe even people like youliang

i say to not cave in to those particular elements within eve they will have wonespecially with the way some sectors of eve players stalk they just dont know when enough is enough though even this extreme talk is probably not serious just not thinking and more than likely it is again alcohol influencedbetter to deal with law enforcement with no delay if necessary like last night on a case by case basis ahould this arise again in the futureupd eve needs to have the bad boy on the block reputation but now it seems more like the psychotic idiot on the block alliance and corp members need to eyeball thier members better these behaviors are usually evident in some fashion before these things happen but then the type they hang around with probably think its funnyupdate 2 i see the goons are really for this and mainly goons i smell a rat csm and ccp really better think hard before doing away with rl names seems to me like someone is trying to pull a stunt and get away with something anonymously more than likely they have found an exploit of a sort id be real careful hereupdate 3 reread the article about all of this id be careful i cant stress that enough and really be sure that was not somebodys idea of a bad joke on that radio show something seems staged about it that needs to be looked into as wellbesides a csm composed of anonymous toons will not be taken very seriously at all and may as well not existsigned james causey palm harbor fl

dont think of it as caving think of it as asking why the hell that information is even public in the first place
yup this would be a good thingi might suggest that the part about who they are in real lifebackground info be displayed tho as certain backgrounds would help people with the job if they are displayed without names ccp should verify so we know it is the truth and not some random claimif trebor had claimed all the things he had done and i couldnt look them up i would have assumed he was full of crap for instance just make sure the info is vague enough not to be identifying
do it
signed no one should ever be a target for threats of any kind in a online game and defiantly not in real life because of interests or game playthis is way out of line and can never be justifiable in any way 
makes sens
if names cant be released shared and exploited then lets have skreegs look in the resulting botted csm
supportthere is no reason for them to have to disclose their names to other players
agreed there is no reason to disclose real namestoo many people take this game waaay to seriously and there are alot of unstable people out there who really would find you and do bad things because of what you did to their pixels it is very easy to find a person via the internet once you have a name and a few small details even mor eso if the figures have even a small reputation to research intohow will it affect ccp when a crazy really does go and find someones wife or kids because they got angry in game and lost it
signed
well a little more seriously why cant normal so called real people distinguish between a person and their avatar what i propose is the old gamer use of an in game character tag for roleplaying in or out of character that still leaves plenty of mucking about potential but also leaves a line drawn in the sand that cant be crossed
everyone please take note that no one is saying that ccp should not have personal information of the csm rather the internet at large should not have it 1
surely you must have missed the part of the op where he says that only ccp must know the namesi feel you bro reading is hardontopic  supported its time people learn to differentiate between a game and rl
oh thats right nobody at ccp ever leaks any information ever just ask hilmar about thatalso the timing of this is suspicious late on a friday night ccp gone and only a few hapless gms around for the next 48 hours how convenient
so you dont support this because their names might be leakedare you forgetting that such a leak would place ccp in a fairly precarious position
would not be too hasty in trusting names only to an old feudal hierarchal structure like ccp who in the past has come to blows with the new palyer order and well lost i would rather trust my identity to a crowd than to a secluded and protectionist group of corporate pr men

i read your post very interesting analysis and opinion and i was clearly about to signthen i just remembered prencleeve video the rl threats and comments about alex rl information and i cant sign any moreby the way csm candidates should not even have to present themselves irl for this very same reason does ccp guard or another ccp member tells you his rl name tells you his rl life cv whatsoever no and if they do its a big mistakethis is an internet video game where internet anonymous nerds do whateverwhatsoever from killing pixels to act like pedos threat people rl bullie have racist comments more often than they say hello to someone else girls dont exist or theyre gayplayed by men most guys are gay and so on and so forth so because of the above i cant agree with you this can take proportions that go beyond reason
i support this idea there is too much madness too many rl threads leveled at people like the mittani and you are right  the community is not mature enough let ccp know and leave it like that what purpose is there for the community to know the players let them interact with the characters and leave it at that
huhcurrently to run for the csm you are required to divulge your rl identity not only to ccp but to the entire community the idea is that csm candidates should not be required to do so except to ccp of course but this is already done through your account info

i agree with this first post on this forum in a week that makes some god damn sensewant to find all the podcasts around eve online visit
when eve ingame shenanigans spill over into real life it becomes a problem and ccp needs to stop itsummary of eves last four expansions
signedi wonder what was the rationale behind of not doing this in the first place
so you are saying that a perfectly good reasonable and logical idea should not be implemented simply because goons are suggesting it that is pathetic truly patheticthere is no reason for this information to be published automatically ccp are the only ones who need to know the personal details of the csm they are the only ones who should be automatically told if a candidate chooses to reveal more personal information about themselves that is their decision
supported the eve community should not be mixed up with a persons real life details too many separate events have already marked and shown us the way the community works and act in various situations i trust ccp i am in doubt though when it comes down to single units within this community
totally agree with the optheres no reason the real names and locations are needed to be published to the playerbase at all ccp needs that information for nda reasons travelling and other practicalities obviously in game names are most critical and they are the ones that we identify with anywaythreatening someones family and property in real life because of activities from a video game is never ok this just makes sense period
after the abhorrent threats posed against the mittani in real life the eve online community has demonstrated that it is not mature or responsible enough to handle the release of real identities as part of the csm
your entire argument against this idea is simply hm lots of people in gsf are voting for so we should vote againstyoure despicablesignedblawrf mctaggart
signedno one should have to go through what the mittani has
im honestly somewhat confused over why ccp had csm members reveal their out of game identities and whatnot at all past a generic ccp has bad ideas deal sure the company needs to know who you are and stuff but the community as a whole sure as hell doesnt need to and sure as hell cant be trusted with it as a whole bunch of people have shown over the past week or two
this is a great idea if only to stop a load of creepy chucklefucks posting peoples real names on the eveo forums
i generally agree with the need for caution but i do have one issue with this and it might even be the reason why ccp chose to publish names in the first place i dunnoif the real names off applicants are removed from the process doesnt that increase the chance of a player with a poor reputation using an alt to run for the csmthere may be players who would not vote for a certain candidate because of a past action say the mittani or because of a poltical association a certain alliance etc but who would vote for his publicly unknown alt that is untainted by a colourful pastwhile revealing a real world identity could be abused it also helps to identify individual players from largely anonymous character identities that can be legitimately bought or sold if real names were removed from the process there should be another means of identifying players beyond the character name they choose to compete withan alt of the mittani would still benefit from the channelled support of goonswarm but be freed of much of the current controversy now on his shoulders is that right the jotunn risi are now recruiting brutor ancestry required in order to best represent the brutor interest join channel joris to learn more
ive heard a decent amount about the threats mittens has receivedso i support this as well and suggest that perhaps evetvfanfest should stop using players real names as well and just use character names just like they do with the ccp employeesnot broadcasting players real names whether restricted to the csm or not will help players and ccp avoid further media slandering in the futureedit while taking out the country might be a good idea without the names they dont mean much some people might vote because someone from their country is running so perhaps keep a category about what primetime they fall under or something its still vague while still potentially enabling regional voting for anyone who actually might do that for whatever reason
im not a fan of the mittani and what he said did make feel sick what he did was wrong but to do real life threats to anyone is just as bad want to get back at him or anyone do it via war decinvade just keep it in game and under the rules of the gamei support this 1
you forget one thing  controversy does not mean someone cannot get elected as long as this was not dodging a ban on running for csm  ccp would need to investigate using real names and billing info which they and only they should possess  then there is no reason why mittens or darius or anyone else who has made themselves infamous by their actions should be able to standplus the alt would need to develop a good reputation before nonvoting bloc members would vote for him if mittens stood for election for csm using an unknown alt and commanded all goons to vote for him he would receive goon votes and maybe a dozen more of so if he stood as the mittani he would receive all goon votes and hundreds if not thousands of nongoons who like his attitude or policiesas shown by the voting results of csm 7 an unknown toon without the support of a voting bloc will gather no votes even high profile but inept candidates received a pitiful number of votes to get elected you either need the support of a voting bloc  goons will vote for the mittani whether standing as the mittani or an alt  or you need to be a competant high profile candidate who has been a key part in the community for a number of months potentially years so these concerns about alts abusing the system really are minimal especially compared to candidates personal contact details potentially being abused a la mittensgate
agreed either country of residence or timezone would be a good thing to include  and explains why toons that are relatively unknown as far as i am aware in the eveo community gather large numbers of votes in the election presumably mainly from their native voting bloc
i agree but i would like to amend your proposal any csm delegate  or an eve online player for that matter  that discloses personal information pertaining another player or if he or she commits an act  both ingame or occ  that is illegal like inciting to suicide should be banned permanently reporting the crime to authorities by ccp should be mandatoryextensive leeway are given to people who play the game they can grief gank kill bash destroy all for the purpose of good laughs its the sandbox  whatever that meansbut those who have great privileges should also have great responsibility you cant commit not even one illegal act you cannot break the laws of your host country by inciting people to harass your enemy until he suicidesthats where the line must be drawn that is the fact that many here are conveniently dismissing this proposal as it is  will only protect csm delegates who are already powerful players within the game we regular players should be also protected from them and i am not talking about a 30day ban
that is already the case
signed
sorry what how will this protect csm delegates ccp will still have the real life contact details as they do for any player and ccp already report harrassment cases to the relevant authorities this thread is simply asking for csm candidates to be treated like any other player with regards to their personal details  hardly an unreasonable request i dont understand what actual change you are asking for  this just sounds like a subtle request for the mittani to be permabanned and that is not what this thread is about mittensgate has been dealt with case closed

an overreaction to a particular event fanfest is over let it goi prefer my own anonymity as do we all but i am not particularly ashamed of anything i have ever said or done in any of the mmos i have played over the last decade ill keep my anonymity to the extent i can as long as i can but i dont want any scary gaming company policestate apparatus erected to enforce it as some in this thread seem to be calling for internet privacy generally is an illusion and becoming more so every day fact of digital life get used to it dont expect to be able to lead one life one place and another elsewhere and never see the two put togetherif someone wants to stand for election to represent players to a company and to the larger world via the gaming media i think we should have a right to know who they are and if we wish check them out in real life i dont want to see some known troll from somewhere else eg second life elected here just because no one can put the pieces togetherif you cant stand the heat stay out of the kitchen as for the mittani his real name was not just revealed as a candidate and member of the csm he used it himself in making his apology and trying to draw a distinction between the amorality of his game character and his shocked real moral self that someone posted his address is reprehensible and if done ingame or on a ccp forum or other asset that should fall well within the kind of harassment that already can be sanctioned under ccps current toseula if the toseula need to be amended to make that clearer for the future ok im fine with that kind of limited changebut dont expect or ask ccp to set itself up as some kind of worldwideweb gaming policestate to ferret out and protect its players everywhere they might ever be mentioned it wont happen and would lead to a nightmarish witchhunt atmosphere of suspicion accusation and counteraccusation and dirtytrick fraudulent postings actual rl threats are a different story entirely those are matters for the police not to be dealt with by a gaming company
you dont want to give up your name dont run for csm you run more risk of being harassed on facebook then you do being on the csmany irl harassment that may occur on can easily be taken care of by the local authorities and a petition to ccp most of the fallout and continued fallout can be laid squarely at mittens feet that eve radio stunt was pathetic next time try having someone one with an opposing view point that wasnt bullied into changing his tune on it was nothing but propagandist fluff by cheerleadersspace wizards are real they can make 10058 votes vanish and for a moment i hurd 10k goons cry out then silence 
signedbecause if its true that real life candidate names and addresses are now being circulated in a way that could result in violence against candidatestheir families that should raise concernif i was a brat id ask whether the real life candidate information was circulated by posters using their own real life names or if they were hiding behind anonymous internet identities posting disagreeable or potentially threatening material anonymously can be seen as a calculated way to avoid accountability for all we know ccp  the csm may already be thinking along similar linesre this whole panel drama part of being human is making mistakes and then having to take responsibility make things right with any injured party accept whatever punishment comes down and then with those things done to be being allowed to move on better and wiser than before id want the same for myself so im hoping this community settles down soon ive been avoiding forums with all the neverending rage and bickering thats all i have on thispixxie tviva small alliancesb new player podcast  pixxies eve online podcast  latest episode episode 10swtor diablo 3 inferno hulkageddon  on itunes and at
oh so things like people threatening to kill his dog and posting his home address can easily be solved by a petition to ccp and the local authorities because so far ccp hasnt done much to help with that other than banning that creepy kid which was handled well imo because they cant police off site stuff and since this is international townie cops arent going to help much you know what would solve this problem before it becomes one not having his name out there what is gained by having the name of the panel out there
supportedi dont think their real names are relevant to the position
signedtotally support this bringing someones real life location and information into the public eye is serious business and while what mittani did wasnt right what others did to him with the threats of violence and other retribution were even less right responding with an eye for an eye attitude is not right sure you can kill someone repeatedly in game and generally make their ingame life suck but the instant you take that into rl you have crossed that thin red line and you should be dealt with swiftly and to the fullest extent of the law one might even say coldcalling someone and delivering a death threat is a terroristic threat there is a clear separation between the game and rl it should never be crossedlegal definition of a terroristic threatchapter 42 classification of offenses penalties delawareall states have a law that is pretty much a carbon copy of this but basically a terroristic threat is a felony and is punishable by up to 25000 in fines and up to 2 years in a state penitentiarysp and a notation for a felony on your criminal record try to get a good job with a felony on your record also most crimes that would land you with a felony tie into other criminal charges ie getting charged with terroristic threats is a class g felony and also nets you a charge for a class a misdemeanor which is up to a year in class v incarceration and up to 2300 in fines along with your felony chargesentencethink before you decide to take something from in game to the real world kiddiesedit posted info to back up first paragraph
well ccp will still always have the rl info its a necessity due to the requirement of passport copies as proof of ability to travel to iceland so it wouldnt be difficult to include info like ran preivously as old character or character name has been sold to a new player its a bit more work for whoever handles it though not much but its hugely preferred to publicly releasing rl detailsthat said i dont really see that being a problem anyway as anonymity is pretty much your worst enemy in something like this take a look at darius iii for example  hes certainly not someone known for positive things in his previous term yet because his name was known because he made his presence felt and used actual things he had done or not done as a hook to have people talk about him he managed to get elected had he just rolled an anonymous alt to run again he wouldnt have any of that to grab anyones attention and hed probably be somewhere in xenuria territory voteswise
i think ccp should ban all goon players since they have publicly declared that they want to destroy our game why does ccp put up with the crap it seems easy enough to track down and ban all players with goon in there alliancecorp associations
can ccp still allow them forum access i would be lost without their tearsthe best argument against democracy is a fiveminute conversation with the average goon  the mittani
not our game just your game they dont want to ruin eve they just want to ruin your dayjust one example of how understanding doesnt necessarily lead to friendship 
i dont like the los idea but space weather sounds interesting then you have to ask is it random or do some areas have better weather than others
i think you hit right on something there the los may be problematic so implementing that may be a step in the wrong direction meanwhile the other point you made is more along the lines of where my own following the thread imaginings went so los might not be needed but the effects of being able to hide a fleet in a huge cloud of dust where they could not be scanned down yeah we know theyre in there but the only way to get them is to go in and get within visual range and maybe even the visual range is limited in some fashion using the effects of the phenomena to create a terrainsubstutute is exactly where this seems to be going good point
los is how you break up blobs but it is nontrivial to implement
main problem with space weather  how often does it happeneffects should be rare enough to warrant leaving ships unprepared but at the same time visible to a larger community not just people present within the solar systemperhaps with similar messages as incursionsor even galaxy wide weather with proper weather forecasts although atm i fear this is more wishful thinking  as of now there are many thing that need iteration on before ccp would start implementing something this large
i thought about that some more and thunk yknow it really wud be a nice feature to have los around stuff then it wud be more like the 3d terrain effect that was running around just below my conscious thought level  well if ccp does i have the name for the release ready lets call it the universe strikes back  
on the good news front check out the tesselation presentation some folks at ccp are laying the groundwork that will make a more realistic space environment possible in future releases
thanks for the info ill go ahead and put the link to the youtube video here for everyone else to see looks great and looks like the addition of 3d terrain to eve is a possibility after all lets put the tesselation and physx to work for us thanks again
not supportedand i am primarily a caldari missile usertrain for turretsit took me about 2 weeks to train for every basic turret laser hybrid and projectile of every size small medium and large to level 3 large requires gunnery 5 but is rank 1 plus turret support skills to level 3 i think i spent another week or so after that training all the turret support skills to level 4 which will soon be followed by all the turrets to level 4 im not a turret specialist should be obvious that i prefer to be a jackofalltrades but i am functional with them thats all it takes to have fun
helloas you can all know ccp has been using color as an identifier in the market place and other areas recently i would like eve to use color or let users pick a color for our text in chat channels only on the client side just to be clear only the text you type on your end would be red or green or blue it would only be to help you find any text you typed the text would still be white to everyone else viewing the chat i strongly believe this would help new players more than anyone i tend to visit the help channel and when 20 people are spamming questions its very easy to lose sight of where your question is and how far up you have to go to find your answer vs everyone elses questionguys i really need your help to drive this idea home so please post on this subject with your support again the color text would only be on the client end so that the person typing would see the color this way it would not affect the current color system in place for gms and so forththank youjoshuanew player
i am pretty new to eve and from a new players perspective i have to say null sec feels right and so does high sec but low sec feels wrongi dont understand why we even bother with this middle terminologoy seriously am i missing something the only difference i have noticed is gate guns that really dont do anything to begin with is this supposed to make me feel somewhat safer in low sec than null sec i really feel this middle ground is the part of eve that feels the least realistic i would honestly tell a new player to just call everything null sec because honestly low sec doesnt feel any different and i feel it shouldi am not looking for a safe path to everywhere i am just saying when there really is no difference to null sec and low sec than why even bother having it just call them all null sec and call it a dayi suppose my proposal is some kind of adjustment to the guns i suppose to make them bigger to make some sort of safe spot in low sec because otherwise we might as well just call them all null sec
nope i dont mind at all but you are wrong in assuming that the system at the moment is a balanced voice of the playersso what do you suggest then 
might be due to my tiredness of my job at the end of the work weekor maybe im just dense due to migrainbut your ideaas elegant as it isis not that much different than what we have herebut i do get the sense of the spirit of what your pushing forperhaps csm needs to be more elaborate and inherity complicatedperhaps its just that easy to become a delegateperhaps voting is too easily fubard stop the evemail spam
hello all and this is my first proposal and hopefully a good one in the csm assembly hall my name is calvin cook and i propose something that may completely fix the csm vote stacking problems of people voting for a candidate with multiple accountsi propose to change the way accounts and multiple characters on accounts workcurrently an account may have a maximum of 3 characters and only one of those characters may actively train at once this effectively makes multiple characters useless for reasons other than a alt posting on forums and b anonymous grief andor shade tactics ingame i may be leaving a few reasons out but for the most part this is what the 2nd and 3rd character slots are being used fori propose that new accounts have only one character slot and that you may add additional character slots that increase your monthly fee and all characters on your account may actively train skills i believe this would help the multiple account voting problem we currently have aswell as make multiple active alts much more convenient i am aware that this would not extinguish the multiple account voting problem but i believe it would lessen itan additional option would to allow customersplayers to pay for individual characters on their account and if you dont want to keep paying for certain characters that character on your account gets frozen because that specific characters subscription has run out this would allow for individual plexinga quick exampleaccount with 1 character 1500moaccount with 2 characters 3000mo both characters on account may actively train skillsaccount with 5 characters 7500mo all characters on accounts may actively train skillsplease tell me what you think eve community
not really related to defender missiles but another skill that ive not seen used is fof correct me if im wrong but are they used in any situation i know they are the only weapon except smartbombs and drones that works when jammed but with the lower dps i do not see why anyone would use them
strap them onto an t2 escort destroyer specialized in rocketry and defender missiles
and while we are at it  why are strategic cruisers better command ships than command ships and why arent they better mining ships than exhumers on the other hand so many questions 
my tengu can use combat probes burn through warp disrupt bubbles warp while cloaked and do more dps than most other t2 cruiserswhen i got my tengu i found my buzzard to be obsolete since my tengu can do everything a buzzard can plus moresummary of eves last four expansions
totaly spotted that blatant error of mine after i posted but hay still even the covops frigs can be deadly if used correctly
supportedas i like to think im the reason the charon and rhea recently gained a starboard thruster i cant help but support little things that drive some people crazy
theres a sticky on this in general discussion so it looks like youll get your wish and i agree
id sure as hell like an efficient system for sharing them between alts is it unreasonable not to want to copy a few thousand bookmarks in a horrendously laborious fashion for each character i use
in a small scale fight having teh battle last longer would be nice but once into large scale combat the problem is that battles could last a ridiculously long time the idea of longer lasting small battles is good though
simple but cool changes please ccp make it possible that we can use drag and drop to link an item from contract to chat use drag and drop to add an item from contract to market quickbar thanks

was mittani roleplaying up on stage he had his 1 sexterity hat on right maybe he was rping a sparkly vampire i hear wow will let you rp is that where he will get his rping fix while on his vacationthe best argument against democracy is a fiveminute conversation with the average goon  the mittani
interestingly it is part of his defense that the character mittani is who is an  while he himself alex g isnt he did apologize though so it does not count as using rp as an excuse but it does mean that he agrees with the fact that it can happen that we take our eve personages too far
now what i keep asking me is why should some weirdo who has some 20 accounts and real life issues and who is so connected to the game that he threatens to kill himself when things dont go his way be the responsibility of a player anyway when ccp see a mail of a player telling some other player that he wants to kill himself isnt it their duty to reacti wonder if people ingame start crying and tell me how sad their lives are and how they only want to kill themselves what am i as a player expected to do stop playing the game like i want just to comfort those random internet people that i will probably never even know by name no sir i dont think so i will keep shooting and camping and suiciding or whatever it is that got the guy mad in the first place and and i will invite all my scumbagcomrades to the party because that is what i do welcome to eve online buddyif someone cant cope with an internet spaceship game and wants to kill himself thats a case for a psychiatrist or even the local authorities but not for the csm not for the players and not for me
sigh i am starting to get tired of repeating this butthe mittani was not punished for shooting the miner in the first place he was punished for what he said about it according to ccp stance on multiple threads they are not asking you to stop shooting someones ship if they tell you they are suicidal or whatever they are asking you to not encourage other people to go after him in order to drive him to complete the threatso if you are camping and shooting someone and they ask you to stop because they are suicidal what you should do is report the threat of suicide to ccp not answer the player continue playing normally including camping him if thats what you were doing before and not share the communication with any othersyou can block him or report him for petition him for spamming if he keeps on giving you these messagesccp has also said they will take steps against people they find using that kind of threats arbitrarily in order to make people back off from banter because they have to take every case seriously obviously and its a whole lot of work so even if you find that the request to stfu this one time rest assured if you petition the incident he wont do it many timesit seriously cannot be this hard to separate between an ingame action firing on a spaceship and words said about it in public to other players if you want this guy to kill himself heres his characters name look him up
and then ccp actually saw the mail and didnt do  even ccp didnt know what to do or not to do how can you expect a player who is just paying to play the game and have fun to know betterto make things clear  i dont care about the csm i dont care about mittani hell i dont even like that guy this is not about the mittani this is a very fundamental topic that concerns all of us and for me fanfest is not just all that serious and reallifeish if i met you at fanfest and you threatened to shoot me laughing reeking of alcohol and wearing a wizards hat would i call the police and have you arrested because i felt totally threatened hell no this is still eve right its fanfest after allalso  if it is that easy to draw the line between ingame actions and real life actions as you say why did the mittani get a 30 day game ban for a what was labeled as a real life act also  will the guy who threatened to kill himself read made a real life threat ingame in the first place be sanctioned or will he be coddled and protected from the bad eve playersit is not as easy to draw a straight line between real life and the game especially not with a game like eve and thats what this is about
1 they did not see the mail at the time it was written which was months before the thing because instead of petitioning it goonies used it to make fun of the writer2 you do not know and it is none of your business to know what has transpired between ccp the guy and local medicallegal authorities3 if you need ccp to tell you that it is not ok under any circumstances to publicly mock someone that might really be suicidal and entice others to go after him you are the one who should not be playing eve because obviously you do not have the mental capability to differentiate between ingame shootingbanter and stuff that might be actually harmful that this kind of a game requires
they saw the mail before the thing months days hours  who cares they didnt have a clear rule to follow how can you expect a player to have one hell they didnt even see the problem hey mittens about that mail there  that could be a problem dont show it  they could easily have said that but they didnt they didnt know but a player has to pay for not knowing thats why i would like to see some kind of insurance in the tosand that doesent mean they should have a clear rule for every case they can or cant imagine that is obviously impossible but people have to understand and agree that this game might neither be easy nor nice to them when they start playing it and that there is a thing that we call metagame be it fanfest evekill eve radio forums 3rd party software or whatever and that they should either gtfo or htfu if they cant handle thatpsjumping to my mind right now you are right what happens with this specific player is not my business but what i have to expect should a case like that occur again is my question about him was purely rhetorical as i care about his person as much as i care about the mittanis  not at all but i care about him in the role of a player as i am one of those and might find myself in a situation similar to this one sooner or later
and that is where the problem is because the existent rules are not clearly defined so players have a big manoeuvre margin witch leads to gm appreciation when youve crossed the line or not now let me ask you who the hell is random x named ccp something to decide when the line is crossed and based on what does he takes that decisionicelandic lawsicelandic way of livingicelandic vocabularyyou guys should know where i want to go with my question thing is that without clear and proper rules its no mans land wide open for a lot real lot of things and stuffeve is in need of some defined rules of behaviour you should not try to overcome youll have to at some point
if you updated it every day not only is it a lot more work but individual battles can change the sec status of an entire system because of the short timeframe essentially with less data to go on anomalies have a greater effecti think that the original proposed changeover time ie one month would be much better here it also makes the whole thing less crazy and anarchical as players actually have a chance to move somewhere else safer or riskier depending on the player before it all just jumps back again if you changed it every day wed essentially have a situation where every hisec becomes lowsec and every lowsec becomes hisec as in hi people dont fight and in low they do so then the next day the systems which had been high two days ago would become high again as in the day before they were low and hence more fighting occurred there think of it a little like the vc and the americans in vietnam whenever they took an area from the vc theyd leave and the vc would just move back inno i definitely think a daily update would be frankly ridiculous a month is just right
didnt they mention a way for players to see a recording of the battle afterward maybe they would have a way of sharing thee videos
flash would be a bad idea better to stream it to the cq video screen
