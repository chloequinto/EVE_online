100500 this needs to have been done years ago corp thieves and other miscreants that do not produce kill rights will just need a completely different system is all but this one will already fix numerous problemsmind if i offer a tiny tweak thoughat
if you keep this contract system separate from the bounty system as it is now except with changes to how the isk is payed out to prevent alts collecting bounties then that problem is already solvesi dont see any reason why not it would create more consequences for shooting at people illegally i always like that nothing it stopping them i dont think it should be stopped if someone is resourceful enough to pull something like this off they deserve to reap the benefitsin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
actually upon reflection i do see a potential problem consider this scenariocharacter x is a corp spy he joins a corp gains trust then steals everything not nailed down and before hes kicked to add insult to injury he suicide ganks everyone he can get his hands on in hopes of gaining bounties on his head assuming that one can invariably place the bounty on the entire player corporation the criminal is a member of this would more often than not be the default way of handling things once x is kicked from the corp the next day everyone ends up with bounties they did nothing to deserve in addition to the theft losses and they can do pretty much nothing to prevent that particular problem no matter how well they secure their assets or vet members its more problematic than awoxingi believe that the current corp landscape is plenty paranoid enough already so the only solution that seems reasonable to me is to produce kill rights on everyone who shot the aggrieved party at all and their logi and make it possible to bulk package them in a single bounty contract
great ideas
no you can shoot pods below 5
been in my share of nullsec alliances they are either stuck up jerks cta mongers corpalliance thiefs paranoid freaks power hungry dictators or just simply boringmany people do truthfully dislike having to kiss up to much of the current jumble of jerks
why are you so insistant on trying to blame miners my friend lost her first and only ever covetor in a quiet system while her husband watched local d sacnned both aligned and flew with her for safety you seem to have forgotten that in highsec you dont get automatic blue  or not for everyone in system you only get that in null people who are paying attention and doing all you suggested lose mining ships every day because the systems are simply weak andor broken why does negative security status not automatically tag a pilot a warning colour in highsec local that is part of why null is safer because the usthem dichotomy actually works and effectively tags all treats but new  casual players cant do anything in null if you take them there they will likely quit the gameas for being able to pod at 5 good luck with that unless suicide ganking miners is changed to put you to 5 then gankers will kill a ton of people and use an alt to collect their own bounty if it ever gets high enough to be in risk of getting podded remember that the bounty system is meant to protect people like miners by allowing them to hire pvp players to kill thier foes and we all know that system is horribly brokena new thought that came into my head  kill rights should be able to be made into an item and sold so that the miners really can give the contract to kill someone the right should also work as a key to activate locator services on the target in any bounty office after all concord and the empires know where these people are
you can change and costomise your overlay  and ive made mine give people with negative sec status a coloured background that helps me in losecthe problem with industrialists getting our own back on suicide gankers is   regardless of any kill rights  bounties  transferable kill rights bounty hunting crime and punishment other game mechanics yet to be invented   etc etc   is the fact that suicide gankers will almost certainly be using a disposable alt the pilot who ganks you today will be biomass this time next month if it is easier for them to continue ganking with a new character without any access to the main account the thing that the player has invested time into suicide ganking is without long term consequence for those who participate there really isnt anything stopping them from running an entirely different paid account for being naughty onthere is a difference between people playing as pirates long term and people who create a new account for the purposes of giefing for a couple of weeks the long term pirate has made a choice and likes that way to play and game mechanics like secstatus affect them the suicide ganker may well be just having a laugh with a disposable account  and certainly would dispose of it if things were changed to make it harder for that character to continue
yup  youd just be dead several times over getting there
obviously doesnt know jack  about the game go join a mining alliance they will move your  there for you otherwise head to npc nullsec pick a  moon and stick your pos there get a rorq or jump freighter all you need is patience mannn you guys wanna make isk the easy way period eve is dangerous youve been provided all the tools to keep yourself safe do it clearly your friend and husband and village wasnt paying attention to local properly enough learn the game learn from your mistakes lose a ship just get back missioning and mining to get another isnt that hard if youre gonna quit after losing a ship then gtfo no one wants you this game isnt for the weak go play wow or something if you dont want to lose your hardearned 
yeah i do  join friggin huge alliance  you will be on at this time you will participate in these mining missions  you will get jack  oh and a huge monthly bill for being part of the alliancethe alternative youre now red and dead 
hi im part of a nullsec alliance that does mining ops and things not one part of what you just said about them is true in any way shape or form try an alliance that isnt led by a mouthbreather and you might like it more
man youve seriously chosen the wrong alliances to join havent you i havent had to do any of that all the years ive been in nullsec vov
this is how eve works these wolves as you call them are actually teaching new players about how the eve world works true by technicality but your general idea is flawed every plex at least as far as im aware in eve was purchased by someone at some point therefore every players playing time was paid for some players are willing to pay cash for another players playing time in exchange for isk this benefits both players involved and ccp we dont want you to quit if you quit then we cant harvest your tears any more not really im not a vet by any means i started playing sometime around 2008 i still manage to enjoy the game perfectly fine if i wanted to create some major nullsec sov holding alliance that produced trillions of isk per day i have the tools at my disposal to do so just like every other player i will agree that the veteran holds the advantage in some ways such as some vets having t2 bpos that are no longer being created but on the large scheme of things this isnt a major issue as it doesnt detract from someone elses enjoyment of the game because they can still acquire these bpos through purchasing them nor does it prevent ccp from acquiring new subscribers and holding their current subscribers if you cant find a way to mine during hulkageddon without getting blown up you probably wouldnt have lasted long in eve anyway so your argument is mootcontinued on next post
while its not feasible for a solo miner to produce their own hulk they can produce their own mining barges perfectly fine i will assume you were referring to hulks however theres a reason for the market and its perfectly feasible to acquire the isk to purchase your very own hulk as players do it every day eve doesnt mean easy by any meanswhich combat ship has a base hold space of 8000m3 im sure there are a lot of traders that would love to knowim unbiased on this one because i dont know all the intended effects from this mechanic etcso use a battleship fitted with mining lasers when you know ganking is going to be an issue if ccp felt that you should only be able to mine in one ship they wouldnt have made it possible to mine in other ships you can get a maximum yield of 1500 per cycle with a hulk a rokh is capable of achieving 971 per cycle with three mining laser upgrades and 8 mining lasers and it still has room for a tank which you dont need much of to stop gankers yes because giving the large alliances a way to make their logistics operations invincible is certainly the best way to solve the issuecontinued on next post
i will directly quote you here because after all you argue against your own point priorfurther obtaining the isk to purchase and set up a pos in high sec to do research with is actually very feasible for the average player t1 ships arent obsolete by any means there are actually some t1 ships that are more effective than their t2 counterpart after all you dont see suicide gankers running around in tengus do youno this would allow a single player to horde sites all for themselves and isnt necessary as there are already existing mechanics that can be used to work around gankers this is eve you arent safe anywhere and nobody who understands how eve works supports making miners invulnerable further if miners became invulnerable mining would become even less profitable as a result which is already an existing issueyoure free to hire mercenary corporations to avenge the scammers if you like therefore the mechanic you suggest is already in place on top of that pvp does not mean combat and there are more forms of pvp than ship vs ship combat think outside the sandboxthe only mess created as a result of scamming is the mess that is created in the gms petition list when the fool who was quickly parted with his isk attempts to get ccp to aide them to no avail the person whos creating the mess here is the fool not the scammer the scammer is just using game mechanics and greed to his advantagecontinued on next page
players do not appear the same as npcs npcs come in the form of a plus sign whether its red or white players are in the form of squares in varying sizes based on the size of the ship as well as their name which generally is not as standard as the npc names this is something i learned within my first day of playing eve and isnt information thats too hard to grasp so you might lose a million isk or so to learn that lesson in the end its not a big deal many lessons in eve come at a far greater costas far as i am aware podding a wanted player does immediately pay out the reward if it doesnt immediately pay out the reward then it most likely pays the reward out in the same fashion as pirate bounties every 15 minutes which isnt a major issue engagement times are not lower now because of new ships because people dont suicide gank in tengus or shiny shipsi think you should stick to not posting your ideas at the very least dont post them in the assembly hall where theyre likely to waste csm members and ccps time you should also change the thread title to griefers vs carebears hulkageddon is winning time for carebears to htfuoff topic stop making ridiculously huge walls of text that are a pain in the ass to quote
i thought t1 ships were obsolete
actually i would recommend against this for three reasons1 it makes teamwork more important i remember ratting when someone would come into local all the non afk people would start typing in local to get everyones attention now anyone who detected a hostile in local could speak up to warn their slower scanning bretheren this makes ratting a team effort2 you never know who is or is not really friendly when politics get complicated sometimes blues and reds dont quite hold the same meaning3 this would make a scout role important if you were group ratting you could have one guy jack up his sensor strength and be the designated local watcher again encouraging group pvei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
i like the idea of scanning down mining sites for 2 reasonsfirstly for the miner it gives a more interactive experience in mining as well as the stated a counter to botsstarts the griefers training those scanning skills to probe you out or using the d scan correctly rather than just warping to belti can see further bonuss from a game design povyou are not going to have the same level of cans anchored in space  should cut down on bookmarks in highseca number of pve combat sites that have asteroid belts  spawns can be reused with or without the npc fleet as scanned mining sitesi know we already have grav sites and this is an extension of that heck im just happy that after 5 years we are getting a decent look at industry as a whole
u took the alloys and gave us nothing really basic bountys no sec stat gains  moons no faction officer drops no hauler spawns no drops period but drone parts and some t2 salvage once in a while  why cant we that liie in drone space have some kinds mods drop and sec status gains hell even a hauler spawn or officer yes this is my 2nd post just thought that maybe this should be in here more so then where i first posted it
or you could go take some nice space from someone else normally thats what other guys do in this game
hesitantly supportedif the state of affairs is as you say it is then you could at the very least use the sec status gainin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
i say go and attempt to take space from someone else
i dont think irc are capable of taking space from anyone else do you
thanks
im dragging this thread back from the dead because its just flat out a good idea and deserves some attentionpost your support or dont but post anyway this covers all my rules for a good proposal its a simple easy change to make it doesnt break anything for anyone it makes flying a spaceship more intuitive something that all the ui in eve lacks2 for cloaking failure audio notificationsin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
should editing a medals description or design be a feature possibly deleting medals when they are no longer needed let me know what you think
hello there have any of you brought up how bad the new ui is with ccpif not please discuss this issue any feedback on this would be great thanks
hopefully the incarna stuff wont be too heavily ndad it would be nice to have some certainty that it is actually going somewhere and have something to look forward towalking in pos  prometheus style exploration  win
likes are a valid determination of how much his argument is worthand we still dont know what they are up to in fact the last thread that he was trolling about the lack of csm communication got us some communicationthis is not to say that its the only way or that its going to be a consistently effective tool but it was effective once this thread is not a real information thread although it does say that in the op its a teaser thread it teases objective  complete
i guess they breed em dumb  rude in your part of the galaxy dont you have any traffic jams to honk in and generally be an ass in somewhereseriously what is wrong with youi was glad to have had some information those for instance not in twitter would have been updated by this postbut i guess your just to special to realize that it isnt about you its about getting information out to everybody img
this is what we are up to  three days of meetings in icelandtoday is the final day trebors updates day 2 is here are all we have time to produce while we are here aside from a few of us that are using twitter to do live updates from time to time during the sessions we will all be flying home this weekend and will then start sorting out the official minutes that will probably take 24 weeks depending on peoples rl work schedules and reviewing them for nda stuff i will work up a blog early next week detailing what i can about the summit as a whole prior to that
thank you trebor and seleene at least you have made it clear that csm is actually working stay the course keep up the good work csm to drake people looking for quick and instant fixes and feedback are being totally unrealisticnot every post made by a csm member must have content specific to your likes drakean informational about what is being done and which events are being attended is just that  an informationali suspect that even when the minutes are released you will have something negative to say about that toocoo  bene gesserit chapterhouse ceo  sanctuary pact alliance
not very thrilling as we already had a lot of talking and not doing on this issue being replaced now with nda talking and even less doing
thanks for keeping us updated i dont ever remember hearing anything at all this fastkeep up the good work
you are very funny i love your arguments i am sure you arent an idiot and a troll because you use arguments trols are funny though
hmm did i say somewhere that pvp should be banned or something why cant someone have tons of pvp in low sec or 00why cant someone have tons of pvp in low sec or 00 read befor you answerto have pvp whenever and where you decide sure not
you wanna play with words i mean pvp as killing noobs for easy kils tears and making fun of  noobs plenty of pvp oportunities outside of high sec why dont you use them
are you a ccp alt to keep us believing that killing noobs in high sec is a good idea and you dont have to go to low sec and 00what stops you having kills in low sec and 00 maybe you suck at pvp
nice that we agree arent there any markets in lowsec and 00
sure i agree this thread is about to change the rules of pseudo pvp in high sec some people just dont have balls to fight in low sec or 00 they only can compete against industry noobs can you read are you scared to pvp outside of high sec do you feel safer while harassing industry noobs tell me more about your fears im sure i can help you
ah he is one of those high sec people you ganked me therefore you cant possibly pvp in anyway hurr durr
nope nobody ganked me can you answer the question what stops you having pvp in 00 or low sec
nothing has ever stopped me pvping in low sec or 00 but why shouldnt i be able to pvp in high sec
if nothing stops you pvping in low sec or 00 why dont you go there than to pvp why do you need to blow up a noob miner who does not even have skils to pvpwhy should someone not be able to run incursions for example cause he is wardeced why should a 2 days old noob get ganked why should someone pvp without wanting itwhy shouldnt there be a safe place where new players can evolve to what he wants you want pvplow sec00you want incursions missions indy mining etc you are a new player  hig sec and formost how exactly gonna stop a small corp a wardec no way to do it with the new expansion until the aggressor accepts a surrender the wardec goes on foreverif you want more raisons let me know
i agree with the principal concept but not for the solution pvp need to be allowed in hi sec war system now is nice player that gank other people in hi sec need more severe punishment much more severe
because heshe might be unwittingly supplying minerals to my enemiesbecause that person may be the alt character of one of my enemies and is using the income from incursions to fund his warstruggle against me has very shiny loot and i want it and dont want to be forced to deal with the market or incursions to get it that person insultedshot atlooked at me funny and so i want revenge for honor and anything shiny i pick up from hisher loot is a bonusit teaches the nubbin very early on that eve is not like other mmos that you can be engaged anytime anywhere and that its generally not a good idea to carry so much fancy stuff in one ship without taking precautions ahead of time because the moment you create safe places in eve will be the same moment that everyone and their mother will move their manufacturing and support to said safe place thus creating logistics operations that are invulnerable and can continually support ones enemies indefinitely incursions are not new player content far from itmining and industry can be done in low and nullsec too its just that more people do it in highsec 00 alliances included due to the hassle of the rules of engagementkemal ataturk saidand formost how exactly gonna stop a small corp a wardec no way to do it with the new expansion until the aggressor accepts a surrender the wardec goes on foreverunderstand something combat and pvp can be performed in a variety of ways not just straight shiponship combat this is especially so when it comes to corporations peoples skills can go a long way to getting rid of an unwanted war dec as does humor all you have to do is not be an entitled asshat and work with your attackers to find a mutually agreeable solution and yes this does require you to swallow you pride to some degree and yes it isnt really fair but guess what eve was not designed to be faireve is the only game where it is perfectly allowable to throw sand in your enemys face to gain the upper hand
maybe you should get a free allocation of minerals of your choosing after downtime every day too or perhaps a free hulk when you achieve the skills required to fly it  off and stop ruining my eve because of your inability to use common sense andor situational awareness to your advantage let alone take the time to educate yourself about how the game works just because you dont understand how it works doesnt mean it should be changed to the way you want it to worktldr why is this type of crap posting even allowed in the assembly hall
eve  everyone vs everyone everything you do in eve is related to competing with your neighbor while mining or mission running or industry dont involve shooting your neighbor they affect him this game allows you to use aggression wars suicide ganking etc to attack anyone thereby limiting their influence restricting their activites so you can game the system and get ahead look at events like hulkageddon while it caters to the schoolyard bullies of society its effects modify the entire market it psychologically changes how many players approach the game and is a fundamental sandbox driver i totally understand why people dont like getting ganked or war decced by a random third party but learning how to deal with it is a fundamental part of eve this is not like other mmos where the developers protect you in this game you are responsible for protecting yourself the developers provide many many tools available to you so you can protect yourself remember conflict is the biggest driver in eve anything that creates more conflict is seen as a great positive and artificial limits on conflict are seen as undesired
you have recieved no support the entire time this thread has been up stop pushing no one wants thislet this thread die gracefully like you should
thank you all for keeping this thread aliveim so glad that it has received so much attentionso many of you deserve a darwin awardfight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
did ccp put them there to look pretty or create a security zone we call high secfight them until turmoil is no more and strike terror into their hearts wwwrossfwnet
do you ever post anything constructive are your parents beating you are you fat do you eat to much candies maybe someone stolen your pet
this thread doesnt deserve to be on this forum let alone in assembly hall
surrely i will not post this sort of thing with my main and i dont espect that who reply do so dont troll me about thati played eve forwellsince 2008 so four years with pauses of course long and short i think that im seasoned enough for some simple and logic observationi sperimented the pew pew side of the game in all sec type of space and the carabear side as miner and tech 2 crafter so im quite neutral about the all the questions of yeah a carabear kill him or mmm those roids are juicy but im worried about the evolution of eventthe ccp powered destroyer ships type and goons catch the momentum for start the biggest hukageddon event that this game got so far why isk of course they controll the right moon goo for earn much more than 100m for 10 exhumers destroyed but this isnt the problem hulkageddon isnt the problem personally i found that really fun as event but not as routine but this is only my considerations and since game mechanics allow it  the problem is that 3 t1 ship value is around 15m with shiny t2 fitting have a sure gank even in hi sec if the targhet is an exhumer not only hulk even mackinaw that is even more fragile that worth 200300m and got income even if they lose ship after they got concorded cause the insurance and the loot goons bonus a part a modulated strip miner worth 56m you know this created a loophole on the efficency of hi sec mining for those that dont know 6570 of minerals in eve are made by reprocessing thing the problem is that reprocess lack of tritanium and pyerite needed in mass for the production of ships and modules so the other 20about are made in hi sec for trit mostly now we got much less miner cause they dont undock for fear and of course the price of all modules and ships will go up due the lackness of mineralsminer question dont even try to tell me just stay focused and dont afk mine check your scanner and this kinda of bullshit mining is already boring rewrite the mining sistem if you dont want afk miner now spam the button of system scanner is too much crazy for me usually i study when mine for raise 2040m in hi sec an hulk need one our of mining how you expect that a miner stay one our to click the scan button and another thing have a tanking hulk for those who dont know even how a hulks work mean much less mineral mined for a ship that should be specialized in mining and even a tanking one dont resist at 3 destroyers 15m and profict even if concordedthe main problem isnt for old player that already got all the ship that he wanted and the right buisness for replace those the main problem is new players missions will not pay enought for allow him to replace his shity t1 cruisermy proposal is to rebalance ships like exhumers for adapt them with the powered destroyers not eliminate the hisec ganking is part of gamesorry for my bad spelling and gramm english isnt my strenght
those destroyers already get no insurance just sayingwhy should a civilian non combat craft be able to stand up to multiple pure combat ships anyway cost is not a factor in ship balancing the last time they tried to use it as one we got supercaps remember that
bullshit cost is allways a factor of balancing as everyone know in eve particulary for exhumers cause those ship should bring you money no one will mine more if a ship that cost 300m can be popped in hi sec from one that cost 5m exhumers are not fighiter ship you made an investment if you buy one if this investment in crappy you dont buy itcivilian non combat ship arent we tired of those sort of  for pilot an hullk you need toons of skill and money i dont see where is the civilian side in that a vexor is a mining cruiser like the osprey those are considered civiliani dont care what you use or who you are make nonstupid and nongoliardic observation please or dont answer
cost isnt a factor in balancehulk pilots should stop being morons and take some precautions like everyone else
already asnwered to your observation
so no reply no solution no more trolling or insultbumpthis is a real problem miner profession will be no more cause every player start in hi sec no one will begine the miner profession cause is unsafe risky and non profictable even in hi sec this cause some old and bored players that got too much skillpoint are too coward for do pvp where needed 00 cause goons are too much powerfull cause you dont whant to risk your slave implant set cause your carrier cost too much or you dont have the balls for be 10 sec status and be a low sec piratebullshit the first people that should stop to be moron are hisec ganker they dont want that destroyed be nerfed again they dont want that exhumers will be improved they dont want that noobs live and say them that eve is a bad game cause everything is unsafegankers tears
as an ex miner turned pirate and 10 most hulk pilots are idiots and take no precautions they dont tank or watch dscan price is not a balancing factor it is decided by market forces alone and is ever changing if price decided balance eve would no longer be eve everyone would sit in invulnerable expensive ships and pop anything cheaper because they are able to due to their priceganking has gone on for years and yet people still mine and they will continue to regardless of whether the ganking continues or noti will admit that mining is boring though and it should be something ccp changes so it isnt so mind numbingevil if i were creating the world i wouldnt mess about with butterflies and daffodils i would have started with lasers eight oclock day one zaps one of his minions accidentally minion screams
now this is the first serious replyccp should invent something for keep a miner in front of the monitor so they can stay on alertbut this question has been raised a lot of time and a lot of time ccp do nothing or very little for solve the problem and i dont think that they will solve that soon or everso problem sussistsure it would be great invent a new mining metod a challenging one not one that if you dont afk mine you should keep your eyes on the strip cicle
lyris nairn were looking at you  you great spamming biatch lol
thank you for the support everyone please keep it comingin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
i suggest we limit your stupidity with a biomassing
after you dear friend the forums might actually attract more people willing to discuss differences once comedians like yourself leave
sbus should die in a fire as should all ehpgrind based mechanics
i cant see goons abusing the ability to make 250 falcon fleets with out the risk of concord in hisec
looks good jack i still support this idea keep up the good work the csm should support this and do should the devs
i was once counting the seconds it took to jump from a gate to another systems gate in a kessie w increased wd speedit wasnt pretty i think it was near 1530 seconds for something that according to 83 au warp should have taken like 2 secondsi think they should increase the accelerationdeceleration immensely at least with rigs or something
i have to agree with this guy it might look great when youve got cinematography to highlight how great it looks but in practicality it might not turn out as well
when i said i dont see why not i meant for this rather than killrights against an entire corp which is sillyin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
this would make the beginnings of war so much coolerwhy would you remove such a thing who cares about politics a man will fight harder for his interests than for his rights napoleon
i too would like to see corpse names again it would be really nice if you release a reason for these changes at leastfrom my research it appears this change was made whether intentionally or not i am not aware in crucible patch 11
afk tag in local brilliant
love it
and all your defensive pvp support for your mining ops would do nothing to stop even a halfaed alpha strike from a few bored suicide gankers  just saying  realizing you are really talking more about nullsec than hisec tho ofc
ill take that one it takes me about 3 mins to get a full rundown on how many towersships are in a hostile wh without using probes with a long range probe or two its less then 20 seconds usually
and i thought i wrote walls of text
it is working as designedintended losing t2 has economic repercussions just like t3 has economic repercussions and loss of sp
let me see if i got this right you mine while actively aligned tell me how long do you stay in range of any roid that wayill say it again you will not escape someone with hot mods who drops on you directly mining ship vs dessie  dead mining ship in nearly all cases about the only way to survive this is if i get horribly stupid in the attack
protip you dont mine while actively alignedyou cant as you will move out of range of the rocks in less time then it takes to complete more then a cycle or two using strip miners anyone who claims they can probably should have brown eyes as theyre full of it and before someone gets uppity about this ive gone mining in a fully tanked hulk and i still didnt survive the brutix that landed on top me courtesy of the covops scout sitting  10km off meas for the rest of the thread all im hearing is bleating coming from the gankers who think they know everything sorry the whole lot of you are being shortsighted at best if you honestly think that youre absolutely right about everything someone is going to use a sledgehammer and disabuse you of that notion
funny all i hear is bleating from carebears because they cant make endless amounts of isk without any risk
yeah lots of carebears in eve apparently they have to go to hisec to battle harden themselves into full blown grizzly bears
man goes up to you in your face and blows it away on a busy street what are you going to do about it
you seem to have forgotten something criticalveterans get new players to reroll using the invite a friend deal to get a free plex up to 10 per account that is not how ccp wants that deal to be used it is for getting new players who are not already playing eve to join but that is not what is going onthe players who are working that borderlineexploit dont want new player to stay they only want them to subscribe so that they get their free plex x10 and dont care if the players quit indeed the higher the turnover of new players the better for that nearscam and lets be real every player doing that with 10 new players costs ccp us150 in lost real subscriptions for players who ccp had already spent the money to effectively recruit via its advertising spendbottom line this game needs new players to stay stop making excuses for greifers using nolose pvp to drive new casual and social players out of the gamefor the record what was i doing before downtime mining in null sec love those 800000 isk belt rats that i can and do mine in null does not mean there is not a problem in highsec its a problem if you dont like my proposed solutions then dream up more to fix ithow about a dual corp token system that allows players to jump to the corp home null base or wh and home base high once per day each so that people can get to null easier to mine and home to high easier to pve null sec rats are too hard for many new players
there is a daily token its called jump clone you can use it once every 24 hours you can even make it for free at a rorq or eacs
the fact that this may be happening is a different issue altogether it is not relevant to the op there are always going to be unscrupulous users that will take advantage of promotions this obviously isnt hurting ccp too badly because if it were they would have found a resolution to it by now i doubt the people involved want to see eve go out of business i also doubt its being done as much as you claim the main reason i doubt its being done so frequently is because nothing stands to be gained from doing this the scammer as you would call them is only getting a month of service in exchange for a plexthe fact that you mine in null sec has little relevance null sec mining is more profitable than high sec mining therefore its more desirable to mine in null sec it is a problem indeed but its your problem there are plenty of miners who get by just fine if youre too lazystupid to figure out how to avoid suicide gankers that is your problem and is not cause for extremist changes to the game that very few actually wantthis mechanic already exists via jump clones the fact you dont already know this suggests you know very little about the game indeed i had absolutely no problems ratting in null sec anomalies with a 2 million skill point character so your argument that null sec rats are too hard for many new players is moot not to mention the fact that null sec isnt exactly aimed at new playersyou seem to have forgotten many of the game mechanics and basic logic or maybe you just didnt bother researching the basic game mechanics
alt in a hyenanext question
wow you seem to be missing the whole point if i want you dead youre going to be dead it doesnt matter how many ways you try to stop it a ganker will kill you if they want toohere is one for you bs drops on top of both your ships and starts smartbombing hyena pops you lose your web hulk pops because you cant warp off suddenlyno matter how you slice it you will lose both ships and most likely the pods tooand yet again people using alts to try and keep from getting killed still get killedill state it again if i want you dead you will be dead nothing will prevent it the sooner you get that concept through the sooner we can move on to a proper discussion
1 by making intl shared between fleet members it rewards those who are already in fleet if you are in a fleet together you moreless are working together it also means youre more capable to form up a response gang it also provides a way to share intel with nonalliance members 2 but you do know who is friendly mostly thats the point of the standings system 3 you might still want this it just means his intel is shared with his fleet members too gathering information on your opponents shouldnt be completely handed to you on a silver platter have tools to share the intel you took the time to gather makes that intel much more valuable to everyone you share it with

what irc can or can not do is not the point here the point is that in eve if you want somthing better you go take it or if you cant take it get some friends to help you take it if you want to talk about what tnt could do on their own lets take it to caod
i thought the point was to draw people to null  not crap on the ones here  you take the alloys and replace it with bounties ok kool what ever but now even the non minersbuilders have to mine or ship in mine cuz you cant get drops to refine or even a hauler spawn i dont get it  as for taking new space been there done that been in them fights since late 08 why cant we just fix the fix and make it alittle closer to the 2nd worse area
i do agree that the nerf bat might have beed swung to har on the drone regions deal with it
this post is too long if that offends you please dont read it and save us both a flame warlooking at the whole minerganker debacle raging in full force on the forums i cant support either extreme opinion complaining about gankers being able to attack in the first place shows a blatant disregard of what the game really is in favour of what you think it should be like which is silly blaming miners for all the ills of the game is just as silly not to mention that willingly participating in rolecide on that scale is not terribly wise in the long runbut why do miners mine solo and afk in the first placesuppose you were carrying a big money bag across town would you go alone you would probably hire a bodyguard what would that bodyguard do were you to be attacked in worse parts of town theyd pull the gun on the attacker and probably fire preventively in selfdefense in better parts of town theyd shield you with their bodies and then pull the gun on the attacker anyway once the intent to harm is clearin eve whatever bodyguards the miners might hire are out of either option anywhere outside nullsec where they can just bubble the gate into the system andor filter the much shorter local list where nonblues are readily apparent they cant preventively shoot anyone in high sec because they get concorded immediately and giving them that option in any fashion would open untold potential for abuse they sort of can shoot first in lowsec but they get a sec status hit for it and eventually become outlaws if they keep it up which isnt good for business they cant shield anyone with their body in any way and they cant stop the alpha strike before the deed is actually done since all it takes is one or two cycles since its all about alpha keeping a logi up on the miner wont really do much good as logi wont cycle fast enoughsince bodyguards are useless mining solo becomes the most sensible option to maximise profit while minimising risk and doing that alone is more boring than watching paint dry so naturally going afk becomes preferable getting people to play in groups is desirable in any mmo  its the whole point telling miners to fit a proper tank when they should instead depend on other people for protection sounds counterproductive  isnt that what the heavy industrial and mining ships are paper thin forbut what if bodyguards could actually bodyguard by shielding with their bodies suggestions to enable that have been offered in various forms mostly involving sharing of damage and shield directly or indirectly in some fashion or shooting down incoming damage some suggesting special ship types for it however that approach is highly problematic because whatever protection goes on would be so universally useful that it would drastically alter the face of combat all over with consequences inducing a balancing nightmarebut another solution comes to mindcontinued in the next post
lets try something a bit less universal and individually swap the targets instead the miner or whichever other industrial target needs protecting equips an active mid slot ewar module called lock redirector lock redirector may only be fitted onto industrial and mining ships requires a special skill to use and has a 10 second reactivation timer but can cycle indefinitely once turned on as long as theres cap the bodyguard equips another high slot module called lock beacon lock beacon cannot be fitted onto anything bigger than a battlecruiser  in fact requires a battlecruiser or a command ship being a special warfare link module and requiring leadership skills to use a lock beacon balloons the sig of the user not unlike an mwd and possibly even higher this penalty is always active lock redirector needs to be activated on a target ship in the same fleet which obviously needs to be locked first that has a fitted lock beacon it has a very short range say under 5km the skill may boost this range up to 10km at level v while lock redirector is active on a lock beacon the lock beacon ship suffers a penalty to ship agility one lock beacon may be the target of multiple lock redirector signals but staying within their respective ranges is their problem the aforementioned penalties to ship agility stackany attempt to lock the target equipped with an active lock redirector will instead lock the ship with the lock beacon its activated on using the penalised sig of that ship  what you click the target button on is the miner but what your computer instead ends up locking is his bodyguard npc rats drones fof missiles anything except player ships themselves is immune to this effectexpected results of the introduction of these two modules are as followsit is actually feasible to shield a weak high value target with a harder lower value bodyguard but keeping the protection up requires concerted action and attention from participants lest they drift out of range miners need to come with bodyguards to be safe or at least splurge for an extra alt  and since it needs a battlecruiser they cant use a free trial account either and mining under guard becomes a considerably more tactically complicated affair that is feasible in wider range of sec status systems hopefully making everyone a bit less bored suicide ganking in highsec does not become impossible nobody becomes invulnerable  killing protected targets is merely more tactically difficult regardless of location you will need to use smartbombs which dont require a target lock or ecm bursts which break lock redirector locks on the bodyguard or you can bump the protection targets out of range of their bodyguard  who has an agility penalty and cant easily maneuver to keep up you can simply endeavour to kill the bodyguard fast enough and attacking protected targets becomes considerably more interesting and challenging killing unprotected targets remains as trivial as it was if they cant find anyone to guard them too bad this set of modules does nothing for freighters which cant fit modules in the first place or combat ships which cannot be protected in this fashion because they cant fit the lock redirector at the same time it enables escorting a smaller industrial with a ship that can actually protect it disincentivising using freighters when protected smaller ships can do bettermeh who am i kidding its the forums whens the last time people supported anything constructive
i like the idea of some way to take a bullet for another ship
the problem i see with this is it isnt worth the effort required to do this you would either have to get other players involved who are willing to babysit your miner and they probably arent going to want to do it without pay its going to be quite a boring task for both parties mining is already boring and so is watching someone mine the income of mining would make this unworthwhile the other option is using an alt this would require that the miner be actively paying attention to whats going on in order to be effective which miners dont do now because of the income of mining i think the only possible issues with mining right now are the facts that its very boring and very low incomeas a result mining is usually done semiafk this isnt a very big issue as long as it can continue to be done semiafk with low risk and its very possible to do so if you take the time to find a system that isnt likely to be traveled by gankers or find a belt to mine in where youre not likely to be the target of choice i think mining could use a little bit of work but overall as long as it can be done semiafk with low risk which it can then its not something that needs to be completely overhauled i do think mining could use an income boost but i also think that changes have already been made that will bring an income boost to miners it will just take some time before the effects of these changes are fully realized
i mostly agree with this statement but the biggest benefit of the proposed system isnt that highsec mining becomes safer it does but whether its worth the expense is very situational but that it will enable practical mining in cases where it would be an unsustainable risk otherwise ie welltraveled lowsec a mining op into lowsec with ships guarded in this manner will greatly increase the probability of survival of mission critical incomegenerating ships get people in combat ships for extended periods into known static locations ie belts and ensure fights not unlike fw plexing in its current incarnation does  you need to stick around the complex beacon to gain your reward and your opponent needs to kill you first before they can push the beacon the other waysimilarly when youre guarding your miners in a lowsec belt a gang of pirates warping in on you cant lock them until they ecm burst them off you or kill you and the miners get enough time to warp off while you cant run yourself and by the time you can youre pointed down
first i would like to say thank you your someone who recognises their is a problem with the way high sec suicide ganking works and how it doesnt really fit into the way combat in eve works your also someone who recognises high sec shouldnt be safe and carebears dont need some drastic change to to their safety but rather something subtle you dont often get these two qualities from posts about this particular subjectim going to tentitively say that i like the idea in theory but i cant help but think there might be a slightly simpler way of accomplishing this the idea of having two differant mods on two seperate ships in order for them to have their desired effect seems odd to me somehow probably because there is nothing in eve that i can think of that works in this way alreadyin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
simpler solution revoke concord protection for ganker permanently separate from sec status as long as sec is not low faction police will not harass you youll just live without concord protection
well let me explain my logic in detail and maybe youll offer a better alternative somewhere1 the problem with suicide ganking isnt that its possible and isnt even that miners are the most common target  its that mining and industrial ships have very low hp suggesting that they need protection but such protection is impossible to render because of how game mechanics works there are ways to punish the assailant but no way to offer a reasonable chance to prevent the loss anywhere except the strictly controlled nullsec space which restricts industrial gameplay in general to where npcs at least provide very very certain punishment or to where players can lock down the entire system its not that nobody mines in lowsec its that too few people do so that is the real problem isnt the high sec concord mechanics and isnt the low ehp of industrial ships but how they all interact with the damage mechanicsindustrial players need to be able to calculate risk and bet on surviving after having taken measures to do so like everyone else can from the general mmo design logic it is far more desirable for these measures to involve other players once it can be done they wont restrict themselves to highsec anywhere so much and theres lots of incentives in lowsec already more fun for everyone no need for extra universe2 sharing or preventing the actual damage easily creates a balancing nightmare and can make industrial players simply invulnerable which is no fun switching the target to a harder ship is a sweet spot  it mitigates risk but can be countered by specific fits and tactics at specific tradeoffs most industrial ships tank with their mids lows taken by missioncritical modules they shouldnt need to sacrifice a mid slot for this ability to share someone elses tank sounds right this module should be active directed at a specific ship and limited at the very least to the same grid for obvious reasons limiting its distance so that the target and the bodyguard have to huddle together enables specific countertactics  makes it feasible to bump them out of range or smartbomb them both requiring the module to be activated on a target makes ecm burst a specific counter making rats immune to it simplifies programming and ensures that industrial ships cant get away with bodyguard as their only tank3 it should be impossible to exploit this mechanic to become untargetable at the expense of an unaware third party or otherwise misuse it  unintended consequences can be gamebreaking someone will find a way to pollute the sanbox into uselessness otherwise bodyguard must be very aware of his role in the team and its consequences however it is desirable that the bodyguard needs no extra interface elements for it  that is easier to code this is easiest to accomplish by making him fit a module too and requiring both ships to be in the same fleet which takes care of all confirmations required this module can be passive so the bodyguard doesnt have to worry about it4 it should be possible for the bodyguard to survive an overwhelming assault for long enough to offer his charges a reasonable chance to warp out what this mechanic really does is not preventing damage to them but preventing them from being pointed while they align but it should also be possible but hard to bring enough firepower to just crush them all sufficiently fast cruiser hulls are generally too weak for the purpose and baiting battleship builds can offer truly silly amounts of ehp on par with structures so battlecruiser sized hulls are the sweet spot making the receiving module a high slot warfare link module seems logical then since those hulls are meant for them in the first place it shouldnt be possible to fit it into a capital ship but thats obvious  no need for capships at this party its for small gangs5 ballooning sig radius of the bodyguard ensures that the bullet they take for their charges actually hits the mark and adjusting the exact penalty value can be used to finetune the whole equation to desired survivability of the bodyguard under fire so that the charges can warp off with a desired known probability if a known amount of dps shows up it also has the side effect of making the mechanic useful to guard a hauler  hauler needs to be able to lock use the redirector module on it quickly for this sig ballooning will take care of that agility penalty is a roundabout soft limit on the number of charges a bodyguard can handle simultaneously  the less agile they are the harder it is for the charges to keep range while they do their thing so you cant reasonably protect too many ships with just one battlecruiser lockout timer on the redirector module penalises piloting errors and afk playingi wanted to be thorough when formulating this 
well reasoned i still cant see any problems or holes in it it covers almost everyones concerns as such you have my full support having said that i still believe the problem can be sorted by adding more dire consequences to suicide gankingnot quite this harsh though in the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
and you seem to love being deliberately obtuse not unusual with you these days are you going to be buying orcas and the skill books needed to train them for all the new players you must be feeling generous these days now back under your bridge troll op the premise appears sound but thats just at first glance i dont like this particular angle on how to mitigate some of the rampant flipping personally i dont want it to go away in its current form you make several good points however i cant support it like thisid say a complete rework after checking out both sides of how the mechanics relating to this work would be in order but im not expecting much in the way of changes

i support thisi support this very much as welli too would like to see more communication from ccp more communication from ccp would actually help their cause quite a bit people wouldnt be so pissed off about the glorified inventory if they knew there was a goal behind it that would benefit the game overall however there has been little communication on ccps part regarding this and as a result the only information players have to form an opinion from is the information sitting right in front of them and that information tells them the new inventory sucks nothing moreas far as drake whining because trebor didnt provide information on every second of the meetings for reasons beyond his control get over it its communication it tells people a little bit about whats going on with the meetings im sure trebor would love to tell you every detail of the discussions that took place but he is unable to do that for multiple reasons being an  about it isnt going to change that nor is it going to encourage more communication
hey thanks to all the csm for the update on whats going on and what was talked about trebor what little you said sparked my interestas for drake the douchbag you need to shut up and quit being a hypocritical piece of  i dont normally post on the fourms but enough is enough you need to quit being a cry baby all you do is  and complain and when something dont go your way you throw a temper tantrum like a two year old kid you wonder why the csm dont pay attention to you just look at how you act now back to the csm thank you for all your hard work and for the update on the summit
are you scared to pvp outside of high sec do you feel safer while harassing industry noobs tell me more about your fears im sure i can help youquotemy fears are that players that have no clue will try to have this game turned into a less hardcore game than it is it could be more hardcoreso if you want to help me stop postnig  proposals like this andor biomass you toon sooner rather than later
ohhh you dont mean remove pvp kemal  you mean remove hisec ganking  well i dont advocate removing it  even though it entirely breaks the risk vs reward mantra everyone likes to believe in  gankers have zero risk since they are after all planning to blow up their own ships in exchange for the tears and loot of those who do actually risk their expensive ships id say just make them kos for a full 24 hours  and give everyone a nice blinky warpto point that follows them around
i hate concordthat being said i think the solution to eves problem of law and unlawful balancing should take a look to freelancer and freelancer mods freelancer has both trading and combat its an excellent game to play if per say your waiting for your battleship skills to train and you just cant take thinking about piloting it anymorei think interdiction should be easier and more player involved i think it should become more frequently able usable etc by npcs and pvp to counter this there should be certain specific this can be done such as a deep space communication relay that a playerunlawful npc used to amplify interdiction signalsthese locations are static generally halfway in between major locationshubs iein between a gate and a station the higher the security the higher the likelihood and strength of lawful npc groups and the lower the security the lower frequency but higher intensity fights the fights in lower security would really depend on players attempting to fly in between locations and their pirate counterparts which would be inevitablein addition to being easier to interdict it should also be noted some sort of antiwarp scrambling device should most likely be added much less paralyzing compared to warp stabilizers which kill your range ridiculously muchas is concord really doesnt do anything in my opinion except stop the flow of the game in a more logical cop vs robber mentality a constant good vs evil which should naturally happen is somehow relegated relatively to corporations and alliances i really dont enjoy the thought of you either die or you dont die i often feels like theres not enough gray area and complexity in eves warpnavigation in between systems you arent really forced to meet pirate scum unless they are camping at gates which i think should start to be discouraged by lawful races by fighting not omg concord concord boom or boom take the plexsconcords coming whew we escaped if concord is so strong its a really really bizarre universe
i believe concord is there to enforce ethics and morals in hisec which means the players do not have to create and enforce their own ethics and moralsi could see the idea of removing concord it makes everyone fair gamethen people start realizing that if they want to get in something more than an ibis they will actually have to setup their own game ethics and morals and actually think about not shooting each other

i agree completely with philomatheusalso this is not merely about graphics as philomatheus and others have mentioned its about broken travel mechanics anyone who has played other spacesims is probably liable to be extremely perturbed by this games travel mechanics even ignoring visuals also im sorry but the warp tunnels dont really impress me i would prefer a warp graphics effect more closely to freelancer gates starlancer warp etc

so mr invincible how do you deal with gankers who use an orca or cloaked battleship to bump you off warp remember they know where you are and where you are going youre aligned any cloaked scout can see all they need is a bookmark in the right place and mass directly between you and your destination personally weve been looking at combat orca fits to kill bomber squadrons but thats null sec fun and games bottom line you seem to think there is a way to be perfectly safe mining that if you believe the counterarguments would be as wrong from a game design point of view as it is simply not true bumping someone off their warp alignment happens right before the alpah strike warps in and the ship bumping is not flagged in any way that does not mean they didnt just get you killed however pcarebears pay us and buy plex to play be nice to the sheep  you can only have so many wolves and so few sheep before the wolves get very hungry and bored oh wait they already got so bored in null that they invented hulkageddon to give themselves something to do gee guess the game is at its zenith of pvp huh p
hulk is already in warp by the time the bs gets out of warp ill add in mining well away from the warpin point and leaving a can over at it to decloak too if you likei am well aware that if someone wants me dead i already am there are however steps that can be taken to make it harder for them wasting a smartbomb bs on one solitary hulk instead of a swarm of macks in any ice field you like thats one of those ways it wont deter someone whos determined to get me and me alone but honestly its not about making my hulk invulnerable its about making the guy want to shoot yours instead
perhaps 1 billboard at each gatestationyou pay to display it so many times an hour rates go up depending on jumps in system
im very much for the idea of advert prices scaling with the average populations of systems either that or some kind of bidding system like the buy order system where your adverts display a certain amount depending on how far down the auction rank you are with either of these two options imagine the isk sink from the adverts in jita we would really see who the 1 were that way
i believe that the use of shortcuts is beneficial to game immersion and reduces impacts on ui changesit also allows you to reach to your objective much faster than with all those mouse clicks on the windowsid like to suggestshortcuts for corp hangarscurrently there are no shortcuts to open corporate hangarsthere should be a way to set a shortcut to open a specific corporate hangar tab one of those 7also in space this shortcut would open the closest corporate hangar bay which is not in your current shipdifferent shortcuts should also be available for opening the corporate hangar tabs of your current shipthe servers stores your shortcuts configmake a way to store the client shortcuts settings in the serversit is a pain to reconfig all shortcut settings after a new game release  full installmany other client configs could also be stored in the servers but this discussion belongs to another threadps i have eve installed on 3 different computers which scales this problem proportionally
interesting  inventory shortcuts
but why created cpu rigs when thats is unuseable 
true a lot of caldari ships need some love but i am focused on the kestrel right now and since ccp is rebalancing frigates they need to take a look at the kestrel

i agree somewhatwhy only for cloaking what about a sound for the end of session timers like aggression etc or when your hold is full of ore for when research is completeit would be great to be able to add sound alerts to events  a tool to select the sound and add it to the event would be a fine addition but it should be client side like your overview settinga neat object oriented tool to add sound alerts but why get so complexthe game is so broad you dont want to open the floodgates cluttering the gui simply have an elegant tool with conditionals that filter the events only setting off an alert when the match is found
supported  this has no effect on afk cloakers and simply fixes a ui issueusing overview is also a great idea  after they get rid of the limit on having no more than 5 overview tabs another horrible interface issue that needs fixing

this thread is going placesi have an easy solution to deal with an afk cloaker move your rattingmining to another system if the afk cloaker moves with you he is no longer afkthat was the protip of the day now stop whining and learn how to adapt to the game and other players in the game dont demand that ccp change the game because you are bad at eve

this if your not comfortable moving from the system theyre in to another one to do your ratting mining etc then you really shouldnt be out of highsecto be honest im not flatly against some kind of mothed of reducing the effect of afk cloakers in systems i just think all the suggestions made so far are terrible i also think most of you are crying over spilt milk afk cloakies has always been a part of gameplay for me never really done it myself but ive always had to deal with them ive layed traps for and killed three of them and never been killed by oneive also carried on with life in system as usual most of the time because we have standing fleets and lots of people active in system usually admittedly not where i am nowin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

id love a scanning aspect to mining fully support this proposal thanks eidric for you careful and well thought out postplease see link for more along the same linesthanks for doing this for us all
thank you for your comments unfortunately this project of mine was a bit rushed  i was about midway in finalizing it when i heard about upcoming summit as such ive tried putting this on forums so csm would be able to see this before they head outi did look at the link and only thing i slightly disagree with is on board scanner  since it will allow bots to continue working as they are now until the scanner would start to require precise direction to achieve results it will remain botfriendlyi would also like to stress out that the sites have to be large but despawn quickly  in such a way that single hulk will not mine out the entire site before it despawns reason  it allows formation of mining fleets similar to incursion design  come in fast mine at incredible rates and move out even in hisec that way the new players will have an incentive to actually form fleets and socialize more they are not punished by going alone but rewarded while coming as a team
agreed  later on in that thread there was a consensus that the dscan option wasnt viable and that these mining sites should need to be scanned downit adds support to your proposal there has already been some debate here and a probe option was considered very strong for finding belts
bidding on time slots for the boards i like that idea it would make it an isk seek but keep it competitive at the same time also set a the base bid price by the average traffic in the same system over a set time frame

how is wanting to change the whole system of jetcan mining exploit in the miners favor accepting the risk of jetcan miningfyi if someone takes something out of my trashcan and i decide i want it back break into their home and take it guess whos going to jail jetcans can be seen as garbage cans they belong to you and everything inside technically belongs to you but can be assumed to be up for grabs as you show that you no longer want it in all seriousness jetcan mining is risky for all the reasons mentioned in the op as others have pointed out there are better ways to go about mining

you can still use cpu rigs the calibration cost on them might have somthing to do with halacing in regarts to the fitting you coul make otherwise just saing
no just because they dont behave how you want them to and just because you cant see the justification in their calibration cost does not mean its like that for no good reason i suspect ccp determined that stacking them they way you do acrs allowed unintended fits and adjusted calibration accordingly

yeah would be nice theres also other agents that need looked at as well cosmos agents  need to display the correct standing requirement for access in their agent info they should also issue a warning message to players stating if mission is declined it wont be offered again that message should appear with a yesno option each time a player declines a cosmos mission offeravrue auz  agent listed on the certificate gained at gallente data centers gives players an item avrues token for completing her missions that item is supposed to be given to another agent boismevier mals for continuing the chainhowever that agent isnt available thus the chain is broken er unfinishedpatch notes for apocrypha released 10 march 2009 item description for avrues token now jeremy tacs  1 of 2 concord agents left in game that offers a mission for security status increase that mission offer was recently deactivated due to a bug allowing players to farm his mission cosmos bpcs  these need to be redone such as lowering the amount of special materials required thats listed on the bpcs or at least make those special materials more readily availablestoryline modules  these need to have their attributes increased to correctly represent their meta level as it is right now most storyline modules are equal to meta level 3 modules yet the storyline modules are listed as meta level 6 or 7anyway theres other issues as well the event agents their missions and their rewards definitely need some ccp love and attention
no way but afk tag on local is fine
afk tags wont fix anything because alot of afk cloakies looking to kill people will sit in an anomaly waiting for someone stupid to turn up and then kill them it will say they are afk but they can still see when you turn up if your running an anomaly that a cloaky went afk in you will still get no warning before they attack you because they wont be notafk until they move the mouse to uncloak and attack you also you could just jam something in the keyboard and the afk tag wont show upnot only that but the afk tag will cause problems suicide ganking in highsec will become easier for example that freighter who is autopiloting is also afk easy target or that hulk pilot is afk hell never see us coming if you want to support these kind of changes then go ahead but you wont get my support it also detracts from infogathering and the normal tactics associated with pvp if someone is looking for fights in null sees a system with one person in space on the map and jump into that system to see 12 people in local they will wonder if they can pull off a kill without people turning up to support them with an afk tag they will instantly see the other 11 arnt going to come to the person in spaces aidalso it just doesnt make sence to have afk tags from a lore perspective gates control local chat the information is given out by them how exactly do you justify a gate knowing whether the pilot of a ship in local is paying attention answer is you dont because you cantafk cloakies have never been a problem to me because we have always had systems in place to deal with them if you cant deal with them then you shouldnt be where the afk cloakies are also i am getting fed up with people replying to my posts without reading what i have written or putting together sensible arguements please think before you hate thank youin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

id really like to see a better way to manage wormhole operations a pos is a really crappy way to live in a wormhole and they arent really meant to be lived out of a pos as it currently stands is geared towards corpalliance operations not for individualswhat i would like to see is something similar to an outpost like in null sec wormholes are completely lawless just like sov null sec space so why cant we claim sovereignty in them put up a tcu and an ihub to work on the systems and make them better even place a scaled down version of an outpost at a planet possibly multiple small outposts so that multiple corps in an alliance could own themas of right now it is a nightmare for individuals to live in a corp pos there is no individual storage you cant repackage items so you are forced to look at 20 of the same thing when scrolling through a hangar and so much more it really gets frustrating sometimes the bs you have to go through because of an outdated system ccp should have updated before they even released wormhole space to begin with  yet another example of stacking  on top of  for an even bigger pile of even if we cant get outposts can we at least get new pos modules larger corp hangar arrays the ability to have personalized space in them and a way for a ceodirector to be able to take the stuff out if need be to remove the array from space there are some good ideas out there for other arrays for poss and i think ccp should strongly take a look into thisive played with wormhole space back and forth and it is really hard to stay commited to it and bring other pilots in when we still for years have an outdated system not brought up with the times of the gamefix it please somehow just make it more workable for individual members of a corp not just the corp itself
nice this is bang on the money talking of which    why is it in eve an industrial mining ship costs more than a battle cruiser a civilian ship will get blown up by a warship but  queen mary 2 cost 460 million for 1 in 2003 she is a massive vessel not much armour not really any at all nice cabins though very large shipdiscoverer enterprise cost nearly us430 million 1997 is an industrial drilling ship massive again not much armour but good a drilling holes in the sea floor for industrial purposessauipem 7000 one of the worlds largest crane ships massive industrial vessel 400million usd in 1986covetor industrial mining ship 22 mil isk pretty standard mining shipcomparetype 45 destroyer cost you get two for 646 billion so 32 billion each in 2007 its called a destroyer but its quite big for a destroyerrupture pretty standard cruiser 10 million iskif in eve as in my real world examples above industrials where to cost 16th the cost of a cruiser then miners could have a covetor for 16 million isk and might even risk taking it into losec or wouldnt mind so much losing one in hisec
an offline pos should just deanchor after a certain amount of time its the simplest thing to implement i do like the other ideas of hacking etc it would put my explorer char to great use but i feel that the complexity would require too much time to implement once fuel runs out the reserve power that is holding the anchor would just disengage the old pos would stay in orbit decay and become wreckage
1 way to go as doctor kevorkian might have put it
why is it that only one character per account can train at any given time it rather defeats the purpose of having an alt character if you have to put you main character on developmental hold to train your alt im not sure if this has been brought up before and maybe there is a reason behind the policy but i currently fail to understand itlet all characters on an account train simultaneously
people pay for seperate accounts to train new alts this will never be introduced because ccp would lose a massive massive amount of income please think your ideas through or know more about the game before suggesting to change it in the assembly hallif your generally that experienced but still think your suggestion may be worth while post it in the features and suggestions area of the forums first to see peoples reactionsin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
people having multiple accounts would not be greatly affected by this as you may only have one character online per account at a timemany maybe most players have multiple accounts with characters logged on simultaneously for any number of reasonsfor example mission ship  command ship team running missions hulk  orca mining teams the are many reasons to have multiple accounts online at any given timeallowing alt characters on any given account to be training in offline mode would not necessarily create a huge drop in the number of alt accounts that many players require
show me a game where you are allowed to train multiple characters on the same account at the same time
if you want to compare and contrast eve online with other games then why dont you show me another game that allows you to train your characters when you arent even logged in
the search thingy at the top of the forum is really helpful you know you can search for subject matter such as training and account and see just how many times this has been brought up and repeatedly shot down by the eve community all in one placeall in one place
well if the subject keeps popping up that should indicate that there is popular support for it and it is worthy of further discussionsimply pointing to the fact that it has been discussed and summarily dismissed in the past doesnt necessarily mean that it is a deadend conversation i appreciate that fact that you and some others think it is a bad idea duly noted however there may be quite a few that think it is a good ideaif everybody in eve online had the thats the way it is and you have to deal with it attitude bob would still be in control of the galactic southwest

one thing i noticed is that on the geddon models the mega pulse lasers hang off a little bit
i agree on some of the turrets dont actually look like turretsbefore the turret implementation laser turret large ones looked like fishball on a stick attached to ship while being pretty plain they do look like a turretafter the turret implementation large laser turrets dont really look like a turret when attached to amarr boats instead they look like fire hydrants or sumthing like that it only appeared to be apparently its a turret when u click on the item description icon and get a close up animated view of said turret
rushnik wroteww2 had bigger guns then eve compared to ship sizebecause we can compare metal tubs floating on water to selfcontained starshipsrushnik wrote turretlauncher placing on ship hulls  be creative but not stupidi have no complaints about turret placement most of them look greatrushnik wrote sensible turret designs  spinning rims on my ac its an autocannon it spinsi think the progress theyve made with guns in the past two years has been great and i want ccp to continue their current course
this is probably a more realistic model as it makes a lot more sense to merely move the lens or a mirror than the entire laser ive not looked closely enough at my lasers to notice
then to what should we compare them tell me  im listeningeven if we dont compare them to anything can you tell me why the turrets have to look like glued on and much too small on some hullsthats a good one almost made me laughtalmostoh yes most of them but not all imoyou didnt look close enought then go look tell me how you like them are you contenttheres a reason they dont differ in size much which leads to restrictions in the creation process to make them fit on many hullsand where is that course headed you know that course absolutely dont get me wrong you sound like you are content with the current situations and i can understand you but the only reason im writing this is because im trying to look ahead i sense another little overhaul and another overhaul and so on im trying to say they should take a good look at the big picture they are trying to paintps im sick and tired of people explainingcountering everything with fluff
as i recall ccp wants to render the turrets the same way that the ship is modeled but theyve run into a host of issues that make it look bad so the current turrets are in fact pasted on its not anything that ccp considers a permanent solution its just the best alternative for now
sink this crap ideano alarm for afk cloakers
you obviously didnt read the thread if you did read the thread then your a drooling uneducated borderlineiliterate idiotas i should probably say something more constructive than this  read the thread it is quite clear that this will never help afk cloakies people have explained it enough already nobody wants to do it again try using your brain before putting fingers to keyboardin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
you obviously a fcking afk cloaker fagsink this thread no alarm for afk cloaker noob who cant check his screen
agreed stop afk cloaker whines
this wont help afk cloakers if you can provide an arugment for why this might aid afk cloakers im sure people might concede but i dont think you canshouting your a dog at a sheep all day will never make that sheep a dog just like saying this will help afk cloakies over and over will never make it so unless you have some kind of logical reason to think this then your comment wasnt worth posting
nice alt postin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
everyone know that some players why crying for a sound alarm when their ships decloakedsome player use cloaker alt pilots at enemy systems while they playing with their main characters in same timethis is why they want a loud warning sound when their ship is decloakednot supported
1 to this
in the very same window you can see the exact time the person has last logged in and out
well now i feel sillyill amend the op to just focus on the first issue
the npc corporation you are thinking of is called ded they are the in game police that are supposed to deal with the worst of the worst criminals in eve if concord are like the nypd then ded would be the fbi if you look under station services in your map you will notice one of the services is bounty hunter missions yet there are no bounty hunter missions the bounty hunter button on the station interface doesnt do much except list those pirates with the biggest bounties yes i agree the best way to stop or at least discourage the killing yourself with an alt exploit is to have the ded corporation give out bounty hunting missions as well as an earnable bounty hunting license in order to get the bh license you would have to grind your standings by doing bounty hunting missions on npc pirates player pirates wont do this but those who want to be professional bounty hunters will once you have finished your level 4 ded stroryline missions you get access to ded tracker agents ie locator agents who not only give you the name of a player pirate with a bounty but tell you what systems they have been in this would be a lot like research agents who do research for you once you gain high enough standingsi also think that the reward should be based on the bountys skillpoints and not visible in their profile i also think that the bountys skillpoints should be matched with the bounty hunters skillpoints as much as possible to ensure an even fight i also think kill rights should be transferable in most cases they are useless to a player with low skillpoints if someone ganks them my suggestion is that you could file a complaint with ded for a small fee once ded gets enough of these complaints they put out a bounty on the person that bounty could go to the ded tracker agents who could hand them out like starbase charters
this fixes all the loopholes in the currenty systemand this makes a bounty hunting into a viable profession if the first of those two linked proposals is implemented and then the second is then implemented aftwards as a seperate system all problems and loopholes in either are fixed and the profession works as it should this has been discussed thouroughly in the second thread 
im not trolling when i say you did not use the wordphrase defender missiles in the original post
still waiting for a fix to make bounty hunters a valid career and no i dont live in highsec as if that would make your opinion any less wrong
but wait if you cant really tell whether the person is afk or not  how would it hurt the game again then i see conflicting statements above  somehow you will know whether or not the other 11 ppl are afk or not but you wont be able to tell whether the guy youre attacking is really afk or not  which is it
you might want to change those sun glasses for a pair of reading glasses englisk is defenetly not my nativ toung but got the point in the first go now try again
lol yea read it again hahain the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
again we are asking for a no risk situation thoto be immune to risk is bad for the game
well how about noooooliving in wspace nets you way more isk than living in normal 00risk vs reward have you ever heard about that in eveso if you want to live in wspace you have to live from a pos deal with it
although i support the suggestion completely it seems a waste to even start a thread about it because ccp are already publically commited to reworking poses from the ground up
how about yes living in a pos is not the issue of risk it is the issue of functionality poss adequately abbreviates what it is like to live out of one a piece of having a small outpost or specializedbetternew pos arrays does not negate the risk vs reward  this is purely to enhance the gameplay in wormhole spaceif you have a pos with upgradedbetternew arrays or a smaller version of an outpostor even normal sized ones does not tinker with risk vs reward a bit both can be destroyedtaken over please post when you actually have something worth postingto the ladder poster if ccp publically announced they are going to rework them then let them take this into consideration and think about wormhole life not just from a corpalliance perspectiveas i said before they seem to be mainly for corpalliance industry but from the perspective of a member of a corporationalliance giving them their own personal spaces for shipsitems without making poss undefendable because of powercpu requirementshow about extra large towersoh i know what you are going to say  so someone can put up an even bigger dickstar or deathstar around a jumpbridgecyno jammer or whatever else well how about up the powercpu requirements of those modules then so that these setups are not possible on large towers anymore and null sov holders are forced to use these extra large towers instead of normal large towerssomethings gotta give on this not everyone is comfortable having all their stuff stuffed into a tab where others can access it and not everyone wants their ships accessible to everyoneposs are inadequate for wormhole life if ccp is doing something about poss in general or looking at wormholes in general this would be a good place to start
pos or station most definitely has something to do with risk vs reward blow up a pos and modsUFFFD all your stuff is gone you canUFFFDt blow up a stationit might be inconvenient for you to live out of a pos but itUFFFDs a choice you want to make a ton of isk in wspace well then you have to live out of a pos if your donUFFFDt like to call it risk vs reward lets call it inconvenience vs reward dos that work better for youthe fact is that if you have your  together you make a ton of isk in wspace all you have to sacrifice is living out of a station there is a saying and it goes like this UFFFDyou canUFFFDt eat your cake and keep it toUFFFD
upgrading the pos ccp is doing that alreadyallow outposts or sovereignty in wspace absolutely not if you do within a few months people will turn wspace into impenetrable fortresses backed up by supercaps etc etc etc transfering some of the outpost functionality repackaging items swapping subsystems to a pos thats reasonable personal space within a pos maybe ill have to think on that
no one ever said you couldnt blow up the outpost in wormhole space im not concerned with those mechanics of the game i am more interested in making wormhole space better currently it is  to live inwhy not take some of the functionality out of outposts see how much you like living in normal space yes it is inconvenient but something could be done to improve it if you cant see that then  off honestly
wormholes are not were never intended to be and probably never should be easy to live in
akatenshi isnt asking for it to be easy to live in wspace they are asking for basic features of the game that everyone in this game is able to use except those in w space living out of a pos is for the birds especially with more then 5 corp members and giant secure containers in corp tabs in a pos hanger isnt a solution there should be a pos module called corporate members hanger array that gives you the ability to repack your gear  a seperate tab to store your ships and only you have access to it view rights for security officer obviously as the only other way to work around that is to launch your own pos in wspace and have your own tower to tend with all the hangers fuel and other general nonsense oh and you actually have the corp roles to launch and anchor a pos everyone seems concerned with the amount of isk you earn in wspace the market drives that isk as theres no bounties or direct in pocket income on sleepers unlike 00 and empire rats no missions and no station games aka marketeeringoutpost  sov  definitely not and would never support thisdestroyable base  possibly would need to see stats as w space has that added benefit of being able to limit combat by collapsing the entry point  so no white noise a goon test blob attacks modular pos with some w only mods  definitelyironic people launch into a troll instead of actually contributing something of worth to these forums makes me sad to see the culture that is developing in this gameproposal quick changes to ore vessles  gas gear
i agree on the pos revamp but as many people already noticed it is currently one of the top priorities of csm and ccpas such we dont need to voice it more that it needs to be changed  everyone knows that what we could possibly do is suggest a possible way of what could be implemented in the pos systemabout sovereignty and outposts  i am definitively against first and prefer to see pos reiterated to work as substitute for secondfor the op i would suggest reading up on summit updatesfanfest videos  they should answer most of your questions
wh space was intentionally launched and planned around not having those amenities wh space is designed to be a teamactivity where a corpalliance is required to work as a cohesive unit in space with limited access to the amenities of kspace that means its not easy and isnt meant to be easy isnt meant for the casual solo ratting enthusiast and shouldnt be subject to game designs that make kspace a dull and easy for the casual playerthere are plenty of people that thrive in wh space by being smart and actually participating and trusting the communities that they interact with if you have issues with that perhaps wspace isnt for you if you need easy and the comforts of kspace just to enjoy wspace wspace really isnt the place you should be
not asking it to be easy asking for a broken system to be fixedim merely putting suggestions on the table and all i get are troll posts contribute or gtfo if ccp and csm are trying to fix this and it is such a top priority then i am certainly sure they are willing to consider and look at ideas on the subject to help develop fixes and things that the community would like to see versus having to pull something out of their asses and hope that it works or will be received well by the communitythat being said if you cant contribute then stfuive seen lots of posts suggesting that poss need a fix and these are some of the fixes that could help new arrays for poss specifically driven for wormhole space livingso here is an idea wormhole only modules modules that are adapted specifically for wormhole living in normal k space you wont really need some of these modules possibly even special towers for wormhole space increased cpupowergrid and possibly larger fuel bays are something i can think of just for new towers in wormhole space if you intend to live in a wormhole frequent logistics runs are not always possible while you run ops and other stuff and if you are living on the frontier should you really have to be bothered to exit into k space once a week or once a month anyways just to interact with the rest of the universedestructible outposts could be a solution if it is too much to ask for newer and updated pos arrays or towers i would suggest that if we go the outpost route that it be a special wormhole outpost smaller in size than normal outposts lesser hitpoints but including reinforcement modes just like poss and outposts there would be no market no bounty offices no lp store etc just able to do corp hangars personal hangars dock repairrefit cq contractssometimes it is useful to send a contract instead of tradedropping in hangars etc and it should cost at more than a fully decked out large pos but less than a normal null sec outpost to anchorbuildif we go the pos route then we definitely need to have new arrays for them i think the arrays speak for themselves in what we need and want and i really like the idea of a dry dock for capital ships the capitals not technically being hidden just in an anchored state as said before they would be visibly attached to the dry dock array and would stay there if for whatever reason the tower goes down capable pilots could potentially steal the capital ships intact and pilot them away or shoot and destroy them individually and the pos dry dock array itselfwith new pos modules i think there will have to be some revamping of the towers though were adding more than corp specific modules here to towers or do we have to put up 5 towers for all of this stuff the corp has to have personal spacewhich is already addressed in corp hangar arrays and ship maint arrays just as much as individual corp members do
and they do many of us posted our suggestions there concerning poses in general and wh space specificallyas far as i know ccp specifically intended for wh to be dependent on kspace that is the reason why there is no ice here thing is at this moment wh is actually most polished part of eve with most of the stuff working as intended all grievances that we endure are actually coming from poses being outdated
ohhh i spend time lived out of a pos or two in my time and yes its no fun but it was a chose to do so no i will not  off in all honesty eve is not an easy theam park game its a hardcore sandbox if you dont like living out of a pos move out of wspace in eve you chose and you chose to make a lot of isk in wspace well then you also chose to live out of a pos eve have no easy mode deal with it son
pos management needs to be looked at outposts in wspace no thanks
i e lived in wspace and yes living in a pos sucks fat monkey  however doing whs is ment for a corp or a alliance not for 1 person it can be done with one person but its hard it never affected me to put my ship in the hanger because i trusted my corp mates not to steel my  now if corp hanges where ment for people to have there own little space then ccp would have made it that way to start with thats why its called corp hangersov in whs is a no go outposts is a no go as well if you want your own hanger then stay in kspace or goto 00 and make a outpost
helllllllllllllllll nooooo if you want to look at it that way tell the frigging pirates off the somalian coast to stop hijacking ships in their cheap ass boats a couple thousand dollars worth of equipment putting a huge multmillion dollar ship at risk that is your real life example thereif you want to put it that way combat ships should cost under a million isk versus a covetors 22m
sure if you dont start getting out until the guy lands  but theres this directional scan that i keep hearing about where you can see whats nearby assuming you consider up to 14 au to be nearby so i suppose that you could watch out to say 75m km 05 au and have a good chance of seeing weird stuff and gtfo before they land granted every system is different and the ranges would need to be tailored to your situationwhile ccp did up dessie dps its not like theyve banned industrial characters from setting up intel channels setting known gankers red or doing whatever they can to keep an eye on local  there are things that can be done the miners just have to decide to do themthere are no ships that are invulnerable in hisec the few capitals and possibly supers that were devmoved that are there are holdovers from years ago theyre so gimped as to what they can do that theyre just trophies for the people who got one back then think of them as an ornamental dagger or the like  pretty but useless one cannot suigank a nyx in hisec well i suppose if everyone in jita turned on the nyx it might have been possible furthermore the fact that it was up there was created due to one of the recent changes to supers drone bay so it was effectively a onetime event in day to day gameplay one will never see supers in hisec or in a station for that matter while it is used by people who multibox  its also viable for someone flying a single account helping out their corpiesmines actually in the belt with me
youve clearly missed foghails point about the ship having no use so why not give it one  on another note as you like to troll gas clouds have 5005000 gas regardless and its not as if theres 15 of them on top of each other so yes this little boat would mine a gas cloud like an banshee but its not as if theres 100 more clouds within its 1500m range usually max of 3 with 140km between each other long slowboat or warp out and back in so your troll is like saying you could potentially mine billions an hour if your insert uber roid never popd  stop talking out your arse and contribute something useful not omfg im so l33t in my destroyer and live in w spacefor anyone unfamiliar with locating and mining gas you still have to scan down a site using probes you still have warp into the site and bookmark the clouds and you still have the same issue of a max of 5k a cloud the benefit of using this little bird is the hold size the speed that it would harvest and the potential target it would make in empire if its full of gasi couldnt see an issue with giving this little ship a 5x bonus yield bonus then as it only has the slot for 1 gas harvester give the strip the same stats as the gas harvester you fit to your trusty destroyer as the skill limits it to max of 5 gas cloud harvesters anyways or simpler yet remove the turret requirement from the one on your destroyer and no new module needed gas isnt an instant isk printing press either so stop making it sound as if it is theres still towers to setup reactions to perform bioreactors and those reactions etc etc etc and thats before you have to deal with customs officers at gates anti boostert3 product mechanics etc you make it sound as if your harvesting veld with an every hungry market for it get a clue sorry in advance for hijacking the thread foghail1 for a good idea for a very under used ship
please refer to my first post i know the amounts present i wanted to point out how fast they can be mined in terms of isk for these who never dealt with fulleriteshere is time example lets use the one that takes a lot of time to harvest  vital or instrumental sites6000  500 in each let us assume that we are mining the largest cloud  6000 units  size  6000x10  60000m3destroyer mines 20m3 x 5  100m3 per 40 seconds or 150 m3 per minutetotal time it takes to harvest the cloud  6 hours and 40 minutes  of course no one usually does it with single ship  it is normal to do it with 34 shipsproposed ship would harvest 500 x 250  1125m3 per 120  25 150 seconds or 450 per minutetotal time to mine the cloud  2 hours 14 minutes now imagine if you had 34 of themmind you if we calculate c32 and not c320c540 one used above we will have 13 minutes for destroyer per 5k cloud and 4 minutes for proratoralso dont forget the fact that sleepers appear about 1015 minutes after the site has been generated with that in mind and 24 propators you will be able to clear sites before sleepers even appearand about rarity  there is very well known tactic in wh called wh collapsing with decent team you can harvest these sites literally nonstopthat is the reason why i am against it  i am not against specialized ships i am against jesus harvesters capable of sucking everything dry in matter of seconds
so we have now heard your rant and complaint suggest a solution or modification
the thing about gas clouds where your head seems to be is that theyre not even remotely close in volume to traditional mining the volume they require to store is huge and the actual size of the sites is not gonna support an iskhr argument iskhr for 1 or 2 hours maybe but thats it then you have to wait until respawn this is not a valid argument against a gas cloud harvester improvement
relay like the idea of giving some love to the gas junkiesboosting the proc seems like a good plan my thought is thismake its bonus as well as the ones it already has1 able to fit gas strip harvesters2 barge skill 10 bonus to cycle time per levelt2proc1 same2 barge skill same3 exumers skill bonus to scriptsyour gas strip harvesteras a cycle time equivalent to 5 gas harvester 1s t2 variant cycles for t2 harvestersmines 75m3 per cycle t2 100m3only fits on barges and exumersallow for scripts in the t2 varientgas compression compresses gas as it is mined 10 less space used 5 longer to mine gas expansion expands the gas with inert gas5 faster cycle10 lass harvestedgas extraction harvests larger amounts 75 yeld 15 more cap used per activationgas expulsion harvests less gas but better cap use 10 less harvested 15 less cap per activationname it siphon gas harvester
all of these things were discussed alot a couple of years back in a thread titled outlaw teh support was massive ccp ignored itdevs got a few of the more colourful lowsec leaders to form a discussion group under the direction of mynxee we discussed things a little and when it became apparent ccp had no intention of taking any notice we left teh discussionmy corp moved to nullsec after living in lowsec for years because many of teh things coming in made lowsec even worse capital blobs roaming pairs of supercaps titans in lowsec no income etc etc etc many of the old guard of lowsec eventually went to nullsec because to be honest there was no real reason not to we loved lowsec we moved out because lowsec has never had any attention given to it fw was not the way to steer it in itself a nice creation but that isnt what teh majority of people who lived in lowsec wanted they wanted a unique gaem experience as different from empire and nullsec as they are different to each other look up outlaw on teh old forums it would have made lowsec awesomealso incursion they should be lowsec only as it is the only place they make sense from a storyline perspective and it would be a thing that draws players there
or of course make a protection module for orcas allows it to boost industrial and mining vessels ehp while on grid possibly a bubble of influence type of effect where every industrial and mining ship inside that bubble has a greatly extended shield capacity make it so it does nothing to military grade shields so doesnt affect anything except barges exhumers and haulershave it come at a cost so taking up one of teh orcas boosti ng modules or something but would allow miners to increase tehir survivability considerably promotes teamwork apart from of course those who run 22 ice mining accounts but of course arnt bots1 who could do it all themselvesit wouldnt make ganking obsolete by any stretch of teh imagination but would mean peopel who are serious about their mining can reduce the risk immenseley
now that is a simpler suggestion can the orca get warfare gang links on it because if so you might as well just use the one that already exists for boosting shieldsin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
mine in fleetspay attentionbuildbuy a command tengu alt and nearly double your shield ehp put it in a safe spot or pos shieldproperly tank your hulkdeploy ewar drones instead of mining dronesdone right you can force them to bring three tornadoes to alpha a single hulk and alpha is the only option as a swarm of ewar drones will ruin their day if they dont get you in the first few seconds youll lose some yield but thats the price you pay for security
notice the key missing element in high sec elsewhere alpha usually wont be the preferred optionthe above proposal makes mining ops far more feasible in low sec as well giving people a reasonable opportunity to spread out of high sec is kind of the point
a couple of thoughts 1 while gankers can bring three tornados or a dozen catalysts to gank a single hulk that isnt the status quo hulks can easily be tanked and very well i wrote an article about how to tank hulks how to use logis and how to counter with ewar fighting hulkageddon i know people that using the tanked hulk posted in there survived 5x catalyst suicide attempts as well as many other flavors of gankers i really dont understand why people feel entitled to maxyield fit their exhumers put on civilian shield boosters for tank and still be able to thwart a common suicide attack nothing in eve works that way and many of the complaints about suicide ganking come across as people having a tantrum because they lost their shiny ship in space that they think should be risk free you can fit a tank with no mining upgrades to have 28k36k ehp you can fit a tank with one mining upgrade and still have 22k28k ehp those numbers are not using fancy faction mods and theyre what you get before standard fleet bonuses 10 let alone ganglinks 30 2 your idea is very intersting and has some promise here are my comments on it  what happens if i have an industrial ship targetted and he activates the lock redirector  in its current form this is typically useless for industrials the lock time on industrials is quite long and the range is of the redirect modules is too limited making it worthless for use during transit it would only be useful for an industrial powering slowly gathering resources on grid with the lock beacon  in its current form it is useless for nullsec nullsec travelers will bubble the entire group since they are all close to the lock beacon resulting in the slaughter of your entire mining party  it allows you to afk protect a mining fleet in highsec one of the fundamental dilemmas in the miners vs suicide gankers battle the miners playstyle is pretty laid back and somewhat inattentive whereas to thwart pvp attacks you need to be constantly vigilant of threats and situationally aware this idea of yours caters very well to the miners playstyle  how would this interact with aggression flags if im at war with a miner but hes protected by an npccorp bodyguard via this system can i attack the bodyguard without concord intervention i should be able to some thing for thieving kill rights etc etc etc  i worry how easily this could be implemented but thats up to ccp to figure out i wonder how changes to crimewatch will interact with this  the redirect module should not be useable on orcas and rorquals  the lock beacon penalty is too weak i also dont like the idea of 20 hulks using one ship as the beacon in terms of a bodyguard they should do a good job guarding one person or a couple but their effectiveness should be significantly reduced when guarding many people in a similar fashion id change the penalty to the lock becon ship something like a 15 reduction in the shield armor and hull resistances for every ship that uses a lock redirector on them then if youre guarding 10 hulks with one ship then all its resists will be reduced to 20 of their original value  the lock redirector should give the agility penalty to the ship activating the module ie the hulk not the bodyguard was this posted in fi first your idea really should be fully vetted before posted in assembly hall
why would the forum prevent me from quoting more than five times thats silly anyway heres an item by item commentlock redirector only affects targeting attempts made while it is active on a target but does not break existing locks this should be easier to code less logic and edge cases to worry about increasing the sig of the ship with the lock beacon should help with that that was one of the reasons i thought of it but it might be a tight balancing act  the idea is that the first thing the industrial does upon dropping jump cloak is lock the escort with the redirector already active and waiting for the target regardless of whether the escort got attacked or not this gives him time to align and run if the escort did get attacked obviously this should happen sufficiently fast that the industrial has a decent chance to avoid getting targeted by the camp and scrammed but cant be completely immune yes but nullsec sov holders already have the option to bubble the way in or out so if anyone is brave enough to mine in their sov space without permission they have to deal with that first and if they have permission they can bubble the gates themselves even if they dont have permission they can still bubble the gates post a cloaked lookout and tell miners to run when anyone shows up accomplishing essentially the same thing sort of protect yes make immune to suicide ganking or war  no ecm burst still works to disrupt the connection and is not prohibited in high sec so if anyone is foolish enough to post an afkguarded mining gang theyll still get suicided or killed by war targets you indeed should be able to but assuming the new crimewatch system lets say that the bodyguard inherits the suspect flag of any targets it guards thats why the lock beacon in the first place  the bodyguard should consciously agree to doing that while the lock beacon is online he can offline the module if he decides to drop it war targets can be taken care of by requiring the bodyguard to be in the same corporation as well though im worried that might be too restrictive see above indeed and i did mention capitals though forgot to include the orca which is technically not a capital but an industrial command ship i suppose that works better than what i thought originally yes that would make it harder for the hulk to run away though which would defeat most of the point maybe some other kind of penalty instead er no whoops in my defense though i can say that this applies to quite a few other threads in here as well so that was easy to overlook
well considering the subject has been shot to pieces several times before on this forum by the community and not ccp might give you a hint that it is in fact not the best idea ever one might actually say that it is a minority of players that would like this change and the majority sees it as a bad ideathe fact is that its never going to happen simply because ccp would lose a crap load of subscriptions to be fair wouldnUFFFDt we all rather have ccp getting the money they need to further expand and evolve eve the game we all lovedo remember that when ccp had a 9 decries in subscriptions the had to fire 20 of the staffUFFFD that is one in five for those of you that didnUFFFDt listen during math classso in short thatUFFFDs to late now stop posting suggestions for game changes you havenUFFFDt thought trough or just go biomass your char now
it has been brought up before at least once this week here are some previous threads dealing with the issue
my take on the issue is this the most scarce resource in the game is time learning to manage your time is the most important skill you as a player can learn learn that skill also learn that you will never train every skill in the game you need to specialise industry or military is one basic dividing point do you train to have 200odd order limit on the market or do you train to fly battleships do you train to fly a widow or fly all t12  3 cruisers do you become a onepilot industrial behemoth able to churn out ships at a phenomenal rate or fly a stealth bomber with cyno 5 so you can take part in blowing up battleships at a phenomenal ratethere are already options available to you to help you win the sp race explore those options character transfers and multiple accounts
and yet despite the endless ridicule from our communitys aristocracy it still keeps popping upthis is possible yet at the same time opponents of this idea continually point to the fact that it keeps resurfacing on a fairly regular basis that in and of itself might point to the fact that it is indeed not as unpopular as you may want to believe it is that is your opinion and unless you happen to be sitting in front of a crystal ball ill prefer to believe that my idea has merit and may possibly be implementedi have three accounts one each for the three characters i play allowing me to additionally develop characters in the two alt slots on those accounts is not going to make me want to stop paying for the three accounts i have therefore my idea will not lead to a massive decrease in subscriptions i have thought it through and ive successfully and logically deflected every argument to my idea in this thread will you go biomass your characters if my change is implemented i think most likely not
so apparently its a fairly popular idea
this is my point exactly why cant i use the two spare slots on any one of my accounts to train up a trader character or an industrialist character or a logi pilot i can  but only if i stop training on the main charactermaybe a better argument would be eliminate the two alt slots on an account and make players pay a subscription fee for every character they playin effect thats what we are doing to begin with
i donUFFFDt have a crystal ball but thing it trough if there still isnUFFFDt a bell ringing in that empty skull of yours i do suggest you take class or two in marketing business and product developmentwell this subject might reappear frequently but so did the subject about missiles and delayed damage vs turrets and instant damage the fact that a subject is aired often doesnUFFFDt make is a great subject often itUFFFDs the other way around great proposals tend to get csm attention the first time
the thing you seem to be missing the idea pops up from one individual gets maybe10 people supporting itand then gets laughed at and shot down by everyone elseccp will never implement it simply because it flies in the face of the core principles of the game the moment ccp deviates from those principles is the day the game dies see nex store for more details
lets put your suggestion in a general framework you want to train multiple characters per account why becuase your impatient and cant be asked to stop training on your main so you can train a second character reasons why this might not be supported it doesnt really serve a real purpose since you can cross train everything it is always quicker and more effecient to train into a new thing on your main becuase they will have support skills already i suppose it could allow you to play as two separate people but then you should be using two separate accounts anyway  character farming  when you could train up multiple characters simultaneously people would just make 2 alts and train them to do stuff then just sell em on the bazarr or irl this would essentially devalue all characters and really screw over current character traders yes there are people that earn their isk that way rmters and previous players abused the old multicharactertraining system  account sharing  since you could train mulitply chars on the same account 2 or 3 people could effectivly play the same account if they all did so at different timesfinally you really need to research your ideas before posting them quit stinking up the assembly hall with recycled craptastic ideas unless you can give it a new spin and really thoroughly understand the topic next time i suggest you find the answers to the following questions before polluting the forums  has this been suggested before 3s of research will tell you many many many many many many many many times before  if so why has this been shot down  omg we expect you to post as an informed person please do so  is your idea thoroughly vetted if its a new idea get some player feed back in features and ideas not assembly hall finally for your information they used to allow mulitple characters to train at the same time way back in early eve there are multiply reasons they got rid of it you should probably be knowledgeable of why they got rid of it and how those arguments are no longer valid andor how reintroducing it at this time wont cause the problems it did before
personal insults are generally a sure sign that your arguments have been deflected and parried and you have no other logical basis to stand your viewpoints upon so if i scream louder than the other guy ill winlol
i didnt insult you unless being called impatient is an insult i insulted your idea i called it recycled craptastic and stinky it is undeniably recycled perhaps the latter two adjectives are too much opinion but you wouldnt be complaining if i said fantastic instead of craptastic youre only complaining because my opinion of the idea doesnt agree with yours if we can move past that i also posted a very thorough outline of why its been shot down before and explained what is expected of you when bring your ideas to the csm in the future which is what the assembly hall is for
i think that insult part was directed at me and yes it was an insult but mostly just because the op insults the rest of us by posting stupid proposals i might be a bit inpatient with ignorant people that simply refuse to listen to well founded arguments that doesnUFFFDt support their point of view or i simply spend time in test at some point in my eve carrierUFFFD pick one
my point was that we already have alternatives we currently have three slots so that you have the option for example to train two market alts while focussing on combat skills for the main character after a while you will resent the cost of replacing clones for your highsp characters you might decide that flying a black ops battleship on your main is enough more sp will hurt you financially so you spend time training the other slots in order to sell those sp that you are never going to useyou might train a thrasherflying alt for rvb or faction warfare because you know that such a ship is viable that alt doesnt need warp drive operation 5 or retail 5 or amarr encryption methods so you stop training while the clone replacement isnt going to break your bankthese are choices which have consequences if you remove the consequences the choices are not important any more and you break the basic model of eve

i see few good arguments against this and those that are out there i know of ways to deal withid eliminate the possibility to trade chars to combat the farming to name onebut the reason i would like to be able to train multiple chars on one account is because from an rp perspective one chars training should not affect anothersalternatively they could reduce sphour to 13 if they allowed simultanious char trainingor they could just limit the amount of chars to 1 per account but then youd have a riot and id participate but for this reason it is quite speculative if this idea would cause intolerable subscription loss
yes this way the sop can be make a new account roll three new characters and maintain three training queues while playing one character at a timealso this would ruin the character market
this would be acceptable you can train all three characters if you want but they share the same sp pool and training is slowed for all threegood luck training that caldari battleship v see you in three months
nope
comparing the mechanics of the game to 00 politics isnt a correct way to get your point across

is not a valid arguement especially on a forum where were supposed to be debating pros and cons you and i and your alts are not going to get alongtwo reasons the above is rubbish1 if their alt is on a second screen sitting cloaked on a station they are not afk2 if they cant see their alt whilst they are cloaked ie no second screen on the station they will die if they get uncloaked alarm or notbouy see above that is how you make a counter arguement please post something productive next timein the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
ive never used recruitment advertising however the corp management needs some serious work it is too long winded but still ends up lacking massive amounts of functionality things like pos roles are far too limiting its a tough thing to get a balance on but we do need to to be more functional
yup i try to make it clear in my op that i dont propose removing it entirely because no doubt some people would be inconvenienced just give people the option to disable it if the wisheve down under  a community for players in the autz
does anyone have any suggestions that could make this idea even betteri am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i think that the gap you speak of makes sense for eve combat it is 3dimensional and filled with open empty space if shots coming at you are going to be blocked you cant really expect your friend next to you to be carrying the shield it makes a lot more sense for the blocking ship to be blocking damage from itselfbut prevention of the attack can be done against anyone shootingregardless of who theyre shooting atwith electronic warfare
as grand zap mentions above there are already defender missiles in the game which is a slight nod to the capabilities im talking about they are always a bad tradeoff though and they only defend you and only from missilestechnology in the context of eve combat would develop so that you could interfere with incoming fire im looking to make it so that you can interfere with the incoming fire on behalf of a friendly whether the explanation be smart reflective chaff for deflection of lasers or the superduperscifi explanation of such a technology is irrelevant the new mechanic and the new tactics it would lead to are worthy addition i thinklineofsight hasnt been implemented because its computationally expensive and impractical for eve but that doesnt mean there isnt a way to bring maneuver into the game in a better fashion than range and transversal management but not having done the math i dont know if this could be done the way i describe in this thread even if positional effectiveness doesnt play a part in the implementation active defense still has a place
fixed
this is a very well though out post and it is exactly how i have envisioned the bounty system should work i support this fully
not sure if you mentioned any good ideas i stopped reading at griefers vs ccp ccp and griefers arent in any way misaligned once you have fully recognized this go back through your post and rethink it if you still stick by any of your points come tell em to me and ill be more willing to listen
 yup
ummm  sorry to say but ccp has thrown away the were greifers too attitude they teamed up with sony for dust514 nothing will ever be the same the whole reason for discussing changes is that ccp is not going to allow the new player recruitment opportunity that dust will provide to be undermined by a small number of diehard greifers they will hard code changes if they need to so come up with good ideas or blame yourself if you dont like what happens
i guess in your example transposed to eve thatd be a rookie ship pointing an industrial ships for a ransom ill conceed that i was more comming at it from a 2nd world war scenario of commerce raiders being actual ships rather than just a costal dinghyedit actually no what i said was that cruisers might want to cost more than industrials 6  1 ratio youre somehow trying to suggest that cruisers are the eve analogue to an inflatable dinghy

i think the hacking module should be completely vulnerable for the entire period of time and when it succeeds the pos modules should become irreversibly abandoned and anyone can scoop them up and relaunch them the person who set the hacking module should know when its going to finish and would be able to show up at about that time to claim the parts
supportedso long as it isnt invulnerable everand so long as the timer isnt shorter than 48hrsalso anyone should be able to claim the pos and the hackng module once it has done unanchoring the pos this will add some danger to trying to steal poses because lets face it that is what you would be doing it would create some nice small hang incentive especially as all it would require is a hauler to take it
ahh this thread is back coolstill supporting specifics id like to see this would only work on an outoffuel pos the structure would be about as tough as a poco maybe a bit softer its designed for taking down abandoned structures after all but at the same time shouldnt be vulnerable to a small gang passing through a wormhole without them investing some time in highsec this could be used on any pos without there being a wardec but the defending corp would gain aggression on the owner so long as the structure is anchored at their pos now the question i have is does this unanchor the pos or would i become the new owner i prefer the latter just because having the pos suddenly unanchor or making it so that anyone can unanchor it means that anyone could cash in on my hard work just by knowing when the timer would expire and beating me to the scoop
it would have to unanchor as there deosnt seem to be any restrictions on who can use it just as you cabn steal a tower being deployed by a corp  after they launch for corp and before they anchor i dont see any problems with allowing others to ninja your hacked tower goods i forget what happens to ammo in abandoned weapons but i suspect that teh stront in the tower would either have to get ejected or disappear  or stront could be the factor which prolongs hacking attempts and it gets used up that way
another halfway thought quote from the mxzf iskh is determined by sell value which is playerdriven you make it sound as though making gas mining ships or gas strip miners would create an isk fountain on the contrary it would just reduce the price of gas
i started a thread for a gas mining barge once and literally got barraged by people who screamed about how they like mining gas in a battleshipi have no idea why we dont have a dedicated gas mining ship but we need one
you could make the billboards destructible in lowsec and null and then corps could replace them with their own billboards like the new customs officesit would be marvelous op updated
having proposed one of those other ideas i have to say the intent was to alter the face of combat all over whether it would be a balancing nightmare hasnt been established and there are mechanics i describe for keeping it from being too powerful so as to keep it balancedthat said this proposal does seem like a good idea given the adjustments mentioned
an industrial with 3x scan scripted t2 sensor boosters a prop mod and this redirector will still take 2s to lock a mwding moros it will take 34 seconds to lock a mwding bc which is more than enough time for it to be locked assuming the chance of lock break follow the same mechanics for chance of jam i havent tested this then an ecm burst will break the lock of a hulk or mackinaw with 100 success as long as the exhumer is within the 9 kms optimal range of the ecm burst this will essentially undermine youre entire suggestion it wouldnt be so problematic if the chance of success was say 20 but at a 100 success rate ecm bursts ruin your idea unlike a repper mod where the bodyguard is actively activating his mod on a target this system doesnt seem to require the bodyguard to activate any modules on a target this seems really really problematic to me in regards to aggression transference the only solution i can think of is for the bodyguard to activate his beacon on a single target this would limit the number of ships they can bodyguard to 8 max given the max of 8 high slots
why are we still talking about thisUFFFD no please tell me whyconstructive well thought trough ideas ill happily support but please no more of this crap
i came here hoping for a let me have one skill queue for all characters on the account and found this same crap idea againwhat point would there be for training something at 13 the speed or if only training two characters at 12 when you train the exact same speed as doing it separately other then to set up nice long queues for going on long vacations since we arent supposed to be sharing accounts why the split on character training queues they are all controlled by the same person
the reason you cant train 3 characters at once is because everyone would be training alts they arent playing and they would be able to skill into 3 areas at once instead of one at a time it only makes sense you should have to pay for thiswhich is why players should be allowed to pay an additional subscription to train their alts on the same account i thinkoh and dont mind everyone else this forum is filled to the brim with people who say nothing louder than everyone else
as an occasional faction warfare fellow i see it is not possible for cov ops cynos to be used in complexes or indeed any other cynospersonally i dont mind if ordinary cynos are allowed in complexes or not but i would rather like the opportunity to use the covert cynos as it doest really seem fair to restrict their usage and the tactics they bring a lot of the factional warfare fights happen around the complexes

allowed unintended fitsthis is another way of saying just because they dont behave how ccp wants them to and just because ccp cant see the justification in your suggested lowered calibration cost does not mean its like that for no good reasoni see so your argument is that ccp is god and is always right about balancing lulzthe entire idea of eve online is the sandbox we havent even been given time to use the sandbox to prove whether it is or is not overpowered so it is why people are not happy about it being prenerfed for your frustrationi consider this calibration cost a war on glass cannons and perhaps specifically caldari as the implications for missiles would be stunning
i think asking ccp for the reasoning behind the large calibration cost on t2 cpu rigs is totally reasonable pou gives a 71 cpu increase for 150 calibration cost pou ii gives a 96 cpu increase for a 300 calibration cost  35 improvement but costs 100 morein comparison to the acracr gives a 10 bonus to pg for a 100 calibration cost acr ii gives a 15 bonus to pg for a 150 calibration cost 50 improvement but cost 50 more in fact most t2 rigs have a 50 increase in calibration cost for a 2050 increase in performance so the question is why does the pou have a 100 increase in calibration cost instead of a 50 is this a bug  it easily could be in which case a change isnt out of line is this intentional  if it is asking for an explanation is very reasonable if it does unbalance something then it shouldnt be changed however currently im oblivious as to what it might be unbalancing and id like to know
10
it might be unbalancing gang link ships to my understanding the pressence of cpu rigs have made fitting 6 links on a single ship very doable and if you could fit multiple t2 cpu rigs to a ship it might enhance the problem if t2 pous were 225 instead of 300 then you could fit a t2 and a t1 pou on a single tech 1 or tech 3 hull i dont really know if this is a problem or not but it might be the reason behind the strange calibration cost
actually yes they are in new eden ccp is the giver and taker of everything
some minor model stretching just before it enters warp would be nice as well1 supported jesuschrist renamed to scoreboard scoreboard kills himself
in case you missed it one of the suggestions above was that in a future dust expansion instation battelfield environments should be added so that people can hire dust marines to go do exactly that  kill you inside the stationbesides in nullsec you just conquor the system take the station then kick you into space full of pretty bubbles then kill you its not my fault highsec stations are immune to pvp oh wait  about that game design yes its not even over eve why i fully expect to see yet more changes to highsec pvp rules or changes to exhumer defences or both as to the somalian pirates example the ships should just add defences many do picking up mercs before transiting then dropping them off to the next company ship about to transit the other way kind of like an iteron adding a small laser and shield boosters but the point is validly made above if a 40 million isk battlecruiser can make kills of 800000 isk rats and pull in 25 million per hour easily then a hulk that is pulling in far less should not cost 300 million combat ships should cost far more than industrial ships because it is the combat systems that make them expensive not the basic hull if i lived in the eve world for real i would have retrofitted battleships to carry t2 strip miners by now based on the costsso yes the cost of industrial ships should be pulled down lower they are well off the mark and perhaps a civilian overhaul option should be added so that combat ships can be t3 retrofitted ripping out all their missle systems half thier turret slots all their targetting bonuses but then being able to fit special industrial module mods for example lowmedhigh fit strip miner overhall mods with all 3 needed representing how much you had to rip out to put in a t2 miner lets also not forget that this is space  there should be an ore hold mod midslot that visually is an iteron welded onto the side of the ship for minmintar

go somewhere you can mine more valuable rock then and youll make more than 25mh
erm thats not how it worksyou cant just kick reds out of the stationship prices are player driven and if you want to mine in a battleship then just mine in a battleship
silly 800k battleships are in null go to null as well and you make more than 25m per hour mining rokhs arent that bad tbh if combat ships were more expensive than it is today it would jeopardise nulllowsec pvp wanting combat ships to be super expensive so you dont get gank come on thats really selfishnot all new players start out as miners i never mined when i started eve i jumped straight to pvp after constantly losing my ships falling asleep in missionswell you can do the same hire some mercs and counter gank whoever tries to come into your belt if thats the case not that hard eh itll cost a premium but im sure shipping companies pay mercs a premium for protecting their ships from pirates
its all apart fo the sand box
no i think that would reward people that use multiple accounts any part of a newchanged intel mechanics that is passive in not requiring active player involvement devalues the activity and need for active player intel gatherers and such roles as scouts i also dont see any need in rewarding players for being in a fleet being in an organized group and having more people to fight with and support you is its own reward
the ability to share intel with the fleet make the benefits of an intel gatherer much more tangibley furthermore it allows multiple scouts to pool their intel and get a more accurate representation of what is going on in local this is the only way to truly scout a system with a large number of pilots in the end this creates an environment where pilots can be more situationally aware which is important for being a good pilot does this mean that people can put their alt into a cloaky ship and have it sit and watch a gate essentially giving easy intel to all in system fleeted with said person yes it does however im leaning towards this being a minor evil many systems have several entrances thereby eliminating the effectiveness of this tactic if youre worried about it being too passive id much rather have a transmit button that a pilot activates to share the info with fleet members i think this is a needed mechanic to really bring intel gathering into its proper role ie intel gathering is done by dedicated intel gathering ships to be shared with the rest of the fleet which arent as competent at gathering intel

gated deadspace pocket working as intended
you cant warp to a point in a deadspace complex from outside why would any cyno workdeadspace is a way to control the types of engagements that can occur the gate limits you to bringing in frigates or destroyers so why would black ops battleships and recon cruisers be allowed to simply cyno in

miners in lowsec adn nullsec have fleets defensive ships and scouts sometimes a boosting command ship miners in lowsec adn nullsec rarely get ganked because they know what they are doing and are serious about it like it or not this is just about hisec miners
since you are only an occasional fw monkey you probably dont know that the reason for the plex fights are so numerous fun and desirable is because they have none of the lameass boresec inspired pvp tricks associated with them  such as hotdrops for instance  when links are made ongrid i fully expect plex fights to become even more competitiveferociouswhen in a plex you know what is coming short range scan of gate when it coming timer  maximum window otherwise scan and who is coming local intel  take away any of those and youll likely see a noticeable drop in plex fightsin short eve needs less hotdropping tomfoolery not more
hotdrop on the gate
because eve is a fictional computer game i did read your op in its entirety you however either by choice or ignorance contradict your own statements
i appear to be blind origional post below since i cant delete this topicorigional postthis is just a small proposal to make the current inventory system bettercould it be possible to click and drag a container cargo hold or dronefuel bay and drag it into an empty space in your ui to create a separate windowso could it be possible to have multiple windows like in the old inventory but with the new upgrades
please do your research before posting this is already possible shift click opens a new window also the next update will alow for dragging windows out instead of having to shift clickin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
im terribly sorry so it does now to find a delete button
you already have a good deal of these options with respect to skill trees and modules that existleadership skills  their associated modules increase resists and the like if you choose to use them that waythe only lowend limit i might see would be allowing a specifically designed destroyer model to use them  the old small gang command ship suggestionas such your module recommendation would be in addition to what these command modules and skill trees do  which is a very big boost in a direction that can turn major fleet fights into minipos bashes with the compositei dont know it just seems to have the potential to be way overpowered or lessening the value of things already existing
id been thinking on this a bit too but i had a slightly more brutal and cruel approach in mind which you may find possible to incorporate in yoursthe idea was to scatter bounties  if you have low standings with a factionsov holder a bounty could be executed on your headas such my almost 50 sec status would not prevent someone from being able to put a bounty on my head with a faction i was negative with  but only in that factions sov would i be a no concord fair target though still bountied if killed in other space gank style  but concord  sec status loss also it would allow sov groups to use the bounty system directly to place bounties on enemies heads  kind of a contract fulfillment gig where the funds are held npc style until someone collects on it or it expiresas such you could be wanted dead in all of highsec via sec status or just bountied in amarr caldari jita etc based upon your standings with a faction as such any bounty hunter could legally shoot you in that space  no concord no gcc etc a legal retaliationyou could have various bounties in different sectors of space  wanted where someone could only collect the ones they had access towild west style  bounties in different states cross the state line and the bounty is invalid but you could kill and go collect but youd be violating another sovereign states territory with all the potential repercussions of thatbuild a skill tree for how many bounties you can go after tie the sizes of them to faction standings and allow bounty hunting in a factions space to actually raise your standings with that faction a registered bounty hunters style subprofessionlots of potential for various uses and abuses a bit less  kind in its applications and it potentially takes buildingrebuilding standings from go rattingmission running to go kill other playersi never really fleshed it out all the way but thats the general gist of it  allow bounties and bounty hunters to be setup very broadly and make it much more eve like  not a twoedged sword but more a morningstar with lots of jagged spikes sticking out
currently the state of faction warfare from what i have noticed is largely one mad offensive dash with little to no defense being played the reason for this is simple offensive plexes reward lp defensive plexes give no direct benefitits quite understandable that defensive plexes give no benefit for farming purposes but i have two ideas about how to perhaps combat the mad offensive dash that i perceive faction warfare to be1 reward defensive plexing a fraction of the amount that an offensive plex would give based on the percentage contestedfor example assume a small plex rewards 15k lp if run offensively running a small plex defensively in a system that is 0 contested would award 0 lp running a small plex defensively in a system that is 50 contested would award 75k lp this would promote defense in more popular systems and would likely lead to more pvp2 break up faction warfare in general into pieces as is the entire set of contested systems are open for attacking and defending perhaps if only a set amount of systems were available for attackdefense at any given time based on the progress of either side so the warfare would progress a bit more logically albeit in a much more controlled way and i would personally prefer solution 1visual reference for 2
i support solution 1 it really solves the source of many problems with fw
point 1 would go some way to encouraging defensive plexing there have been a number of good ideas to encourage defensive plexing some of which included the idea of paying a  of lp directly to infrastructure of the system the plex is in some combination of that and what you suggest would seem ideal to mecould you clarify point 2 a little do you mean you would only be allowed to contest x amount of systems at once or contest systems adjacent to a system you already control based on progress meaning you can contest more when winning or when losing
there is currently no point in defensive plexing nobody does it not counting defense fleets and theres a reason for it which has nothing to do with whether or not the system is at 3 or 93 contested most people that are plexing are just doing it for the lp farming even despite the lack of speedtanking and without any legitimate payout they typically avoid defensive plexing like a plague but the other main reason is simple carebearism in that your defensively plexing systems that are currently under attack from the opposing militia ie lots of wts usually this means its a hairy proposition for the defensive plexers which roots out the more casual lp farmer which considering how much isk speedtanking sites makes for how little opposition there isisnt suprising and thus leaves the aggressor with a targetfree system to just grind down till they flip it there is a balance in there somewhere but i do think rewarding defensive plexing with fractional lp payouts would help in making it a more viable strategy as it is its far more profitable to let systems flip just to flip them back while snagging millions in lp this makes it a frustrating war for amarr despite the enjoyment to be had from all the cheep pvpfrogblast the vent core when the wrkncacnter came pthia was killed and yrro in anger flung the wrkncacnter into the sun the sun burned them but they swam on its surface
while we do have hundreds of thousands of people that love the eve online experience it is a very particular type of game ie we have had serious problems getting to a million people let alone 10 million and weve given up on eve as making it just by improving the game we need to build new games because we cant reach our customer number goals
supported nice ideaid rather have other players get shot by other players than not interacting with others ccp soundwave
yeah  high sec is all about alpha strikes  so the only thing that will help there are things you can activate against someone who hasnt yet triggered any criminal flag  in low and null they have the luxury of shooting first and asking questions later but in hisec that will currently get you concorded
the ability to pay this way might work except who in their right mind is going to pay the same as a full account you would be giving up 2 same account alt slots and the ability to have chars logged on at the same time per additional character being trainedthere would need to be more value add or a lowered cost for 1 account simply training alts either of which would cause problems and additional workload for ccp  while doing very little to improve overall game acceptancesatisfaction
ive done some research and was suprised to found nothing related to this topic so i will try to explain as of the best of my capacity what my vision is see it this way many alliances or corporation will use preformated fittings and fleet concept for their roamsops since the fc needs to have specific damage dealing and etc it is crucial for everything to be properly plannedhere is my suggestion have an option inside playercorporation fitting browser witch allow the operator to create a folder in the folder the operator could then save different fittings related to the subject in questionto have a better vision here is an exemple of a folder structurefitting browserbomber fleetpurifiert1 purifiert2 purifiermanticorenemesishounddeveloppement fitsship name1format 1format 2ship name 2ship name 3ship name 4in conclusion instead of using the traditionnal way openning the fitting browser picking the ship type searching for the correct fit etc etc the player only as to open the fitting browser look for the correct folder and choose the fit he needsit is a simple addition to the game i might make it sound big but it realy isnt its simple and easy to add there are lots of different variation of this concept not only for corporation but for player it can be used for so many different thingsits simple but will make a huge difference in terms of organisation of one of the most imporant part of the gameif you simply feal this is a good idea please either like the post or write a response of the kind nice idea i agree with it and have nothing else to add dont simply skip to the next one because you dont have anything to say about itthank you corniel atell me what you think
i would be entirely okay with this
objectivegive small ships roaming gangs of approx 15 cruisersbcs objectives in 00 sov space why this is neededcurrently there is a void in opportunities for small ships to have an impact in 00 destroying poss arent really an option for these types of fleets nor is participating in territorial claiming as a large assault with greater numbers and bigger ships is required weve all been therespend 20 minutes getting a roaming gang together then 20 minutes jumping to the destination only to find that your opponent turttled up in a pos or station and refuses to fight your only options are to stay there and camp boring no gameplay value or travel to another destination and hope you find someone to gank who isnt paying attention to intel channels there needs to be more than thisproposal1 make ihub upgrades attackable like station services are 2 balance the hit points on the upgrades so a 15 man cruiser sized roaming gang can offline an upgrade in 20 minutes 3 in order to restore the upgrade to online status the owning corp must pay a fee 25 mil iskreasons for doing this1 gives small ships a target to assault without requiring a full out war or blob warfare2 adds an economic warfare element that is currently missing in 00 a you know youve inflicted 25 mil isk damages to your enemy per incapped upgrade tangibleb you know that youve denied access to greater income potential until upgrades are returned to service intangible3 it uses assets already in game so the dev team doesnt have to devote an entire expansion to make it happen additional bonuses1 when coupled with kill mails that show reinforced structures that the devs stated they would be adding to the gamei can now contract mercenaries to hit someone on the other side of the map and have a quantifiable result outside of ships destroyed ill pay you x amount per upgrade you offline mercenaries rejoice 2 tactical choices no blob needed alliances can send out 3 different small roaming fleets to 3 different systems within enemy territory and cause chaos imagine the intel channels and the confusion in trying to get a defense fleet together under those circumstances plus even if one group is blobbed by the defenders the other 2 fleets are still causing damage3 new isk sink added to the game thats a good thing for the economy
stop moon goo production thatll get their attention and some fights
if 15 bcs can kill ihub upgrade in 20 minutes a 250 man bs fleet can alpha the upgradeswhilst the idea is commendable it wont happen like that the blob will move in and destroy all upgrades in 5 minutes tehn move onto teh next ihub
fair point but i dont think thats a problem 250 ships can oneshot a really expensive ship and rack up billions in ship destruction very quickly in a fight but we dont balance ships to face 250 man blobs as a result but thats apples to oranges so since the fee for fixing the incapped upgrade is relatively small 25m was just an example it could be 20m or 15m you could incap an entire systems upgrades for less than the cost of a fitted t2 hac or bs are corps going to get huge blobs together every day to inflict such a small amount of isk damage maybe but it would get old hitpoints and isk dmg could be balanced to find a sweet spot
in the war on clicking i would like to propose that keyboard shortcuts be added for fast overview tab switching being able to use atl15 just like in chrome would be hot not to mention that keyboard shortcuts is a better analog to using my mind than moving the mouse and clicking on something make eve real
1 for an excellent idea
i propose to add more items to the ore and materials filter in the new inventory system i dont know exactly what items are included in the filter but i know that planetary interaction products are not included i would love to use that filter more pi products are materials and should fit into that filter it makes sense maybe this filter could include gas or moon materialspolymers as well if if they are not already includedif other people would like to include a another group of materials to be added in that filter propose here but i propose and ask for pi products to be included 
greetingsall for new shiny sht assuming the math works right i support the idea this seems to me to be the perfect roll for a tech3 destroyervreastin the imortal words of socrates  i drank what
that is definitely a concern but one of the things i mention in the counters post is a new combat tractor that would literally allow a frigate to yank the destroyers out of position the idea certainly isnt about creating a pos bash but it is about creating a frigatefest as an opening to each battle noobs in frigates and destroyers wouldnt be just a good idea theyd be needed and actively recruited i hope
thank you for your support my only worry with a tech 3 destroyer is that would make already diluted cruisers entirely useless t3 is about versatility at an efficiency level between tech 2 and tech 1 destroyers today are characterized by a frigate tank with roughly double a frigates punch i can see making an aegis destroyer another tech 2 hull but id prefer a brand new tech 1 destroyer with a role bonus
wait i can have a fluffy dress does it come in pink1 for new effect ideain the imortal words of socrates  i drank what
the spindly sticky out bits on minmatar ships are actually the drives responsible for these numerous micro jumps thats why minmatar ships are faster  they have more of these ugly odd things and the dogthings are why minmatar ships smell bad
i have drawn an incredibly crude picture designed to represent the idea
i think by rewarding defensive plexing this will also help solve the issue of solo offensive plexing simply because there will be more defenders in a more contested system sure this will encourage the people who really want to solo plex to go to uncontested systems but eventually an equilibrium will be reached
i giggled when i read incredibly but the picture works very well in accordion to your explanation this makes a lot more sense now that we have a visual on how it would work
i like the idea of lp based on  contested it makes sense both from game mechanics and rp point of view but i cant support your idea of warzones let the militias decide what systems they think they can take and defend
ok but  i dont think this is about risk it is really just about the grief and the game mechanics where players are supposed to be active and not botting or causing things to happen while afkyou had an interesting idea to tag the guy in local as afk but just a tag would as noted surely be abusedbut along the same idea it occurs to me we already have an ingame feature to report griefing in local if someone uses inappropriate words or gestures  lol perhaps the same mechanic could be improved by adding a check box ok whatever im not a programmer but u get the idea here  or some other reporting feature that could be initiated by a player who feels someone isnt at the keys for xxx minutes or hours  which can in turn be followed up by some game admin whenever they are bored or between cups of coffee or something after all if the grief really goes on 247  its not a labor intensive thing to identify and cause the reported griefer to lose his connection for violation of eula to be at the keys when playing but youll say we cant do that oh wai that might cause the griefer some grief like the time i got banned briefly from posting in local because someone in the enemy fleet pushed that button and reported me for  never mindjust a thought anyways grief for grief sounded good at first blush so shoot at it
its called a niche your interpretation is way off the mark as the game is continually further developed which you would have noticed if you werent so busy whining about ccps bottom line which you have no real knowledge of remember the last time ccp had to fire a bunch of people guess what it wasnt because of griefersit isnt underperforming at all it is a niche game that attracts a certain audience steep learning cliff whenever i hear that phrase my stomach turns since this game isnt rocket science it just looks complex because nearly all other games are being developed with a barely literate audience in mind you shouldnt have to be able to think hell some people dont even want to be at their keyboard to be able to play why is it that some minersindustrials in high sec mind you are making tons of money off this hulkageddon while others are writing post upon post feebly arguing that some of the core ideas of this game need to be destroyed in order for it to survivethere you go again what are you ccps accountant i highly doubt it since you dont even seem to grasp the very basic notion that using plex to play does not make any difference to ccp at alloh yeah before the usual moaning starts never ganked a miner or industrial myself never been ganked never scammed anyone never been scammed still think its a part of the game
they did have to let people go last year because ccp didnt have enough cash to pay them thats called the blunt bottom line  if you dont bring in enough us you cant keep paying it out if you want to survive as a business at 9 years old eve should be paying ccp a lot more than it currently appears to be a lot of interest in the ip is industry speak for people want to buy the rights to use eve onlines brand you should stop right now face the emperor and thank all the amarr gods in eve that ccp didnt just sell the rightsit does make a difference to ccp when they gave the plex away and forgo income because of it plex also creates a future debt look at where americas economy ended up by being too cute with debtsread what ccps ceo is saying dust is a doorway into the eve world and ccp will probably not make real money off dust long term unless those players move into eve itself and pay with actual us free to play dust means ongoing costs if dust does not pull in the new subscribers sony wants for its ps3 who do you think is going to be footing the bill to keep dust working once the initial contract is up for renegotiation just like in eve itself nothing is ever really free so do the math and think about it  dusts pricing model only works long term if ccp get a lot of players coming into eve from dust and subbing up and staying its brilliant as a marketing tool but viable in the long term only if new players join the game and stay this whole thread is about minor changes to improve the likelihood that an identified subsegment of the population would continue to play and indeed play and buy and use plex on items too save a carebear help ccp you have all of nullsec and lowsec to go crazy ganking people in i dont see what the issue is about improving protetions for newersocial orientated players in highsec the isk per hour mining there sucks anyway oh and thank you for contributing i had a friend join red v blue and he had superb things to say about you guys discussing an issue should always be about the issue not about the person speaking and the more perspectives on an issue the more robust the conversation the more useful it is for game developers games like these are inevitably about balancing competing tensions however ultimately the commercial bottom line has to win out or like so many pvp games before the game shuts down
i guess you dont know that the actual problem was that ccp had started up and focused heavily on two new games instead of maintainingupdating the game which was actually paying those bills and the game ie eve online was suffering an exodus as a resultit has all to do with save a carebear people unsubscribing is of course not optimal but you have no idea how many people are subscribing because of the lamentations of these carebears
battleships are not 800k in null and a retriver is 20 million most of the pvp i see in nullsec is 2004 vets in superfast ships with massive alpha appear obliterate a 2 month  1 year old toon and vanish out of system then you get the huge fleet fights where the whole game performance crawls to a slideshow mess then a bomber wing obliterates everyone you seem to have forgotten that you can make combat ships more expensive or you can make mining ships cheaper as things stand i can see why people ridicule this game so much  your arguments simply dont reflect the experiences of many other players and because you are so full of selfrighteous bullshit you dont even realise how weak your argument is you dont make 25 million an hour on minerals in nullsec  because you have noone there to buy anything off you without highsec there is no game nullsec is a bad joke with a great deal of boring mechanics that are nothing more than poorly designed isk sinks that is my personal impression null needs work and too bad if you dont like it but dont tell me how easy it is in nullsec because its not what you mean by nullsec is probably the we never ever have pvp here goons reigon or something where the players are so bored they go to highsec
no youre right if you live in non space battleships are actually 1416m each i forget the exact figure i dont rat much vovthis is why i pay for my subscriptionsyou havent tried this in tidi have you or havent you learned to switch off various graphical options if your computer isnt up to scratchor more likely the entire bomber wing explodes in a fiery ball of death because they couldnt warp out quickly enoughwhy should they be given your argument jumpfreighters should be reduced in price too its so unfair that a few bses can kill a ship which is costing between 67 billion isk   face it youre paying those 300m for a marginal increase in output and tankability so you can actually use it in say nullsec youre not entitled to anything in particular just because youve paid a lot of money for it
this thread is so full of terribly thought out posts and really really bad logic that it hurts my headdust wont make any money unless the dust players move to eve someone hasnt been paying the slightest bit of attention to the way the mmo market is moving free to play games earn more money than most subscription games want to know how play one and youll seethere is nothing wrong with mining ships there is nothing wrong with the price or effectiveness of destroyers and there is nothing wrong with highsec the only problem we do appear to have is that suicide ganking is too easy and so any sensible person who sees the above would just think change the mechanics of how easy it is to suicide gank or make the consequences of suicide ganking more dire dont drag other aspects of the game into an already complicated subject they dont have to have anything to do with it
i lold you clearly dont know what youre talking about a 5 year old toon and a 6 month old toon can do the same thing the only difference is a 5 year old toon has access to different other ships no one to buy anything off you got to be joking there are loads of manufacturers in nullsec supercap production as well you can manufacture in null and seed the market ever thought about that nullsec is easy probably safer than highsec you probably just had a bad experience or friends had 1 bad experience and thought  it im leaving nullsec isnt just about huge fleet fights there are plenty of smallmedium size gangs out there only though most of the fights that are publicised are the huge ones and fyi bomber wings rarely work just 1 lemming with the wrong bomb or wrong placement to  everything up get out into nullsec and experience it yourself
the primary issue i have with these suggestionsarguments is as a whole they generally promote the creation of an isolated niche population within the game which runs counter to the core of eve sure there are some updates that probably should be made to industrialmining ships to make them a bit more competitive vs upgrades to combat mechanicsships however there are reasonable steps that can be made to make highsec a lot safer by becoming more organized you know actually interacting with others in a sandbox mmo every remotely successful group of players in eve has some level of organization this is already what youre kind of proposing with a crafting guild rather than introducing some artificial mechanic why dont you go out and organize a playermanned version with similar objectives as those that you proposed if it looks like too much work then find a way to share the workload with others that share your vision in any event the further compartmentalization of the eve universe is not the answer
you might not satisfied with the attitude of the csm towards the dwellers of high security empire space which was summarized by alekseyev karrde you have to deal with it or stay docked or play another gameinstead of whining let me introduce it is a lobby organization we have no politicians csm candidates but try to influence all of them by offering them the votes of our members if the politician supports the views of the organization we do nothing ingame maybe a jitamarch before the election our sole purpose is to influence the csm election to get a csm8 that supports our ideas how will we do it well have a big enough voterblock that is too juicy to be ignored highsec hold 80 of the players we have 80 of the votes we can own csm if we start voting instead of crying on the forums to ccp that does nothing until the csm speaks up ccp listens to csm however most of the csm members came from nullsec representing those who gank us they are ignoring us but we deserve that as we are ignoring the electionto make differece we need votes if you are supporting the ideas of  you should join the corp to show it to the csm of course you shouldnt do it on an active char the corp will do nothing and probably will be wardecced in the second this post goes up join only with station trader or manufacturer alts the ones who barely ever leave stations or simply start a new alt on an empty slot and join if you have multiple accounts you have multiple votes so join in multiple instances join as soon as you can as characters must not be on trial accounts or younger than 30 days to vote everyone would assume younger pilots to be trial alts created for the purpose of looking bigger if you make an alt for this purpose now make it caldari so i dont have to learn ethnic relations 5 also spread the word in your real corp and friend list ask them to join too has three program points  less griefing more highsecpve content  no power item shopthe details will be worked out you can of course take part of that discussion too but if you agree with the main points you shall join if we just whine they keep ignoring us if we present thousands of votes they will start to caresee the details on

so questions for your new group 1 wardecs are the sanctioned way for one corp to suppress the economic activities of another corp npc corps are gimped to limit their economic activities no corp offices to share materials high tax rate no towers etc what economic sanctions are appropriate for a idontwanttobewardecced corp a 20 concord bribery tax 2 recycling characters to avoid negative security status hits or negative wallets is already prohibited by ccp do you really think force new players to way 2 and half months before they can participate in suicide ganking is fair to them youre essentially forcing players to be good guys for a fairly significant period before they can play how they want perhaps you should ask ccp to work on detection schemes that prevent character rollover rather than banning new characters from participating in valid playstyles 3 insurance changes you already dont get insurance payouts if concord destroys your ship are you suggesting in highsec lowsec or nullsec if i land on an ratting drake and start shooting him that if the drake shoots back after i started attacking him that he should not get insurance for his ship andor are you suggesting that if the drake destroys my ship after i attacked him that i should not get insurance because i started shooting
youll have my hisec alts support oh waitid rather have other players get shot by other players than not interacting with others ccp soundwave

dscan issue was discussed already in this thread here was one of my replies in relation to an automated dscan system could you quotelink where ccp has said anything about what they want with the dscanner i dont remember them saying that
im in support of this idea it will make it easy for peoplecorpalliances to promote their service products or propaganda and it makes it a good isk sink
greetingsfirst i agree with a players right to blow up anything and everything anywhere he wants with appropriate repercussions which i also believe are already in place sandbox for the win we already nerfed insurance payouts to gankerssecond your idea is the most well thought out i have seen not necessarily to stop ganking but to add a beneficial aspect to game play that does not infringe on anyone elses style yes gankers will have to rethink some tactics and industrial  miners  haulers  high value curriers will have to find friends but constructive change is a good thing i however would open it up to other ship types not sure how it would work but i can think of some fcs who would love to not be primaried every time they load grid so it could have second and third order effects outside of the high sec gank well done sirvreastin the imortal words of socrates  i drank what
interesting
never gona happenwhyright now if you want to train a new account you create and pay for that account with your change that would be one less sub for everybody who wants multiple alts if you cant see why ccp wont do that after 9 years there isnt much posting the 85th thread about is going to do to clear up your confusion its not going to happen ccp is a business your proposal will cost them income
ive been in the software development field for nearly 17 years if theres one thing ive learned its this never underestimate the thrift of your customers in general inconvenience is a poor deterrent for customers making due with buying one copy and hotseating however many users they can
tell me what you think dont just skip it if you think its a great idea and doesnt wanna argue ita like is great if you like the idea
the new inventory system is an impossible to use piece of  5 years of playing eve and have never been so pissed off at the stupid assholes who came up with this garbage get your programers back in the shop and remove everything that was changed to the inventory system listen to the players remove it now
wow just wowi thought the update was a good step forward yes there are some issues  lots of mouse macros are screwed  but they can be fixedi imagine the old code was very deeply rooted and could not be changed with out major problems in the entire game it sounds like the new one allows ccp to make alterations without bringing the game to a grinding haltmy only complaint make player controlled folders so we dont have to buildbuy station warehouses to keep sanity
id like to bring up the issue of those players who are colorblind  with regards to the coloring on the missile warheads and the associated background nebulae on targeted shipsid like to see a small diagonal cutaway from a corner of an items tumbnail with the color in question as a solid nongradiented areathe warheads gradient while nice make it difficult to discern the actual color of it for those of use who have trouble or cannot see colours at all and its even more difficult to pick out the background nebulae for many ships to match it to a damage typejust an ideajesuschrist renamed to scoreboard scoreboard kills himself
greetingsnot sure what the end mechanics would look like but i am all in favor of a simple solution to get more pvp going baring the blob mechanic it would definitely serve to leave a calling card as you passed through other peoples space vreastin the imortal words of socrates  i drank what
if it costs isk its irrelevant incap every goonswarm ihub and theyll barely even notice paying the fee to fix them allhow is that an advantage over the usual rep mechanics every other structure has
ships also generally arent static structures which just sit around 2357 waiting for someone to shoot them either
this isnt really a were going to bankrupt them concept as much as a were going to inflict a little damage to their wallets for not defending their space concept focused on small ships it shouldnt be a bankrupting situation anyways it adds an opportunity that isnt currently there and would hopefully help encourage more pvp or more roaming gangs knowing that if they didnt find anyone to gank they could at least inflict some type of damage to the opponent the only way of doing economic warfare against big alliances is through moon mining systems and even then they have t2 bpos and other methods of income smaller corps corps within less established alliances and even individual corps within a big alliance that dont have moon income would feel the impact depending on the size of the fee of course no doubt theyd rather spend that 100 or 200 or however many millions you cost them on equipment or resources more than on restoring their upgrades itll add up the advantage to a fee rather than simply repping is that its quantifiable if it was just a repping situation what is the impact someone could just use an alt to rep while they run the belts or go to another system you didnt hit with an online upgrade leaving little impact if any its more definitive with the fee and it comes out in pure isk rather than time
which means that small entitiesll be more heavily penanized economically than the big guys which wont give a flying hint pocosagain pocossigh this again stop this this isnt the big moneymaker you think it istime hurts more equally than isk balancing anything on isk doesnt work never has never willas for an alt can just rep it while they run the belts well guess theyre going to be that much easier to gank then
i like the idea of a target for smaller gangsbut i think the repair process should at least take 24 hours or soand poco are not for small gangs as they have 15mil ehp and a reinforce timer
while i very much want to see small gang warfare targets i dont think your suggestion fits the bill 1 station services have enormous amounts of ehp they are not small gang targets 2 i dont think current ihub mechanics mesh well with your goal  if you can repair an upgrade for isk the damage you inflict will be easily negated by a quick payment 25m is nothing to a large corp hell its nothing to many ratters  upgrades only go online at the next dt and upgrades typically go offline immediately if you allow a smallsized gang to be able to shut off upgrades you create a very annoying tz warfare situation  imo there is too little risk for the marauders given the economic impact they can inflict its easy to avoid a counter assault and they risk very little while shooting the ihub in short i like your goal i just dont think this is a viable implementation in its current form another note i had a corp mate that propsed a fairly neat idea very much in line with this player created incurionsthis does not create sansha incursion sites the main idea its a deployable device that causes systemwide incursion effects to screw over general pve  reduced resistances on all ships reduced bounties on all npc ratsand a few other ideas were suggeted to affect ore mining ice mining pi moongoo etc but the above two are the main goal the concept a marauding group comes into local anchors the device creating a system wide warpable beacon they then online it if the enemies dont destroy the lowehp beacon within 15 minutes or whatver the system gains the above incursion effects for the next several hours my favorite alteration of it was that the effects would last a few days but the severity of the effects would wax around the deployment period and wane for the rest of the day then the marauders can unanchor the device move to another system and redeploy it the goal is to force the locals to form up and fight off the marauders before their precious ratting system becomes much less effective its low ehp think a few 10s of thousands not miilions and the fact the marauders are putting the device at risk essentially give them something to lose and the 15 minutes to online period force the locals to act quickly limiting blob potential
we clearly need faction warfare plexes in nullsec
at the moment to clear a chat window you need to right click the top border and select clear all contenta better idea would be to have it as a right click option inside the panel that actually has the text you want to clear currently that panel only has copy copy all and toggle timestamp
greetingsi second this whoever said that 3k m3 was giant is probably the same one who told us what six inches looks like instead of looking for a new and abused game mechanic how about a usable secure cargo container with 20k m3 just so the truly greedy will still jet can mine the container in theory would fit empty inside a badger mk1 with cargo expanders so as to have something to train to when anchored it would expand to usable size and would need to be emptied again to unanchor and movevreastin the imortal words of socrates  i drank what
well said but in all likelihood they will ignore your good suggestion and carry on bickering about a subject that isnt going anywhere that seems to be the way of this forum in general
damn you had to go all technical on us i thought t3 stuff was so bitter vets could have something new shinny and completely full of awesomeness so as to thumb our nullbear wealth at the lowly rabble of highsecin the imortal words of socrates  i drank what
well if you put it that way
i like this approachadd to that things like if you shoot too many npcs of a faction pirate or empire or make it standing based they npc factions can put bounties on your head too which makes your open game for player bounty hunters in their space not much diff in lownull though and killing a player with a npc bounty gives you standing boost with that faction too very interestingbut this good idea like many others still needs to address the fundamental flaw with bounty hunting profession today which is how do you keep people from collecting on their own bountieswithout a fix for this no bounty hunting feature will work
you obviously havnt read any of the thread stopping people from collecting their own bounties has been adressed over and over and overin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
yea i definitely prefer solution 1 having that sort of rigid control inside a game as free as eve would feel weird
option 3 find a mechanism for defending the system that doesnt involve orbiting a button afk for 15 minutes at least when offensive plexing there are rats to tankshootthe problem is that capturing and defending systems is tedious if we have to orbit a thing to change vulnerability give more system  per outpost and reduce the spawn rate of outposts to compensate i know that the devs want systems to take 35 hours to flipit would be better if we had a capture mechanism that was more interesting
with mechanism 1 you would be more likely to be defensively plexing in a highly contested system meaning a much greater chance of having some pvp going on
just a question the afk tag is dangerous for any player  nothe afk tag changing the game mechanics  noeveryone knows why would be disturb the afk tag some cloaky fags who lying in this topic im afk at enemy systems and i cant kill anyone when im afk because they would be lost the chances to terrorizing active players in afk
reports all 1500 people in jitaseveral times
agreeits true
its also stupid if you are afraid of cloakers then get out of nullsec
i knew we werent going to get along very well your doing it again you cant just say no to stuff and expect people to take you seriously if you want people to take your opinion seriously you need a couter arguemnet which i imagine you are too daft to think upalso nice alt post again you really do make it very obviousin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
if you are afraid from afk tag then get out of game
this
silly rabbit not a jita issuethis mechanic issue and my suggestion for a solution using the reporting button only apply in null sec and low sec as your war decs in empire already have time limits as the new players already noted above an afk enemy or neutral player in empire doesnt cause the same type of grief does not require the same type of respectresponse fear is not the issue players have to respect the game mechanics which includes the off chance the afk dude walks by his computer or gets active when the locals are trying to do their thing without proper respect to the neut in system boomso dont be afraid be insured be griefed just make the game more enjoyable and give the majority some counters to shake this up
yet we already have that hardcoded in with the null sec alignment rules this game already has neartotally separate populations of players however the real issue is the most vocal richest and most pandered to by ccp are the null sec pvperseve was always intended to be a game that supported many different gameplay styles as a true space simulator most of the arguments above by the pvp crowd are essentially that if you are not a pvp player get out of the game that is not what eve is meant to be about the critical issue is that with the current game mechanics it is simply not possible to prevent someone killing a mining ship you literally cannot stop them as discussed above it is too easy conceptually miners should be able to have pvpers guard them if they want to but that is not actually a valid tactic in highsec until the greifers fire there is no right to fire upon them and the new ships and power of alpha strikes now means that it is simply not possible to stop the killthats broken spin it any way you want bored null sec billionaires going to highsec and murderering social orientated mining players is just not good for the game its promoting noskill preforma pvp not highly fluid skilldependent pvp nolosekills are as stupid for the game as introducing battlecruisers that were not properly designed or balanced you like the drakes overrunning the game think that makes for good dynamic pvp  gets old fastno matter how you spin it highsec miners have been getting the thin edge of the wedge from ccp  they pay the same money per month as others often more because they usually cant afford plex so come on ccp sort it out t2 mining ships should have survivability if a t2 transport can have a 2 warp core stabiliser not bad shields and armour so too ca a hulk that costs twice as much and takes longer to train into or make the damn things cheaper  and yes make freighters  jump freighters cheaper as well while you are at it
but i am entitled to raise an issue when gankers drive my mining friends out of the game why because i paid real money to play this game and i think the highsec ganking has revealed what i consider to be real flaws in the game design and balance this game has been underperforming for years for ages ccp thought it was that people were too distant from their characters so they added walking in stations that hasnt really changed all that much though guess what the issue seems to be greifers being total wankers for no better reason than they are bored that has killed other pvp games offline gone dead i dont want that to happen here with eve underperforming and limping along with ever lesswellbalanced shiny toy ships being used to appease the restless thinning masses miners have been forgotten while year after year pvpers have been given a rediculous amount of new ships so many in fact that nearly all the original ships are simply obsolete you can build what 3 oracles for the minerals it takes to build an apocalypse guess which does more damage at 100 km and which gets to warp quicker if things are not going your way yay well done ccp again nice balance there  not im waiting for the minicarriertitancombobattlecruiser next
a macro cause of the grief that the op and many new players feel in eve is that this game was designed by griefers for griefers and griefing will always be a part of this game it was designed this wayim a carebear and run a carebear corp and i do it in a universe that is constanlty trying to grief me that is the way it is and the way it will be always remember the people who designed the game and who continue to make game design decsion are griefers if you are going to play this game for awhile and enjoy it you have to deal with this truthas a carebear i deal out my own form of grief 
its ccps fault you dont watch local use dscan mine away from the default warpin point mine in empty systems or tank your hulks if youre that worried about highsec gankers move to nullsec or wormhole space there must be corps around wholl take you without any of the uninformed bs you guys always spew when the suggestion is made as a nullsec resident for 18 months or so ive never experienced most of what gets complained aboutganking is not griefing if i gank you once its a gank if i gank you exclusivley every time you undock in highsec yeah thats griefy if tier 3 bcs have replaced battleships why do the nullsec entities use battleships as the mainstay of their fleets why do highsec missionrunners use battleships why do i use a magathron over a talos for rattingi dont think you know what balance is either put an oracle into a brawl an apoc would come out of perfectly fine and youll find you have a dead oracle they fill different roles entirelynot that youll read any of this
 1  yeah i gave up on the csm frankly it is time for ccp to review the entire csm concept the entire gonswarm fiasco via  the milantti  was directly caused by the csm office my theroy is let ccp come up with ideas and if they fail then people will
griefing is a bannable offence whats the problem
ccp and csm5 agreed to vanity items only go read fearless and understand the horror that would be released on the game if ccp decided to settle for no power items the three types of transactions identified were vanity concierge and power concierge items were things like paying money to have more saved fittingsscatim helicon would do a better job of the voice of hisec than gevlon though i fear that statement is condemning with faint praise
giznitt safe corp no towers same missioning tax as an npc corpcan you give any sensible reason why would a real newbie spend his time and very limited resources with suicideganking id say every 1month old suicide ganker is a throwaway recruitafr
you want safe stay in your npc corpyes its funhey i have a better idea lets remove insurance in its entiretylast i checked griefing was going after one player in particular or going after newbies in starter systems scamming some random idiot or ganking a random hulk isnt automatically griefing in the well ban you way its part and parcel of how eve works
also heh ccp shall not remove plex thats funny im sure that demandll go down well
i love these highsec demagoguesthis sounds somewhat similar to isslers voice of reason party from the last election
so if new accounts are banned from crime does that mean low and null are totally off limits to them or just low and why ban people in npc corps from having fun
im a nullsec player i have 3 accounts 3 characters are in nullsec the rest are support characters in hisec of my 9 playable toons 6 are in hisec that is 66 of my pilots 80 of pilots in hisec are in fact not hisec players many of them are merely nullsec players miners haulers incursion runners fw mission runners and other stuff these people will consider themselves nullsec players not to mention the amount that are nullsec peoples hisec ganking alts 80 of characters may be in hisec that doesnt equate to 80 of people being hisec players
i just noticed this i have 3 accounts 2 of my characters are in nullsec the rest are in hisec doing various things80 of the accounts may stay in hisec its not 80 of the players though
its kind of cute how frequently people try to play william wallace
confirming that all my disposable scoutcyno alts are in highsec doing what exactlynonplaying disposable alts are placed where your actual characters dont want to be  that would be lowsec not highsec or null
i dont know about you but i do considerable business in hisec when im not in a fleet in null this includes watching prices in a lot of market hubs etc
station games as far as i can tell are pretty much against everything ccp stands forstation games save ships when they should diestation games give the cowardly high sec war deccers a mechanic to hide behind even tho they are the ones that aggressedi am tired of trying to go 1v2 and having to go home with no kill simply because i dont have the dps to alpha one of the 2 playersproposal make warp scrambled ships unable to dock or better yet make ships that are being aggressed currently unable to dock similar to the nerf of the super loggoffski trickpro more ships will die and this promotes more actual fightscon cowards wont be able to hide behind station mechanics anymore
repeat ccp dont want directional scanner spamming every two seconds thats why they changing the dscanner delays to 25 secondsthis idea is bad and delayed local too no more cloaking boostnot supported
bump
ccp why have you yet again just completely screwed up faction warfarewhy have you made it into 00 effectively with this stupid station lock outs sov type bashing and whatever elsethis isnt what we want from faction warfare if we wanted that we would go to nullseclowsec has just become nullsec with restrictions we dont want to be endlessly fighting for sov thats the reason why we came out of nullsecyou know why alot of us went to faction warfare to shoot stuff and for targets plain and simple i mean its our battlegrounds effectivelystop allowing highsec bears to be in fw if they are going to be protected whats the point of being in war if you hide in highsec all the time remove the boundaries remove the navies allow people to shoot others in highsec if they are in fw without protection yes i understand that something has to be fought over but station lock outs seriously you forcing us to do endless grinding just to be able to dock yet again the most boring depressing thing you can come up with you did whats with the obsession about grinding through this stuffi dont think this should be forced i think yes have something people can play for or a prize to win if they so wish to do so just like the old days of deds where people competed to get them of course randomise them otherwise they get taken over like last time i dont think stuff should be implemented that makes someone play a specific way or be forced to the problem is you have to fight for the system in order to stay in it i didnt sign up for that and i know alot of people in fw didnt eitherwe might as well just all go pirate and have an alt in fw to farm missions if need be
ban npc corp posters from csm forums

bah hum bugthe intrinsic value of any internet based progam can only be measured by the amount and quantity of clicks by the users just ask facebook about thatkeep us lost keep us clicking and the spice will flow on a serious note theres one other place a shortcut might help and thats the trade window from sitting in stationus old timers like having ships in station show up on the right side and checked the button to keep them there but when you see a ship you want to trade you have to tab out from the ship window to do it that means its a few clicks farther away and not immediately obvious what to do to trade ships and stuff because you have to click on the guy in station to trade then tab to ships and do it in the correct order or youre borked so maybe give option to start a trade windown from clilcking in local or doing a shortcut to eliminate extra key strokes
a modest proposalwhen scanning it would be helpful to be able to identify wormholes from other signatures early in the process
hmm yes please just waiting till i can see a fleet of 250 mens all warping with that jizzling effect o while warping in fleet it would be amazing to see ships warp on at a time instead of seeing a splush of ships all warping together they can then meet back in the warp tunnel
this is my old post unedited from when we lived in lowsec back in teh old forums it never made it here but it drummed up alot of support and criticism i think its time it was looked at and discussed again maybe if somethign along these lines were implemented all the people who left lowsec and went to 00 maybe some would return maybe more would live there after this a lowsec improvement comittee was set up approved by ccp it disbanded very fast as no one was interested in listening really maybe its time to look againnot all the ideas will eb popular not all will be realistic but lets start a new look at lowsechere it is in its unedited form though lots of additions and edits were done at the time as new posts were put inproposed lowsec expansion outlawi renamed the thread titlelowsec needs some serious attention to make it the great place it should be and im not talking about fw which is pretty much unrelated to real lowseclowsec is about criminals its about piracy its about the dark underworld of new eden i think its about time it had some deserved attention it would take a lowdec patch to really turn it into the place it should be i suggest ccp do just that the update should be called outlawi have the following proposals for this and by no means are these all my ideas so thanks to all the people who have put ideas around before1 criminal underworld similar to 00 sov recognition should be given to the overlords who dominate systems some sort of benefits may be bought with underhand payments to authorities such as the rats in a system may notengage unless fired upon or reduced facility rates offices etcmaybe something similar to the new sov mechanics with a hub pos using modules to upgrade the system this would need to be les impacting than 00 so the best you could upgrade should not be as good as an unupgraded 00 system possibly only available in the lower security say 01 and 022 criminal faction agents for missions beter rewards for missions in lowsec generally thesse agents would be ayt pirate stations that can only be found by probing3 the blackmarket have a market that can only be accessed when in lowsec and with items that can only be sold on the black market all illegal items moved onto this market maybe with npc smuggling items too create more illegal items to load onto the market more drugs maybe illegal implants see also 4 the black market panel only becomes available when in a black market station which would only be the piratecriminal stations4 pirate faction ships and items become illegal in hisec so whilest usable in hisec become available only through the black market5 make better smuggling oportunities with these illegal items make a smuggling proffesion more viable6 crooked cops have random faction npcs for that region wander lowsec looking for payoffs hand over a little isk to go free or fight themmaybe the overlord can see to it that these crooked cops dont interfere with their people7 have lowsec borders between all the empires or at least the empires who are at war so there is no safe route for people this way people would actually hire escort personel to protect haulers another career opportunity smugglers would also be employed in such places8 new pos modules such as pleasure hubs and so on could be you need to supply it with drugsfoodalcahol etc and in return it earns money would need to be limited to like 1 or 2 per pos though to avoid large pos super brothels being built enmass in systems to make huge isk this income should be small in comparison to moon mining etc9 some form of cyno jamming as in 00 lowsec is becoming blobbed with caps possibly only the system that an alliance has godfather status could be cyno jammed would be part of the upgrades available to system overlords10 better ore better missions etc to keep the isk warriors coming in despite the riskalot of people are saying how there arnt enough people coming to lowsec but people need to have a reason to go there im not interested in getting more carebears to wander in to get ganked yes im a pirate but i prefer a fight what id like to see is more organisations fighting for turf gang wars pirate factions fighting each other or real opportunities for anti pirates to go in and wage war against their hated enemieswe need a deeper immersion for lowsec bring it on please make lowsec the dark and dangerous underbelly that society loves to hate lowsec shouldnt be a dangerous version of hisec just as 00 isnt a no concord version of hisec it should be a seperate experience in itself
a quote from a beloved gmnow i dont have a problem with rookie protectionism in the rookie systems but when you extend it outside those systems i have a problem as it makes eve a less complete place and at the moment this is only going to be enforced in arnon but personally i dont want to see this outside of rookie systems including arnon in hatakani there is an incursion atm so shall we protect rookies from those too the gm discretion has to play a part but a lot of gm discretion is ill advised i dont kill rookies unless they are generally war targets or something similiar ingame mechanics should be used to help rookies instead of artificially coddling them and its not as if they have much to lose anyway most of the timewould rookie alts be protected too in the future new players who bought an old character stop spoiling the sandbox for the majority for the sake of the new
how about we propose a new system a rookie tag on characters that indicates they are not fair game the specifics of this tag would need to be worked out ill get back to that if you steal from a wreck or can owned by a rookie you risk bannage if you gank a rookie you risk bannage if you do anything to ruin the npe you risk bannageways to trigger the rookie flag being turned off the account reaches a certain age alts would never be rookies the character joins a player corporation the character engages in activities outside of the new player experience tutorials career agents soe arc other stuff i havent though ofthis would take some serious work to prevent it being abused but i think it would solve the problem and prevent people from blundering into warnings and bans by not knowing the list
i agree that protecting systems that are distant from the rookie systems is a bad idea but i also agree completely with the gms that greifing in those systems hampers ccps growth and is frankly not coolmove the career agents to the systems next to the rookie systems then have it protected problems both of them solvedin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
1 i think clear labels on the system label stating its a rookie system is very appropriate  im under the impression its hard to know what system is considered rookie safe 2 i think any special rules that apply to rookie systems should be blatantly stated on one of the systems information tabs personally i think special rules for rookie systems like no can baiting is just a pita to enforce its a pita to keep track of and having the rules extend to other systems is not ok move the soe arc to rookie systems dont expand the rookie system limitations into soe systems 3 rather than deal with can baiting crap in rookie systems it would probably be better to have all cans automatically set blue abandoned in rookie systems this way the rookie will only get aggression when they steal from a wreck or shoot at someone for doing so finally its pretty sad we need protections for rookies
the idea only makes sense if a system is not contested why go defend it if a system is contested than the troops should thus be rewarded for their worklike
your proposal doesnt make capturing mechanisms any more interesting were still orbiting a thingmaybe means more fights maybeor maybe it means smart players find some other ways plex that still avoid fights for example maybe theyd farm two systems in a frigate and bound back and forth leading an opposing fleet on a merry chase more likely the fleet wouldnt bother really because a single frigate is a tedious target to hunt maybe they just log on when its not the other teams peak and plex in peace for extra lpthe problem with capturing systems isnt a lack of lp and so far we dont lack for pvp the problem is that orbiting a thing is tedious as all hell and you need to do it for like 35 hours to make a difference
1 i would like my noskill afk defensive plexing alt to receive the same rewards as my main in a pvpfit ship
i assume you just mean nullsec as i imagine your gripe is with hotdrops because if your issue is just you cant be bothers to defend yourself or press dscan every minute then you shouldnt be mining anywhere out of highsec so are you seriously advocating that gms start investigating if a alleged afk cloaker is really online with eyes on screen or not gms dont have too much to do anyway so yeah sure lets put one more impossible and meaningless task for them to attend to besides are you seriously advocating that gms enforce that people press a button to prove they are aliveim a cloaky i should be the one who has to do nothing and just sit and watch and collect intel that is the whole point of cloakys i dont make money from collecting intel so thats why i dont need to be pushing buttons like you are mining away and making cash if you fear a hotdrop you need to have spies of your own in systems jump distance away from your location i assume you have no issue with cloakers if they had no ability to hotdrop right if so then you have to get over the fact that you need to actively defend against hotdrops in null thats life in null thats why you get the big bucks sorry if you cant safely mine like you can in highsec thats life
you cant get intel if you get afk tag when you just sit and collect intel  you just raving herethe true it is what she wrote earlierjust a question the afk tag is dangerous for any player  nothe afk tag changing the game mechanics  noeveryone knows why would be disturb the afk tag some cloaky fags who lying in this topic im afk at enemy systems and i cant kill anyone when im afk because they would be lost the chances to terrorizing active players in afkif you collect intel and use dir scanner you using scanner button you wont get afk tagif you moving to hotdrop position you wont get afk tagyou just get afk tag when you dont move at least 30 minutesbut you can collect and share information from visual contact with afk tag too that is dont disturb you
i would like to point out that none of you advocating this afk tag have addressed any of the potential problems i have highlightedalso ribikoka you missed the point of kaelie onrens post entirely they werent even talking about the afk tag why would they no one has put forward any good argument for how it could be used yet so what you did was quote someone not talking about what your advocating even though there is a post only a few above that rips the afk tag idea to pieces which you happen to be ignoring and then say how thats not a reason to stop what your advocating your right its not because it wasnt meant to be there are far more obvious and glaring problems with the idea of an afk tag that you happen to be actively ignoringin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
an afk tag must be one of the dumbest ideas ive seen suggested congratulations local already provides ridiculously valuable information to lownull players at absolutely no cost something i personally think should change wanting it to provide even more information is just ludicrous  especially something like the activity level of another player sorry you shouldnt be able to know that unless they do something which alerts you or unless youre actively doing something to try and detect their activities like scanning
afk tags in local means you could get the bot to recognize the afk tag as a nonrisk factorif you do botting this would be a great idea to increase the effeciency of your botsremoving local or at least delaying it would be more usefull in terms of reaching the intended design goal nullsec  dangerliving in a wormhole makes you paranoid you could propably learn alot from this but it doesnt stop people from doing any activity because there is a feature that helps in risk asessment dscan
delayed local is the most dumbest idea what id seenafk tag is fine
i live in lowsec and i have a cyno alt that is now repurposed into a hauling alt i have 2 extra character slots each on both my cyno account and main account thats 4 random characters that are sitting in market hubs for quick price checks i consider myself a lowsec player even though 835 of my actual characters are parked in highsec right nowi am also starting up a corp that has 90 taxes for people who think kittens are cute join up unless you are anti kitten also the kittens demand that you farm incursions non stopif you want highsec to have less risk then it needs less rewards kill highsec incursions only have veldspar and scordite in the belts move level 4 missions to lowsec do that and then you can have your invincible hulksor we could give highsec more risk and more reward then not only would it be a place worth living in but if people wanted to transition to low null wspace then theyd have to get used to fewer new risks basically a safer highsec creates a bigger barrier to try any other type of space some more interesting missions would be nice and improving the new player experience would really help the one thing eve needs is something to do when you are alone all the group content is great but sometimes everyone you know is signed off or just doing something elsei am guessing you are talking about the lp store the lp store is a good thing first if solves a lot of isk faucet problems because lp is essentially just gear waiting to exist also rather than just making it rain isk it means the market value of your lp stuff is based on how many people are running any given site if the sisters of eve only gave out lp that could be spent on sisters probes and launchers then their price would be dependent on how many people were farming sisters of eve missions the demand for probes stays the same but the supply changes based on how many people are running the missionsi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea

im sure theres supposed to be a point there somewhere in that post
i do like the idea though i think this would fit in the process a little more smoothlyhave players who undocks redock then undock again wait 2 minute for abuse of station servicesbasically a cooldown if you undock twice under a small amount of timei like your idea though
station games are awful im pretty sure everyone in eve would agree to get rid of them if it meant noone else could use them either
i like the idea of a jammed target being unable to dock sort of makes sense
all that this would do is move gatecamping to stationcamping i mean why bother trying to maybe catch stuff on gates when with a sensor boosted ship you are guaranteed to catch a target undocking that once scrammed cannot warp out or redockits pretty much a guaranteed kill and the victim has no way of knowing what is on the undock or within a short warpin rangei agree that station games need to be addressed but you may want to rethink this proposal and consider a more balanced approach
yes to ending station games absolutely no to warp jammers stopping you docking a there is no reason in game since you arnt warping b it would kill too many people who actually dont want aggression ie people simply flying to a station to dock and getting ganked rules must never be brought in that favours gankers over everyone else ganking will an dmust always happen but it must not get any easierto mostly have all stations kick out you always end up 2500m from the station when you undock reason being simple teh station auto undocks you to avoid collision and doesnt release you to manual control until you are at a safe dstance
warp scram preventing docking is stupida better solution would to be to extend aggression time when aggressing within a certain range of a station
theres no reason that warp scrambling should prevent docking it doesnt make sense webifiers at least might interfere with being towed into the dock which is how the game states your ship gets there however if i were a docking manager i certainly wouldnt allow any ship to dock under fire id say that if they are actively taking damage they should be unable to dock this gives people more options in finding ways to get docked up and doesnt create a zerodamage method for holding someone on top of a station indefinitely
1 preventing docking because you are warp scrammed has many many problems suddenly you can bubblescram a freighter trying to leave and gank them i think this will encourage station camping and station games not eliminate it 2 if you want to end station games dont fight on a station the current 10s session change timer instaundocks and the like makes station camping much less effective fighting on station is typically just a bad idea as people can undock in anything from carrier logistics to whatever draw people off of station and if they wont leave their safety zone go find someone that will 3 while this is only partially related the new crimewatch system which is coming out soontm is supposed to transfer aggression timers to logi pilots that assist a currently aggressed party this will really alter the stationgate games and will solve much of the station game retardation
have the station guns that target any aggressor within 50km or soif it was my place of business then i would defend my customers as they enter and leavea few big guns and a warning should suffice         warning you are about to engage in hostile activities withing a 50km radius of our stationyou will loose standing against this corporation and face retaliation do you want to proceed with this aggressive act  do not show this message again        for bonus points you loose standing with whatever corporation owns the stationyou could always target the station guns and blow them up too but at a huge standing and  or security status loss  unless highsec then concord 
i dont need you to repeat yourself i asked for a quote or a link regarding your claim about ccp saying such things im not saying they didnt say it but i have never seen such comments and well sadly its not uncommon for posters to misrepresent what is just their own opinions as that of ccp etc  so please clarify or ill just assume youre making it upas for no more cloaking boosts there is no mmo that i have played where stealthsneaky gameplay is weaker than it is in eve
are there any other mmos where losses matter to the same degree as well
so you agree with the statement zim only that due to eve degree of cost of losses you think such a state of gameplay is appropriate
i made absolutely no statements in support of or in opposition to any statement i made a question
i sincerely believe that this issue will solve a lot of problems if implemented

implement a new mod a cloak disruptor which would basically be an active sonar ping and decloak cloaked vessels possibly probability based on sig radius within a certain distance dictor sphere size limit it to this new t2 destroyer classpossibly even have a targeting delay like a cloak reducible by training skillsasw destroyers exist in modern navies and this would add a counter to cloakies and mean you wouldnt want to sit afk 10k off a gate
not this crap againall you do here is make things even easier for gate campers and do nothing to address afk cloakingafk cloakers would just move to safe spotsterrible ideajint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
dont see how you make anything easier for gate campersi did consider having a system wide ping but that seemed far too powerful
seriouslyi presume you have never cloaked your way through a gate bubble before thenor done much traveling through lowzero sechow can you say that having a module that can decloak anything for 10k around a gate would not make things easier for gate campersjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
because it would be just like a dictor but unable to be effective solo how can you say that dictors make life easy for gatecampers
i didnt say anything about dictors jint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
you said something about an aoe 10km range module that can be used to catch people who previously could have gotten away sounds like a dictor bubble to meexcept my module isnt a bubble its a ping and it doesnt prevent warping just decloaks
proposal add space tissues as a commodity for people who are so bloody bothered by cloaked ships that cannot harm them in anyway and who are more than likely not even at the computer
at the moment the only way to escape a big gate camp in nullsec when there are dictors is to use a cloak so no this is a terrible terrible idea i imagine that even the usual anticloaky trolls wouldnt support this idiocyalso this exact idea has been proposed and shot down a good few times already dont make us have to do it againin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
no its not and even if you cloak you are not certain to get away and if youre that scared of a big bad gatecamp use scouts
no your not exactly so there is no problem with cloakies passing through gates then is there in which case what is the point in your proposal i can answer that for you there is nonein the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
the cana deployable module with a decloak radius of 25k
 a bubble that declaoks ships that try to cloak up to escape a gate camp and you dont see how this could be used to make gate camping easier youre either a moron or a troll i think both either way you certainly didnt do your forum research as similar ideas have been proposed and shot down more times than i care to count
1 how many solo gate camps do you encounter2 gatecampers dont use dictors because they have deployable bubbles without themif youre that scared of the big bad cloaker go to another systemgatecamps get kills every day how many times have you been killed by a cloaked shipeither youre a really terrible troll or completely unimaginative actually youre definitely the latter so ill lay out the scenario for you a gate camp sets up a drag bubble to pull people past a gate then then place one of your new destroyers on the edge of that bubble spamming pings anything that lands gets instantly decloaked a fastlocking tackler pins it and it dies a fiery death these will become standard issue in every gate came in nullsec and cloaking will be useless for everythingexcept idling in a safe spot and intimidating carebears

1 assemble all option in ship hangar if i have 100 megathrons in ship hangar i ought to be able to click once to have them all assembled2 fit all options in fitting gui all ships highlighted should be fit with the fit that is currently activeon a more serious note right now the fit button is a 70 solution that could easily be turned into a 100 solution by fitting up everything that is in the fit and not excluding items because they are rigs 3 clicking fit should install all mods all rigs all drones and everything in cargohold
rigs are excluded because they cant be removed if you make a mistake a warning message of if you use the rigs specified in this fitting they cannot be removed without destroying them are you sure would be a good compromisemass fitting ships from saves would be useful for those who do such things what i did as an alternative was create a stack for each slot in a container select all and fit to ship it let me hop between ships quickly and fit with minimal efforti fully support the idea of being able to massfit identical ships id like to see an option in the context menu for items that lets you choose the number of that item to fit to the active ship that way when you want two eanms and three heat sinks and eight pulse lasers you can place them with six clicks currently the best way ive found is to shiftdrag the lasers into 4 stacks of two select all and fit twiceleaving one heatsink to fit at the end

having been in fw since it started i think the current status of faction warfare is just skippydoodleworks just fine
the deadspace reason seems quite a viable response for not allowing cynos in
no
i believe ccps reason in what they did to the inventory was to group up everything long story short when openning the inventory you open 3 windows the items ship hangar corp hangar thus lowering the amount of windows openned on your uii agree with the possibility of having a shortcut for every window to be added to the neocom i dont see why you would have to open a general window and then open a specific onei disagree on ccp storing all the config on the server image 40000 players loading a config file from the server each time they connect it would only create unnessesairy lag also even if a config file for such purpose doesnt take much space there is so many different accounts that story all that data would require ccp to add more space on the servers not that they cant just saying they would have to spend money for that
for his many years of service to the eve community and as a thank you from everyone who he has helped over the many years i propose that ccp name the new ore frigate chribba
not saying no but what would lets fit chribba be like lol
how has ccp not responded remove bounties or fix them the end
yeah i have no time to read 9 pages of people ranting one way or another enlighten me how or point out the page its on so as to spare me reading through pages of fluff if you are referring to the simple system it said it only prevents blue or same alliance people from collecting bounty exactly how did it propose to prevents neut alts from collecting bounty on yourself if it doesnt the system is useless if i have a bounty on my head i collect it myself with my alts until it is zeromy only loss is the insurance premium on the ship
agreedhow lame
this is actually a good idea brand new players should not be the target of griefers and yes it is griefers as ther are plenty of legitimate and capable targets out therehave the age limit be something sensible like 7 or 14 days plenty of time for a new player to get used to teh game and finish tutorials even if they are a very casual player new players should not be the target of pvp possibly though if it is capable have it ip linked to avoid abuse by making untargetable alts
and so the descent down the slippery slope begins
rookie protection wouldnt even be needed if some mechanics were properly explained to them right at the startanyway is the nogriefingrookies policy based solely on system that seems a crap way to manage it since you have to keep extending it to include other systems evidently
haved you thought about growing a pair and stop moaning about how you cant kill noobs because you are too lame to kick it with the big boys my god we might as well line them up liek a firing squad if you want a kill that easilygo learn to pvp properly get in low sec and fight someone who can fight back and just leave noobies alone
some of the rules concerning noobs are universally applied to the system and it makes certain actions a bannable offense regardless of pilot age
the issue is that things are based on system  and it keeps extending with potential for hitting the likes of hek lustrevik etc enjoy getting banned for can flipping in a trade hub or ninjalooting in a major mission hub etc
for example i had no idea hatakani was on the list i pass through there all the time and have on occasion stopped to mess with the locals there is zero indication ingame that the system is under any sort of special protectionedit also creating safehaven systems is bad because it provides a place for older players to go where its against the rules for us less savory players to mess with them thats not the pvpfree zones some of the carebears ask for but its a step closer and is a bad thing
first point good of coursesecond point interesting i see youve chopped it into zones of fighting but that seems slightly rigid what if to flip a system it had to have a stargate to a system already controlled this would give much more strategic importance to a few choke systems and introduce the idea of making a push behind enemy lines

exactly it seems as though people think a stealth bomber will instawtfpwn any ship it cant in fact a single cloaky in system even not afk is almost no threat to any group of mroe then 2 people i live in wormholes not only do we deal with cloakers on a daily basis but we deal with them without local and you know what we bait and kill them if they dont run scared out of our system ebcause we started tracking them down
you forgot to call him on mentioning he dropped probescause you know if he dropped probes no one will think he is afk since probes dont have a very long lifespan
you are smart and you got the pointafk players can terrorize active players they dont know who active or inactivei dropped the probes and i went to afk sometimes i scanned them sometimes i didnteasy and riskfree to cloak in enemy systemthis is the real problem this is a bad game mechanics

sorry what how is cloaking in an enemy system a problem at all how is it bad game mechanics to cloak in an enemy systemknow what is a problem and what is bad game mechanics players having in depth information about other players and what theyre doing instantly and without having to do anything to get it thats not how competitive games should work bro

ive been in this game for over 2 years sure its not long but im willing to bet the whiners are all noobs used to argue google it that there should be a counter for cloakers something not matter how hard that defenders could do to rid their system of cloakers but you know what i smartened up you noobs will tooyou just need to realize the way to counter cloakers is to employ your own just cause you rented some null space from an alliance you feel somehow entitled to the space with no risk sorry thats not how it works you need to work for it afk tag is the stupidest suggestion for this yet and i have been around long enough to have read a lot of them i personally would love if this was implemented i would afk in your system and hotdrop your sorry souls once you got comfortable knowing that i wasnt pressing any buttons
the afk tag wont workeither address the problems that people have already brought up with it or give up on the idea i hate to have to repeat myself but this topic is really going nowhere fast there isnt any debate here when someone points out a flaw with an idea it needs to be addressed you cant just ignore it and continue to shout your unbackedup support all over the forumsand afk tag wont work address the above problems with the idea or stop shouting about it there is no middle ground if the above problems are too great to get around then the afk tag idea needs to be abandonedin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

if he is afk you dont need a counter because hes not doing anything if he comes out of afk and attacks someone then a support fleet or standing fleet solves that problem if you think hes not afk ie he just entered left reentered system or is someone spotted him momentarily on dscan you can bait him i have done this and it worksuse a drag bubble and strategically places cans use interceptors with drones assisting them to burn in their direction when they try and get away on gate this works i have done it i have also been killed in cloakies by people doing itin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

sigh youre still not getting it afk players are a threat to no one there is nothing broken with the mechanics surrounding afk players cloaked docked whatever there is no need to counter them a bad mechanic would be one that instantly tells everyone that a player is actively doing something which these tags would do because it it just bloody is if you want to know if someone is active in your system get off your arse and start scanning setting up bubbles and other traps you already have an immensely powerful tool that instantly tells you the second someone enters your system exactly how many people are in your system etc i cant comprehend wanting to make the game even easier for yourself
you still talking crapswanting to make the game even easier for yourselfthis is you you want cloaking without riskread what said those players who know the truthtell to me do you know who cloaking and waiting you at anomaly in cloak or just went to afk  no you dont knowif you are alone in system with a cloaker you will go farming  if you have brain you wont go so an afk cloaker can disturb and terrorize active players who want to playcloaky reds in system how to make life harder for themafk cloaked ships need a timer when timer runs they get kickedsimple as thatnow go complain your cloaky griefing ship should be able to sit shiva for 2 hours not moving and explain whyif cloaky griefer wants to play all he needs to do is find a target in a reasonable time and kill it how hard is thatoh wai cloaky griefer is afraid to die and hiding in a ship with no guns why support thatjust when i was in khanid low sec three lvl4 agents was there in the first day the local was 38 i just got some kills and two weeks later the local decreased to 12four weeks later the local decreased to 3 most of time i was there in afk sometimes i just dropped out some cheap scanner probes but i didnt scan and mission runners docked up instantly probes in space pthis is the real afk terror enemy players dont know the status of afk player they dont know ambush when starting not all pilots playing in same time sometimes easy to catch one or two peoples there who do a mistake sometimes they want to make a trap or something to kill cloakers but against smart pilots who has intel or using a spies thats useless thing and experienced afk cloaked player uncatchablebut the afk terror is working i used this tactic many times with successful everytime where i was in afk cloak activities on local drastically decreased after few daysso dont tell me afk cloakers does not have effect on active playersjust a question the afk tag is dangerous for any player  nothe afk tag changing the game mechanics  noeveryone knows why would be disturb the afk tag some cloaky fags who lying in this topic im afk at enemy systems and i cant kill anyone when im afk because they would be lost the chances to terrorizing active players in afkthis the afk cloaking just evasion and lying
1just i said its time to create something what is should be change this bad game mechanic where a cloaker can hide in enemy system and can went out from his pc 23 hours time long without riskneed solution for handling this capacitor useage for cloa
an afk cloaked pilot cannot terrorize anyone if you terrorize yourself because you see someone afk in your system thats your problem mate i do have a solution to all your woes however remove local from nullsec you wont see those meany head cloakers any more and can mine until your hearts content
you lying again nobody dont know who afk or not in systemthats why can terrorize a cloaker the active players so if he cant terrorize anyone you wont cry about afk tagbut tell to me why disturb afk tag an afk player who not at the computer  ppp

so the pilots wont be dock and redock if you put a bubble at station  man you know the rules  i dont think sostation games means station games where the pilots dont leave out the docking rangesand you heard about low and high sec  please put bubbles there tooand the makes it physically impossible to dock the worst idiot answer what ive seen todayhow  bump them within 15 sec from 50km station range because you see too many fags at 00 who died at horrible at station dock range not means how everyone stupid in eve

so i have been going over the math a bit in eft so this might not be totally accurate to the gamelets say you got rid of the 10 seconds it takes to run the system scanner to find a haven because its annoyingok so your average ship has a warp speed of 3 au  s and if we assume the average warp from a gate to a belt or ratting site is 30 au thats 10 seconds from entering a system to landing on gridthen we could pad that a little bit for aligning and landing say 3 seconds to scan down a site align and warp to it then another 3 seconds t land on grid and target someone now we are up to 16 secondsnow lets give the defender 3 seconds of warning time to notice the hostile align and warp out back down to 13 secondsso assuming my numbers are correct they arent a fair amount of time for someone to have a 5050 shot of safing up when they see someone in the new intel tool is about 13 secondsthen you could adjust that detection time upward and downward from that initial fair time of 13 seconds based on based on the sensor strength of the detecting ships the signature radius of the detected ship their distance in au from one another and any other in game stats that were appropriategranted i am sure 13 seconds is a little inaccurate it might be worth going on the test server and using a stop watch while warping to different sitesand now for a networking traffic tutorialthe current d scan sends a query to the server whenever you press the dscan button thats why doing it more than once every 2 seconds bogs down the serverfor a new intel tool the server could just pipe all the relevant information to the users client once when they enter system then a little bit here and there whenever something in local changes people logging on or off docking and undocking and jumping in and out of system then the client would handle all the intel tool math and feed you info as per game mechanics based on local data and wouldnt have to query the server every 2 seconds for you to press the dscan buttonalso an intel tool that makes you press a button every 2 seconds is dumb that stuff should happen automaticallyi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
try it againmaybe you never played with eve eft not helping you when you need experience of play30 au long warp distance from entering a system to landing on grid isnt 10 seconds long time thats more than 34 seconds with a hurricane 3 au warp speed from 0 speededit personal attack removed  isd stensson
actually the reason it was tuned down to a minimum of 2 second delay was because of bots the average cpu usage pr person went down noticeably when that was implemented because the dscan was something bots used extensively
man dont talk stupid thingsautomaticaly intel  lol network traffic tutorial  ive never seen dumbest thingsyou want a more server intensive queries for all players already not all players use directional scanner maybe just 1020 of players using and they not using that continuously every times when scanner refreshing datas the server need to send all scannable objects to the clients of players thats would be generate massive lag if all players need to get datas continuously and automatically from serverthatss why bad idea directional scanner spamming every two seconds or automatically dscan and this delayed local should be generating more active dscan spamming to see enemies because all players need to use this when they dont see local instantlyso delayed local is a bad idea just a lag generator
wow the pro local intel crowd really are grasping at straws now ill certainly concede there may be particular issues with my proposal that need to be addressed some already have been in the course of this thread but the whole dscan would cause massive network lag so we have to keep things as they are argument borders on the ridiculous thanks for finally providing a link travelbuoy however the link didnt show ccp saying the same thing as you were stating merely that they didnt want players updating dscan more frequently than 2 seconds well guess what im not suggesting dscan be able to be updated faster than 2 seconds either an automated system doesnt mean it has to update constantly in fact my suggestion for dscan was that it would operate based on three perimeters scan range scan angle and frequency of scan with more of one meaning less of another meaning at max range and a max scan angle of 360 the frequency dscan would update would be very slow at max frequency speed it would be covering a small area of spacenow in regard to any of this causing network lag thats an issue of ccp fixing their code because crappy code shouldnt be an excuse for holding onto crappy gameplay mechanics
sigh its not causing network lag
man the dscan was instantly before patch which is changed to 2 sec the ccp said same things what travelbuoy linkedccp atlas there is a new 2 second delay in using the directional scanner this has been done for server performance reasonseveryone can understand this who want you just trying to evadean automated system doesnt mean it has to update constantly thats mean update to everyone and send automatically all data from server to all client which connected the serversometimes this means 4050k players this is at least 10x times more data queries so you wrong againdelayed local not supported and this is just the one problem but not the last one
by the prointel crowd i presume you mean rib and travelbouy i resent being grouped together with them i just think this is too big of a change its nice to see someone trying to logically and objectively put together argument even if it is using eft buy you have to remember that people arent looking at local all the time even if hypothetically someone were checking local every two seconds thats still a potential 2 seconds less time for someone to react and warp out i would guess i probably check local every 5 or so seconds and i check local alotin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
ok but your question was in response to a particular statement made by me that you quoted i said there is no mmo that i have played where stealthsneaky gameplay is weaker than it is in evethen you quoted that and said are there any other mmos where losses matter to the same degree as wellthat to me implies you accept my statement as true but consider it a reasonable state justified by your rhetorical question that followed maybe it would be best if you simply clarified what exactly it is youre trying to say
its almost like i havent said thissiiiiigh
im not sure what it is you think im trying to evade i should clarify that automatic doesnt mean that every player in the game has it running as its still something that ought to be initiated however what if every player did have it it running the server has to register all kinds of things with every playerclient in the game why should the information provided by dscan be any different your grasping at straws to defend keeping local intel nothing more
no i defend game from idiotic ideas which bring more lag and more bad game mechanicseasy to see why is so bad your idea
even other posters that also want local chat to retain its current intel functions think your argumentscomments are terrible and want to be dissociated from you please stop filling my thread up with crap your not helping your cause and your dumbing down the discussion of this thread
no i was mostly ignoring whether or not it was true or false and going off on a completely different tangent which would then double back to prove a pointanyhow ive had a think and i can only really think of two games where losses actually matter darkfall and mortal online i havent tried either of them but i believe at least one of them is without a show people near you style ie ive seen tons of people get robbed by people who just followed them out of eyesight the problem with comparing this game to eve however is a matter of scale and how things work in the other two games rpgs the act of sneaking up on someone is something which takes a fairly long while giving the victim ample time to unscrew his head and spot the perp in eve however if the hunter isnt bad hell be able to cut the response time from when hes visible on a 14au directional scan till hes got you locked and warpscrammed down to 6 seconds or so while this may sound like ample time and it would be if there were something other than the mindnumbing activities of mining or ratting for hours on end to contend with the mere fact that the hunted is sitting around and not doing overly much stimulating means that the chances of the dscan warnings coming in time to allow the guy to take evasive maneuvers are pretty slim your idea of cutting down the distance the broader width you scan down to 1au cuts the response time down to however long it takes for someone to slow down from warp sufficiently to start locking youi mean its not like the 30 seconds or whatever is the current best time from appearing in local till you can land on someone if you do everything right is preventing that many from dying like muppets so im not sure why the urgency to change this well in caliphs case the reason is fairly clear cut he just wants ganking to be easier so hell suck lessthe lag isnt even the thing you should be overly worried about even though it would put an added strain on a server during 1000 fights the main problem with the idea of switching over to a dscan style intel gathering is that it drastically cuts down the possible response time of the hunted and puts literally all the initiative in the hand of the hunter however fun it might be for a while and believe me if this change did come to pass id dust off my t3 and go to town all over the place it just strikes me as a bad game balance change
i played beta for mo and beta and live for some time on darkfall as i recall neither showed other players that were near you perhaps mo had some function like that on the live servers but i doubt it i dont think uo did and shadowbane didnt although it did have tracking which might be thought of as a more powerful dscan shadowbane also had slightly less severe losses on the individual level since you couldnt loot equipped gear but it did get damaged and anything in your pack was lootable theres a commonality between all these games theyre sandbox pvp focused mmos with full or in the case of shadowbane partial loot but unlike eve stealth as a tactic is much more viable because none have the equivalent of local chatwhere i do agree with what you seem to be saying zim is in the sense that it really isnt ideal to have a system where hunting and ambushing others is nearly as effortless as it is currently in evading such predation by using local it should require effort and player skill to find ambush and kill someone but it should also require effort and player skill to evade escape and defend from other players presently local chat offers all that on silver plate free from all but the tiniest portions of player effort and skillbalance is a rather subjective thing but i am looking for a balanced outcome if you accept the notion that accessing the valuable farms and fields of the game should mean being subject to the potential of unwanted pvp combat and that it should be possible for players to be able to both sneak about and predate other players then theres hope of coming to common ground here from those that accept those things i really appreciate criticism and the presentation of alternate ideas from those that dont its largely a waste of time since we want an entire different type of gameplay that isnt compatiblethis discussion in one form or another needs to happen as removing local and adding cloak hunting are both on ccps mind
ccp atlas there is a new 2 second delay in using the directional scanner this has been done for server performance reasonsbut do you know better than any ccp devoh mandelayed local generating more lags why because all players need to use always the dscan continously ccp dont want to create from a stupid idea a massive laggeneratorand wasting server resources for this stupid delayed local its a fail easy to understand
sigh you didnt read my post did you im also going to guess that you havent seen the devblog which they gave out after they did the change where they said that the average cpu usage per player dropped by around 10 or so and im fairly certain they mentioned bots being the main culprit behind why they did the changeso yes it uses cpu on the server side ive also said it does its still not the biggest problem with the idea of removing local
ok learn to read a post before you criticize it also some comprehension of network traffic would help toook let me dumb this down for youlets say you had one shared document between 10 users each user needs to see the changes that each other user is making to the document remember google wave anyoneso the dumb way of doing it that you think we are talking about is to keep everyone up to date by constantly downloading the entire document every 2 secondsthe clever way is for everyone to download the document once when they first see it then when one user makes a change the server pipes that change to everyone else looking at it if no changes are made for half an hour then nobody gets a change from the server if one person makes one small change then everyone else only gets broadcasted the one change and not the whole documentnow replace the word document with stuff in system with you and changes to the document with different stuff comming in and out of localso you have 10 guys ratting in a system for half an hour local hasnt changed nobody has docked or undocked jumped in our out so they dont get an update on whats in local from the servernow an 11th person comes into local the other 10 clients are piped the info on the new ship not a full dscan query and their clients start doing the new intel tool gameplay timer thing locally so it doesnt bog down the serverthe 11th person comming into local doesnt have an up to date copy of whats in local so their client does a full query pretty much the same amount of data in a regular dscan then like everyone else their client starts doing the new intel tool gameplay timer thing locally so it doesnt bog down the serverand as long as these 11 people are floating around in space without anyone leaving or comming in the server wont pipe any more data to any more people until something changesautomatic intel tool time based detection low network trafficand id be willing to bet this only update on new information trick is how most shared chat channel programs work too if thats the case then this new intel tool wouldnt add any more network traffic than being in one additional chat channel and someone coming into local wouldnt cause any more lag than them saying hello in a chat channeli honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
no you just evade simple you answer is not truenever was the problem the botters for dscanners link it where they wrote but you wont be find it because this ccp answer is not existingmaybe you need to read the old devblogs againthe real problem that was everyone spammed the scanner buttons im too and those server packet asking generated too much lag botters was just a little part of players 1 or 2 percents
if you just look at local as something which you glance at to get intel then yes its no effort the effort aspect comes in when you factor in the need to keep constant watch hour after hour theres a reason people keep getting caughtthe main problem i have with this is that i think the riskreward of nullsec for the individual pilot is right now mostly okay if its made more risky the thing thatll happen is that peoplell just go back to l4s in hisec instead because the riskeffortreward makes more sense than it would do in nullsec with this changewhere id prefer to see more danger however is more on the alliance level to encourage more skirmishes over systems which i believe is a bit more of the right place to do tweaks
ok learn game mechanics before you talking idiocracy such as if you can warp 3au with a ship and you move to 30 au distance your travel time will be 10 sec pand now starting your eve client and try itand dont talk dumb thing as you download a document man the dscan download objects not one or not just two documents you will downloading all objects in solar system pos ships etc datas in small packets with different angleseverytime when you push scan button you will get all objects from database which is not allowed to save on your client prevent cheatsif the players not see local the all players need to scanning continously because they dont want to die and they need intel from scanner thats would be horrible for server performance when 50k players spamming the dscan button within 2 seconds again and again time to timeno matter if manual or automatic scanner will you use you need gathering and download the datas from server side
1 its currently very difficult to catch an alert ratterminer and even unalert minersratters that actually practice safe habits are very hard to catch 2 we all know you like the notion of sneaking around and you like the notion of ganking the gatherers of eve both of these start off with good intentions of adding more risk to the game and enhancing the cloaky playstyle on the surface i fully believe that nullsec needs more risks and that allowing people to hide is a good thing however a balance between the hunters and hunted is extremely important to maintain for a healthy lowsecnullsec ccp tends to lean game mechanics in favor of the hunted and for good reason overhunting results in the extinction of your herd xorv in general your proposal overwhelmingly supports the hunters especially cloaked hunters the consequences of which i think youre oblivious or willfully ignorant of when the people you hunt cannot truly defend themselves nor have a realistic opportunity to detect you and get safe before they are within your guns sites you break the predator prey balance last i read your proposal really lacks any viable options for the hunted to counter your cloakysneaky ganks think about it i can make 15m an hour easily and very safely in highsec running missions and the like in most of nullsec the rewards are not that much greater pretend i can make 30m an hour which is not nearly as common as youd hope pretend im thrifty which means i make this ratting in an 60m isk drake to keep pace with my highsec counterpart i would need to rat 4 hours before losing a drake do you really think thats possible with your scheme theres only 3000 nullsec systems and only 20 of those are actually regularly used with an average of 25000 players online how many of those ratting systems can be successfully ratted for 4 hours before a cloaky gang destroys them
there are some very educational words in there that you are missing out onthen downt broadcast the information in clear text honestly this is something ccp should be doing anyway remember the locator agent ship type exploit that got used in this years alliance tournament dont send the client information in clear text and it fixes a lot of problemsif you had been paying attention then youd have read that peoples game clients wont be constantly dscanning to get intelat this point you arent bothering to read or comprehend anything anyone is saying and you arent adding anything new to the conversation just repeating talking points that have already been proven wrongyou are basically just empty posting at this point which is only bumping a topic that you disagree with and just dont understandi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea

your welcomei do see a potentially small problem with this in general almost everyone i talk to avoids missions against the other main factions like the plague if you gave people the option to never have to run them would anyone run them at all if that happened what would happen to the price of faction shipsalso mission runners in highsec already can earn 8m every 20 mins without too much difficulty especially when theyre older characters with golums tengus etc but people are often slowed down in their mission running by the fact that they occasionally have to decline missions if they need to do this twice in less than 3 hours then they risk taking damage to their agents standings so a lot of people wait out the timer your suggestion would mean they would never have to wait and therefore their earning potential would go up isnt highsec mission running profitable enoughdespite those two problems i still support the suggestion its nice to see good and simple ideas on the front page of the assembly hall we get far too much rubbish on the first pagein the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
the thing is though is that there are quite a lot of people who have said to hell with my opposing factions standings i just love enemies abound or we and dont decline antifaction missions some of these are rpers to be sure but i cant be the only person to have noticed that once you hoover all of those tags from smash the supplier up the collective pay including loot as well as everything else is often substantially better than a similarly sized lvl4 mission it is for this reason that i love antifaction missionsim not 100 convinced that this would just be another gushing isk faucet what happens if as you say the number of people running them drops and the price of faction equipment goes up well surely in a sandbox environment like ours quick thinking people will recognise this and move into doing faction missions to take advantage of the premium that tags would now command presumably this would continue until equilibrium had been achievedyou also said that people might not have to wait at all before declining missions and they might therefore just mission away without any impediment however the reality of the situation is that  provided your faction standings are high enough  you can essentially decline mission after mission with really negligible faction hits i would also say that perhaps mission travel times are a bigger factor than declining missions but thats just my opinion and not really relavent here thank you for your input so far
ccp is working on faction war right now lots of players are suggesting that players must kill all rats in order to cap a plex if ccp actually does that you will see tag prices drop fastamarr currently basically has to kill all the rats in order to run a plex take a look at the cost of minmatar tags over the last few months they pretty much tanked i anticipate this will continue because the incentives to run plexes has gone up make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
thats probably quite a big if and might not fully solve the intrinsic problems with the lp store  tag drop relationship that exist at the moment a lot of it in my opinion stems from the godawful distribution of antifaction missions
look at the costs of minmatar tagsmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
now all we have to do is grab the dev attention or csm to hound the devs about it

oh thanks for filling me in on all thisyes i remember mynxee and was a member of her brainstorming blog making lowsec work yes i made a lot of those same suggestions there too and i think i even absorbed some of those ideas from mynxees blogi have no idea why ccp would just strait out ignore those ideas i really think some or all of those are good ideas its a good way to get people out of overcrowded highsec and give them an alternative to nullsec considering pirates for a moment lowsec is pretty much all about pirates and faction warfare pirates from earth history around 1600s were usually sailors from a countrys navy not everyone in the navy was happy about it and it wasnt always voluntary either sometimes you were knocked over the head and woke up on a ship in the atlantic wearing a sailors uniform ship mutinies were one way of dropping the shackles of state and belonging to a somewhat democratic crew of pirates and finding new land to call your own if highsec was overcrowded monarchistic europe and nullsec was the undiscovered wilds of the american continent then lowsec would have been those free ports that were established frequented and maintained by pirates the emphasis here is on free ports as in trade hubs in lowsec despite the work that has gone into creating the backgrounds of the various pirate factions blood raiders guristas etc a lot of pirates at least seem to be twodimensional its not even about ransom anymore its just about blowing up peoples ships sure there are some exceptions what lowsec should be is a place where highsec dissidents move the original thirteen colonies in america were a place where religious dissidents ie pilgrims could settle without persecution england at the time would have been safer but like highsec was also crowded heavily policed with fewer opportunities the american frontier was more dangerous but a place where you could more easily make a living similarly there are some amarrians who are abolitionists or atheists just as there are some minmatar who are former slaves and still follow the amarrian faith these people would likely have difficulties fitting into their highsec societies the stories are there in some of the missions they just havent been developed far enough i guess ccp has decided lowsec should only be for faction war which they have apparently improved upon slightly and arguably personally i think the lowsec only casinos and pleasure palace stations would really do it it makes sense to have casinos and pleasure palaces in lowsec highsec space is an authoritarian hellhole at least caldari and amarr and nullsec is too far away and too dangerous lowsec is close enough to safety and population for customers but far enough from the eyes of of the law drugs gambling slavery brothels and whatever else would be located here also people love smuggling but there is no real smuggling mechanic in game why not make some smuggling missions that pay a lot more than regular boring courier missions but are only available in low seccasinos turned las vegas from a crossroads in the desert to a bustling city casinos are planned for the space hotel under construction as a way to attract tourists into space how else are you going to make a town in the desert or a space hotel a profitable venture nobody with money wants to invest that money in a risky venture but they have no problems placing it all on a number on a roulette wheel there are already tons of eve isk gambling casino applications independent of ccp a casino would be both an isk sink and an isk faucet it would be a real reason for high sec carebears to come out to lowsec and it would really help develop some more lowsec trade hubs eve wants to be seedy and dark well consider where most of the seedy and dark stuff happens it happens in a bar on the bad side of town mos eisleys bar in star wars ricks place in casablanca there would probably have to be some special storyline missions maybe epic arcs in low sec systems too these would only be available at the special casino stations i would have missions based upon the dissidents that moved out to lowsec like the amarrian abolitionists caldari socialist communes monasteries cults etc this is the same with every story throughout human history it is the heroic myth cycle in joseph conrads the hero with a thousand faces first the hero is safe at home then there is the call to adventure the hero refuses at first but is drawn in then he crosses the threshold into adventure that threshold should be lowsec the intrigue doesnt happen in high sec moms house it doesnt happen in the middle of the nullsec haunted house it happens in the lowsec school yard where the kid is confronted and takes a challenge from the bully i dont know maybe move the militia sign up office to lowsec
quoterico minaliall of these things were discussed alot a couple of years back in a thread titled outlaw teh support was massive ccp ignored itdevs got a few of the more colourful lowsec leaders to form a discussion group under the direction of mynxee we discussed things a little and when it became apparent ccp had no intention of taking any notice we left teh discussionmy corp moved to nullsec after living in lowsec for years because many of teh things coming in made lowsec even worse capital blobs roaming pairs of supercaps titans in lowsec no income etc etc etc many of the old guard of lowsec eventually went to nullsec because to be honest there was no real reason not to we loved lowsec we moved out because lowsec has never had any attention given to it fw was not the way to steer it in itself a nice creation but that isnt what teh majority of people who lived in lowsec wanted they wanted a unique gaem experience as different from empire and nullsec as they are different to each other look up outlaw on teh old forums it would have made lowsec awesomealso incursion they should be lowsec only as it is the only place they make sense from a storyline perspective and it would be a thing that draws players there quoteyes you are right in that it makes sense for incursions to happen only in low sec what does lowsec mean after all low security not no security you would also think that concord would be right on top of their butts for invading the system instead of making sure that people dont shoot each other
this keeps on popping up because new noobs keep joining up just because an idea keeps one getting rehashed doesnt make it automatically somethig that needs to be fixed it just tells you that people coming from other games have a hard time adjusting to some eve specific ways of thinking and playing and they inevitably rant on the forums for a while before they get itthe veterans that even bother to respond to you on the forums are a minority make no mistake the large number of vets dont even bother responding to posts about the same topic that have been shot down years ago your new opinion doesnt make it any more viable than it was the first time it was brought up
this would be amazing i would be training a freighter char and another pvp toonand i would have all of them logged on at the same time and they would all be doing awesome stuffand i would totally unsub my other alts because you know f ccp  i got 3 chars on one account why would i pay for twoend
ccp changed this in 2003 pthey wont support this
i can agree to this if 2 things are changed 1 all cloaky ships have a lot more tank sb in particular2 this new destroyer is paper thin and has a long targeting delay not reducable by skills targeting delay at 30s would be good and applies to all ships that are with the destroyer on gridmy solution is much simpler stop trying to greatly change game mechanics of a class of ship to fit your paranoia we get it afk cloakys really bother you get over it you could also counter the entity that is afk cloaking you by doing same
trying to relieve stress symptoms paranoia and fear of the unknown by game design changes is a bad idea but can be done by removing other players from the sight range of the offended partyout of sight out of mindafk cloakers do not run into gatecamps so proposing a ship that can decloak a cloaky ship is irrrelevant since you can not scan down an afk cloaker in the first placehaving a module that decloak ships within a certain range means that cloaky ships will move out of range of that module and youll be no better off than beforewhat you want is a module that will make a systemwide cloak wipe warp cloaky ships to your location so you can kill them and continue with your riskfree nonfactor carebearing ways in null this will never happen
clearly more than you judging by the rest of your commentslet me put it this way as you clearly still dont get the reference to interdictorsimagine a world without interdictors and then ccp propose a t2 variant of the destroyer and a new module that will drop a temporary bubble that will prevent ships warpingyou post to the thread a whine about how it will make gatecamps much easier and how fast aligning ships dont do much dps anyway so you are not at riskthey clearly were not valid arguments then as we have interdictors so i dont see how the same arguments are valid nowid actually have the ship be less effective at its role than a dictor is it its own role because i think cloakies should get a chance yes if you had a camp consisting of several perma pinging asw ships you would uncloak everything on the gate but that would be expensive and massively limit the dps your fleet can doand yeah i would want a 30 second locking delay after a sonar ping tbh the dictor should have one too after dropping its bubble
just drop it your taking up valuable room on the front page of the assembly hallyou are getting so much opposition it should be clear to you that your idea will never see implementationalso using a drag bubble and a can will work better than the ship your proposing so it will never be cost effective no one would use it anywaytake a hintin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

you want to reduce the facility rates in a lowsec system you control yet you want to improve the system with ihubs like in null that doesnt make any sense
not sure i understand your point reduced costs for offices manufacturing repairs stuff like that at stations
thats true low sec needs more buff and lovethe low sec dieing except the fw sectors when someone went in 2007 was 20k active players on server to low sec the low sec was densely peopled placebut already almost empty today i saw just 2 peoples when a went trough 20 low sec systemwould be nice black market hubs pirate stations etcso i supported any good idea what is bring back to low sec to forefront again

removing local would make cloaking even more powerful it would change drastically the tactics of alliance wars and doing so would need some way to detect cloakers ping them revealing them in local if not then how will you know your fringe territories have spies you know alliances keep their own spies to see which systems may be watched by the enemy you cant hose this mechanic just cause some whiny renters cant get with the program and want highsec safety you want to cloak without risksilly rabbit risk is associated with isk producing activities only mining should have risk missioning has risk industry has market risk collecting intel stealthy wise doesnt carry risk as it doesnt pay how long will it take you to understand this
afk cloaking is a valid form of psycological warfare its clearly working on you
so we just turned back to trutheveryone knows why would be disturb the afk tag some cloaky fags who lying in this topic im afk at enemy systems and i cant kill anyone when im afk because they would be lost the chances to terrorizing active players in afk
i can assure you nothing i have said has been a fabrication the accusation leaves me crestfallen as far as terrorizing goes an afk player cannot terrorise anyone in fact the nature of their being prevents them from doing anything at all if you feel terrorized that is a result of your own mental state and ccp should not have to invent mechanics to coddle your damaged psyche if you dont like that redneutral in system with you then go to another system or get a fleet together defend against him if he should make a move or ignore him as the saying goes htfu i am absolutely against afk tags because you do not need nor deserve even more detailed information about what potential enemies are up to you must work for it or make do withoutanticloaker tears fuel my cloaking device thats why it is seemingly infinite
there is almost no point in arguing with rib or travelbouy if theyre not both the same person they do seem to post the same agenda in the same threads and quote each other to say how good each others logic is even though no one could possibly say that their logic is logical at all they dont read what you write and if they do they dont understand it even if they do happen by some miracle to understand it their reply will simply be a repeat of something they have already said which is probably unintelligible anyway their posts dont add anything to any of the topics they post in and they never use any obvious counter arguments they just repeat their opinion that such and such idea is goodbad with little to no objective reasoningalso if either of you are reading this or you are reading this with either account if you both happen to be the same person which i am starting to suspect then address the problems with both ideas before you continue to repeat yourselves read it and if you have nothing to say counter to the above admit you are wrong and that afk tags and logging people out are terrible ideas i dont even expect you to abandon the idea that cloaky afkers are bad i myself am neither for or against the statement that afk cloakies are bad for gameplay but i can see clear as day that neither of these two suggestions will work and everyone apart from you two and your alts or just you and your alts can see the samein the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

stupid idea is stupidthere is merit to ending station games yes but not in the manner the posting op suggestedi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
right now you can just ignore station games and move on having a docking restriction would transform docking games to station camps with instant locker as you know them from gatesboth is not really the pvp i like but there are different opinions about that

yes please stop posting
youve changed nothing you are still a terrible troll
ok on this issue your both preaching to the choir as ive stated all over these forums i believe the valuable farms and fields should all be in dangerous space high sec should either be made much more dangerous or have its pve gutted this is the norm for mmos that describe themselves as sandbox and build themselves around conflict pre trammel uo shadowbane except newbie zone darkfall and mortal online all have their pve in areas outside the protection of npcs eve should be the same and if it were all these concerns that players will flee to high sec will vanishthe whole idea that you separate pve from pvp is from themepark mmos when players go to do pve activities in eve it should be also with pvp in mind even the crappiest pve content becomes interesting when you add pvp into the mix however if you add any pve content that is both free from the risks of pvp and remotely close to the same rewards it becomes the most efficient means of gaining the rewards of pve and thus just about everyone feels compelled to only do that form of pve this is what has already happened to eve and why so many characters are in high sec already compared to the rest of space this issue of high sec pve isnt a reason to reject my proposal its reason for us all to put pressure on ccp to fix the problem of largely pvp free pve in a sandbox mmo
as someone whos flown in nullsec for a good amount of time i agree that local is simply too much and too easy of an intel gatherer the idea of stealth does not work when everyone is alerted of an intruders presence what i propose is a 30 second delay for local update for both parties what i propose for cloaking is that the inorder to receive intel update the pilot must remain uncloaked for 30 seconds to receive intel up if he cloaks before the 30 second timer complete it restarts but at the same time his presence will not be revealed as long he remains cloaked and does nothing if he remains uncloaked for 30 seconds his presence will be revealed if the cloaked pilot warps however he will be revealed in 30 seconds even while under cloak stealth will have more meaning in the game and more deaths to ratting bots
you cant travel through a system within 30 seconds so your proposal does nothing to hide your pressence the only stealth in your idea comes from entering a system cloaking and slowboating into a position while cloaked this isnt all that appealing to mealso 30 seconds is a very long time to remain out of local imo thats too long as a quality skirmisher will be in warp to a target before appearing in local imo 1015 seconds is a much more reasonable vale i really think the best solution is for the entrance of a player into system to be announced quickly to all people in system this means everyone becomes alerted to a new person in local however no information who they are what they fly etc is given on the new player until they get reconned them through an intel system cloaky ships cant be reconned and remain anonymous then you can travel through a system and if nobody recons you you are just an anonymous traveler it gives skitish ratters warning enough to get safe as long as the intel system does not automatically transmit information about who is blue and who is neutral systems with lots of blue traffic become easy to sneak through and require sentires to identify hostile traffic as long as there are no static structures to autoscan pos modules sov upgrades then the value of intel is significantly increased
so ccp said they want it to be use by both new and older players heres a simple idea that may actually do thatnew module for the rorqual ore jump portal generatorthe range should be the same range as the rorquals jump rangeonly ore frigs can jump with itthis way small corps or groups of friends have a new idea for an op ninja mining in npc 00 or whatever fun ninja mining shenanigans still has a bit of risk because youll have to fly these ore frigs into lowsec to get to the rorqual the very good reason why i didnt say orca unless of course the rorqual is a badass and is carrying some of these and jets them for people to useold players may want to do it new players can tag along an feel cool because everyone but the rorqual and scout are in the same ship helps make mining a bit more fun back to group ops where people sit in voice coms shooting the  and drinking beer

that would actually be better in many respects and solve at least one of the other problems you mentioned and possibly the ecm burst problem since the bodyguard could pack eccm  il admit i didnt think of ecm burst being too effective but let me explain why i didnt go that way from the beginning1 unintended consequences going in the other direction theres quite some interesting mischief one can possibly pull by target redirecting an unaware and unwilling target by handing the responsibility of keeping the module activation to the bodyguard himself we either reduce the options to control the relationship on both ends or resign to things like lemme steal the shield rep from the opponents logi which would be fun in a way but a bit too chaotic if you ask me 2 avoiding the above would produce considerably more complicated module activation checks for example suppose that two people with beacon modules activate their beacons on a single industrial and i try to target this industrial  which ship of the three do i end up locking can two people do that in the first place and if they cant how will the server prevent this what about selecting which ship classes it can and cannot be activated onid rather offer a suggestion as narrow as possible if only because theres less chance of i know what your agenda is flames otherwise  notice that this only works because in lowsec every nonblue is a target however should you really have to to shoot first always changes to the crimewatch system described in the fanfest presentation particularly the sec status logic described appear to be trying to create a situation wherein in low sec a neutral can be just a neutral and not necessarily someone you need to kill to mine at all let me explain why i believe this is importantany not blue shoot it situation promotes certain behaviors in players simply because players who dont do that suffer in particular1 if you arent looking for a fight but are instead looking for a resource to harvest you will attempt to find a location where a hostile engagement is as unlikely as possible watch local and avoid engagement whenever possible doing otherwise cuts into your income that leaves lots of resources unexploited at all and in most cases leaves you mining and missioning in high sec2 if you are looking for a fight everyone is avoiding you as hard as they can because of the above so you spend lots of time roaming until you find an opponent and more often than not you instead find baitin nullsec large regions are populated by nothing but blues due to the sov mechanics but in lowsec theres no sov mechanics and you never get many blues so you shoot everyone and run from everyone as a result lowsec is a failed ecosystem where everyone is forced to either be the predator or the very quick and avoidant prey  or avoid lowsec in the first place theres very little middle ground even if you cooperate and the more you cooperate the more you become the predator by necessity coupled with the crimewatch change i believe the proposed change should create a more populous lowsec
i would have been with you if you would have suggested that you could add training to the queue regardless of which char you added it from instea of like right now that you need to pause your training log in with the other char and start trainingbut training on all chars on your account simultanously no thank you

first of all you totally mix the concept of active and passive protectionsecond iirc eve projectiles and missiles only count where they were shot from and where they were shot to then you just negate a percentagenot all of it of damage on the receiving end if it is within the range of the module may even add a factor of how much distances is between the edge of modules range and the protected ship on the vector of projectilesmissiles path to determine the exact effectivness this way a close range brawl would be more effective since the distances between the target are minimal at default which would potentially lead to the rise of blaster boat doctrinesadd some special effects to make it beautiful so that the pilots that use them wont be bored
yeah because you can tell whos a real rookie by their character age alt accounts of vets are definitely rookie and casual players who arent online for hours every day to learn pvp are no longer rookie on day 15 right you turn 18 today son now go hang with the big boys nevermind that youre rolled as an industrialistextend it to all of the 7 of systems in eve that is highsec and be done with it
they should either extend it to no systems or all systems not some grey area eve is supposed to be a harsh place full of dangerthis really isnt helping to convey such a thing as advertised by ccpnew players could always test out their place on a seperate server like sisi for instance or a new server dedicated to rookiesi like rookie pilots i really do and most of the time they are not worth shooting because they have nothing of value plus i usually have no reason to shoot them however if this kind of change is expected in future i might have to hire rookie pilots to shoot rookie pilots with a bonus reward for doing so then lets see the gms start banning rookie pilots
test server is for testing the idea that sisi exist for noobs to learn is ridiculous
anything in fw now or later will be abuseable by the xfactor thing as i think it is called basically a person on amarr and another on minmatar can coordinate and make massive amounts of lp this is possible now and itll be possible later unless some serious restrictions are put in
i believe several people have already addressed how having an afk tag would be detrimental you are just copypasting the same poorly worded question and resorting to ad hominem instead of responding to any points they make
you keep perpetuating the myth that the things you list matter against highsec gankers none of those things work your only chance of success is if they screw up or didnt bring enough destroyersyou want to see a brawl between an apoc and an oracle sure if you are stupid youd lose the oracle

or if you are stupid youd lose the apoc
while i agree that most of these ahem demands are pretty silly i also agree that there really is no voice for hisec players i remember the last csm election and not seeing any candidate who wasnt ultimately just a lobbyist for one nullsec alliance or anotherive seen this problem in other games for example back before ww2ol was merely circling the drain and not diving headlong into it they had a player run high command system composed of players who acted as major domos and ran the campaigns the problem though is that all of these hc were little more than front men for their own respective squads clan guild alliance  same thing different names the result was that instead of actually running the campaign ie their jobs they just prattled around like a bunch of courtiers to get more of their own squaddies into the program  whine for the developers to change things to they way they themselves wanted it and to hell with everyone elsesound familiarthe problem i believe is a similar lack of requirements for what a player must do to be a csm right now its pretty much do you own a passport yn there is no actual rule against a current council member from buying their kid brothersister a subscription  a passport then telling everyone in their alliance to vote for that twerp the very next day considering the size of some alliances this is not as improbable as it seemsfrankly id like to see the csm positions be less about administrative garbage and more about various aspects of the game there are nine csm positions last i checked why cant one of them be dedicated solely to voicing the concerns of hisec players you could have a nullsec rep a lowsec rep and a hisec rep and still have six seats open to shuffle powerpoint slides  pretend to be important while getting drunk in iceland for two weeks a yearwould that be unfair to ask for

the thread on hulkageddon showed the sharp division in the communityat a blunt level highsec needs csm votes not just getting the attention of the null sec crowd who dont really care but its own voice on the csm itself but to those who ridicule highsec players know only this ccp wants more players they are not going to get them without increasing highsec player retention so guess what changes are going to happen whether you like it or not
wtf do you mean highsec needs csm votes highsec has more representation than any other part of space since i believe every csm member is likely to have at least one character in highsec in addition to that the csm has at least three members whos interests and campaign focus is on highsec kelduum revaan alekseyev karrde and issler dainze what more do you want

is the the world of eve polarizing to 00s vs the rest of everyone elsewardec nerfs ccp supports unfairnessi would have thought that making wars a free for all escalation was what inferno was all supposed to be about maybe this post is old news but i thought it would be fair to point this out to csm i have to say i am leaning on the side of the posteri think a proper sandbox should allow bullies to get bullied back
im not much of a conspiracy theorist but i have to say that that poster makes some very good points i dont know if it was goon influence or not but i think that what that person described being able to turn a wardec around with some allies and force the wouldbe attacker to pay for a surrender seemed like the exact thing the new wardec system was designed to encourage this change does seem like a bit of a you can turn the tables on them but only if theyre small enough that 14 allies can do the job i agree with some of the changes being made like 2week contracts but that poster does make some very valid points about how those changes very strongly favor large alliances and make it difficult for a defender to turn the tables on an aggressor by exponentially scaling the ally cost and removing the ability to lock someone into a war with you and your friends with the changes the aggressor will just drop the dec if theyre losing and shrug it off
i think its more a case of people abusing it to lock hundreds of corps into permanent wars weather they like it or not
jade used a known problemexploit which could enabled to parcipiants to join war for 00 isk and what the testers reported to ccp when the patch was in test phase on sisi ccp didnt fixed their fails reported ui and wardec problems before they released infeno everything else just a conspiracy theory
actions and consequences
im personally of the belief that it was right to stop people who make a war mutual from being able to hire alliesall of the other changes however are in bad taste as far as im concerned its just another nerf to the little guys the autorenew and cost changes in particularas to whether its the csm and mitanni trying to influence ccp well who knows i certainly cant make that call but i do think ccp sees the big alliances as being somewhat integral and some kind of amazing part of the eve online universe and i would agree to the latter and therefore pander to their needs a little more than they shouldin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
no this wouldnt really change much at all since im sure organized alliances and bot programs would figure out some way to communicate the presence of friendlies in a system and then by process of elimination easily know if a new ship entering a system was a neutralhostile if you combined your ideas above with a new chat that was regional wide not just system wide then it would be a real improvement i swear i recall even zim suggesting someplace that local become a regional chat its not my preferred option but it would be a marked improvement over what we currently have
well that depends on how well the frigs will mine and how much fuel it will cost to jump them easily fixed with role bonuses and such
what does the csm think of the changes to factional warfare  not from the play fw players perspective from the perspective that more and more game content  expects to peoples to be involved with fw the 2 changes that i am referring to are data cores and now clothingso my questions are do you think the changes to fw which affect the greater eveverse are a good thing  if so why what do you think the end game of fw interns of player involvement should be  ie something you can to do or something that you have to do with respect fw  do you see that the game should always evolve around these factional wars  how do you think null sec alliances should be involved in fw  what changes to the game mechanics are required  to what limit should fw intrude into null sec politics  just curious about what we people think fw meanscheers and beers ramm

youre not making any sense tbhid rather have other players get shot by other players than not interacting with others ccp soundwave
i didnt say for definite to use sisi just an idea
perhaps rather than try to thwart such actions it would be more productive to make the lp gain from such action similar to what would be gotten from just grinding for example cause both sides to gain lp based on how heavily they do combatdamage dealt gives some lps but scoring kills gives more and causing isk damage gives the most
i somewhat agree with option 1 though i believe that it should be based off of how contested the plex is not the systemthe reason i say this is because i have come across several plexes in uncontested systems that have a wt in them i go in the wt flees and then i get to orbit a button to close the plex which yields no reward if a minor gets run down to 10s left on the button and then the wt leaves it i still need to close that plex to lessen the chance that that system will become contested now i am not saying that the reward for orbiting defensively should be the same as offensively however i do believe that there should be some form of reward perhaps 14 the value of offensive plexingif the plex was opened by a member of the nonsov holding militia then that plex should pay out a reward if closed either way whether the attacker finishes it or a defender comes along and closes it
actually i agree with this if it were based off how contested the plex is it would be very abuseable as people with alts could come in and shortly contest a plex and then you could just defplex it for lp this would actually lead to even more of a problem than currentday offensive plexing if it were based off how contested the plex is then it would work out and would not be abuseable by an alt

so basically were all supposed to bend over backwards and change fundamental game play features for people who want to pay real money to fly ships they dont understand how to operate talk about pay to win no thanks you seem to forget the many players who have been here through the years and those like myself who are new and appreciate the game mechanics ive been ganked gatecamped the whole nine yards and you know what it doesnt bother me i usually try to ask the player questions and get advice afterwardshave you seen some of the killmails where people die in noob ships with 5 10 even 30 plex in their cargohold do you think ccp reimbursed them no because to do that would tamper with the fundamental philosophy of the game and would drive away a lot more members than it attractsjust because you wanted to pay stupid amounts of real life money to immediately jump into a ship you dont understand how to fly properly doesnt mean you should be catered to over the people who form the rest of the community ive bought plex as well and you know what i do with it i buy  i can afford to lose never fly anything you cant afford to lose before you go whining about how we need to fundamentally change the game why dont you i dont know experience some progression and learn the mechanics why would you possibly want to just jump in completely alpha in every way when it comes to mining were supposed to respect thatdont assume everyone who has bought a plex is a stupid scrubnub about it i did it to fund my corp we operate within our means and its working out sorry its kind of hard to just buy your way into mininggodhood what a cheap and silly way to start playing a game i mean how much more can you complain youre playing a game where you can shell out real money to leapfrog months or years ahead of other noobs in terms of skill and income and you want there to be no risk guess what if you could do all of that and not be at any risk of losing that expensive ship you bought with plex money eve would effectively be pay to win and you miners deserve that exclusive right why againalso one more note why do miners always portray their chosen profession as the default choice of the new player its always the same youre not hurting us youre hurting the new guy appeal im new and ive never mined neither have my corpmates and we most likely never will because that looks like a dreadfully stupid way to spend your time in a game
im sorry i didnt check how far this thread went on my previous post is probably irrelevant at this point
youre quite right it is broken but you fail to see why even after spelling out most of the relevant facts yourself in your own postssimply in game like eve the farms and fields which includes mining shouldnt be in what is high sec to begin with its because you can gather resources under the protection of concordcrimewatch that players resort to suicide ganking and its because of those same concordcrimewatch mechanics that player guards as you suggested simply dont work it isnt ccp failing to deal with highsec griefers that has been holding back this game most of those players are better thought of as part of the immune system response of the sandbox to unhealthy antisandbox gameplay whats holding back eve from its real potential is the themeparkish game mechanics found in highsec and ccps unwillingness to really address that problem
hi capital ships havent seen much love lately and im wondering if something like haveing a class of carriers that can fit a limited number of gunsmissles which would definatly mix some gameplay up and the best example i have of this is battlestar galactica
sounds great but we need a name for this new and revolutionary type of shipi vote we call them dreadnoughtssummary of eves last four expansions
i love it we should rename the triage module into something elselike maybe siege sounds badass ccp pay attention to these great ideas we are having
and what you carried  ammos over fighters 
moros called it wants its drones back
i for one would welcome carrier hulls with turret slots
you guys are takeing me waaaay to literal on this and just thinking inside the box and odveously with implementing guns on something like a pocket carrier their would be some changes to them as to what a full carrier can do and im sure if any of you participated in capital operations you would know that a lot of corps use their carriers off grid and send their fighters in to attack a stationpos thus leaveing them defensless untill their fighters return and allies warp in to assist them if they are coughtif you look at a lot of world war 2 carriers they had around four 5 inch guns to help protect them even modern carriers have use of some source of defence of this nature
the problem with this is that ccp should really be sticking to their model of open sandbox and emergent gameplay fair for all if the current alliances burn then others will rise up to replace them that is the sacrosanct idiom of eve ccp should not pander to any particular alliance or demographic of eve but make it possible for emergent gameplay to tear down existing systems and rebuild them if the populace demands it locking people into mutual wars is not good but if a big alliance finds itself stuck in a war too big for them to handle firstly well too bad that it misjudged the ability of their victim to gather many friends to came to their aid and secondly well maybe they should be able to just swallow their pride and surrenderi agree that the whole protecting merc idea is a sham mercs should be hired guns to do operations in null or low not highsec mercs getting paid to grief some small time corp in highsec is frankly something that they should not be paid to do thats like getting paid to gank if only all of us could have that much fun while getting paid to do itlower the ally escalation costs to at least equal those of the aggressor party and also take out the limit on the number of allys to at least be the same as the people you are fighting i believe that any war should fundamentally be able to be equalized in balancing the numbers it really is a game of picking your allies well and knowing not to declare war on a party that has many friendsthe counter argument of having a lot of small noob corps get stuck in wars is a sham and a red herring no noob corp is stupid enough to join a war without being willing to pay the consequences
sothe mitanni wardecs anyone and everyone who publicly spoke out against himthe goons are sent out in full force against small highsec corpsthese small highsec corps seek help from mercenaries the mercs and the highsec corps fight backgoons lose horriblygoons cry and whine that the wardec mechanic is brokenccp obeys the wishes of the goonsccp changes wardec mechanics that directly benefit their situationsounds like a case of devswarmcost for the goons to wardec highsec corps  50 million iskcost for those highsec corps to fight back  billions of iskyep thats fair summary of eves last four expansions
but use a known exploit its fair too isnt 
i think the 10 mechanics werent perfect  a small corp being able to turn the tide and properly retaliate against a large aggressor is a good thing but foreverwars with a thousand allied corps ehh dunno the 11 changes are utterly ridiculous though it just makes it far too skewed in favour of large alliances  aggressors yes ccp have said they dont want war to be fair but why should smaller poorer corps on the defensive be the ones who the system is weighted againsti think perhaps having the 10 mechanics but with a single change mutual wars cannot have allies smaller victim corps can still start a dogpile to turn the tide or force the aggressor to back down but they cant trap corps in wars
oh please is the prdamage control so weak that its reached the point of crying exploit exploit goonies started a campaign against certain outspoken members of the community  small corps or individual people  and wanted to utterly crush them or force them out of the game unfortunately for goons their targets threw a few surprise punches back at them thats a good thing and not something that should be rushed to be patched out of the game
read again and stop crying when you see goons on any postjade used a known problemexploit which could enabled to parcipiants to join war for 00 isk and what the testers reported to ccp when the patch was in test phase on sisi ccp didnt fixed their fails reported ui and wardec problems before they released infeno everything else just a conspiracy theoryyou need to read the wardec topic at eve information portal section 
its only an exploit if it is deamed to be an exploit by ccp until he started using it they didnt realise it was a problem they only started calling it an exploit after the event so when we used it it wasnt an exploit do i have to argue with you in every thread on the damn forum ribin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
the title is inaccurate its not a nerf to decing its a nerf to people defending themselves from decsthe key issue is that ccp saw 20 alliances vs one attacker and thought that was a problem not seeing that one of the alliances is the largest in the game and is modestly at least time times the size of the twenty combinedthe scaling of costs should only exist if the member count of all allies manages to be greater then that of the attackersbeing the system might not be fixed back soon one could work with the system and make a temp super alliance for battling goons imagine if privateers moar tears and all the others merged in a alliance just so they could be the ally for a underdog
how is people joining a war for zero isk a exploit it is comprehendable that isk is not the main motivator for all
support
yeah that pretty much sums up my view too make it unfair for the defenders and the underdog for once ccp
how about when a war goes mutual both sides are allowed to call in alliesalso make the cost of starting a wardeck based on the difference in population between the two involved partiesso a 1000 man alliance wardecking a 30 man corp or a 30 man corp wardecking a 1000 man alliance would have to pay the 970 man priceoh yeah and the 2 week renewal and costs to hire allies was to make the mercenary profession happen since defending corps can only bring in a few allies they have to carefully choose who they let in and without dogpiling actual skilled pvp mercs can charge for their services ccp just had some really awful timing with their patch notesi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
its not dogpileing if the attacking alliance has ten thousand it would be almost fairyou got to have some numbers to win no leet amount of skills will make one pilot be able to beat 100 at oncei would like to know which merc alliance in existence not fantasy can tackle the largest and wealthyest space empire alone
wouldnt this by definition be playerside effortnevermind how bots would circumvent the system since by that process of elimination removing local would make bots even more overpowered since you could just put a bot account on each entrance to the system and spread evenly across the solar system so you had a 100 coverage too and unlike humans they wouldnt have a lapse in concentration you have to design systems which would not make humans stab themselves in the foot so something else will hurt moreremember this is a game if you want proper cockstabbing it turns out youll want 171 of dayzyeah i hate to tell you but i was on a small trollchain there just to see how easy it was to get people to rage while on the other side of the fence turned out it was pretty easy in some cases
theres a difference between giving people a tool for something that they need occasionally and enforcing a tool that they will need to run continuously whether they choose to or not unlike other mmos eve runs in a single shard environment which means every single bit of globally frequent server queries will have be reduced to their minimumsimplified the way it works now for the dscanlocal perspective for every player in each system the client queried people available in that system thats it only when they pressed dscan the client pulls out a request for space objects within that dscan scope on demand even offgrid objects which is not something thats queried automatically on every session changes during a certain timespan only a handful of clients would put such a request even with this kind of mechanics ccp decided to put a 2s delay on every dscan requestswith an automated dscan and delayed local people will be forced to use this just to gather information which should be there in the first place even with 5 or 10 seconds delay imagine the increase of strain to the server would be and remember since in a sense local info is not there people would be more likely to turn this feature onthis is also not a matter of ccp should code it better no this is how clientserver communication works on mmos its not the issue of how big the packet size is for each instance its a matter of how frequent those requests are lets say 40k people are online at one time say 18 of them are in space so thats 5000 imagine a quarter of them plays in nullsec and ratting or doing missions of something so thats 1250 imagine almost half of them are using the automated dscan so that 620 people for a 2s delay youre talking about adding 310 number of pings active each second continously and thats even the best scenario possible and judging by your idea of a sortof removal of local it should be at least twice or three times that number so yes the serverstrain argument is indeed valida good analogue but it doesnt apply to this case mmo packets are different than shared online documents the biggest difference would be an extensive timeslicing on the server side caused by how frequent the packet requests are on your analogue it addresses the point where huge size file downloads are not necessary because of the incremental update in mmos a relatively small packets are sent and received continously throughout time on the servers the main issue is the amount of packets received not to mention the database queries needed before the server responded this brings out another thing that differentiate eve and documents it may be true while clients can cache ship informations hulls character avatars etc we cant cache their positions and state hence its not as simple as sending an update of one changeregardless im not fully against the idea the purpose of it is nice the solution offered however imo might need another alternative while it seemed balanced people might view it as a complete nerf of local while not providing any incentive towards those who dont like it this drastic of a change without any incentives rarely works if you think the public emorage coming from the incarna expansion is bad try removing local and see what happensid rather have other players get shot by other players than not interacting with others ccp soundwave
great explanation and this problem is real the delayed local and automatical scanning would generate more lag
i think this is a sensible idea in general the details would have to be worked out but anything that makes carebears less care bearish is a good thingeve forums official anthem
for once an intelligent suggestion in features and ideas i have a single question thoughwhy not ore ships in general jump portals are useless in highsec where most ore ships meet their end anyway so this might get a few more into better mining systemsalso anyone know if there will be a t2 ore frigate in the future

i have come to realise that the thing about eve for most of the older players is that there is no more wow factor for training for something you couldnt fly before a lot of my mates seem to agree so not being one to moan without thinking of something to help with i have come up with two ideas that could help this situation and bring back some of the old faces that have dissapeared along the last two years i have been playing evenr1 as a quickish fix ccp should bring out some more tech3 ships such as tech3 bc or destroyer or even frigsnr2 as a long term fix they should bring out either a new race or bring out jovian ships the reason for this is they can make it so that we have to train brand new type of weapon ships support and a bunch of other skills this will bring back the older players give newer players a chance to also get into the new content almost on par with the older players in skill training terms and it will give me something better to train for than small blaster specialisation 5 just my thoughts
the devs are having balancing issues with the current t3 ships and t2 and t1 i dont think they want to introduce a new line of ships that may or may not be op until they have addressed all those other onesand this is based on pure conjecture i think theyd probably stick to only t3 frigs and battleships for purity reasons have you ever noticed that there are no factionpirate destroyers or battlecruisers jovians are supposedly scary powerful compared to the rest of new eden why would you want to introduce a technologically superior ship line just because and risk obsoleting every other ship currently in existencea good example would be the jovian battleship the eidolon it has 8 high slots 8 mid slots 8 low slots 8 turret hardpoints 8 missile hardpoints 400m3 of drone space 125 mbit of drone bandwidth and enough cpupg to fit any fit you can think of with room to spareoh yeah it also has way better stats than any other ship in its classand no high cost will not be a limiting factor and high training requirements will only put such ships out of reach of younger players
didnt i say new race or release jovian ships or a less powerfull bastardised versionwith all this rebalancing of ships they are currently doing i am sure they have the skills to rebalance a new races ships so that they arent totally opas for current issues of rebalancingthis was more meant for something to think of to mid and long range plannings after dusts issues have been more or less resolved after the launch i never even assumed ccp would attempt this nowbut yeanext objection pls p
confirming that conceiving designing and balancing an entirely new range of ships and a range of subsystems to go with them would be a quickish fix
instead of just more new ships or new weapons not that i am against it but just it is only a temporary measure and can only be done so many times before you wind up again where you started with people trained up to the maxxwhy not make a system where players can create their own missions sort of like a modding kit that will allow you to script missions and setup your own agents in your sov space maybe event involve dust players eventually in these missions
greetingssomeone in 2011 suggested on the old forum a new container which is ancorable in 07 or lower sec spaceit seems that eve began implementing this container which is now found as an item however there doesnt seem to be any way to buybuild or invent iti propose that this container finish construction the concept which this particular container was formed from is soundaude hematbaetue bex
the mechanics and programming for something like that would turn out to be a pain in the i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
at the very least i think it would be a nice touch if the ship description said something along the lines of developed with the help of otherworld enterprises
maybe put a quote in from chribba in the description of the ship

theres an easy fix to bounty hunting keep the current bounty system simple but instead of people being about to see the bounties on their head deny everyone access to that knowledge nobody gets to see the bounty placed on their head add a skillbook to become a bounty hunter allows you access to bounty hunting mission agents agent gives you a mission to hunt down a random person in your region with a bounty the bounty hunter is not told the sum total of bounties placed on the wanted persons head just that they have a bounty and that they need to die say a time limit of a month or so to complete the bounty you also get specific bounty hunter locator agents perhaps special scanner probes modules etc as you become a better trained bounty hunter you get access to a wanted list that lets you pick your bounties from a randomly generated list of bounties in your area the bounty hunter gets paid a baseline fee eg the collective bounty placed on that persons head for destroying the ship of said target and additional bonus isk if you pod them this will encourage both small scale solo bounty hunting but group bounty hunting as well
i was about to say something along the lines of if it was really that easy to fix then dont you think somebody else would have fixed it by now but this actually isnt bad make the bounties scale up with the skill level trained ie you get bigger bounties given to you if you are high trained in the skill only problem i see is local area is hard to define people jump clone around a lot would taking a bounty on somebody who leaves the area make you sort of stuck
then goons and other neerdowells completely wreck it by placing 1 isk bounties on each other drowning out the real bounties
almost the entire proposal and much of the subsequent discussion revolves around addressing this issue i mean like from the first paragraph
if youre looking to get people to shoot at an entire losec corp than i think that is better addressed through the wardec system and mercenary contracts not bountiesby asking other players for advice in the same way that a new player should before making any other similar sized purchase this isnt and shouldnt be a game mechanics issue its a player interaction issue
once you have a bounty on someone the locator agents would track them no matter where they went much as it works now the skillbook or skillbooks would have long train times and even if you did want to potentially game the system itd take some effort but the only way you could collect the bounty would be to somehow magically get your main or alt with the bounty to pop up randomly and then gank yourself the real reason why the bounty system is broken right now is because people know how big the bounties are on thier heads and then manipulate the system to kill themselves with an alt and collect the bounties themselves
i didnt mention it but i would would assume that the higher price bounties would be lumped at the top of the randomized list to be doled out to bounty hunters that would prevent low pay bounties from poisoning the well as it were and making people chase after bounties only worth a few thousand or hundred iskmore than one person could get the same bounty on the same person so there would be competition to collect heads
one of the best lowsec improvement proposals could be found herethe reason i am posting this is because i feel that your first barrier is the need to increase the population actively using lowsec before you can introduce content such as in your proposal without an active population advocating for these changes there is really little that will be done  which is why for instance most of the changes introduced in eve are 00 improvements war dec changes fw upgrades and so onthat thread may give you an idea of what is currently stopping the casual pvpers from going into lowsec i think this barrier needs to be overcome prior to introducing any new content
i actually disagree with the majority of that post my corp lived in lowsec for years and those barriers are not barriers merely elements of what lowsec is about when we lived there lowsec was actually quite busy fights were easy to get you could go to nearby busy places with entities that you could go to war with lowsec was great in those days before fw had even been thought of 100 ship bs fights were not uncommon 30 man roaming gangs were very common it was a good time the proposal above was originally written up a whiel after fw started to affect lowsec when capital blobbing became normal to see in lowsec a little while after that we moved out of lowsec as it became totally boringdont make lowsec easier it just needs more in it alot more and some serious restriction on capital use
it wouldnt need to all come in in one big patch i do actually know about moon mining as we run lots of it most of what we do is very easily done in lowsec too adn our corp makes some 10 billion isk a month with about 12 towers all on low end common moons and some sensible importingremember this is actually an un edited old post so some of it will be outdated and no longer viable
this is true thats was nice days but now the low sec is crap and need revitalize
thats a great trip down memory lane however not the intended point of my post we are talking about lowsec in its current form with a focus on 00 with fw and with the new wardec changes why would a casual pvper go through the headache of living in lowsec now it has so many restrictions that can be circumvented through just joining fw or going in npc 00 or just living in highsec and wardeccing that way i dont really need to worry too much about the clear drawbacks of lowsec that have been pointed out in the link i provided in the post aboveits not looking to make lowsec easier well perhaps easier to live in and base out of but in all reality it would make lowsec so much more accessible to a great number of players with a good playerbase in place  i believe that a proposal such as what you are suggesting may bring some benefit until then it is really an exercise in futilityi am not really disputing any aspect of your proposal  it may indeed have some merit  i just think that we are in a chickenortheegg scenario
you cant the current design of the overview does not allow this
eve carriers have a form of point defence as wellwe call them smartbombs
true but they become uneffective when everything from frigate on up can orbit you ouside the range of your smartbombing
ineffectivesuch a well thoughtout proposal worthy of the assembly hall for sure not quite sure whether thats sarcasm by the wayanywho you can either have a a carrier with fightersdrones or b a carrier with guns the former exists already in form of the current carriers and the latter is called a dreadnaughtmixture of the two would either be op or would wreck the role of the current two classes of ship that are in the game or probably both if you cared to expand on what exact role this ship would fill and why this role is necessary and also what you envisage would be a balanced layout of slotshardpointsbonuses for this new pocket carrier then your proposal would be worthy of debatesomething tells me however when you really think about it besides its cool and its like battlestar galactica there is really no particular reason for your ship to exist in a game like eve
conspiracy theories aside i would say that jade constantines proposal in the 11 war dec amendment seems most fair given the direction of the war declarations in generalthis way if the defending alliancecorp is smaller they can get allies for free until their numbers match that of the attacker this would fix large alliances griefing smaller ones at will and without recourse and it would also address dogpiling of allies for the defender once they have matched the size of the attacking alliance
exactly i dont buy the limiting allies helps mercs by forcing defenders to choose your allies well arguement if you allow it to be a numbers vs equal numbers mechanic then you have to be smart with your ally choices because adding an ally means you attacker can too so if you add a lazy one who has 100 members but does nothing vs 20members bit logs on actively you are going to come out on top this mechanic ensures that lean mean mercs get jobs and dog piling of a lot of unskilled allies is just going to feed the veteran mercs more fresh meat
supporti also think this would allow plenty of room for mercs as the majority of wars have sensible numbers with corporations roughly the same size or only a difference of a few dozen to a hundred or so so youd be far more limited with allies and w
id like to elaborate a little bit heres an example of a corp op that i imaginedto corpsubject mining op tuesday june 19th 600pm pst 0200 gmt  800pm pst 0400 gmtas you all know we are based out of stacmon placid formup will be at 600pm at stacmon viii  moon 22  freedom extension warehouse if you need an ore frig the corp will lendgive you one if you want to keep it at the end we can take it out of your cutwe will then be moving as a group next door to our pos at dastryns viii  moon 11 corporate bookmarkedwell meet up with our rorqual who will be bridging us to 6rpwu 
on the pvp sideoh look its showing a cyno lit up in 6rpwu lets go check it out guysand they may even catch a rorqual out in the belt
subject says it alli propose that the war dec fees are based on the difference in size of the fighting entities this means that a small corp deccing a large alliance to grief them or a large alliance deccing a small one to grief them would be expensive groups of the same size would result in smaller feesi would also add that if allies join the fight the difference that makes to the fees should be refunded to the attackerthanks youbofflescheck out my latest chronicle in eon 28  the soulless pilgrim
for a few seconds i actually hoped you meant actual changes to the hull like extra solarpanels for minmatar ships or extra hrusters which i can see would be cool and laginducing but just custom textures nah not that fascinating im pretty fine with the current ones
i understand you but aside from myself there are those that would like to custom texture especially for corporation loyalty

 1 i require the information for research
having any player own a system in lowsec is a bit off seeing that it free for any to access and technicaly is owned by the corresponding empire so no recognized overlords you can be the leader of a corpalliacne that dominates a system and squeezes people but that is based on you projecting powerthough the ideas of having more stuff to draw people to lowsec in content and rewards sounds good something different the idea of a isk generating pleasure hub i think is bad some kind of resource would be better maybe a mini mission terminal or trade hub who knows refine drugsa stronger criminal theme would be good and creates a contrast from empire but have it be the empires themselves still in control in having the areas under domain just the totally not secure rampant with thieves and corruption partand likewise npc nullsec be expanded like lowsec though in place of lack of security and corruption totally in control by a evil empire or criminal groupalso any thing sold in lowsec blackmarket should be accessible to nullsec as well the perk of lowsec being proximity to empire spacefor a interesting isk sink be allowed to payoff any guards in a system to not shoot you higher the higher the sec and have relatively strong empire faction police that infrequently patrol between gates and stations
6 no i dont agree with this i love eve because npcs dont play a huge role like in other mmos3 i dont agree because eve should have one unified market not a special market there are plenty of ways to incorporate black market without the need to create a whole new market in and of itselfagree with the other ideasim almost tempted to say take carriers out of low completelyi do however agree with the fact that low sec doesnt really have the same hook as it used to i think there should definitely be carrier balance and there should be more obvious and more promoted incentive for lowsec players there is no more culture around lowsecperhaps in the incarnaambulation patches there should be the on station poker games or what not non ccp sanctioned games should take place in low sec and official tournies take place in high spitballing ideas here p
hominem instead of responding to any points they makethis is the best part of your post maybe this is you why didnt answer for this question but tell to me why disturb afk tag an afk player who not at the computer  ppptry it again
its quite obvious ribikoka travelbuoy untouchable heart and tadam are alts because i refuse to believe that more than one person can have possibly missed all the well spelled out reasons why the proposal wont work yet seem to have no problems understanding a cryptic question that rib wrote that nobody whose native language is english can decipher
but tell to me why disturb afk tag an afk player who not at the computer stil didnt get answer for a simple question just language and grammar personal attacksbut i told you arduemont i have bad english but its time for you talk to me another language lets see how you can do that cut by isd stensson just i said its time to create something what is should be change this bad game mechanic where a cloaker can hide in enemy system and can went out from his pc 23 hours time long without riskneed solution for handling this capacitor useage for cloak or fuel usage counter ship seek and destroy or afk tagedit please keep in mind that only english is allowed while posting  isd stensson

yes ribo this quotequestion this is the one that none of us can understand what it means repeating it countless times isnt going to make it any clearer to us and now i am repeating myself and what gunslinger42 said already   note when i say we dont know what it means i mean that we do not understand your english sorry if english isnt your native language but you may have heard of something called google translate perhaps you should try running this sentence through that to see if it comes up with anything more intelligibletell you why disturb afk flag an afk player   this is not a sentence nor a question assuming you mean why it should disturb an afk player if they are afk and they get this flag then the reason has already been answered countless times it doesnt disturb them but it does give out more information that the public deserves gunslinger said this already in fact  and here i go repeating myself again i would love this flag as i would cloak by your miners wait until i get afk flagged then once you relax thinking that i was afk i would hot drop you and blow you up then after you got used to that behaviour i would sometimes just get the afk flag and press a button just to scare you and make you warp offthe point is that it is pointless tracking when people are in front of their computer thats just not a sensible solution i suppose you think that afking while on autopilot doing 30 jumps in a freighter should be afk flagged tops the answer is no
if you really want an explanation and a solution which is doubtful here it is againfirst what i am not talking aboutUFFFD letUFFFDs use your good rhetorical question why disturb a cloaked pilot you are right that usually there is no need to disturb cloaked pilots because they at their keyboards having fun playing eve and thatUFFFDs wonderful as you know thatUFFFDs not what these many people are asking to be changedfixed because afk cloaked ships are not a problem when in empire when in their own alliance space in null or when they are being used by an active player ie UFFFD by someone sitting at their computer pushing buttons or taking intel notes weUFFFDre talking instead about the extended afkwhy disturb the pilot who cloaks his ships and goes afk we all know cloaked ships are an excellent tactic when used by an UFFFDawakeUFFFD enemy pilot however when the cloaked pilot is not at the keys for an extended period of time which i will define as 24 hours the cloaked shippilot are never serving a tactical purpose for UFFFDgathering intelUFFFD or whatever fabricated excuse was offered by the earlier poasters who follow these practices once the afk lasts for an extended period their sole or primary purpose becomes causing grief and interfering with normal game play by the other people in system both blues and hostiles who are trying to get an accurate count of the tactical situation as noted this does violate eula and many believe it to be a broken mechanic due to lack of an effective UFFFDcounter measureUFFFD being available to the system sovereignty holder blueshow does the afk ship violate eula when cloaked in hostile territory it is the exact same principle as eula forbidding the mining bots or the ratting bots except the cloaky doesnUFFFDt even require a UFFFDbotUFFFD a eula violation results from 1 a pilot who is not at his computer 2 who leaves his ship neut or red in enemy system 3 for sole purpose of causing grief and annoyance andor to impede normal game play by his enemy for example a player puts his cloaked alt character into his enemyUFFFDs system right before he leaves for work in the morning and the player leaves his computer running all day with the alt char online all day until the next down time without attending his keyboard except when he gets home for about 10 minutes to push a button before he leaves again to go out to the local pub for drinks and a party the net result of UFFFDtactical intelUFFFD being advocated by many people in this thread results in eighteen hours 18 hours of cloaked enemy red or neut in his enemyUFFFDs sovereign system or office system vs ten minute 10 minutes with the player at his keyboard UFFFD not exactly what i would call UFFFDintel gatheringUFFFD but obviously trying to deliver griefi particularly enjoyed the earlier question isnUFFFDt this the same as turning on a freighter to auto pilot 30 jumps across empireUFFFD guess whatUFFFD that freighter is UFFFDat riskUFFFD of being ambushed and is UFFFDin playUFFFD while the afk cloaker is never UFFFDat riskUFFFD while cloaked summary why disturb the cloaked pilot1 he is interfering with normal game play while not UFFFDat riskUFFFD2 he is violating eulaproposed solution confidentially tag the offending player for his eula violation let the gm or automation kick the afk cloaker resulting in emergency warp is he afraid to log back in due to risk doubtful since he can immediately cloak up again anyways this solution is simple just use the same mechanic already in effect for eula violations when a player posts kiddie porn or uses offensive language in local both types of conduct are reportable as a eula violation perhaps this will take time for gm to police but perhaps it takes less time than programming a simple timer to fix this game mechanic as noted above ccp does have ways to track when the account is online and inactive which can be used by the gm to quickly identify and silently bootbounce the afk playerUFFFDs account so he has to relogUFFFD heaven only knows this game causes enough unintentional UFFFDemergency warpsUFFFD that a few like this to encourage fairness shouldnUFFFDt be a problem whenever the coding is rewritten a more permanent solution should become available so this is only a stop gap solution
you cant at least not a pure fleetfriends only overview same as wartargets only overview its not possible the way it is now the way around this is to set personalcorp standings towards alliance members
stations should have gate turrets near them at the very least but you shouldnt really be fighting near stations anyways fighting should be done in the field not at the base
i dont see a issue with raising the time limit for aggression and being able to redock have it tie in with the new criminal flag system but punishing others with being agressed by others is not kosher fixing station games should not come at the expense of other players who use stationsas others stated generally if looking for fights get people outside of stations if you encounter phags in docking range and they dont want to do risky pvp other than station games they could always stay dock and you would be just as out of luck
just allow them to use covert cynos without having a cloak no need for a new mod jump them out to null with a transport ship and do some ninja mining theyll be nimble enough to get out reasonably quickly
the rorqual already has a jump drive 1m m3 smb and a cloning vat who needs to jump all those frigs individually1 have everybody install blank jump clones no implants on the rorqual2 rorqual jumps out to the destination system3 everybody clone jumps to the rorqual4 everybody gets in the ore ship of their flavour from the smb frig barge exhumer and gets to mining5 when op is done everybody sticks their ships back in the smb and selfdestructs pod no implants no money lost safely back in hisec system of their preference6 rorqual jumps back outonly downside to this is you have to wait 24h from initial jump to get back in your implanted clone though this could easily be fixed by allowing you to chose a nonmedical clone as you default clone when you get podded or by increasing the number of times per day you can jump clone
in before goon whiningi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
why is it so expensive for small corps to war dec big corps surely a small corp should get to dec corps on the cheap ccp have gone the wrong way round doing the opposite which just encourages corps to fill up with alt chars on unsubd accounts really dumbwar cost should  number of chars in your corp not number in target this would also encourage corps to throw out in active players
support drone regions should be boosted
supported and asap please i have 25 fully fitted brutix i need transported 67 jumps
i dont know where people are getting the idea that this kind of warp effect would be instantaneousif the warp mechanics were switched to this system ships would still have to align and ships would still have to obey the laws of physics they will not instantly appear on their destination ships are not quantum particles they dont randomly materialize out of thin airwith the current warp mechanics ships only reach their maximum warp speed halfway to their destination in other words 13 of the time your ship is accelerating to max warp speed 13 of the time your ship is in max warp speed and another 13 your ship is in decelerationthis new system would do away with warp tunnel accelerations and decelerations but ships which warp will not magically appear at their destination instantaneouslyeditheres a picture
i agree dreadnought that can fit like 8 strip miners or a carrier that can fit fightersized mining drones
i didnt like my fit so i stripped my chribbasexy
i like the idea and support it i do agree that there shouldnt be another class of ship implemented as far as the cargohold i think a way for it to work is possibly putting a 0 m3 extra cargohold on all ships and having them work like cargo expanders either based on the current cargohold of the ship and leave the concealment modifier stay the samextreme industries take back your roids winners not whiners if you care about your game experience take it back or find a different game experience to hate goonsquad now offering bounties to troll and flame inquire within
ok i think that refinement of this proposal has gone about as far as it needs to at this stage im awaiting the csm minutes which hans has kindly confirmed will include a discussion of the status of the assembly hall when the correct venue for player proposals is clarified ill post a final version therethanks everyone who contributed to this thread its great to see that worthwhile discussion can be had on the eveo forums
but tell to me why disturb afk tag an afk player who not at the computer  question not equal with why disturb a cloaked pilotthat is just a tag same as who online or not and that is existing in the game
weve answered this question over and over and here is the answer againafk tag causes problems for everyone not just afk cloakies examples belowalso it wont work for the below reasonsalso afk cloakies are not in violation of the eula that is rediculous theyre not actively doing anything so how can they be greifing also greifing is defined as a repeated act against one particular player afk cloakies presence effects everyone in that system and if they leave that system the cloaky doesnt follow one particular player if they did happen to follow one particular player it still wouldnt be greifing because out in low or nullsec even if he were just waiting for the right time to strike that is what those spaces are for pvpits already been suggested the gms police it which is also rediculous do you really think they have the time to try and futily figure out who is and who isnt at their keyboard even if they could somehow tell which they cant it would be a massive waste of resourcescorrected a typoisd dosnixin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
on this remove local chat idea i opt for another solutiontransponders just like aircraft in real lifeyou would have a transponder choice in local chat to either brodcast yourself into the local window or not by turning off your transponder you would not appear on the chat windowthe only people who want a local list in null are botters there is zero other reason to have it other than to protect bots if you want to know who is in your system then be active and play the game
and start to spamming all pilot their scanner button within 2 seconds which instanlty should be make lagfestsno
to 0lona i think that spies also do want to see what other spies are in their system so that they can determine their where abouts removing local even optionally breaks this and makes cloakers even more powerful  collecting intel and collecting it completely stealthily little do people realize this is actually more power to cloakers miners rarely understand this as their view is myopically from a prey point of view to the idea of extended afk by kahn soomer firstly kudos for putting together a cohesive arguement that is fair and unbiased but while i agree on your premise and definitions i cannot agree that even an extended afker is doing anything wrong what if i wanted to record via videocam 24 hours worth of footage of an enemy pos while cloaked thats legitamate intel gathering thats fair play according to eula thats how i know where your fleet is or where your miners hang out and what times they log on why should i have to press a button to prove nonafk in this casebeing afk is not against eula end of story you should really think about your grounds of why you think it should be no other arguement against afkers without tackling this fundamental issue is worth considering
this is just untruth thing and evadingfirst suicide ganking not equal with ambush when cloaker pick target and attack his target after uncloakarduemont snip go to high sec and learn what is suicide ganking and who will potential victimssecond not easier to pick targets because the attackers dont know who used another clients or doing anything while open a communication software so this preparation blabla just a big lieeveryone knows why would be disturb the afk tag some cloaky fags who lying in this topic im afk at enemy systems and i cant kill anyone when im afk because they would be lost the chances to terrorizing active players in afkedit keep calm there is no reason for flaming or other personal attacksisd dosnix
unless and until you have been part of a small alliance claiming less than 5 sovereign systems which has been fairly fought by a hot dropping alliance that leaves afk cloakers onine in all your systems 247 for a few weeks i am not going to listen to you suggest this process is fair balanced or not grief against each and every blue player in those systemsunless and until you have tried to conduct pve to recover isk to reship after your pvp losses and you find that your alliances pve systems are plaged by 247 afk cloaked ships and hot droppers i am not going to listen to you talk about making fraps of your screens for intell we all know why you do this and its not going to hurt your intell for ccp to use existing reporting mechanisms to boot the extended afk cloaked ships into an emergency warp they will be safe in an emergency warp exit from system and they can ofc relog and return to their cloaked duties as soon as they return to the keys to actively play the game no foul on them particularly if they are truly activei tend to agree there is no reason to tag these people in local the solution is to push a report button so that ccp can verify afk status and boot them resulting in relog if there was an error small penalty to pay for the grief they inflict and not a big priority for gms or enforcement as there is really no rush for booting them  they are going to be there 247 and ready to be booted whenever the gm has some down time available to deal with the anonymous reportseula violation for botting afk and for purpose of giving grief to every person in system this isnt a eula violation rofl lets be serious thats like suggesting a mass murder isnt a crime because it effects more than one person and the crime is described as killing a person i dont think the judge will grant your motion to dismiss the indictment against a mass murderer on that basisso i say as explained in detail above1 add a report button put it into the same place where you report foul mouthed people or pron links  grief against the local residents in local the policy would be explained in a small pop up or description before you push the button 2 ccp follows up on a report of the violation in a leisurely way as time permits to boot the long afk cloaky causing him to go offline and into a safe emergency warp until he logs back in and reactives cloak abuse of the reporting tool could also carry consequences problem solved at least until some pvp countermeasure or some better solution is developed and implementedwe players are paying for good mechanics please dont tell us ccp still doesnt have time to fix this or address it please make this a priority and please someone on the council take on this project as a crusade show us you can make a difference this will limprove the game
with the new fw changes prices for lp store items have dropped massively as was to be expected with a 50 discount on the minmatar frontwhile this on its own is fantastic i fear it has impacted level 5 missions in a very bad waywith the dropped prices running a level 5 missions now gets you about 20m including everything for which you have to risk a carrier while a faction warfare mission nets you way more for only risking a bombera simple fix to this would be to have two different lp stores one for faction warfare one for normal missionsthat way normal missions get their normal risk vs reward ratio back which i feel was fine before the patch 50m or so per mission for risking your capitalso to all my fellow bears out there please help me poke ccp about this
doesnt fw already have a separate lp store

the problem is the alliance mandatory vote systemsbig 00 alliances easily can put their m8s to csm member positions and the splitted high sec community cant do this but not much can be done about itthe 333 seat postions  to 00lowhigh maybe a better solution for a more balanced representatives but it is very difficult to achieve against the 00 players
not much can be done except stopping being so defeatist and not being so bad at organizing yourselves you people keep claiming that 75 of all characters live in hisec it really shouldnt be all that hard to find even just one candidate which isnt xenurialevel weirdola and push him forth to hisec saviour fame
literally the only advantages that the 00 have in the csm is that theyre organised and motivatedcomplaining that organised motivated campaigns have an electoral advantage is like complaining that people who can run fast have an advantage in footracesget organised get motivated as it is hisec got 2 arguably 3 csm candidates this year and as has been repeated ad infinitum et ad nauseam all the csm have extensive hisec experience

are we still talking about thisi was one of the first to complain about the problems with the preinferno devblogs weeks before it launched i predicted dogpiling as soon as the ally system was mentioned in fanfest i proposed several potential abuses of the new system when it was released and have seen a few of those used to great and hilarious effect after the release i was one of the most vocal in asking for many of the changes that are due in 11 specifically i and others proposed the cap on wardec costs and cumulative costs for allies i am quite satisfied with what theyve told us to expectwhat they still need to fix the wardec cost should be based on total combatants rather than the size of the defender this forces large alliances to pay significant costs to throw around wardecs
if i understand this correctly no one does this for three reasons1 this is a huge pain in the 2 the rorquals bay can only hold 56 mackshulks that kind of blows3 cool people have a rather large number of skill points selfdestructing costs more money the cooler the player thus older toons wont want to partake see the many threads on this about 2006 toons pvping in riftersas cool as it could theoretically be changing a mechanic such as 24h jump clone and nonmedical clones and such would be a lot harder for ccp to deal with
wardecs should be determined by the total number of combatants not just the size of the defender this would make it nontrivial for goonswarm to wardec oneman corpsi understand why it costs to wardec large entities youre paying for a lot of targets plus its a deterrent to the dec everything and camp jita undock killboard whres i just dont understand why they dont have to pay the same fee to dec in the opposite directionedit and im against penalizing large groups simply for deccing smaller ones i just want them to pay the same price as if it were reversed
all in all this is a solid idea i suspect thats why discussion has dried up a bit theres nothing to argue againstid love if we could call the ship class heighliners probably an issue with the dune ip there but herbert named them after heinlein rahclass
i certainly like the notion of having another potential response be to commit gallente blaster boats early in the fight to negate the effects of the aegis destroyersin another post regarding effectiveness of active defense i mentioned that distance from the midpoint made a significant difference the closer an attacker is to the target the more difficult it would be for the destroyer to get in the middle thats another potential counter instead of the frigate fest so minmatar can dictate range but the range advantage is offset to some degree by the destroyers if the attackers move to use itinteresting thought

repeatjust i said its time to create something what is should be change this bad game mechanic where a cloaker can hide in enemy system and can went out from his pc 23 hours time long without riskneed solution for handling this capacitor useage for cloak or fuel usage counter ship seek and destroy or afk tagbut cloaking is not against eula cloakers just need real counters after they went to afk very long time in cloak and when cloakers not really play just plagued systems in afk 247 long time without play
i havei havethe report button idea really isnt going to work because ccp wont commit the man hours required for this sort of thing and thats even if it was in violation of the eula which i really dont believe it is saying please dont tell me ccp dont have the time doesnt make it not true they really dont have the time and like i say even if they did you would still need an overwhelming consensus from the playerbase to say that it was a good idea which your not getting i doubt even rib thinks ccp would handle a report button very wellgoing afk is not botting it has no in game mechanics altering effect the only effect it does have is a psychological one comparing going afk in an enemy system to murder is not cool dont do it its also not right you also appear to be forgetting that for a pilot with a cloak it is safer for them to go afk in space than it is for them to dock up or log off logging off gives the enemy a chance to scan you down and kill you when there is nothing you can do about it and docking up means you have to leave a hostile station or risk getting camped in sometimes its just a matter of conveniencealso thank you for posting it is nice to have someone posting constructively in here in the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
maybe the emergent game play solution here is for you to offer up a portion of your pve gains to your renter corp so that they go patrol your space to give you some security or just get used to red cloakers welcome to null if you think your problems are unique to you think again
indeed
skip my wall of text read the solution see above pick it up run with it mr council manfurther constructive suggestionif you dont want to have a gm click 2 buttons this isnt drafting response to a petition is it then automate the button to activate the booting 2 hours after the report but only if the afk cloaker remains inactive in the same system where he was first reported as an extended afk cloaker 2 hours afk to ccp this would cause auto boot 4 hours into his afk modeyou think the risk to cloaky is unfari an afk cloaky has risk of getting discovered in an automated emergency dc warp out well that probably depends on where he parked himself afk but id say the risk is minimal oh wai do you want a role with no risk mr cloaky are you afraid mr cloaky lol even the psychological warfare could have a counter i love it ps  making a constructive suggestion in here seems to always cause trolling and personal attack so you win mr troll im not renting and im not going back to empire instead ill simply sayi have played eve continuously for over 6 years and in all parts of the map one thing remains constant wherever players gather together near a resource you have people doing extended cloaky afk looking for ganks since there is no counter for this with game mechanics the best solution is simply not to undock or to move to another system moving is easy for the large alliances who control the council its not so easy for the small guys atm my main is associated with a larger alliance so this isnt really hurting me personally atm im posting because i think the mechanic is broken and has been broken for many years due to the way the cloak mechanism was coded if a council member takes up this cause to investigate a solution with ccp he will have my utmost respect and appreciation
capacitor consume for cloaked ships is much better solution than posting gms they dont have time for check every cloakers and you never see cloaked pilot active or not so how you can report a cloakers if you dont know he is active or notcapacitor consume much better solutionduring cloak disable cap regeneration and after every hour remove 25 or 20 of capacitor from covert cloaked ships and 50 of capacitor every hour from non covert cloaked ship thats mean a cloaker need to move after 45 hours recons or need to move after 2 hours common cloaksdisable recloak ability again until the cloak can reach the appropriate value at least 25 or 50 of cap depends from cloak type covert or notso when the ship run out from capacitor the ship need to move to safe spot and the pilot unable to remain afk 4 or 5 hours long time in enemy system or he risk his ship
actually i think the imbalance is level fours also your simple fix doesnt make sense to me can you elaborate you want two lp stores with different pricing so the isk to lp conversion you earn from normal missions is worth more than the isk to lp conversion you earn for fw im confused remember faction warfare participants make themselves a target to a large portion of the eve community essentially giving up on ever having a safe haven like highsec while most mission runenrs hide behind concord you should reward people for taking part in risky behaviors i have no qualms about improving lvl 5 payouts as their in lowsec but whatever your suggesting shoud in no way give a boost to highsec mission runners
actually fw farmers risk a cloaked sb in a area without bubbles youd have to be stupid to be exposed to any risk at all the very small chance of a normal missioner getting suicide ganked in highsec is actually higher than a nonstupid fw farmer losing his sb
i recently engaged a hostile attack force that tried to destroy my pos in low sec with a carrier dread and assorted t3 ships being the closest member of my alliance to the pos at the time of the attack i manned the defenses as i called in help the calvary arrived in time and we did not lose any pos modules and only the hot drop cyno ship was destroyed by the attackers we successfully pointed their carrier and destroyed it o much to my surprise as the one guy who was engaged in the fight the longest the pos gunner did not receive credit on an 8 billion isk killmaili know ccp has recently granted recognition of the guys who point ships on the killmails i do herein propose that pos gunners should be included on killmails right now it just says unknown and gives the corp name and damage  inflicted would it be so difficult to credit kills to the people who have taken the extra time to train for the skills to defend the property of their corp allianceseems like this is a no brainer pos gunners fight they do damage and against capital ships they have a steep challenge can someone on the csm put this before ccp to give credit to pos gunners for kills they contribute to power to the players

thank you kind sirwell i thought about this deeply for the past few daystldr read the underlinedheres how i feel about thisa few things came to mind while talking about this over a few beers with friendsit would be ridiculously cool to have all ore ships able to do this but1no older char would want to use the frigs theni figure that you should sacrifice something to have this kind of mobility else all the older players would do it in a ship that could mine more this would be a role for the ship a way of use much like a mack is currently for cutting ice this would be a newbie mining ship and a ship that they will want to still get in after a year if they enjoy the playstylealso it wont be like now where you sell the previous ship when you acquire a new one each one will have a unique function2 this may sound strange or lazy of me but my second reason is that there may be a way to abuse it right now ccp is designing the ore frig if they want to give it this ability then they can insure it does not get abused or later enforcepatch because eve players are quite crafty it could be used to transport cargo fit some guns and hot drop ninja piing and god knows what else we tried to brainstorm considerably and the more beer the crazier the ideas none however were all that gamebreaking in our opinion right now ccp can design it as a ship role rather then a patch in later3 it should not use a blackops ship to jump it covert cynos would make it too op in my humble opinion a cyno at least is visible in local lights up in the map if youre looking for it and the ship lighting it is giving everyone an invite to warp to them
i know its not really a big thing or really a issue but i find that it gets old to click to see the mission details over and over to remember what system the mission is in i would like to be able to see where the mission is when i click on my journal and am on the missions tab an old timer like me tends to forget things from time to time and when i have several missions up and ready i would like to know if i have more then one in the same area just by looking at my lists of missions and not having to click through them all but like i said its now a real big deal just somethin id like to see
i was just thinking of something the npc corps could use to make the game easier for new people to learn and something that could interact with existing or a new tutorial i remember the csm and ccp were both interested in this area so i decided to post it heremany professional corps have a fleet doctrine that tells people you need to be able to fly ship x with y fittings well the starter corps dont really have anything like that some players are smart enough to use the corp chat channel which is a good resource for feedback but others never visit it so i was thinking on the fitting screen why not add some basic ship templates that the npc corps where the tools and resources of a player corp arent available could have the new players are losing out without this and it means every corp they go into has to train them on elementary fitting philosophy in fact it doesnt even need to be limited to npc corps either just to be safeso why not create some decent sample fits for some ships maybe a pvp and pve version for each using basic t1 items and base it on minimal skills and fitting req the csm could help ccp come up with those fits or put them up to public for suggestions and feedback make it available to everyone under a basic fits tab and as you are skilled up for more ship types more fittings are unlocked for you ie no cruisers are shown until you get cruiser 1 and when you do that races fits are unlocked in the module then you allow players to browse the modules and be able to mouse over the fittings this is a key point each item fitted will have a little tooltip telling players exactly why it is there the hulkageddon hulk fit will feature a lot of tank and the tool tip will tell players that they are using tank in these slots so the ship will have a better chance of surviving until concord shows up or something like that maybe even add a few suggested skills like drone five for the lovely vexors then all you need to do is add a tutorial telling players about said feature so when they get a dessy from the tut missions a destroyer fitting tutorial will come up and it will show the player a pve fit a pvp fit and a salvage fit perhaps for the catsthese wouldnt necessarily be current meta fits but basic common sense fits that can help establish some sort of baseline to put newer players on the right track right away for example a new player wouldnt know not to mix tank so none of the fits would have mixed tank and would specifically mention that mixing tank is bad that way the new player can just plug and play until hes ready to improve his fitting skills as a player
nice dune reference but im going to go ahead and stick with envoysi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
still not a bad idea if handled properlyi still would go with point defense such as phalanx ciwstype modulesi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
this is exactly what im talking about
i support the revision of warp mechanicsone thing that must be remembered from an acceleration point of view is that eve physics operates in what appears to be a dynamically fluid model meaning that when you stop the ships sublight engines momentum is not conserved and the ship comes to a stop in real space there is nothing to slow down a craft and once top speed is obtained engines can be shut down without a change in velocitythis means that theoretically and purely theoretically when the ship engages warp speed it must accelerate through space and maintain velocity coming out of warp does not require any sort of retrorocket burn but only that the warp engine be disengaged from a theoretical standpoint this means that hitting warp should not and can not be instantaneous as in the diagramas far as other mechanics are concerned it could be proposed that your camera drones do not automatically follow you into warp but instead lag behind for a second or two this would give you the effect of watching your ship warp out with the camera drones catching up after the initial boost a similar reverse mechanic would allow your drones to drop out of warp a second or two after your ship did meaning they would arrive first and watch as your ship dropped out of warp omen

oh noes yet another cap consume cloaking suggestion how original how about you stop trying to nerf my play style of intel collection recording the screen forever and all the other comments that other people have mentioned like relative safety of cloakers in station of log off your whining  of just the 2 of you and your alts  is what everyone deals with in nullsec you got a bum deal you rented a fringe system from a big alliance surprise surprise these alliances treat these systems like ghetto properties by the train tracks ie get whatever sucker to pay to rent it as they cant be bothered to defend it themselves i used to argue for a counter to cloakers too google it before i realized the legitimacy of intel collection and nullsec noob terrorizing which is valid tactics in null  yes valid just like ninja salvaging so just htfu i hate using that term but nothing else sums it up as well
reading comprehension fail ill say it again risk  reward there is no isk making in intel collection or cloaking having no risk is fine and fair you miner on the other hand are making isk mining you and only you need to bear the risk
arguemont just htfu and gtfo no matter how you cry with your altsthis is a counter for cloakers already they not have counters and afk cloakers plagued all systems they are realy collecting intels alone in empty systems 247 time long lolcloakers is just little girls they just want to play without risk bunch of pcapacitor consume for cloaked ships is much better solution than posting gms they dont have time for check every cloakers and you never see cloaked pilot active or not so how you can report a cloakers if you dont know he is active or notcapacitor consume much better solutionduring cloak disable cap regeneration and after every hour remove 25 or 20 of capacitor from covert cloaked ships and 50 of capacitor every hour from non covert cloaked ship thats mean a cloaker need to move after 45 hours recons or need to move after 2 hours common cloaksdisable recloak ability again until the cloak can reach the appropriate value at least 25 or 50 of cap depends from cloak type covert or notso when the ship run out from capacitor the ship need to move to safe spot and the pilot unable to remain afk 4 or 5 hours long time in enemy system or he risk his ship
why is it that when i argue a point i just get called a troll those were all legitimate arguement if you dont like the fact your proposal is full of holes then amend it dont just call me a troll as for the cap consumtion for cloakies although the way rib suggests it works is very differant to how any other mods work at the moment im usually moderately against ideas like this i actually see very few problems with it in fact i cant think of anything legitimately wrong with it makes senceoh and rib nice to see you finally abandoned the log off mechanic and afk tag ideas  pif it did take 4 or so hours for your cap to run out using a system like this it doesnt break anyones gameplay if you want to gather intel then set an alarm come back and bouncy around safe spots for a bit whilest your cloak recharges you probably wouldnt even need to bounce just check dscan for combat scanners whilst you waitin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
i agree with you on that
if it wouldnt be developmentally expensive i see no reason for this not to be done
sounds reasonable
i support this if they take the initiative to defend their corpalliance pos by parking their ship and taking control of the guns i agree they deserve credit if they kill anythingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
this seems a complete no brainer to me pos gunners are real players defending their property like anyone else ccp need to sort this out asap and congrats on a successful defence
the real question is why havent i ever seen this brought up before

not sure what the right answer to all this is  but the truth is eve will stagnate andor eventually die unless ccp solves the problem of having created game mechanics where your best option as a newer player being wardeccedgankedetc in hisec is to simply log out for a week month foreverno game designer should be stupid enough to actually encourage their players to log off
both sides of this argument have legitimate points but we need to look at the subject realistically i think everyone would agree that poss need quite a bit of revision not just in this area i think there needs to be a clear area of distinction between what can be done with an abandoned pos and what can be done with a bashed pos changing a game mechanic to the former would allow for trash removal while changing the latter could drastically change galactic warfare to hack a pos would mean suddenly that poss would become much more vulnerable imagine if you will the ramifications of such a mechanic on alliance wars if taking overdown a pos was as simple as spending a few hours hacking it or running a salvager over it we would see an influx of active poss that would be under attackfinding a clear distinction between what would be defined as an abandoned pos and a bashed pos could be problematic its unclear how one would avoid completely circular reasoning can a bashed pos be hacked  how many days must a pos remain unattended to be considered abandoned  if a bashed pos has been sitting for x hoursdays can it be hacked  should a bashed pos ever be considered abandonedthese are important questions that should not be taken lightly and i would not expect ccp to take lightly if any change occurs it should be minor and minuscule that allows poss to be removed if certain time and attention conditions are met otherwise warfare in general could be at risk with such changes omen
as it stands a cargo ship that devotes every low slot and rig hardpoint to a cargo expander can carry a lot more than a ship that lends even just a few slots to other modules or rigs i think adding a stacking penalty would put much more control over a ships cargohold by making its max cargohold size fairly proportional to the base cargohold size ships meant for carrying cargo could have their base cargohold adjusted so that their maximum cargohold size is still the same but they could afford to spend at least a few modules on a very basic tank or anything else they may deem necessary it would put more strategy into fitting a cargo ship and would even out the differences between the races industrials currently the badgers have relatively small max cargoholds in comparison to their sizeskill requirements because they have so many mid slots forcing them to tank and not be capable of hauling a large load inversely amarr industrials have relatively large max cargoholds in comparison to sizeskill requirements because they have so many low slots
what problem would this solve exactly
balance battlebadger pvp obviously

sounds good to mei know a lot of people were pissed off about the item renamingalso meta level is really only important for levels 14 id move the little blue triangle to the upper left and not have it appear on t2 or faction modulesoh yeah and the visual styling of the other triangles use dots and symbols not numbers so 4 dots would work for meta 14i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
im looking for feedback on the idea of an industrialonly jump portal generator the unit could theoretically be fit on a rorqual for example and would allow smaller industrials and maybe a few wingmen more movement in nullsec conceivably freighters would be too large but orcas hulks ittys could be fair game this would allow greater range in nullsec along with the danger of losing or stranding a fleet of hulks in hostile territory if your fc happens to be an idiot and honestly who doesnt like the idea of thatthoughts omen
this post should be in features and ideas not in the assembly hall as for your idea i dont see any glaring problems with it although i probably wouldnt support it in my opinion cynos jump bridges and jump portals really reduce the size of eve online they increase force projection to the point where multifront battles no longer matter while you arent necessarily transporting war supplies i think this is just another power projection mechanic that i dont see as benefiting the game i think there should be risk in moving goods in and out of nullsec and i fear this is just another mechanic that severely mitigates nullsec logistics risks
not sure i like the idea of a mining fleet having a cyno alt on standby in a secondary system able to give them an easy out when a gang shows upcaptain potential dangerlight the cynopoof the mining fleet flitters away to safety
if it needs to be moved thats fine i agree there should be risk transporting in and out of null and this idea would not remove that risk only reduce it to a certain extent remember that until we can light cynos in highsec which will never happen this will only allow for movement from within nullsec to nullseclowsecyour argument is interesting in that by decrying an industrial jump portal you would also seemingly disapprove of the titans jump portal my argument is significantly less drastic than that of the titans jump portal which already exists ingame and allows large military fleets to be moved at will furthermore and this is key the idea would add more industrials to null which i believe would add more content to the gameminers and industrialists arent exactly adventurous in nullsec right now not only is the ore barelynot worth it if anyone shows up in local you can count on the miner eating it it would seem that if we can get more miners into null we would add more targets which equals more fights
i do think titans jp is op and could use some tweaking to balance it the titan is also a skill intensive 60b isk ship whereas a rorqual is far more accessible as for moving industrialists to null i would cherish the thought however i dont think this is the real trick needed to bring nullsec indy you really need to1 make logistics tofrom the jita teat a little bit less reliable2 invert the indy bonuses between nullsec and highsec in other words you should only find perfect refine in nullsec and never in highsec rd and manufacturing slots and times should also be much more abundant efficient and cheaper in nullsec rather than in highsec this is the gist of what your proposal does it makes a highsec corp more able to run excursions into lowsecnullsec to run mining ops by significantly mitigating the logistics risks between the two areas i think this is the wrong attitude improvements to nullsec industry should focus on operating in nullsec not bringing them in safely for a brief excursion
that does kind of involve keeping your rorqual in the beltgrav site which is just asking to lose it
agreed how many rocks do you need to mine to offset the cost of a rorqual i punch those numbers into my calculator and it makes a happy face
1am truly annoyed that there isnt an easy way right click  navigate to x mission location in x system
i actually think you we should have right click options when clicking on the journal entry some possible options should include speak to the agent complete missionset destination to agentset destination to missionwhat else would be good
no the only factor on the price of war should be the amount of members your corp or allince has if your corp is packed with members you should be able to afford the cost so small gang and one amn corps should get to dec for cheap
i contacted the csm and was evemailed by alekseyev karrde who let me know that ccp are aware of the idea and that we should look out for not exactly sure what the new player experience has to do with it although i supose they would benefit more than most from a change like this
at least they are looking at this idea its going to be interousting what they do if they are incorperating it into i can see this truly going a lot further then just new player experience imo cause it could not just be corpalliance recruitment but advertisement for services as will
sounds nice xd and if it gets a t2 version name it termite

i think this proposal takes away the only thing that favors the side with fewer systems this proposal makes it so that the defending side will have a reduced incentive to defend plexes in pvp the economic attitude will be let the enemy finsih cappign some plexes in our systems after all the more they contest the system the more money we make by running defensive plexes later when they are not around right no with no reward for defensive plexing the defenders have a considerable incentive to drive a plexer out before he captures the plex that is drive him out in pvp because if he lets the attacker actually capture the plex they are in effect punished by having to orbit a button for no gain or keep getting steps closer to losing the systemthe no lp for defensive plexing is one of the better mechanics in this expansion leave it bemake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
no lp for defensive plexing does several good things1 encourages the defending side to stop plexers in pvp before they capture a plex so that they do not need to orbit a button for no pay2 gives some reason to join the side with fewer systems since although your lp is worth very little you have more opportunities to make lp through plexing it also limits the winning sides ability to make lp through plexing yes they can still make lp from missions but that does not help their occupancy efforts and if enough people switch over to missioning instead of plexing then the side with fewer systems is given some respite3 it can lead to a war where many systems become vulnerable or close to vulnerable and then flipped in a dramatic fashion sure this hasnt happened yet but we are starting to see it signs of how it will work one of the caldari or gallente refused to flip a system after bringing it to vulnerable the minmatar are already getting concerned of the prospect that amarr will start farming those back systems in a way that will be very difficulttedious for them to recapture once the amarr gets around to plexing those back systems and forcing the minmatar to plex for no gain we will start to wear them out we havent really begun that yet but it will work if we do decide to do that 4 its sort of neat to use individual greed as a balance 5 if you want to farm systems where your enemy cant even dock then eve offers that already sov null sec i think sov null sec could greatly benefit from a system like this where you are rewarded for taking over new space instead of just sitting in your space and farming it imo that is a big reason why null sec has been so boring for the last few years by forcing people to take over new space in order to gain isk you encourage conflict make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
everytime you mention this point i will repeat myself so that any new people joining the thread as if there were any will know the fundamental point you are missing hereno isk no risk cloakers earn no isk cloakers do not earn any risk
actually there are some considerations that this proposal misses heredo you mean to make your cap 100 recharge while you are cloaked how else is a 25cap1 hour cycle time going to ever deplete more than 25 of cap so if by a small chance that rib actually thought of that and just failed to mention the 100 recharge necessity then i would point out that this 100 cap gimp completely kills cover opsrecon ships which have small cap you wont be able to make it more 2 jumps into null sec before you have to decloak to recharge your cap so that you can even make the next warpnot to mention it completely destroys the gameplay of scouts jumping into an unknown system without system safes they jump in they cloak and warp to sun and already need to decloak to recharge cap the see combat probes show up on dscan they recloak and bounce to the next celestial now they are definitely out of cap probably drop out of warp half way now they have only 2 choices decloak and hope to gain enough cap for another warp or stay cloaked and hide yeah you saw this coming 1 hour later when the awesome new 25  h mechanic decloaks them pretty much jumping into enemy territory with even a minor pvp force will be suicidethis will totally ruin the gameplay of covert ops
now here is the real reason why miners are the ones who need to htfu yes logical statements strung together in a convincing argumenti will answer them in faq stylestatement no isk no risk that is the defence of afk cloakers miners seem to not want to recognize thisbut they strangely dont have a problem with accepting the flipside of that same statementwith isk comes riskthey are the first to admit that there should be risk in the game and that risk should be scaled to the amount of isk the activity you are doing earnsq is highsec mining more or less profitable than nullsec mininga it is less much less profitableq is highsec mining more or less risky than nullsec mininga it is less risky but only because of cloakers and chances of hotdrops in nullsecq should i as a nullsec miner have to tolerate the possibility of getting hotdropped at any timea yes you made that choice when you decided to mine in nullsec you are making a lot more isk than in highsec and therefore this is your risk to wearq but i paid an alliance to rent this space shouldnt this entitle me to some level of peace and quiet to minea no you should have factored that renting cost into your mining yield profit calculations you paid for the right to use null space without actually putting the time into conquering it yourself you did not pay for risk free ore mining if mining rare expensive ore was so easy why doesnt everyone who can pay a rent fee do itq i thought it moving to null is what everyone does to get rich fast it isnta not necessarily maybe a myth propagated by renting alliances or pvpers looking for fresh meatq i thought the formula to use was  if possible nullsec yieldmonth  rentmonth  highsec yieldmonth  then you should move to null is this not truea not that simple you forgot to factor in the risk profiles of null vs highsecq im pissed now because i didnt do the math and i think its unfair that i thought that this mining in null thing was going to get me rich fast but it really doesnt unless i have to change the way i mine hire scouts and do all this other stuff that i didnt need to do when i mined in highsec i want to blame this on someone isnt it unfair that afk cloakers have such a godlike uber mechanic on their sidea no it is not their fault that the way the game is played and balanced in nullsec does not work to your expectations they earn no isk they get no risk denial of space and reconnaissance is their role in nullsec it is their job in the circle of life to make your life a pain and the pain is yours to bear as you want to mine rare ore and get rich

i think tigers spirit has rightwhy the  someone afk in a enemy system even spy or scout dont do afk in a enemy system long time the reason why someone is there because try to terrorize the local citizensnothing to do there only cloak the ship and afk local players dont dare to kill npcs or something because dont know somebody hot drop them or try to kill and no one can shot himand of cours everybody hate cloaky faggs on local they do nothing even fight so pointless be there long time
except you know the most popular botting software simulates mouse and keyboard inputs using the os keyboard and mouse buffers in a way that cannot be legally tracked by ccp and is identical to the physical keyboard and mouse at the software level so it is already immune to your brilliant idea even before it is done timeouts like that would only break long autopilot runs in highsec which is what you really want anyways lern2computaheve forums official anthem

jedi except for teshania and dinger i dont believe that this thread said very much about online towers at all and was dealing with fairly strictly offline towers and while i was really the only ones to respond to their posts they havent posted back on itim not even sure what you mean by bashed is this a tower in reinforced is this a tower that is past reinforced but not restronted shields below 25 what tower state are you trying to represent here out of fuel  a tower has gone offline because of fuel and has been out of fuel for less then 3 days abandoned  a tower is offline but anchored for more then a week reinforced  a tower on a stront timerbashed what was being presented and discussed here was a new structure anchorable near an existing offline tower whos function was to capture or unanchor the target tower when dealing strictly with towers offlined from lack of fuel or intentionally offlined by the owners abandoned can be judged simply by closed corp or offlined pos for more then x days weeks or months i tend to put that number for abandoned at a weekthe questions that you raise seem to be on a different topic entirely the op was talking about offline towers
turreted carriers have been proposed before and been shot down as an idea namely because at the time dreadnoughts had drone bays now that they do not adding turrets would be an interesting idea however their utility and balancing would be an issue an issue balancing that i am not convinced is worth attempting to fix the parallels to real life are a bit disingenuous as most of the other ship classes and abilities and configurations of ships are not paralleled in rl it is only the ship class names that are drawn from rl in rl and you should wiki this frigates and cruisers sizes and armaments get fuzzy after a while with ships classed as frigates become the sizes of cruisers battlecruisers are the same sizes as other cruisers or even as small as destroyers which can be frigate sized or battlecruiser sized depending on their roles and not their tonnagealso take a quick look at the battleships in game all of them lack the secondary armament that real life battleships had or the tertiary armamentsa quick check of the last of the great battleships would have something like 2x2 main canon groups 4x2 secondary sized cannon groups 24x1 tertiary turret weapons and 5 torpedo tubes  hms agamemnon which would be a fairly big change from the current 68 turret distributionusing the missourri as an analogue to dreadnoughts it has9 UFFFD 16 in 410 mm50 cal mark 7 guns12 UFFFD 5 in 130 mm38 cal mark 12 guns32 UFFFD bgm109 tomahawk cruise missiles16 UFFFD rgm84 harpoon antiship missiles4 UFFFD 20 mm76 cal phalanx ciwsas its armament another far cry from the 3 weapons slots or 2x2 that the nag has the rl analogues that people try to bring up are wrong in terms of armament of ships however roles are fairly universal a pocket carrier of the orca size would not be an amiss addition to the game a 5 fighter ship that cant assign them or triage would be an interesting ship to have on grid of course it does need a better justification the it should be interestingi also do not know how it would fit into the current ships lineup in terms of abilities or utility
they cant orbit you outside the range of your support fleet if they can they are most likely not a threat to your carrierno to capitals ever being viable without subcap support
and you obviously havent participated in capital operations or you would know that fighters cant attack pos due to range issues and that a carrier can instantly recall its drones from across the system pull them and deploy more useful drones for combat because fighters cant hit anything smaller than a cruiser and that carriers are far more useful on field with the other support ships going into triage mode or providing pantheonstyle remote reps with another carrier to the gangfleet

afk cloaking a problem is this a joke how can they bother you if they are afkcan the op please take off the tin foil hat1 if you are worried about the cloaked pilot sitting in your system stay alert2 if the cloaked pilot is indeed away from keyboard than he wont be there to cause problemsan afk tag is stupid idea so is an auto disconnect imo both easily circumvented removing local or something similar is an interesting idea but because i like the idea of people forming their own channels etc the fact is cloaking is not brokenop said because nobody knows if cloaked pilot is afk or not they can terrorize other pilots risk freethe lesson eve is a game where you should be alert 247 not cry because you cant see somebodyon a side note i would love to hear the story behind your hate of cloaked pilots
gathering what intel while afk chat logs why are you all talking in local maybe im wrong but it seems to me that is the only thing an afk cloaked pilot could get in the realm of intel im pretty sure most other types of intel would require him to be at his computer

oh man thats make me mad if i got nerfed neighbor will too just anger talking from you not a logical answer stations and pos means dock and log off or be afk in a safety place so could you tell me what is the meaning of afk cloaking when want to log off in a enemy system is a reason when enemy gank follow you is a reason or do sneaky attack but just make a camp there is not reason see now thats why we think better to do something against afk cloaky faggs and should be better for server also without them
yup they just haters without logical thinking they just affraid they will be lost riskfree afk cloaking at enemy systemthey cant answer logical arguments just lying about afk cloaking

answered read it againno isk no risklying please look up the word before you use itwhy dont you just admit that you didnt even think that cap proposal thoroughly cause you sort of suggested the whole thing as if it was as simple as 123  but now you are saying that its going to require a whole module rebalancing forcing ships to use cap boosters for doing something as simple as warping between systems and possibly have to add new slots etc all to compensate for your simple solution to a nonproblem answer this why do you think that miners should not be terrorized in null sec
stop whining and afk cloakers not just in 00 they can cloak everywhere in afkand other thing no risk equal with no isk really  hey newbee what is the riskisk for afk cloaker in enemy systema ratter have risk when he go to make isk when a cloaker in system but what is the risk for a cloaker who went to afk  nothingso your arguments a big zero and just empty blabla such as the second answer not need any module rebalancing i can use cap booster on any ship maybe you need to learn some skills and brain for good fitting i know this part is the hardest thing for you without it
unfortunately i am having trouble following the arguments of ribikokalikely not her fault but still confusing
as a cloaky f ag do i think that this needs to be balanced yesmy ability to sit in a prime enemy system from uptime to downtime risk free while inflicting economic damage is a bit tilted am i afk and no threat who knows even at work i will rdp into my home box and give local a wave i do that three to four times at work which takes about 1 minute every time i do and for four minutes of work i lock down a system really not all that fair until the mechanic is fixed myself and other cloaky alt will be camping systems while my freighter alt makes me all the isk i need a solution probes that scan down cloaked ships have it triangulate the position of the ship based on how long since they last warped the longer that they have not warped the easier it is to scan down to ensure the security of actual cloaked scouts make it so that the first 10 minutes of non warp activity you cannot be detected after that it becomes incrementally easierthis means i have to warp around at least ever 10 minutes or risk being detected i cannot do this while at work and i would not risk doing so when rl has to take precedence over the game
and that makes bombers and scouting worthless well done
and what happen when cloaker is aligning somewhere  you jumping to his warping point and what will be happen nothing he will be still cloaked and you dont know where is are you need decloaking him but that is impossible without luckthe main problem is not the cloakers thats need for collecting intel or other battletactics when the pilots playing the problem is the riskfree cloaking without play when the pilots not playing this need counter

im not sure if this is truei think if you are in a player corporation and you are war decced by a bigger older corporation some would suggest that you and your corpies could stay station docked or logged off for a week to deny them targets other options include moving to a new region hiring mercenaries or even fighting back if you never leave the npc corporation you are safe from being war decced but you have to pay 11 taxes joining a good player corporation is another option too a good corporation will provide you with ships and training you also have three character slots you could make a different character for each slot and put each one in a different corporation if you wanted to that way if your pvp character was at war you could leave him or her docked up while taking your miner or missioner out for a week or so your option you are safe while docked you can even engage in station trading while docked it doesnt mean you have to be logged out

why should sansha have all the fun of all the other pirate factions i reckon blood raiders come before the rest in using wormholes to raid empire space for juicy blood vessels this should definitely be a reality angel cartel serpentis guristas are just criminal enterprises really although they may make minor incursionsthe raids into empire space i feel should also be deadlier i mean concord ships and the faction navy are unable to stop them so how about disabling concord and the empire navy maybe having sansha npc ships etc blow them up in whatever systems an incursion is taking place or maybe only the sansha incursion hq to make it more resemble low sec add sansha ships to the stargate areas so people dont just idly potter through an incursion as though nothing is happening
sansha have fun being farmed constantlyif ccp can transform incursions into events with uncertain outcomes meaningful consequences where the pirates can actually win and where players can side with the sansha without having to deal with lame game mechanics like concord then we can talk about doing incursions with other pirate factions

excuse me for interrupting the personal attacks but i have a questionare you seriously trying to defend some need for a hostile afk cloak to remain in operation for more than twenty 20 hours to protect an afk pilot in a hostile system shouldnt the real question be how long before we force a disconnectemergency warp on the griefer or should we continue to troll and personally attack the posters bringing up these good ideas lol get serious if you are really on about getting some killmails or some serious intelligence gathering youre going to have to move about anyways lets send a message to the extended afk cloaker  no risk no killmails shouldnt we focus on why anyone needs to cloak for over 4 6 10 14 18 22 hours afk in a hostile system and then ask whether the needs of the one exceed the needs of the many i think i already spotted the one in this topic  does anyone else recognize the troll lol how long do you think should be the extended afki see no reason not to disconnect the cloaky so the isk maker alts can move to another system after a reasonable period of time rather than forcing the isk maker to choose either extreme risk or logoffski to play wow some chars gather isk some chars gather killmails either one is fine why cant we all just get along but just the same as you dont want miners and ratters afk all the time  you shouldnt get cloakers hunting afk all the time keep the pilots active i bet youll get more killmails in the end dont make them log off due to tactics without a counter
where can move when all system is plagued with cloaker alts which is easily can create on account slots and need just few days training easily can put cloaker afk alts to all systemsthats why i wrote need create to cloaking devices with capacitor or fuel useage and cloaker cant do afk cloaking easily 247 times long or afk tag and afk cloaker cant terrorize other active players anymore
yes rib i agree with you except for one small issue that needs some thoughtif cap needs for cov ops cloaking device increases after the extended afk period and this cap drain simply decloaks the ship the poor little cloaky nan would be left out there at risk of being scanned out and killed the point is that we never want cloaked ships to be at risk amirite or wrongso hers a small addition to ribs great idea program the game to recognize the covert ops cloaking device malfunction due to cap drained and cause an emergency warp via a safe disconnection cant ccp set conditions for extended afkincreased cap use by cov ops cloak and decloak result in dc to emergency warp vivi suggested using a report spammerreport extended cloaker grief buttonfeature trigger causing ccp enforcement automatic or gm to disconnect the griefer the dc seemed a bit more humane as its really hard for the average joe to catch a small cov op cloaker after dc into the emergency warp the dc works for either one of these mechanics 1 cap drain or 2 report extended afk grief button includes a dc with emergency warp out using dc the cloaker preserves his current not at any serious risk advantage the dc balances the game by pushing the cloaker out of system for a little bit of time so local traffic can resume until the cloaker returns cloaker still wins but majority still have some small counter measure the dc happens only after the cloaker has full reign of some long and unreasonable period 4 hours for imposing his grief upon all the locals in that system now tell me why this is not better more balanced yes
if you are at the machine you can manage your ship with my idea can use cap booster you can evade from scanners just need to warp to safepoint upload your cap for activating cloaking device and recloak repeat when you are activethe 45 hours long capacitor amount enough for prepare to everything with covert ops if a cloaker go afk longer time than 45 hours he need to undertake the consequences and he will uncloaked and he will scannablewhen you know you need to move away from your pc you can prepare for 45hours long time cloaking but you cant left your ship behind when you move to afk 23 hours long the cloaker have choice to log off when he know he need to move to work 8 hours long time and he wont play and he cant cloaking at enemy system without riskand another important thing cloaker sometimes need to recharge his cap boosters or fuels and they need to move to loading for their cargoholds so they cant sit in a system three months long time without moveyour idea problem is the report to gm they have enough job they cant check everytimes who afk or who notand dont forget they cant respond immediately for player requests
this thread is so full or terrible logic and bad ideas it gives my headache a headache in order for the cap drain idea to work you need to stop cap recharge whilst cloaked which sounds fine until you actually think about it it would mean anyone with a cloak would have serious trouble using the cloak to disengage if they just spent most of their cap using an mwd to escape it also means cloakies cant be cloaked if they want to recharge any cap which for some pass fits takes a very long time indeed to the point where you might as well not have a cloak at all use a cap booster sure if you want to completely ruin your fit it takes a certain type of ship build to field a cap booster and have it actually be useful this would be a massive massive nerf to any ship fielding a cloaknow i want to make it clear that i am not and have never been against some kind of way to lower the effects afk cloakies can have but most of these ideas are terrible and i will continue to argue against these terrible ideas until you lot give up or a good idea actually surfaces from somewhere there is a difference between shooting down terrible terrible gamebreaking ideas and justifying afk cloaking also the whole cloaking is risk free thing is a really daft argument docking up is risk free and you dont need a cloak for that some people might argue that when someone is docked up that at least you know where they are right well if you checked the stations and know theyre not docked up you know theyre in space anyway so i dont see that there is a great deal of difference the risk is still there for people in their home system as well having a hostile only an undock away is something people seem to have a false sense of security aboutin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
please refrain from personal attacks spitfireand you still can use cap boosters for capacitor when you want to use mwd or when you should be need to use capacitor for cloaking devices just you need spend some time to learn to it just ask for us and we show you where you find it and how can you use themand your argument for station its crap the nonnpc stations can occupied those stations need isk for build thats builded for shelter and need isk billions but what need one afk cloaker anyone can camping the station undock point and can waiting to undock any pilots but no one can camping the cloaked afk ships because no one know their positions you feel the differences newbee  who has advantage in his home system the pos is destructible everyone can shot the pos down and can use bubble there for catch logged playerseveryone can find those position toobut how you can find a cloaked player in a huge solarsystemand what is the risk for afk cloaker when hiding somewhere  they dont have riskrepeat  and one thing afk cloakers at enemy systems inflicting economic damage without play and no matter how you try to whining with your alt thats true
i have read in this topic at least 3 perfectly acceptable solutions for better balanced covert ops cloaking devices unkowns 1 whether any council member will take up the banner to ask for better balancecouncil members well know a small minority of the player base likes to grief and some are good at trolling and a lot of large alliances own so much territory they wont be affected by cloakers probably preferring to keep the masses from getting too big ie  big alliances wont want this change as it would help smaller alliances to enjoy their sovereign space in null sec it will take a council member with some courage to get behind this measure 2 whether ccp has the backbone to tweak these devices for better balance it might take some precious time to develop some programming sub routine or whateverthought for the daythe most repeated argument i read in this topic was some crazy thing about no risk no isk the obvious response to that message is that we pay cost to play when mechanics prevent play they are wrong you dont dock in null sec for free but you must pay a lot of isk for sov and docking is a privilege quite simply that is why the cloaker cant dock but the cloaker should also have some costrisk to get his jollies or his killmails  no risk no killmails after all his pvp chars game isnt about making isk its about getting the kills and these different goals makes the sand box more fun all were asking is for a bit of better balance please fix this
there will still be pos defense and i like the gunner mechanic as it stands hopefully they wont be throwing out the good along with the bad
correct thisd be a good feature to incorporate into the replacement code though
if i remember correctly from the csm mins not to long ago they said they are redoing the pos system from the ground up this is a prefect time to have ccp make sure that pos gunners get credit for their hard work everyone else gets credit for their hard work on killmails why not a pos gunner 
so i support the idea of a highsec voting block but i do not support some of the basic tenants that op is lobbying for less greifing  going to have to elaborate on this but in general that is nomore pve content  ok i will support this seems harmlessno power item shop  not sure what this is but i am listentingi am a big highsec trader but i have friends in null so i can say that i represent views from both places my tenant is play balance over special interest groups no stupid play breaking features and more fairness while keeping the sandbox1 for a highsec union lets see how you want to organize this 
i think by power items he means aur for gold ammo and better ships if thats the case then i really dont see why thats a highsec only issue not an all of eve issue same with more pve content really hubs get boring after a while
what about this for a highsec  low sp improvement featurehauling jump clones for cash  i came with this idea a while back it got some positive support but deemed not important enough for the big nullsec alliances  with a tiny tweak to the contract system it can be a fun non boringmission way of starting a career for haulers
in that case yeah i support this too as it is against my fairness ideology that is you should not be able to buy with rm an advantage in the game plex being the only exception and that has natural economic controls
rl carriers only had aa guns 5in guns on a carrier is kind of stupid aircraft do a much better job than small 5in guns modern carriers dont have any guns bigger than 50 cal at least us carriers and are designed to work with smaller ships in its fleet nearby we always had at least 1 destroyer in sight when we were at seaadding guns to carriers in eve seems to be going in the wrong direction prob best to bring more support
well the stupidity of this idea has been adequately pointed out by everyone else so all im gonna say is if you want a ship with guns and drones may i suggest training gallente
not by skills and price the only thing holding amarr industrials back is lack of a higher skill industrial but they have the biggest transports so theres still long term benefit to training amarr industrial try reading before posting next time i actually addressed this in the original posti dont understand why anyone trains anything but minmatar its nice perhaps to throw amarr industrial 1 into the training queue just to get the bestower early on but if you plan on putting any sp into it the wreathe beats the badger and iteron mark ii in overall hauling speed easily and the hoarder can haul as much as a badger mark ii sigil or iteron mark iii and it wont be long before you get that beast mammoth the only reason to train any other industrial path is if you plan to get the iteron mark v or if youre going for transports or freighters no i disagree i think amarr and caldari have royally screwed industrial options while gallente and minmatar have a vastly superior sethowabout this make cruiser cargoholds approx 600m3 battlecruisers 800m3 and battleships about 1500m3 lots more space for ammo loot capacitor booster charges anchorable bubbles with a significant difference between cargohold sizes in different size combat ships it adds a lot more tactical optionsfor instance why is it fair for a capacitor booster battleship to only carry 50 more charges than a capacitor booster destroyer when the battleship uses a much larger booster it is possible for a destroyer to tank the same heavy damage income for a longer period of time simply because its smaller size allows it to avoid most of the damage and it can run its capacitor or ancillary shield booster for many more cycles before running short on chargesanother tactical consideration would be the size of an anchorable interdiction bubble the sizes on them could be changed along with cargohold sizes as a matter of fact but there could be a clear distinction frigates can only carry small bubbles cruisers cant carry above medium with cargohold sizes all so similar theres not so much difference in whos able to carry what bubbleand lastly what about bringing extra ammo to a fight battleships cant last as long in a fight because they can only fill their cargohold with a few hours of ammo destroyers on the other hand can hold literally days worth of ammo i think it would be nice if battleships could carry enough ammo for a nice long pos bash or whatever else you do with a battleship maybe a long trip away from a supply run and also have enough room left over to carry some loot a small or medium bubble and maybe even some medium ammo for the buddies guarding you in their battlecruisers it would make battleships more than just a slow battlecruiser with more hit pointsyou might be asking why cant we just do that now ill show you imagine an armageddon with all 8 low slots filled with tech ii cargo expanders and 3 tech i cargo rigs with a base cargohold size of 1500m3 and no stacking penalty that ship could hold 1593185m3 thats as much as a medium industrial but it is far more durable and can fire weapons sure its slower to align and has a much higher cost but it just has too many tactical options at its disposaldrone bay xl shield boostersextenders turrets neuts energy transfersin short its not an industrial and it shouldnt be able to fill that role particularly wellbut with a base cargohold of 1500m3 and a stacking penalty on the cargo mods it wouldnt reach much over 3000m3 in fact the increase per cargohold expander could even be increased to make the max boost more like 150 rather than 110ish but thats all for the testing department to figure out not me
i think that is some serious changes that would throw off the balance of a lot of ships a bs with 1500m3 means that nobody in the right mind would even bother using indies when a bs can do the job of hauling and mining better
do you even play eve do you know the differences between an industrial and a battleship or even how much industrials carry because if you did you wouldnt be saying that
more to the point cargo space is a non trivial attribue for pvp ship because of cap boostersanyway if someone wants to spend 20x as much as a normal t1 hauler on a cargogeddon more power to them
so how long did it take you to degenerate into unbased ad homonim attacks mature 1500 is pretty close to indie base cargo sizes people already use battleships as mining vessels as alternatives to barges as they have more tank so you just upd the base cargo of a bs from 400600m3 to 1500 and you dont see any play balancing issues to consider
there is a lot of space for an additional info in skill descriptionso maybe is good to add info about what this skill enablesfor exampleminmatar frigateskill at operating minmatar frigateslevel i allows you to fly reaperlevel ii allows you to fly burst probe slasher vigillevel iii allows you to fly rifterlevel v allows you to train for an advanced frigates such as covert ops assault ships electronic atack ships and interceptorssame with the modulesships are clickable ship classes are evelopedia linksit will bring more clarity to new players why theyre might want to train another level
teiricide is removing all that stuff anyway when theyre done every ship will require just the level 1 skilleditalso this isnt truelevel 5 allows access to that races tech 2 ships if you have the t2 skill associated with them you dont want someone training min frig 5 and then wondering why they cant fly a wolf
i have also read that some people are concerned that it may be next to impossible to see where a ship is headed when it warps a visual effect which shows intense light trails spewing out of the ships engines which lingers for a few seconds similar to how the light from an activated stargate works would fix this problemif something like this were to be implemented i can imagine that it would turn huge fleet warfare into an epileptic nightmare so i think players should have the option to disable it if they so desire
i like the idea of a visual warning that a player is about to run awayhes spooling up his warp drives i want that ship locked down now
supported this issue needs to be addressed
i do hope it was not intentional if it was it shows a massive lack of understanding of the player base in evejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
the problem with cloaks using cap specifically cov opsit either uses less cap than the cap recharge in which case it is pointless or it uses more and cov ops become uselessscouting for targets andor other things a cov ops can warp to several belts gates planets and moons in a short period of time if the cap use is enough to have an effect on inactive players then it would make active use of the cov ops impossibleso cap use for cloaks to combat afk cloakers will always hurt active players more this makes it a bad ideaat least fuel hurts them both equally and is still a bad ideathe only idea of anti afk cloaking that i could get behind woudl be something like the followinguse of cloak over time through a currently non existent mechanic adds to the heat build up of the ship since in the rw a cloak would have to mask heat after a significant amount of time between a couple hours and more than a couple hours the ship would have an effective signature of something like a pod would come up as unknown in a probe scan and be hard to probe down it would take about 1216 hours of constant cloak for the ship to be probable to the point of warping to vent this heat only takes a few seconds of decloak during which the sig of the ship is that of a few classes higher frig  bcbswith something like this an active player could manage and an inactive one could still do their thing just with some risk not a lot because it would invariably hurt active players more but enough to be non zeroanything that has more negatives than this would imo be to harsh on those who are at their computers but this is just my opinion and i certainly do not speak for the cloaking community if such even exists
i agree with you completely
oh wow i forgot about this threadmake cloaks consume the tears of people who are terrified by players who arent even at the computer thatll fix everything  as would removing local from nullsec
a few thingsas far as not listening to me that is your loss i live in wormhole space and manage just fine you seem to be having troubles though why not listen to someone who has experience in situations where cloakies are an even bigger threat and is successful dont you want helpyou claim that your systems have been plagued with afk cloakers that prevented you from doing pve but surely if theyre afk you can pve until your hearts content and if you get hot dropped then they werent afk to begin with so which is italso the suggestion that they are violating the eula and that you should have a button that logs them out i have to admit that is one of the funniest things ive read good on you pal 1 for the lols had by all
bad argumentswhat about with ships which use mwd and need capacitor for guns they can use cap booster for capacitor upload  yes they canand other thing i didnt talk about short period of cloaking 45hours long timeuse mwd if you need there no cloak cap consume without cloak upload your cap with cap booster and use cloak and you can cloak 45hours long but you cant move to 24 hours long time afk very simple
you have choice to move wh thx byeremove local just make a big laggenerator because scanner spamming and every player on server must be spamming scanner button
you dont understandif cap usage is less than the recharge of the shipafk cloakers are not hampered at all so no pointhowever if cap usage is greater than the recharge of the ship even if alone it could last for 5 or so hours it make cov ops cloaks 100 uselessa person could cap out after 2 or 3 long warps happens frequently during scouting and exploration it makes scouting impossible it makes 3 classes of ships uselessthe whole point of a cov ops cloak is so that warping while cloaked is possible allowing someone to scout or sneak up on prey undetectedrequiring cap boosters in order to do that removes the whole point of the ships and their cloaks existence
he can use cap boosters he can use rigs and coovops have very long warp speed can warp 200au with just half cap useage and dont forget the original suggests just i said its time to create something what is should be change this bad game mechanic where a cloaker can hide in enemy system and can went out from his pc 23 hours time long without riskneed solution for handling this capacitor useage for cloak or fuel usage counter ship seek and destroy or afk tagif you want to evade with cap useage just change to fuel useage
silly question but what does the high sec vote feel about t3s in high id like to think that under your no griefing clause the uber rich are griefing the poor by flaunting their billion dollar ships and running high sec sites it is clear that t3s should be relegated to low and null like caps
for one sansha back story works well for incursion story line given sanshas had there own empire space blood raiders one dont have no were close the number sansha have or the tech to back a fleet any were close to what the sansha had and havethe first sansha war took all 4 empires to take down sansha that how big they were and are might yet again have reached that size given they have been in hiding for a long time in jove space yes yes in jove space gm posted a pic of a sansha fleet around a jove stationin short blood raider dont have the man power or the tech to pull it off the angel cartel is alot larger then the blood raiders in terms of ships and pilots angels serpenits and the guristas if they wish could alone crush the blood raiders without much of though to do itUFFFD
you forget there a story that go with incursions does any one read the eve storys that are posted other then me the other priate faction yes are big but are no real problem for the empires to handle sanshas on the other hand are way diffent in level of tect used for the most part there npc pilots are skiledl and are pod pilots like player toons  when one shots you it hurt like a player just shot you all the other pirate factions like navy factions dont use pod tect that sansha pilot have no real contral of there actions there porgramed with mind contral implants were the others have free will btw tell a angel cartel member i want to stick this mind contral implant in your head and watch want happen given most are minmatarUFFFD
how about a 60 second cooldown before attempting a redock
terrible ideathe current system where a player can undock and redock without being targetable allows solo players to know what is outside the station without automatically sacrificing their ship i think that mechanic should remain in placewhat i dont like is the ability to undock tank damage for a while and then redock with no consequences if you allow yourself to be engaged in combat on top of the station you should be committed to the fight the only thing that should keep you from docking is directly taking damage
if you allow yourself to be engaged in combat on top of the station you should be committed to the fightthe station undock invulnerability timer has a lot ot do with lag not everyone loads the space environment at the same rate and there have definitely been times where ive finally loaded the space environment and found myself some 40km off station while that hasnt happened in a long time its still there for the protection of people that are slower to load space then theres the premise that getting shot should engage you in an aggro timer on the station the balance should always be weighted in favor of the passive defender as soon as they agress back then the timers should come into play the only thing that should keep you from docking is directly taking damagewhat is this stupidity or did you mean deal damage as it is now
after some thought my personal view of it allonce you get the aggression timer the one that prevents you from docking you should not be able to dock until 1 minute after you stop taking damagehowever my opinion is skewed as i fight to the death unless previously agreed otherwise
there was a huge thread about this in the test server feedback subforum and the general response both from ccp and csm was that they fully supported the changes after quite a bit of bickering between players ccpcsm just fuckin vanished apart from the occasional troll response that benefited absolutely nothing to the discussion no feedback presented from the opposite spectrum those of us who were against the changes was taken in account regarded with any actual propriety and  as stated before  eventually was just entirely ignoredthey know about what theyre doing csm supports it at least the majority of them do and ccp adhered to the majority the majority in this case being a few giant 00 alliances who all bitched in unison my main argument was that these changes absolutely should not have been implemented on such short notice just three weeks after the new war dec system was put in place and all of a sudden we went back and changed everything because of a few threadnaughts it took them years to fix hybrid turrets after numerous nerfs to gallente drone nerf sensor dampener nerf etc what amazes me even further is that they suddenly went all pr on everyone who was against the changes saying to drop the tinfoil hattery and to loosen up on the conspiracy theories to which i say in gross sarcasm its not like a ccp dev abused their powers and gave a large alliance something lmfaomy point is these changes made defenders excruciatingly expensive to get enough allies to join in on the war you have to pay billions of isk every two weeks in order to make a significant impact on a larger foe and that larger foe will never have to pay more than half a billion im waiting for the abuse of this game mechanic to flourish and bring back the inevitable ideal of welp we cant win time to remake the corporation to which id imagine anyone who ever supported the changes will simply smile and say thats just the way the game worksin short csm isnt listening at best theyll probably make an underhanded comment on how your delusional see test server feedback ccp fully supports the changes because duh they implemented them if they delete my post youll know that i was right
they wont delete the post that is tinfoil hatting but its likely true that they dont care as much about individual highsec bear whiners because lets face it big alliances hold real power they hold the power of having hundreds or thousands of players willing to do their bidding fact of life is if you want to be heard you will need power too i heard there is a highsec union or something that you can join ccp only hears your votes and if you cant organize enough highsec people to support your cause then really why do you deserve to be treated as equals with the big alliances
i considered the balancing issues and offered an explanation as to why i think the change in balance is actually for the better you ignored almost everything i said and apparently made up some things in your own mind that you think i meant which im still not sure about youre saying that 1500m3 is close to industrial cargohold size by base value perhaps it is though id rather say its a good medium between the smallest industrial and a standard battleship but that is completely beside the point i addressed the current maximums and adjustments for having a stacking penalty on cargo expanders vs not having one my proposal actually reduces the ability to use battleships as cargo ships even though it increases the base cargohold sizetldrif youre not going to bother reading my posts you should neither be trashtalking them nor expecting me to write out lengthy replies addressing your inability to read what i said i made no adhominem attack on you what i said was completely justifiededitperhaps i should clarify if you played eve and knew the differences between an industrial and battleship and you had read my post then you wouldnt have said that
now that ccp has delivered the skins what else is lacking ship painting purchase costum decalsnew turretsmodules that show up graphically i just gotta ask cause im seeing that the new skins and ships will be around for quite a while id guess as long as the previos skins did thus im looking at things as they are as goign to be around for at least 5 yearsso what else is coming d
given all the talk theres been about major pos revisions lately i expect well see new pos and station artwork in the near future
there will be some things in the minutes that touch upon your questionsr
well tell everyone to hurry up and finish the minutespersonally i hope those ship skins the various faction ones come with a standings requirement to use by players
the way its said did say that it allows you to train for advanced frigs there are still the prereq tab to tell you what needs to be trained as welli like the idea of clarity as some descriptions lead to more questions than answers
nothing like taking a minor break from eve only to come back to several people liking the bouncing boobs
once there was a minmatar assault cruiser that plied the space lanes wreaking havoc on the unsuspectingthis ship was terrifying to behold much like a frillnecked lizard unfortunately this ship has been defrilled circumcised some might saybring back the frill of the vagabond
oh dear god no it looks so much better nowidea opposedin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
like a clean circumcision its like a junkyard thorax barely more than a stabber or sfi the flared frill which would shock enemies providing the vagabond pilot with an additional moment to strike was the signature of the vagabond it should be brought back moreso than the flashing red lights of the navy comet
the frill is more than a simple design change or upgrade or v3 decision based on server load lag or any other comprehensible reason it is simply change for change sake and there was no reason to remove the one distinguishing feature of the vagabond it doesnt serve to distinguish it from its variants in fact it serves to make it look just like its variantsthe vagabond needs to have its manhood restored whatever the reason for the change nice try and all but wed prefer to have it back why remove something so especially unique to eve one of the most easily recognized and distinctive ships in all of new edenthe frill is gone benefit concertwhy you should care about the vagabond
bring back the frill that is all
i support the return of the frill
i am bucky ohair and i approve this proposal
thisnot only that why did the faction battle ship lose there distictive heat sinkssailsnow everything looks the same w diffrent colorsboo erns
1 never flown a vaga but t2s should look different the frill is gone why
i want my frill back
this sounds reasonable supported

after six years of playing this game i still have yet to be ganked by an afk cloaker i dont know why anyone considers cloaked afk ships a threat given that cloaked ships cant actually hurt you and being afk would also make it impossible for that pilot to hurt you
theres a certain type of insane paranoid carebear who work themselves up into hysterics over a random extra pilot in local and will spend years on the forums voicing how terrified they are and how outraged they are that ccp doesnt allow them zerorisk 00 pve rib you chose to go to 00 so bloody deal with it or sod off back to hisec and shut up you are not entitled to absolute safety in any part of eve especially nullsec if you dont like the nature of eve it then unsub and go play hello kitty online
everyone knows why would be disturb the afk tag some cloaky fags who lying in this topic im afk at enemy systems and i cant kill anyone when im afk because they would be lost the chances to terrorizing active players in afkafk cloakers at enemy systems inflicting economic damage without playthis the afk cloaking just evasion and lyingwe want to catch coward cloakers want to counter against them now they can cloaking everywhere in afk riskfree and inflicting economic damage without play thats unacceptable
afk cloakers in a nutshellthats about it what they can do when afk
you are all just feeding ribs insanity there is no reasoning as he doesnt think logically just ignore him and link my post of why fundamentally asking for a counter to cloakers is fundamentally flawed
i find it greatly amusing he keeps talking about how players who arent at the computer are inflicting serious economic damage on him for the thousandth time rib how does an afk player prevent you making isk just go ahead and mineratwhatever theyre afk so cantwont do anything im only trying to help
trolls detected but why troll on poor rib his first language probably isnt english but hes done a pretty good job explaining what you already know about use of the covert ops cloaking device in a hostile system for an extended period of time you remember we already agreed the extended afk cloak has the following effects aka grief1 it always causes the local system count and activity to become reduced2 players either log off to go play another game or if lucky find some friendly escort to leavemove system3 players without an escort or who have a lot of their pve assets stuck in that system occasionally stay docked and whine in local offering goodfights cursing posting sad links etc trying to get the afk cloaker to leave but hes not at his keys to respond anyways until they realize he is afk andor isnt leaving and then they log off thinking they are unfairly prevented from playing  particularly the pve4 some players undock after a few hours and leave solo with minimal gear others undock and start doing pve or transport duties assuming the cloaker is afk he probably is afk and they are okay for a little while but after a few hours the local blues who ignore the cloaky red in local usually end up on the wrong side of a kill mail yep the afk dude came back whether he comes back or not thats always the psychological threat which causes the system to empty and play to stopin other words a some players get upset and whine b some players just log out upset or not they are off to find something more fun to do andor c players ignore the cloaker and lose a pve ship either to the cloaker or his hot dropper friends so of course there are economic consequences this is often called griefing the system when its done 247 a few years ago players would actually undock and try to hunt the cloakers or to try and bait them but this has proven to be a terrible waste of time there is currently just no countermeasure while the cov ops cloak is turned on keep saying the cloaker isnt doing anythihng its funny the cloaker is playing a psychological warfare stunt see cause and effect above his goals are to grief the system andor get his buddies or himself onto some killmails with little or no risk naturally hes going to object to adding a bit more balance to the cov ops cloaking device the trolls dont want to lose their advantage to shut down a null sec system particularly the system that a small alliance has paid billions of isk to conquer purchase the claim unitsihubs and work hard to get rights to buy and install the ihub upgrades its not cheap is it you dont have to admit this causes economic damage the effects of unlimited extended afk cloaks are obviousrib isnt saying to eliminate the tactic hes just asking for some balance against the extended afknext troll
soomer the fact that you seemed to forget that the whole counter arguement agrees with your points but the point is this denial of space is the whole purpose of covert ops or did you not read my post keep the troll comments to those who dont seem to read
this would be a great idea if done
this idea has my support an interesting little tweak seems to be the only thing required
t3s arent the only billion isk ships though if you ban those what about marauders or faction battleships or freighters should all those be banned from highsec as well and if so what about blinged out regular bs or officer fit rifters
great post  just to confirm tho no i do not believe everything should be 100 safe in hisec  again i dont know what the right solution is but i feel its a very big problem that newer players are in fact encouraged by game mechanics to log out assuming they dont hang out in npc corps or join large power blobs but who would want to do that sure they can create alts tho they wont have any skills usually station camp etc  but from my experience a huge number of them simply logout instead since wardeccers can simply dock up at will there is no real way to combat them and no way to win a war since wardeccers dont have to risk any assets such as poss etc and engaging them on any level simply encourages them to wardec you more so best option logically is unfortunately logout
no offense  but developers listening to players like you are the reason so many other mmos have died eve has been around for over 9 years and is still going strongmany players think they want easy no risk gameplay but once they get it they quickly become bored and quit it is the high risk and steep learning curve that has made eve so popular and given it its longevity your best option as a new player is not to log off but to learn how the game mechanics work and learn to use them to your advantage that is where the challenge comes in if they turn the game into something that is a cake walk for new players than the experienced players will get bored way to easy and then the game will dieevery mmo that has catered to making the new players feel welcome has failed as the callenge of the game becomes to short lived and gets boringlook at swg for example it was a great game with great potential but the learning curve was steep and new players had to work hard to get a foothold it took lots of time and work to become a jedi which you could lose if you where not careful overall a great game but they gave into the new players complaining on the forums and dumbed the game down which resulted in a very rapid decline and slow painful deaththe harder a game is to master and reach end game the more players it will draw many may complain about difficult game mechanics but they will stay for the challenge at least most will as far as pvp goes no current mmo has as steep of a death penalty as eve if you die you lose your ship that can be a simple pvp frigate or a titan but you still lose it yet eve has continued to be a successful pvp mmo while many many other mmos with no pvp death penalty have died off after a very short amount of timeeven look at the new star wars the old republic it was one of the most anticipated games of the last 5 years yet it was designed for new players and held very little challenge i played the beta for 6 months and never even bought the game as i was so disappointed in it within a few weeks you could be at end game only a few months you could experience all it had to offer what a disappointment is this what you want eve to become
you know i dont know if i can support a group that doesnt want to purge high sec of a type of ship that needs to be put at risk and destroyed they arent meant for use there and should be removed
a new hybrid carrier would be cool if done right say 810 large turrent slotsno capital turrets combined with a decent drone bay maybe allow it to field up to 20 drones but regular drones only no fighters or fighter bombersno siege or triage just a standard capital class tank one of these would have tank and dps equal to 34 battleships but be very weak against other capitalsknida like a mutipupose ships for real diversity allow it to equip stripminers
with the coming rework of poses id like to propose that ccp also include the ability to make mobile labs available to all rather than simply to members of your alliance in addition to this i would like to propose that they close all npc science slots copying invention material research and time efficiency research and allow a playerdriven research economy to develop
i agree this would be helpful
supported
hii hope im posting this into the right placei heard from lots of people that running missions in 00 is quite boring because there are only a few missions that pirate agents give to players 1015i have to agree with thatwhy there arent more missions we can do for pirate agentsin empire you can get plenty of missions from empire faction agentsi know it is maybe more diffcult to create pirate missions because of the story background etc but hey i think lots of players would like that not i would really appreciate a devs toughts too on this onethanks
im in a nullsec alliance these changes barely even affect me as a player but i still advocate against them because theyre absolutely ridiculous its rather embarrassing that 4 of the playerbase is somehow considered the majority of the community
and you need to read the inferno 10 wardec mechanics devblog and stop lying
to paraphrase soundwave war isnt fair so if u wanna scratch my goon buddies thatll be three hundred thousand dollars tyat the very  least the rising costs for allies needs to be capped so bringing in allies after x corps only sticks on a flat but considerable isk cost per new ally
yanno what to hell with it tonight when i get off work im going to start shooting at the freaking monument in jitashouldnt have to do it to get the point across but what the hell noones going to listen otherwise
are you one of those hisec twerps who sees imaginary goons in every corner he provided a valid explanation regarding the abilities of the minmatar ships and you start blabbering on about goons
i just want to point out that the mining rokh would be better then every mining ship but the hulk if the cargo changes size13 the cost of a hulk and 10x the tank what a fun way to unbalance other parts of the game
this might be a small issue but i has bothered the hell out of me for a while nowwhy are the armor repairer and remote armor repairer pictures the same thing i mean this is not an issue when it comes to the tech 1 and tech 2 modules that say large armor repairer or large remote armor repairer but when it comes to the meta modules most of the time i cannot tell the difference unless i show info and either read the description or look at the variations tab and i figured this shouldnt be an issue seeing as when ti comes to shield booster vs shield transporter they have different pictures so why cant the armor counterparts get different pictures even if its as simple as adding the arrows from the shield transporter picture to the armor repper picture so that it indicates its a remote armor moduleam i alone in feeling this or has this bothered any one else i mean its a simple picture icon that im sure wont take too long to make and install can we please discuss this and possibly work towards fixing itlord rectanus
back to the front  lets not let this if i may say so great idea idle 
doesnt fix lp stores but its still a good idea
come on folks lets keep it goingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
1 if i lived in high sec id certainly get one much needed ship
believably bobbling bosoms better bounceless boobs by bounds
what he saidim not sure how this will work in game unless we get armor with extra bounce in dust but i support it none the less on principlemaybe our char icons could be animated gifs that bring the milk shake to the game
ccp i want my vaga wings back plus an apology or else
the frill made the vagabond model one of the niftiest around i am sad 
speaking as one who has faced and always respected the vaga but never flown one although i can aside from its capabilities the thing that always distinguished the ship was the aggressive appearance given it by its frill i see nothing to recommend this change positively only the ability to tick off more users 1 to the proposal to bring the frill back and 1 to the request for an explanation from the responsible partyparties
i have never had a vaga because i cant afford one nor fly it but its a shame to see it loosing its frill t2 should look more different that their t1 versions rather than just having another skinthe curse also lost its antennas UFE0FUFE0FedU00A0U00BDedU00B2U009BedU00A0U00BDedU00B2U009AedU00A0U00BDedU00B2edU00A0U00BDedU00B2U009C

disgruntled capsuleers have previously had some success making their point through ingame actions most notably during last summers uprising which resulted in the destruction of the jita memorial monumentshooting a static structure is so last year but a similar event would have the advantage of showing numbers being something active and positive and it would also be a talking pointso how about a protest marchthukk you frill me  the march against the vagabond revisioniststhe corporation responsible for the production of the vagabond is thukker mix and their hq is listed as the thukker mix factory in the nullsec system of mmd3bhow about we organise a stabbervagabond gathering one weekend when the entire fleet will muster at the jita monument but will then take a leisurely protest tour of the major trade hubs before heading out through low and null to suicide gank the thukker mix hqthis will have the following benefits it will be an entertaining event numbers providing it will be high profile screenshots could highlight the lack of visual difference between the models the highsec portion of the march will be very visible to other players the lownull section will result in lots of explosions one way or another any takers for a bit of friendly civil disobedienceedit okay hows sunday july 15th sound ill start a new thread but in the meantime check out the plans here
bring back the frill
bring back the frill
tbh i didnt even notice something missing but now im all like bring it back
sounds fun i hate the new change to the vagabond 
1 bring the frill back2 great idea stan im game3 no really bring the frill back
leave it gone the ears were silly 
would you tell a dilophosaurus albeit the jurassic park version that its frill was sillynot while it was eating your face you wouldnt p
i love new vaga look  its awesome  maybe you should just add some more t2 details thats all but not freaking frill hated that thing was silly  d
the ears is what makes a boring ol stabber hull into a predatorccp bring back the frill
this is the minmatar nerf that nobody asked fori cant get uncircumcised in real life but maybe my vaga can
thank  god someone cares about this disaster as much as i dothis was a complete failure on the part of the ccp ship designers taking a legendary ships like the vagabond and making them look like regular production ship so they can make their work on the ship skins easier to give us  hello kittie graphics then sticking some lame ass solarpanel on the side with a few lights to make us feel ok with their changeswhat are we idiots or noobs who dont know any better or give a along with the tragic changes to the vagabond they have in my opinion destroyed the beauty of the faction ships such as the tempest fleet issue by removing its iconic rectangular fins and other parts of the model and the typhoon fleet issue by removing its mast scaffolding and fuzzy antennas not to mention their earlier changes to all turrets which removed all the awesome tech 2 lights leaving all turrets looking like the tech 1 variants and while im at it they have over scaled the projectile turrets and made the architecture look clumsy and senselessccp seems to have taken on a new game model and that is to make everything in eve as simple and reproducible as possible to create an environment within the design departments of ccp that produces faster and cheaper which is destroying the original creative works that have made eve a uniquely beautiful and amazing experiencei am really into the way my ships look and work as well as fly and fight and that is why i have stripped my multibillion isk tempest fleet issue and typhoon fleet issue and placed them on the marker and will be doing the same to all my vagabonds very sooni once was a very proud minmatar pilot and now i wish i was amarrian
the frill was silly but it was a distinguishing characteristic for the beloved vagabond but perhaps something else could be added in lieu of full frill restoration calling ccp artists and also all those guys who did really cool ships designs for the ship design contesthow about a contest to see what can be added aesthetically to the vagabond to set it apart something not frilly but more badassi love the vaga but tbh im more often found in stabber fleet issues nowadays as they fit into medium plexes and are a lot cheaperthe dragon knight treasures the state friendship duty promises kindness vengeance honor and righteousness more than his own life  the way of the dragon warrior random posts from auga
i miss the frill bring it back

sad panda wishes frill to be returni dont care if the vaga cant fit into a medium complex how can the vaga truly fly without its wingswithout the frill its just a circumcised stabber fleet issue that still cant fit into medium complex silly or not i want my distinguishing feature back

i support this and ive never ever even flown a stabber in my eve lifehell this just made me write my first post here on the forumscount me in on the event stan is planning
i support this please also bring back huginns green engine trails
great explanation
reread your last line rib is asking for the game to be balanced against players who arent even playing that is simply dumb sorry an afk cloaker does not inflict economic damage on anyone they inflict it on themselves by weighing the risk vs reward and making their choice you have no right to whine or change game mechanics because you chose to not make isk as far as using cloaked ships as a psychological warfare stunt to scare the babies into choosing again i must stress the fact that it is a choice to not make isk is a valid gameplay mechanic in fact its the kind of mechanic that makes eve so bloody brilliantthe fact of the matter is that eve is a sandbox with other people you have to deal with the sandbox youre in  if you weigh the risk vs reward and decide to not risk it then good on you thats a valid choice thats the playstyle that suits you making that choice is not being griefed it is simply the nature of eve you make choices based on what you value or desire screaming for it to be changed and claiming that anything you dont like is personal harassmentgriefing is just stupid if you do that then youre playing the wrong game

yea and you were banging on about some plex crap and about not spending real money on buying into ships you cant pilotso what about the people who dont have money to throw away who just run the one account who take their little mining frig out the tutes and spend hours working damn hard to build up the guys who maybe just want to play pretty casually in their spare time and enjoy the nicer side of the community the ones who manage to work up to their mining cruiser ore maybe the basic ore barge only to have it all ripped away from them by some gutless pathetic little skilless sht who probably has to much money to waste both in and out of game i mean really are we that lacking in morality and if nothing else self respect that picking on the defenseless little guy and acting like that makes you tough and shows any skill what so ever is acceptablehopefully despite all the crying done by the pvpers who will fight this all the way in defense of getting their own selfish pathetic kicks ccp is listening and as mentioned will hopefully bring improvements with the winter update the proposed ore mining frig concept looks awesome and the changes suggested to me look promising  they seem at least to be one step in the right directionid also like to add i do know there are proper pvpers out there the ones who know how to play an mmo who have the knowledge to work in a team or the skill to even go solo against ships that actually come some where near matching them and are in areas they can expect combati think just simply remembering that you cant just freely engage in combat in high sec is the biggest indicator that this type of ganking is wrong
ill simply ask of this how will these high sec players ever get to more lucrative low sec areas where they would fully expect to be targeted and so accept then if they were popped and but also be prepared to counter and or defend if they are for ever getting ganked and losing all in what i suppose we could term the nursery of eveplayers need some where to grow an learn the ropes to enable them to move on and dont forget that some times even the immune system gets it wrong it actually harms the body thats called an allergic reactionmaybe if there are not enough players in low sec areas to keep the gankers occupied its because they are preventing other players from ever managing to get there
a i didnt ask for risk free  i simply pointed out that currently the mechanics encourage newer players to log out rather than playing in the face of nowin nogain situationsb it doesnt really matter how easy hisec gets im not advocating making it easy but for those that somehow think abusing players is fun by subjecting them to incomprehensible uis etc remember that there will always be nullsec and losec to provide increased challenge  they are there just waiting for someone anyone actually to go and experience all the joy that they provide c please stop thinking that eve is somehow immune to competition from other games  its not even hard to think of other games close to the same age age with millions of players instead of eves paltry by comparison subscription base yet eve is a much better game graphics mechanics etc  so maybe we should be thinking about whats holding it back d to often it seems the real end game of eve is all just a bunch of bored bitter vets moving back to hisec so they can get easy kills  why should new players subject themselves to the abuse exactly as i mentioned im sick of watching new players quit right and left as a result of such interactions  the bitter vets get their jollies but nobody wins in the end 
say what you will but the harder a game is to learn and master no more sense of reward you get from suceeding while playing that game with regards to many other games out there with millions of subscribers i have played most of them and although one of the big problems is their player base is spread over several servers i have yet to play one where you can regularly expect over 40000 players logged in at the same time to the same game world i apologize if i came across as a little arrogant but this is a sore subject for me i watched the last several mmos i have played be slowly ruined by the developers on the guise of making them more noob friendly and easier to learn dozens of games i have played in the last 5 years and it has ended badly for all of themi think the biggest advantage eve has over most other mmos is the true open sand box there is no max level or final endgame where you have basically finished the game true once you have gotten into a titan and learned how to actually use it well there is little left grow as a pilot but oyu could lose that titan that took months to get in minutes you can always continue to grow you character in skills and wealth with no max level as it stands now it would take over 20 years to max out all the skills in game and the game is only 9 years old so even the vets here since beta have only maxed maybe half the skills not that most players would have need of every skill but it is still much better than other games where once you hit max level there is nothing you can do to make your character better aside from grinding for the best gear that get boring long before 9 yearswow boasts that they have hit over 8 million subscribers yet logging into that game it feels as though it is dieing and nobody cares if you bother to log onto one of the higher population servers it is 10 times worse of a gankfest than eve ever could beeven everquest and everquest ii are only shadows of what they once were games that were at one time thriving now you hardly pass another player when traveling down the street of areas that used to be crowded
supported but in high sec a war dec should be required in low nothing should be needed just drop modal and sit out timer and in null sov can defend against this
i think everyone but total crybaby carebears can agree that eve is supposed to be a dangerous place part of that is because destruction is a key part of the economy you would all agree with this rightanother part of the game is that risk a part of which is initial investment should equal reward thats a fair assessment isnt it unfortunately one of the most expensive and most useful ships in the game the t3 strategic cruiser isnt getting destroyed enough in high sec they can do their job too fast too well and with no risk they are hard to pin down and hard to gank maybe someone has hard numbers but if you wanted to suicide gank a tengu in high how hard is it it isnt as easy as it needs to be i can tell you that much so they can run missions and sites in relative safety acting as a part of the isk faucet that is bad enough as it is the risks dont equal the rewards and both are lower than they should beits time something is done about this isk faucetits good for the games economy if t3s were moved to low and null its good for the new players they can have early successes that make them want to move on to low and null its good for the wh players as there will be more demand for wh goods its good for the t3 players they can do better than high even if they lose the occasional ship theyd still be making more in the long run and providing more high end stuff for the rest of us to buy its also be good for low and null as itd bring more players into those areas that means more potential players in the csms corps or making things interesting for the current null residents maybe the t3 players will eventually band together and try to set up their own small block camaraderie and shared experiences are good for a corp and the gameas i see it restricting t3s to low and null is the best thing for everyone and it should be done its the obvious and common sense thing to do i really hope the csm will bring this to ccps attention
yes this totally wouldnt be monstrously overpowered vs subcapitals edit oh and completely break the game principle of capfleets needing subcap supportno just nojust get a dominix big drone bay has guns sorted
rokhs mine about the same speed as the current retriever and will mine less than retriever when the update comes out its already hard enough just to fit 1 minute of mining in the rokh i see no reason why it shouldnt be able to fit 36 minutes worth its not ideal as a mining ship but it works pretty well considering there are currently no tanky miners but when the new procurer comes out i have a feeling itll mine at about the same speed as the rokh while having a much larger ore hold than 1500m3 and itll have about the same ehp more perhaps since its designed to have a mining fit while the rokh runs out of cpu just putting the lasers ontldrat current rokh with 1500m3 cargohold would increase a little bit in popularity as a miner but would still be generally unpopularwith new barge updates rokh with 1500m3 cargohold would be indistinguishable from the current rokh in mining capabilities and nobody would ever mine in it for anything other than a joke13 the cost 10x the tank half the mining output relevanceits not like you guys are posting in assembly hall or anything but could you at least try to think before you talk
nine years have past since eve online first originated and just my opinion here the overview is becoming a bit archaic  dont kill me yet let me explain the overview is useful in fact its the single most useful interface in eve online however all of that information all pooled into one readout is just added to the dreaded screen clutter neocom on the left controls on the bottom information on the topleft and overview on the right pretty soon all of the graphics updates were getting arent going to be visible thereby heres a compiled list of ideas and suggestions both old and newbefore we go on i would like to make it very clear that all of these things should be optional and not forced like that pesky unified inventory debacle1 holographic overlay gui  we see it in the trailers we heard that we might be getting it at fanfest like so many other things in the past so what is it that we honestly need to see on the overlay that will be functional clear up the current ui clutter and look nice 1a things you normally see on the overview like ship name pilot name ship class alliance etc now obviously we dont want to take any of these things away from the overview but it should be optimized so that this information can be received on the fly just by clicking on them in said overview without having to sort through a bunch of tabs a handy bright and shiny display box that points toward the ship youve selected that displays all of this information to streamline things 1b some other information and this is purely up for debate as some may view it overpowered are more helpful things like showing armaments shieldarmorhull percentages and transversal velocity we dont want to show the armaments right down to the metalevel but with unique turretmissile renders we can identify these things by memory so simply showing heavy neutron blaster note that it does not show techmeta level it makes it a bit easier to get an idea of what theyre fielding on the fly transversal velocity is already available in the overview but it couldnt hurt to show it here either 1c further information beyond the scope of what is provided things like colorcoding the display itself based on standings you select a target it shows the readout of all the information listed above and its got a nifty little orange tint to it to tell you hey mate these aint your friends here 1d information that could be consider too much but could be implemented if restricted things like showing the ammunition type on the gun not meta leveltech level some of you avid amarr pilots can readily identify what type of ammo theyre using by the colorful flash of light i personally dont think we should implement this but figured id provide it as an option for those interested 2 a more comprehensible combat log this was suggested in the past and is commonly brought up but i felt that it could be mentioned here as well 2a giving damage notifications locations showing a damage counter over the top of the turretmissile module at the bottom of the screen so its not dead in the center mixed in with all the other damage notifications heres a screen shot from a previous thread that suggested this
can anyone find a way that this could break the gamethank ya thank ya
unless its a damage bonuses gallente ships have bonuses for active repair these work pretty well in solo combat but not nearly as much in fleet combat heres some examplesbrutix  75 armor repairer effectiveness per levelmyrmidon  75 armor repairer amount per levelhyperion  75 armor repairer amount per levelnow im not too sure what the difference is between effectiveness and amount but for the sake of the proposal well look over that little bitessentially the gallente desperately need something that can be fielded in a fleet that isnt a recon ship or a capital logistics take the cake as far as repairing damage so these bonuses are not very useful remove the active armor bonus to one of the battlecruisersbattleships and give them an armor resist bonus or an armor hp amount bonus perhaps theyll be fielded more often and more acceptable if not tolerable in fleet setups
the only ship you mentioned that i wouldnt mind seeing the bonus changed to is the brutix the hyperion and myrm certainly dont need their ar bonus stripped and i would be very saddened if it was not all ships need to be fleet oriented ships for bs fleets both the domi or mega have their uses with the domi being an extremely potent and versatile fleet ship for bc fleets both the brutix and talos work very well and they myrm is not obsolete in any way are you suggesting that the cyclone and maelstrom should lose their repping bonus too just so they become better fleet ships edit the active tanked brutix is still decent its just eclipsed by its tier2 brother and while i suspect it might happen ill be a very sad panda if they take away my active tanked myrm  the domi is an outstanding fleet ship bringing heavy neuts to heavily screw with an enemys cap and some damage flexibility with drones its not for the 1 dps mindless automaton but most armor fleets benefit quite a bit by including a few of these ships
yea lets just make them like amarr shipsyou are correct that active tanking needs looked at but the answer is not to remove those bonuses and make it even less useful on the few ships that dont suck at it not all ships are going to be viable in large fleets some have other purposes or niches
and those are what besides low sec solofights oo
omg these are niche ships that are primarily used in small gang andor solofights what of it why shouldnt a ship exist to fill a nice niche hole the races shouldnt be homogenized and niche ships generally good for the game so long as they arent op rather than ask the brutix turn into a prophecy with blasters or the myrm turn into a harbringer wtih drones or the hyperion turn into a abbadon why dont you just train amarr you also never responded to the inquiry about minmatar active shield rep bonuses are those acceptable but active armor rep bonuses not
freak out much their entire race shouldnt fill a niche hole man

the sails were not iconic the speed and agility was iconic most people here have turned this into a bandwagon be one of the cool kids circlejerk without actually giving a care one way or the other or having flown itleave the frills off it looks more deserving of speed now without the horrible atrocity that were wings
wanted cigs and cigars for my avatar aurum itemneeds no further explanation
i thought high sec systems are off limits for real ownership other than random missions for faction like any with little consequence or gainwould concord be ok with collateral damage in highsec
i agree with the above posters if they finally get around to fixing poses then this needs to be in there from the startmy missus thinks of eve as the other woman 
kristoffer touborgccp soundwave wroteit isnUFFFDt really hard but i think there are customers that you can lose in a good way and thereUFFFDs customers that you can lose in a bad way if people come in and fundamentally donUFFFDt like eve online then i think that might be a good way of losing customers eve isnUFFFDt for everyone i wish it was but the reality is that there are some people who just enjoy playing another game more and thatUFFFDs not really that bad
great discussion points bugsy and vajuit seems overall what you are saying is that perhaps eve really is just a niche game and maybe thats how it will survive  by catering to a particular type of player who thrives on itthat may be true  its sad to me though  imo there should be a enough inherent diverisity in eve to fit many different styles of gamers  i hope ccp continues to keep that in mind  were not all bitter vets looking for easy pvp many of us just cant get ourselves all hot and bothered by at the prospect of ruining someone elses day and the bigger they lose the better though we dont necessarily hold it against the rest of the community either since it adds to overall dark backdrop of eve in most cases id like to see ccp come up with more pvp mechanics not less  as i think part of what turns bitter vets bitter is lack of exciting pvp tools and mechanics to keep them entertained after awhile other than poaching the next 3 day old bantam fresh out of the training grounds or gloating over how defenseless even a 200mm well tanked hulk is under alpha strike ok maybe it takes 3 volleys not one if youre well tanked vs a few 15mm destroyers ironic that these folks keep harping about wanting eve to be hard but thrive off such easy guaranteed win situations themselves no i dont mean to harp on any one mechanic here  even the examples stated are complex interplays of game balancing rules and may or may have room for improvement  but i do think hisec has an important role to play and one of those is in basically blunting the 15 yr old bully in the sandbox effect that has the potential to make younger kids avoid said sandbox logout
i am all for this as long as it only happens in lowsecdoesnt have to have all the incursion mechanics even just have large npc fleets drop in and invadebut teh main point is no incursions should happen in hisec for all teh previous reasons storyline risk vs reward blah blah blah
great concept the details need to be fleshed out but it brings something new and unique to eve gameplay
no just remove concord from most of high sec
why arbitrary rules are arbitrary and bad if youre suggesting removing t3s from highsec why not marauders too how about hacs what about bses the problem with arbitrary rules is that they dont end anywhere theyre arbitrary
nope dont see any merit to this proposal at all
i dont think there should be any restrictions on what ships can be used in high seci dont see why i cant use my carrier there maybe put a restriction on capital only weapons being used but its not in the spirit of the sandbox
10 parks cloakyscanny loki on grid with op and waitsheres a hint not every t3 thats bouncing around hs is bearing it up some of us are after holes to gank people with
yes lets all cry together to make this sandbox even smaller with even more barriers why not remove  hacs maybe battleships  how about maurauders  you have made a very poorly thoughtout illogical post about something which is intefereing with your mode of gameplay wait did you try and gank a t3 cruiser and failed  your post makes you come across as a huge crybaby whos the carebear now coo  bene gesserit chapterhouse ceo  sanctuary pact alliance
just make t3s wormholes only those crybaby nullbears dont deserve them any more than hisec bears do
ok
cant support this if you cant gank a t3 in hisec i suggest you either try harder or move to an area of space where it is easieri recommend wormspace it is open and friendly and you can be guaranteed a warm reception by myself or any other locals especially considering your interesting views on one of our major exports
only if theyre buffed to roughly double their current powerif you really want them to be blown up more then they have to be worth the price of getting them blown up often the only way theyd be worth the lost training time and the billionodd isk youd be out each time you lost one is if they got turned into omgwtfbbq solopwnmobilesfor the record i dont think that would be good for null low or wormholes eitheralso youre complaining that you cant gank a 1 billion isk ship fast enough seriously how much do 6 tornadoes cost back of the napkin 175mil x 6  105 billion isk so youd have to risk a little less than the isk cost of a strategic cruiser to gank one and youd get the pleasure of knowing you cost the pilot the time of retraining skills seems like the riskreward for ganking is balanced for once
youre an idiot
sniffsi smell the fear of a care bear who cant handle real exploration there are some people who say hi sec should be frigates only some people around here help them prove their pointyoure right high sec would be a lot better if we could bring in a few carriers and a dreadnought or two maybe a titan with a xxxl smartbomb that could take out every battleship within 100km while we are at it id like to agree with you but if you could get 100mil for downing 10 hulks needing 5 other people plus someone to scan him down only being able to break even doesnt sound right the least you guys could do is triple the price of the export mats and then put a bounty of 1 billion on the things you have to at least credit the goons for being able to get their act together and make a profit whers fail in comparison and here i am trying to help you guys out and all i get is criticism
likedyou bring up a good point still id prefer if the nice juicy targets werent hiding behind their moms i mean concords skirt 
no one else can see the potential in this can any of you imagine the wardec campaigns that would clear entire highsec systems of towers to make room for lab farmseven beyond that it is yet another thing transferred from npc control to pc control id think wed all be for less npc in our sandbox
make t2 blueprint copies available on the market as well as contracts and ill support this not that im in hisec that often anyway1
i know this has been said before in various forums including this one in which the thread is old and locked

read again definitiion of adhominem in wikipedia glitter im sure it says something about basing your arguement on the weakness of your opponents character normally unfounded or unjustified claims you said i didnt read your wall of post or implied i dont play eve i did i do the attack on character part you are mistaken you made an assumption that i didnt read because you assumed i didnt catch the point of your stacking penalty nerf or something the unfounded part as you cannot possibly tell if i read or not  irregardless you made adhominem arguement qed so why dont you stop sounding like an angry child  note the phrasing  and try to convince us who did not understand your proposal fully i mean you do want support right and you believe that we are mostly reasonable logical thinkers rightits not the readers fault if we are not as smart as you and cannot decipher all the side effects of your game rebalancing or whether or not you actually have put some proper thought behind itso please convince us that you have considered that this may make indies actually combat capable ships or beginner mining ships an if so does it completely obsolete frigate mining ships youve heard of the battle badger does this make all indies battle badgers and battlebadgers viable combat ships have you considered the lowered sp need to fly bigger hold indies you removed the sp scaling dependency on hull upgrades have you considered the cpu and grid upgrades needed to to be done to make new useful lows useable will that have knockon effects will the orca now have a 50k m3 default hold removing the use of expander make ships faster and bigger hull too personally i like this but this may cause some balance issues too will alpha ganks still be possiblei dont think anyone is saying your idea is crap  so calm the testosterone  but you cant call for a rebalance ships without a bit more proof that you thought it all through and most importantly convince us the readership with the all powerful like button of it and being snarky isnt the best strategy for this
too many capitals sding in fights make me a sad pandai support sding as a means to prevent the enemy getting any loot or even to prevent them knowing what was fitted on the ship but id like to have the records show what was actually involved in a fight  even if isnt a killmail in and of itself but is shown as some kind of related loss of a shipor extend the sd timer on capitals to be 5 minutesnew and exciting stuff in this thread
isnt this a bit unnecessary store mining vessels in rorqual jump rorqual to destination system unload mining vessels  store ore in rorqual when done store ships in rorqual jump home  profitisnt that actually the idea of a rorqual in teh first place it can even have a clone vat bay
all good suggestionscriticisminput keep it coming we need csm or dev support folksi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
this thread belongs to features and ideas idea has multiple flaws and is not even closely properly finished to be discussed or evaluated seriously
quite possiblenonsense an idea neednt be finished nor does it need to be flawless to be discussed or evaluated seriously or otherwise if your assertion there are multiple flaws is meant to support your notion that the idea cant be discussed then there would never be any discussion of anything because no ideas are perfectthe idea itself is to fill a gap in the means of defense the illustrated thumbnail of a possible implementation is for a new ship role new ship new modules and new skillsis this a design specification no thats not how you define requirements does this have all angles explored no thats why theres a thread to discuss it we arent eve devs eve designers or eve producers so we shouldnt tell them exactly how to make the feature we should merely give the general idea of what we want in that sense the fleet battle story on page two is more important than lists of modules and skills and assigning numbers to everythingor perhaps you didnt read the thread and only read the first post
and you are just trying to look cool by attempting to be a special snowflakeyou might also want to look up the meaning of the word iconicthe earsfrillswhatever you want to call it gave the vagabond its distinctive iconic apperance that apperance became associated with speed agility and violent death to its prey

stop changing unique features of existing ship models pleasehere is incomplete list of some ship models which did not need any change but were changed anyway just on a whim even though very good portion liked the old unique features of appearance scorpion only one wing falcon there was funny round bit purifier sure fit missile turret but you could have done it with old style  etc etcthere has been a good amount of ship models which have been changed from spiky rough and manly ships into some girly pretty pony versions etcplease stop now

protectionism is a step back for sure and it doesnt help noobsmost noobs click through the intro coast through the entry missions and disregard warnings as fast as possible to get outside and play for that first time i never read the intro or did entry missions i vaguely remember a gate warning me i was wandering away from the playground it wasnt long after before i traversed low sec and took the pod express home you can continue to extend protection system to system it wont work what about all the noobs that travel through hag or parts or several other low sec areas dailyits not anyones fault for killing them there the gate lights up and you prepare to fire by the time your done researching the targets age it may be gone with its load of riggs drugs or whatever simply painting them pink wont save them from insta lockif you make them invincible you create a reconisance exploitif you want to coddle noobs and treat them like children you need to do this1 they are pink in space on the hud and in local2 whenever they jump into a system outside of their home system there should be a warning box for all to see that says clubbing baby seals is wrong so is repeatedly killing disoriented noobs who are probably lost if we catch you clubbing baby seals or noobs you will be banned foreva3 they are worthless there is nothing in the wreck and no salvage4 if there ship is destroyed it respawns at their home system mods and cargo intact same with there pods if they dont get podded they can dock up and pod jump to their home station5 they should be restricted to their home systems for at least 2 weeks give them some hyper gates that leads to stuff like a consensual combat arena where they can blow eachother up for lulz withought fear of loosing their stuff there can be different gates like the combat sites on the test server maybe one where they can fight older players if they wish but they have to stay in the incubator for two weeks thats the rule anything less is like leaving the front door of your house open in the middle of newyork and taking a nap assuming your toddler wont go outside and that if he does the nice homeless man down the street will bring him safely homeeve meet hello kitty in space
such things dont happen everyday does it and not all rookies get shot at so why the protection well this is space and there will be brutes and bullies
idea of having rookie systems is ridiculous i have no idea which systems are rookie systemsrepeatedly messing around with noobies doing tutorials whatever should be of course banned but those aside they dont need any special treatment especially because theres no way to tell if the pilot is a real noob or not
in regards to the agething just make the rule trials are rookies offtrial are legal targets and give all suchtrialrookies a label so you can see clearly whether theyre trials or not also makes it easier for recruiters to know if an applicant is on trial or not
this is simple  no excuses from the csm or ccp will change the fact that this is both fair and overdue  just do itchild of amarr seek not warmth in our cold hearts we are the old serpent of new eden and you must do your part revel in our viciousness we rule by venom and our strike is merciless 
people that say suicide ganking is so easy such actually try it outeverything in this game can be killed even titans a hulk with some damage controlinvunarabilty field and shield modules cant be ganked with a few destroyers also with that type of fit you are not an appealing target too much efford and resources to kill a hulk besides that how hard can it be to check local and dscan mine alined to some celestial avoid 05 systems near lowsec how about gravimetric sites people just want to mine afk in highsec with maximum yield fits without any danger thats not how eve online works
the real voice of hisec is of course the tens of thousands of nullsec players alts and will therefore be voting for their favoured nullsec csm candidates just like my 6 hisec alts will be doing
thats the whole point op got pwned by wardeccers in t3s and thus wants them banned in his place of residence
i could support a minor nerf to the strength of t3s in general which seems to be ccps eventual plan likely bringing them into line with the legion last bit my opinionbut not letting a cruiser in hs is just ridiculous also it would make my job a lot harder selling t3 subs so i do have a personal reason not to like the idea
tarded idea is tardedi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
thats not breaking even youre costing the victim actual days of training time thats far more expensive than the isk itself in addition if killboard stats are your thing a t3 kill is a big get for most gankers thats still coming out far ahead of the victim unless the point of ganking is only to pick on the weak and make big isk doing it
just remove npc corps and make individuals wardeccable then you can compete with these t3 pilots over highsec resources
 thisalso no need for more caps titans are bad enough as they are
i could support that so long as the seeded t2 bpcs were each as costly as the relevant t1 bpo at least in the case of most bpcs as well as of a worse quality than achievable by invention ie 55 at best this would prevent invention from being affected much by the availability of the seeded t2 bpcsmight also be a good time to rework invention as well i think we can all agree that you should be able to achieve repeatable reliable results with high enough skills imho successes should increase the likelihood of success for inventing that particular item in all jobs installed after that success failure should too though to a lesser degree after working with the same items long enough you should essentially be guaranteed a success the variable should be to what degree the invention job was successful
youre the one whos got your panties in a bunch over a few phrasing choices i have made im simply distraught that you would insist so strongly on debunking my ideas without reading my post i still have no evidence that you did read my post because all of your posts so far on this thread have demonstrated to the contrary
your last paragraph is classic ad hominem arguement there is not panties in a bunch i thought my posts were very on the level and calling you for your attitude in posting if you read my responses and read yours i think you would agree im not the one worked up about anything  while you resorted to cynical remarks to all who seemed opposed to you you cannot have proof of anyone reading so you should not make any arguement attacking counter arguements based on that unprovable assumption qed im just pointing that out thats all to the pointsyou didnt propose combat buffs nor did i say you did but you do realize that giving extra free low slots means that a person could fit some combat mods like gyros same goes for the speed buff the effect is coming from the loss of penalties from expanders and increase via instabs and nanos training time you seem to have forgotten that if you dont need cargo expanders to get big enough cargo hold then you effectively just lowered the training time to use a indie  notice how i didnt make some comment about how you missed that because of some adhominem personal jibe i think if you are going to make orcas have close to their max capacity without expanders that will imbalance the use of the ship and may require a tweaking of its other holds
im not making ad hominems against you youre simply unable to face the reality of how poorly you have thought out your posts but every time i point it out to you you just make yet another poorly thought out post trying desperately to prove to me how wrong i am why dont you just accept you might be wrong im fully capable of accepting im wrong sometimes rather often really and you would see that if you look through my posting historythis is assembly hall not a daycare lets bring this discussion back into mature gamerelated topics shall we
give the rorqual and orca a extra high slot for a probe launcher and enough bonus to reliably scan down grav sites and you got a winnerlove the idea will make mining a bit more interestingshould add ice to this alsoalso vary the belt composition ever once in a blue moon throw in a valuable belt
my alt is the ceo of a small industrial corp i had 150 bpos locked down in my corporate office then went inactive for about two years during the two years i wasnt subbed my automatic bill wallet was depleted and my corp hangar got impoundedoh thats unfortunate oh well its only a 14m isk fee to release the assets no big dealyeah  nope you cannot recover your assets if there are any bpos locked down in there you need to unlock them all first  which means i need to propose an unlock vote on every single one its seven clicks per item to propose the vote nevermind voting or enacting the vote i tried asking the gms if they could do me a solid and at least unlock them but they were unable to provide me with a resolution no hard feelings homonoia  bananai assume the reason this mechanic exists is so a director cant steal bpos if the office is impounded  from my understanding all your recovered assets get dumped in the 1st hangar tab so theyd have to be unlocked to move and dump them thats fine but recovery can be handled so much better some suggestions change the corporate voting system to allow for lock  unlock votes on multiple bpos a single vote to unlock them all and then relock them all once ive sorted them wouldnt be onerous preserve which hangar stuff belongs in when impounding the items so releasing them doesnt require any voting or sorting i will also point out that if i werent the sole shareholder this could cause a lot of problems  if shareholders arent playing eve you would be unable to recover the entire hangars contents bpos or otherwisethanks for reading
i wanted to send it as a word document instead i will just post several post in one threadon combat UFFFD improving pve pvp and fleets in eve online1 general eve online is a massive multiplayer online game that presents the player with a vast open ended sandbox universe a big part of the game revolves around combat between live players player vs player UFFFD pvp and combat between live players and computer generated players players vs environment  pve this paper will try to frame current problems with combat in the game and suggest solutions2 framing the problem combat is a very big part of eve online however while the fitting of ships to battle and the training of characters can be very intricate and complicated combat itself is very much an automated handsoff experience where the players involvement centers around turning weapon systems on and off and determining the range and type of movement of his ship while small pvp battles can be somewhat tactical the problem intensifies when big fleets are involved  when individuals are reduced to cogs in what is being termed as a blob fleet and usually the bigger blob wins the day almost regardless of the individual players actions players involvement is also being minimized in pve battles where bigger ships battleships and above are being used this creates a situation where combat becomes repetitive and unchallenging while in big fleets individual fitting of ships matter little ultimately it hurts the enjoyment of the game3 solution this paper will argue that the solution to the above mentioned problem is composed of three different areas combat mechanics ship fitting and prices and fleet command mechanicsa combat mechanics currently combat in eve online is very automated experience a player can influence the activation of his ships systems the speed of his ship to a degree and its vector of movement orbit or straight line and range from the enemy also combat is being influence by the speed of the ship its range and the strength of its shield armor and haul there is little relevance to the direction of the ship in relation to the enemy and to its state beside the basic factor of remaining hit points hp UFFFD directional combat to add a tactical volume to combat it should include the aspect of position in relation to the enemy the shield armor and haul should be divided into several areas usually in other games it is divided into 46 equal parts and damage done should influence the sector of impact once haul is being breached in a certain area it should either go out of action or the entire ship should be destroyed shield power and repair efforts should be able to be diverted to damaged sections to aid in the resistance to damage furthermore every ship should have firing arches that would give meaning to its position in relation to the enemy UFFFD thus ships with gun ports in the front only would be used in a different way than ships with rotating gun ports or with gun ports on the side only directional guns can further differentiate between ship types eg small ships with limited firing arches and big ships with several fire arches and gun types eg multi directional missiles vs single directional guns these two changes will cause the position of the ship on the battlefield to be an important and might even a decisive factor and greatly improve the experience of combat a further development of the theme will be to divide the ship to multiple sectors and calculate damage degradation and repair efforts on every one of them however this might cause over complications of combat implementing directional combat will also require the ability to determine more accurately the position of the ship in space and to a point its speed either via keyboard or by better designing the manual direction system then the one that currently exists in eve online one might add that directional combat mechanics exists in computer games for years now if you could recall wind commander and xwing series the mechwarrior series and later on in starfleet fleet commander and star trek online UFFFD to name but a few UFFFD repair and damage as mentioned above during combat damage is dealt to the vessel as a whole if directional combat would be implemented damage should be done to specific areas in the ship farther more once shield are down a certain amount of damage can penetrate the armor and damage individual modules in that area and hence directional fitting will also have significance this will increase further the significance of the ships position in relation to the enemy and will further require tactical thinking as the ship takes damage if visual indications will be given for damage ie impact on shields will be visible and so will damage to armor and haul in specific areas it will allow the parties to further calculate their actions in battle repairing the damage can also be done in a more specific way where efforts are focused on specific damaged sections and systems
b ship fitting and cost currently while eve online has a wide variety of ships and fitting options and indeed this aspect is the most developed in the game there are several problems that should be addressed to better facilitate the experience of combatUFFFD ship types currently ships especially tier 1 t1 ships are not specialized enough t1 frigates are underpowered and can do little in pvp or pve combat against bigger opponents t1 destroyers and cruisers are unfit to conduct independent pvp while t1 battle cruisers and battleships are very general purpose combat ships to solve these problems all ships should be specialized according to roles and size ie frigates should be the only ships that can use warp scramblers and warp disruptors and be able to be used as navy jet fighters in modern fleets UFFFD thus increasing their value to fleets as the tackler and swarming component destroyers should receive antisubmarine warfare capabilities by allowing them to detect cloaked ships cruisers should be toughened up to become them main ships of the line while battleships and battle cruisers should become heavy drone and gun platforms and carriers should be purely fighter platforms and require armed escorts etc this specialization already exists in eve online to a degree but mostly with frigates and t2 and above shipsUFFFD ship costs currently ship costs influence greatly the combination of fleets while all ship up to t1 cruisers are cheap all ships above t1 battle cruiser and all t2 and t3 ships are highly expensive and underinsured this creates a situation where since battle cruisers are the lowest ship viable in most pvp scenarios fleets are composed almost entirely of a single model of battle cruiser or battleship and smaller fleets are rare due to the risk of losing such expansive assets actions should be taken to lower prices of t2 ships while improving the potency of t1 frigates destroyers and cruisers this will diversify the fleets and lower the bar to pvp combat in the game simultaneously battleships and above should be made more expensive to make them true capital ships in fleets and cause so no more than several ships will participate and every fleet and will become a major strategic target in it similar to carriers and titans today UFFFD modules eve online features an extensive array of equipment to outfit a ship with currently there are too many different t1 modules that have very little difference from one another while the real difference appears only in the t2 and above versions which are usually the ones used for pvp combat these t2 and above modules are considerably expansive which adds to the risk aversion of players and increases the size of fleets hence all the t1 versions of a module should be consolidated into one module while t2 module prices should be adjusted downward and t3 and up should keep their current prices to avoid flooding the market faction etc also fitting of a ship should take consideration of the location of the module on the vessel for damage and effects purposes in directional combatUFFFD modules diversity currently players are dissuaded from fitting several different types of weapon systems on their ships which causes the creation of template fits and reduce the variety of fittings by enabling ships to use more effective countermeasures antiship missiles point defenses etc players will have to diversify their ships fitting which will add another tactical layer into combatUFFFD crews every ship has crews but their skill levels quality and experience has no bearing on gameplay crews can be made to become a universal module every ship should have a different crew compliment x officers y sailors for its optimal employment in case of combat crew can take casualties and in case of ship destruction life boats will follow the players pod allowing to save or capture some of the crew crews can be trained to specific tasks and ships and increase effectiveness of modules like implants crew training will be conducted in corporation academies which will be located in important bases or poss which will increase the strategic importance of systems trained crews sold with ships would increase their price however unlike rigs or implants crews should be able to be transferred between ships and will not be ship specific UFFFD ie a player will have x amount of sailors and y amount of officers and every ship would require its own amount as opposed to frigates officers or destroyers officers
c fleet command mechanics currently fleet control mechanics encourage the use of blob fleets due to the fleet commanders ability to control massive amount of ships while not being able to give them specific orders beyond the general nature of fleets broadcasts the fleet command mechanics should be improved in the following manner UFFFD span of control the ability of trained fleet commanders to ultimately control hundreds of ships regardless of their type and size causes the creation of blob fleets as a sheer force method to achieve victory to eliminate blob fleets the span of control should be drastically reduced and be ship type specific UFFFD ie a fleet commander will be able to control up to x frigates y destroyers z cruisers etc while most fleet commanders wont be able to accommodate more than several big ships battle cruisers and above this will cause the creation of several fleets for big operations under the command of several commanders which will grant more flexibility UFFFD ie the ability to simultaneously operate in different places in a system or in different systems while denying the ability to operate huge blob fleetsUFFFD tactical direction of squadrons and fleet members as mentioned above currently the ability of fleet commanders to issue orders is limited to voice commands and fleet broadcasts both methods are very general fleet commanders need the ability to issue orders via a tactical map that will allow them to direct squadrons and individual ships to specific locations in space allowing for tactical maneuvers like flanking and enveloping of enemy formation and assets also fleet commanders should be encouraged to issue orders to their squadron commanders rather than the entire fleet as a whole allowing squadron commanders a more active role in fleets an example for an effective control system in an mmo can be seen in the game battlefield 2142UFFFD situational awareness currently situational awareness of players in eve online is limited to the sensor strength of individual ships and intelligence given over communication channels without an ability to mark enemies in game for the entire fleet players should be able to mark enemy ships for their allies in fleet an identification that should appear on the fleet commanders and fleet members tactical mapUFFFD nukes in real wars the ability to create huge concentrated ground formation was virtually eliminated with the invention of tactical nuclear weapons such weapons caused the concentration of large forces a tempting lucrative target for the employment of such a weapon an equivalent weapon in eve online can be design so to have more power the more ships it impacts at once like a chain lightning in several games thus the impact of such a weapon on a huge blob fleet will be destructive while the impact on smaller fleets might not be worth the price of the bomb which should be considerable to avoid the over use of such weapons it can have adverse environmental effects such as gravimetric disorders electromagnetic distortion the creation of wormholes etc the fear of such weapons could be increased by allowing their employment only from an equivalent of a nuclear submarine UFFFD ie a stealth destroyers or cruisers only detectable to antisubmarine warfare ships 4 summary the combat in eve is lacking in tactical sophistication and depth which undermines the attractiveness of the game to gamers looking for challenging tactical pvp and pve combat the solutions mentioned above might be useful in addressing the matter5 with regardsshmuel aka sam davaham or gaius makenen
without writing an essay of my own no most of your suggestions are either bad or bad and have been previously tried eg nukes vs aoe dd i mean come on consolidating all t1 weapons of each type also you can mark up the opposing fleet im pretty sure directionally based combat would require a total rework of parts of the game engine
hello i would like to propose a few changes to the eve online store1 no link to the store on the main pageit wasnt on the main page and if i didnt already know about the store beforehand i wouldve never found it i had to go digging through multiple pages and eventually had to go to account management to finally find the link to the eve storeproposed change  please put a link to the store in the eve universe drop down menu on the main website2 order confirmation unclear after paymentafter i pressed the payment button i was taken to an order review page that showed mailing address amount of payment and order summary it was unclear whether the transaction went through or not if it wasnt for the email i received saying my order was confirmed and being processed i wouldnt have known the order went throughproposed change  place a banner that says something along the lines of thank you for your purchaseproposed change  make it clear on the page that the order is complete and is awaiting processingthose are the minor issues ive experienced with the store and they seem like a simple fixthere are other issues with the store that are not as easy to deal with issues such as store webpage presentation item availability poor item selection and such but thats for another day i thinkbtw i bought the red minmatar tshirt 
not an entirely useless bump but i would also like to add that the holographic overlay would work wonders when used in combination with the pictureinpicture featureidea shown at fanfest 2012
