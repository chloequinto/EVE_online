unfornutely they are why do we deserve only good subbs class ships edit lol support 
its not enough just to boost the hp a bit youre still likely to have our missiles pass through the sphere of influence of more than one or two carriersmss in a fleet engagementif were going to have a weaponsystem that sucks this much at least buff it in other ways to make it balanced like not being the 2nd worst dps delayed etc
if dreads are supposed to be immune to electronic warfare to include tracking disruptors then citadel torpedoes should be invulnerable to being shot down as well that would be balanced the situation that we have right now is notand the missiles launched before siege mode should hit for normal damaage all citadel torps launched during siege cycle should do siege damage thats fairif possible increasing the velocity by 50 and decreasing the flight time by 33 same max range would make the ship much less boringbut i digress people want to pop my nonsiege mode citadels fine but i should do full damage with every torp that hits a ship of the appropriate size and slowness unless you let tracking disruptors affect the turret based dreads this is incredibly unbalanced
and the nav skills  capital ships  carrier or dreadthis isnt about everyone running to test the capital fleet blobccp ask us to test on sisi but what if you dont have the skills to test what they ask you do but would like to help never mind im sure 30 days of bs5 or 20 of cruiser 5 or whatever will fly by and im sure the patch wont be released until you have had to wait to test itand what do i have to do to get a member of the csm to vote in here

is 25mhr too high a reward for the risk of losing a cnris 100mday too high a reward for someone who doesnt even leave a station
trading incurs risk and requires considerable player skill missioning hasrequires neither
i was making 60 mil an hour in empire thiefn before ice prices tanked not really any risk as you can do it in a shuttle exthortion and organized crime is fun and profitable toooh im sorry this is the council of stellar management forum like any council member has a clue what im talking about  sorry
with the increased difficulty related to hisec suicide ganking which is about to come to fruition i suppose that the isk farmers and rmt type people are extremely worried about their bottomlines due to the reduced requirement for their service that this change may bringi grieve for you
i dont get your reversed psychology the increased security is a great help for the rmt types nerfing high sec missions would be a great setback for them as it is one of their primary sources of income what you are saying here in essence is that isk buyers are over represented amongst empire carebear types if they dont lose ships less people buy isk i dont agree with you i dont think they are over represented
you completely missed the pointask yourself this question as easy as it supposedly is now to make risk free isk why do isk farmers existnow ask yourself this questionwhat would the effect of making isk much more difficult to get mean for the isk farmers business
are you stab wounds in disguise or something
i cant believe that you are actually saying this you are saying that we cant balance the game because many people would start cheating if we did amazing
ki an do people cheat
beside the point the real question is should we accept that cheaters affect game balance im talking about balance here not exploit fixes and the like
yes you are talking about balance so am i
how about answering the question then
should we be happy that cheaters effect game balance nodo cheaters effect game balance of course
just to make sure i have understood you ccp cant nerf lvl 4 high sec missions because if they did the people running lvl 4 high sec missions would buy isk insteadyou call that an argument
ill go real slowif the isk supply available to the majority of players is reduced the overall effect that farmed isk has on the economy becomes greater due to the relative value of the isk itselfsuch a situation increases the viability for outofgame cash generation leading to more pigs at the trought so to speakas in every mmo there are those that have no issue with circumventing game mechanics in order to achieve their ingame goals these players will actually gain a greater advantage over those less unscrupulous then they currently enjoyof course eventually the economy will selfcorrect and return the relative purchasing power of the average player back to where it currently stands though leaving large 00 alliances in a significantly more powerful position wealth distribution wiseso in the end your proposed changes will at worst harm the game and at best mean absolutely squat
now thats some quality bull right there if you reduce the income of mission runners you also reduce the income of isk farmers less isk will be on the market prices of isk will rise if people want to buy isk they will do so through the ccp sanctioned gtc system as that will be cheaper now that takes care of your entire argument lets focus on why you bring this upits apparent that you have run out of arguments for the status quo your last hope lies with somehow pleading to honest players hate for isk farmers and rmt its something that you alone has dreamed up and it is something that is so out of line with reality that im amazed you would bring it to the forums you are presenting a non sequitur and you ground it on assumptions now you can continue this drivel but you are only serving to further disrupt an important discussion
wrong in many ways remember necessity if the mother ofi can ignore the rest of your posting
you just wont give this up will you its obvious why as i stated in my previous post but its getting kind of desperate tbh why dont you with your bullting skills explain why you think lowering income in high sec will lead to an increase in illegal isk buying bearing in mind that high sec missions is a major part of isk farming operations and that gtc trading is becoming more prevalent than actual isk buying
man you are a bit slow what do hisec mission runners do with the isk that they earn
most of them stockpile them the pvp alts use them to fund pvp the isk farmers sell them for rl money
goodnow how does reducing the availability of hisec isk affect each of these groups
stockpilers will stockpile less and perhaps move to other places to aquire more isk like low secpvp alts will definately join small alliances in low sec or 00 some will remain and settle for the lowered rewardsisk farmers will earn less and be forced to raise their prices still dont see where youre getting with this
stockpilers will stockpile lessor do some other hisec actvity insteadcorrectpvp alts funding pvp will make less thereby allowing for less pvp okisk farmers will earn less not on your lifethey are if we are discussing real isk farmers already diversified and will simply move assets towards the more lucrative activity which i dont really believe is hisec mission running due to the timeeffort required anyway
or low sec activity not everyone is as risk adverse as youno they wont pvp alts will find other venues to get rich like joining up with a carebear alliance somewhere or they will go to low sec pvp will increase if this nerf goes through low sec will be worth figthing over pvp will also mean more as the loss of an expensive ship will hurt people will start flying t1 hulls again thus more pvpthen why havent they done so already no nerfing missions will put a real damper on their isk making activities that will make them having to raise their prices
i also realize that you still havent manage to explain how isk farmers would actually benefit from this nerf
this isnt about me i already said what i make running l4 missions about 5 to 6 millionhour this is about those players that are making 20 or 30 millionhour like has been claimed by your side over and over if i go to lowsec i risk a t1 shippvp alts allow a relatively quick way for lowsec players to gather some isk to fund their exploits especially if the player is not that great at pvp i guess they could be traders andor miners because according to you all other isk generating activities should be conducted under fire so why have a pvp alt that runs missions use your main since you wont need to go to hisec anyway wait why arent you doing that nowisk farmers are already diversified hell there are farmers renting space from 00 alliances farming hugh amounts of isk every day reducing the hisec isk fountain will open even more opportunities for them
its very much about you you are the one who made a quite illogical argument i asked you to back it up and so far you havent been able tonice why are you sharing this information and this is a bad thing low sec shouldnt be a wowstyle battleground people are supposed to live there not just go there for fun eve used to be about corporate warfare and fighting over resources pvp alts have other ways to achieve their income they will just have to put themselves into a little bit of risk and competition to do so just like everyone elseno thats not what i say i say all pve activities should be subject to competition right now missioning is the only pve activity that isnti run missions with both my alt and my main my alt flies a raven though and hes got better social skills plus i like my slightly negative secstatus makes me look more badass no it will close down opportunities to aquire the isk more people will shy away from illegal iskbuying as it gets more expensive due to lessened supply from the farmers and will instead buy gtcs from ccp also all iskfarmers arent from a single company they all do different things to get their isk if one of those venues is closed it doesnt mean that particular iskfarming company can just pick up and move all their iskgenerating to 00i think its time you gave up this silly notion now you cant back up your argument and youre getting more desperate with each post you make its stupid and its illogical give it up
once again you are wrong you are mostly wrong because you assume that isk farmers make the majority of their isk from running l4s in hisecyou got bonus wrong from not soley calling for a nerf to hisec mission runners but at the same time you seem to discount the amount of farming that actually occurs in 00 as well as the most likely fact that it is there 00 where the true farmers make the vast majority of their iskso now we have the scenario where there is still a huge pile of isk being generated from 00 with the added benefit of a now isk starved population in hisecyou do the mathif people run missions to generate isk to fund their gtcs recoup pvp losses and to support other ingame activities can you guess what will happen when this source of income gets nerfed
and once again you are being completely illogical no i have never made that assumption i know for a fact that part of the isk comes from lvl 4s in high sec though part of it that means if you remove that part the price of isk will go up that means less people will buy this isk and instead use the completely legal way of buying and selling gtcsthe reason i discount it in this discussion is because its irrelevant we have no means to completely remove isk farming what we can do is to reduce their means of income however this too is irrelevant because thats not why we want this nerf the reason we are having this discussion is because you claimed that nerfing lvl 4s in high sec would be good for farmers i have shown you that you are wrong in this you can either accept that or you can continue to derail this debatewe already have a huge pile of isk being generated in 00 its not going to go up because of this instead isk farmers will have less isk to seel because of this nerf their prices will go up i also still find it amusing that you accuse high sec dwellers of being potential isk buyers do you think people would buy isk to fund their gtcs wouldnt that be a bit counter productive buy isk with rl money from an illegal seller to buy game time from someone with that isk who in turn bought the game time from ccp with rl cash wouldnt it be better to give your rl money directly to ccp for game time the fact is your argument might work if there was no ccp sponsored gtc trade with that trade in existence your entire argument falls flat
ok how much time will it take the average hisec mission running gtc buyer in game to farm the necessary isk if your suggestion is implementedif farmers are already making the majority of their isk from activities other than the one you would like to see nerfed how exactly does the change do anything but benefit them when you are simply increasing their potential market
i dont know what i do know is that they would not buy isk to affor gtcs dont you see that it doesnt make sense buying illegal isk for use in buying gametime from someone who bought the gametime from ccp its not logical its robbing peter to pay paul or whatever the expression isit seems you dont understand this either if you lower the income of the isk farmers which you do by nerfing high sec missions the price of isk goes up people stop buying isk from farmers and if they are so inclined instead buy isk through the gtc system your argument doesnt make any sense its illogical please try to understand
you cant balance the game based on cheaters and if thats the only argument then well i think ccps course is clear if people start buying more isk then the gms will ramp up enforcement and start removing more isk it will not reduce pvpat least meaningful pvp fly out into lowsec looking for random fight pvp would instead be replaced by fly around in lowsec and defend your valuable iskgathering territory pvp which is much much better
see this is where you have it wrong who will defend their valuable areaspirates nope they are mostly interested in blowing others upcarebears nope they will get blown up once and return to highsec without their percieved ability to progress by losing their isk source or level 4s many will quitalliance pvp alts nope if they were interested in fighting for their valuable isk generating territories they would be running their mains in 00basically those that are already in lowsec will benefit everyone else will go do something different lowsec will still be empty the reason if you lose a single ship a week you have lost more trying to run level 4s in lowsec as compared to running level 3s in highsec at first people will move out there but after losing a ship or two they will move backit is simple math that the reason no one is in lowsec is because for running missions or mining you will lose ships and lose them often as a pve fitted ship will lose to a pvp fitted ship that has npcs backing it up every time if you take all the precautions and align to station jump when local changes etc then you might as well be running level 1s in empire because you cannot make iskies while docked or cloaked in a safe spotno amount of rewards or nerfs will force players into lowsec you have to make it safer for the solo player or they wont move there and like it or not most empire corp players are essentially solo while chattering with their friends
you do realise that low sec used to be populated when it was worth fighting over rightalso how the hell do you think any alliances start anyway they go from being a bunch of carebears or pvpers without a purpose and get togehter and cooperate were trying to make it worth doing this in low sec as a stepping stone to 00 not everyone in high sec is risk averse they are there because you get the most iskeffot there and among the best iskh on top of that if the profit is moved to low sec they will go not all of them but some and probably most those of you who quit take care and good luck in whatever game you try next i hear age of conan is overrun with your type so you could go there
take a look at your calendar lowsec emptied out not because high sec was suddenly more lucrative lowsec emptied out shortly after revelations was released what happened in revalations probing suddenty your deadspace missions and ss areas were not 99 safe the risk factor went up dramatically while rewards were raised slightlythat is why lowsec is empty the risk vs reward is off in that part of the game lowsec has never been a stepping stone to 00 regardless of what the players guide might say even when i started 2 years ago people would say go straight to 00 because lowsec wasnt worth itif you want to make lowsec worth going to that is great nerfing high sec isnt the way all it does is makes those same carebears hint you arent talking people who like a struggle here get restless and decide it isnt worth their time anymore look at who you are claiming are running missions in high sec1 carebears guess what there is not profit worth loss for these players even if they were making a billion an hour if they lost a ship a week it is too much for some of them if you cant guarantee the same isktime ratio over a period of several months ie they make as much isk or more after ship losses they simply wont go and most of them wont go even if they do make more because they arent interested in getting ganked2 pvpers alts funding their pvp excuse me you seriously think these are even a little interested in risk when they are making isk to burn elsewhere if they were they wouldnt have alts to begin with these accounts would just get cancelled3 00 people making isk is safety this one i cant understand when they can make as much or more in 00 than level 4s except they dont have to watch over their shoulder all the time these people wouldnt move to lowsec to do missions either they would simply stay in 004 farmers as previously mentioned these people are heavily diversified and will just do something elsemake this change and lowsec will not increase in population it wont be more worthwhile simply because the hunters will always have too much of an advantage over the hunted some small numbers might move but the vast majority will do other activitiesalways with the you dont belong here if you dont play my way here is a little hint for you you are requesting a radical change in the game that will effect all eve players in some way and a large percentage of them dramatically the burden of proving to ccp that your way is best is on you it isnt our place to defend the status quotelling ccp that those players arent welcome isnt going to help your cause any especially when you are seriously underestimating imho how many it will effect
dumb carebears will get blown up and return to hisec smart ones will organize dodge and fight the pirates i am of course aware that people would just run level 3s which is why i am in favor of a blanket hisec mission nerf full scaling rewards bountiesloot included by sec status so that running 3s to make almost as much isk would not be an optionyou wont lose ships while running a mission unless youre not paying attention there are too many damn tools at your disposal to stop that from happening and in my vast experiences with lowsec exploration easier to probe down than in a mission i have never been caughteven when flying in hiseclowsec border systems that are usually brimming with pirates compared to the rest of iti dont give a  if people are too scared to move out there i really dont care if one person moves out to lowsec although a lot would what i care about is that people who do go into lowsec are appropriately rewarded and people who sit in the safe secure zones arent making huge amounts of easy isk
this is what ive been saying all along i dont think these people are getting it
then advocate a method of rewards that doesnt screw over a large portion of the player base and you might actually have a chance of getting it you arent advocating making lowsec more valuable you are advocting nerfing a huge portion of the gamei dont think these people are getting it
as mentioned already what happened to the plans for thisnew graphics for different varieties of gates have already been completed
a way other devs approached this was in the mmo shadowbanethe game was in a similar situation and they created things to fight over and control that could be done with a pickup gang of 510 players for the sake of conversation lets call these things key areaskey areas if controlled gave money to the organization controlling it key areas can be taken over by a small gangfleet 510 noncap shipskey areas could only switch hands for one hour at specified times times were spread out to facilitate different time zones of prime timekey areas can be attacked within its hour window dailykey areas are displayed on the map to everyone and who controls them and when their window of opportunity isbasically this provided a few things 1 provided something for people to fight for besides fortresses possbases2 controlling a large number of them is a definate advantage3 a small organization can and did wrestle them from larger organizationsmy 2 isk

i support this big time the lag in jita is critically high sometimesit would be nice to have the jita system in a dedicated nodethe server contains 2300 nodes btw
hey look its a lag whine havent seen one of those before
the lag brings a lot of frustration into any activity provided there are enough players in the system fleet battles trading etc everything is affected but the most important part is that even tho besides fleet battles where response time is critical the gaming experience is severely crippledi wouldn t know how to improve this it s not my job i work in advertisement and pr but i do know as a fact that these factors count as 50 to 60 of how a person perceives service rendered and that frustrationgames environment where you should be able to disconnect from the mundane  discontinue usage at least in my bookif you do polls upon servicesubscription cancellation you will probably notice that this is a major issueedit herschel what do you propose accepting it as a necessary evil frankly dismissing a real issue and labeling it as a whine won t earn you any return on investment whereas the experience being crippled ends up in a core brand misjudgement due to the fact that the good stuff eve has to offer pale in comparison to the fact that lag and frustration come hand in hand with the important parts that come with eve

as they exist currently implants seem to have a detrimental effect upon the game for most people who only use attribute increasing implants these only act as another mandatory tier 3 learning skill which most players and ccp despise for those few w huge amounts of isk to burn on combat implants these items constitute a huge newold player divider in both cases implants strongly discourage pvp  particularly for those wo easy access to jump clones via a 00 allianceim open to any ideas on this subject but do firmly believe that implants act as a severe deterrent to pvp in a game in which pvp is already extremely costlyedit adding ideas from the discussion into the main post for easier reading these could either be added separately or as a whole to address the issue1 make implants insurable this would provide a moderate isk sink like all insurance and instead of having multiple tiers of coverage platinum gold etc there would likely only be one tier the payout could be something like 80 of the value of the implants that way riding into pvp in an implanted clone would still cost something but not be a total deterrent factionpirate implants would likely be insurable but only in the way that t2 ships are insurable  for a fraction of their real value this would prevent pirate implants becoming musthave items under this system2 create a new skill that reduces the amount of time between clone jumps substantially this would make choosing to enter pvp without implants less of a sp sink while encouraging players to log on a bit more frequently something ccp likes and is thus likely to implement3 make jump clones more accessible to pilots in empire while implants pose a substantial deterrent to 00 pilots  who can make considerably more iskhr and can choose via jump clones not to risk their expensive implants  they practically require that empire pilots who depend on mining and mission running avoid pvp at all costs the current jump clone mechanics also discourage empire pilots from joining corporations since access to empire jump clones require high individual and corporate standing with an npc corporation

i think having a more secure login method such as using one of them rss secure id devices not mandatory but for the people who really have something to protect would be a bliss countering any keylogging and hackingwhat does everyone think should we or should we not have the possibility of using optional security measures for protecting our accounts
i m vouching for it
a much more comprehensive post on this topic was made a few months ago by chribba its not a bad idea but it should probably be incorporated into his thread
i m not for locking an account to an ip or anything of the sort i m just saying that account safety can be perfectly preserved by using a device which basically generates 6 random numbers based on an algorithm with unique variables based on its serial number that is attached to a specific account and functions along with the password as a secondary means of identification allowing you to use eve from anywhere provided you have your trusty token with you banks use it companies use it why not eve and btw the example has been set in mmos due to the fact that blizzard implemented this into their mainstream product world of warcraft
what is an rss security id device you mean thisif you ask me that is kind of dumb because people lose and forget their passwords all the time you forgetlosebreak your usb small thing and no more eve until they ship you a new one gl with that especially as they are sold out atm lolshacker mode onusing a smart card usually donest give you much security the dumb things commonly keep passwords in plain text and you can easily find that with the most basic scripts with both keys you can easily fool the login server that you have the usb in  the other password phishing and social engineering still works great etc etchacker modereally i see a way for blizzard to gank some money out of scared customers that dont know a lot about security and maybe want something to flash to other people look how cool i amoh and if you are talking about rsa security tokens those are pretty nice but they do have some security vulnerabilities like a few man in the middle attacks personally i think it is a waste of time with a strong pw that you rotate every month you are pretty much safe if someone is really dedicated to hacking your account a rsa securid device will not save you
its a great way for ccp to give their customers a false sense of security and make them show they are willing to fight hackers rmt peeps
secureid costs a lot of money to implement and the little cards are kind of expensive as well while this is a pretty good idea financially it wouldnt make sense for ccp
what happend in this  elbow room  to cause the offense you speak of a link would certainly help 
it was originally a somewhat more german term best known for use in the late 1930s it seems the op has been edited since
there is plenty of elbow room in high sec currently move out from the main areas and you will be surprised how much room there is
hisec is huge it is the mentality of that 80 that is the problem ccp could add a thousand new empire systems and the overwhelming majority would never care unless they were between motsu and jitaexplore a little live a little go to a new region just because you can go run missions for someone new go visit an agent thats three points lower in quality shock gasp horrorturn off your autopilot and spend half an hour jumping through the stargate with the coolest system name once you get out of the forge a bit you might find empire to be a rather different place
my idea is to add a minigame to mining you start mining and a window opens with a game i suggest a match 3 game the purpose of the game would benefit your cycle timethe game would have 5 levels of dificulty in which you have to work your way up and stay there each level would decrease your cycle time by 10 so if you continued to do good in the game you could cut your cycle time in half this would benefit people who where actively mining the game would have to pause after a cycle this would give you time to unload the cargo and your lasers would only run when the game is in progresswhen you start mining your cycle time would be what it would normally be gang bonuses if your attain lvl 5 in the game when it pauses your cycle time with the bonuses is cut in half i would also suggest negative effects if you do really really bad this would be the case if time was going by and you do not make any matches or just randomly click around indicating a macro the overal goal of this would be make the miners who are at thier computer mining can make 34 times what a macro miner can if marco miners want to keep playing with this system in play they will be reduced alot in thier profitsdiscuss
not a bad idea in theoryin practice however all this will achieve is to annoy human miners by placing an obstacle in their waymeanwhile the macros with their optical recognition software will both adapt quickly to your system and permanently gain a 50 reduction to their cycle time as their reaction time as a machine is much faster than a humans so theyll be able to maintain the maximum level in your mini game really easilytheres also the possible disasterous effect itll have on lowsec00 miners who need to be at the keyboard anyway to make sure that they dont lose their ships to hostile players placing this in their way would just be too distractingso while im for ways of making mining more interesting i dont believe your way is the solution
this seem like a pretty reasonable idehgasgdhfgfthis is a terrible idea and would only serve to make mining even less fun than it is now
slapped on minigames are abominable game design outright annoying legitimate miners for the sake of combating macros is equally abominable game design and extremely short sighted not to say blind and stupidplease keep posting your ideas in this forum and keep them out of the features and ideas forums as that ones already suffering from really bad ideas already or just stop posting
minigames  fail
please dont judge this rest of eve or this forum by reading the posts of people like this your idea is certainly interesting and would be a potential way to solve the problem you mention however i think a more elegant solution  one which actually made mining itself more interesting instead of addingon an attentionstealing minigame would be better
as long as they make items people would want the riskreward ratio should be self balancing if the risk is too little for the reward more people start doing fw missions and the price the mission runners sell the items for dropsif the risk is too great people move away from fw missions and the price rises up until we dont have anyone left running them
a possible alternative could be a discount in the militia lp store based on the decorations receivedin practice a militia general would pay 50 random number it is only an example of what a private would pay for the same item but the discount would be operative only as long as he is a militia memberthis way both capturing complex and doing missions would be rewarded capturing complex would be needed to get the decorations doing missions to get the lp
sounds like a good idea in addition one might make those unique items illegal in to use for non fw pilots
a minmatar liberation force rifter would be sooo cool
defaulted to my face changing alt
ummmm you did look in the contract tab didnt you  all the info is there
absolute supportalthough i remember reading somewhere that ccp was planning on upgrading the evemail system completely lets hope they indeed will soon
please dont take offense cheap but what you are talking about is bounty hunting not pirating there is a difference check out the recommendations to changes to that systemo
well the bounty system is just optional for me it is about the lp system where pirates get points for killing other players within lowsec
like all things in eve there will always be a debate on to shoot or not to shoot because honestly this is the only game where if someone is being rude or stupid you just shot their ass to shut them upthe whole thing on ninja looters and salvagers yes i too have been a victim of this to the point where someone actually looted the mission objective then warped away trying to put a price tag on it while others come in and clean out all my wrecks without looting them so i dont have kill rightsaggro should be given to people who ninja salvage but this in turn brings about a lot of problems where as people will dupe you into attacking them since they looted your wreck then instead of ninja salvaging it will be given some fancy new name where the tactic is to get a mission runner to attack the ninja salvager where in turn his buddies will come in and kill the mission runner yes everyone would love to be given to the choice to retaliate or not but it could cause a lot of problems down the line where people from different gangs or party accidentally looses a guy and he comes back only to be killed because people were scamming himi personally think everyone should be given kill rights the freedom to choose if they want to pursue the ninja the way things are now though is still manageable also i think what they should do to fix this mess is to have med and large tractor beams this way people who run l4 missions in battleships will at least have the chance to loot the wreck ultimately people might not want to salvage but i would like to be able to loot my wreck before someone comes in to salvage it losing the loot in the wreckccp has been starting to worry me with a lot of changes that they have been making that look like them catering to noobs since they are getting better and better turnouts with every trail account i dont want this issue to turn into something else to where this game will be just like wow a noob society where the screaming masses of gamers who want to play things in easy mode winaddressing this issue is a problem but i think if a fix should be made then it should be the tractor beams have medium and large sizes that range from 45kms to 60kms for mediums and 70 to 100kms for larges this way everyone can at least have a chance to loot the wreck before someone comes in to take it away from them because almost all l4 battles happen with the ships at least 30 to 60kms away and for a bs to fly to all those wrecks is just too time consumingthey should also release more skill books for mission runners to where we gain an extra percentage extra for every kill that has a bounty i know there is already a book that does that but at l5 it only gives you about 5 to 20k per kill if its a percentage then you gain a lot for every bs kill and moderate extra for every frig kill the extra money however is going to cause inflation which will cause prices for certain items to go up and sooner or later will have to be balanced out so that miners and other types of pilots have ways to make money and arent forced to do missions for moneyall and all those are my 2 cents medium and large tractor beams which doesnt change the game mechanics at all could at least give mission runners a chance to loot the wreckone more thing if you are a ninja salvager ask in local or in convo if you can loot the wrecks i know a lot of people who really dont want to bother salvaging all that crap you could find someone who will willingly tell you where they will do missions so that you can salvage and have a steady supply from reliable sources
i commend you on a very well thought out and respectful postsome do ask however some do not i personally dont and wait and see how the mission runner reacts there have been days where a runner has asked nicely for me to leave and i have other days theyve been less than polite and ive made an example of themit really all depends on the day
i dont even know why people are even suggesting thiswait yes i do its because they are ed that they arent training as fast as everyone else because they dont want to put the time into training their learning skills so instead of having them do it they want everyone else to train just as fast as they do for fear of someone who started earlier getting further then they are you all are just babies everything in eve is a choice that you have to live with why do you want to change a game that finally does what most of the hardcore community wanted we have a choice to do what we want this isnt noobfest usa eve isnt for the light hearted yes we have our occassion noob here and their but do you really want this game to turn into another wow where instead of people having intellectual debates like we are here we end up with first noob flame war suck my  all that dumb nonsenselearning skills are not a waste of time nor were they a bad idea if ccp thinks that then i feel bad for them like anything in this game if you want something you have to put the time into training it  you dont even have to train the long skills since you just do it at the end of your subscription and just come back when its done i hope they dont change that either because i dont think i would play this game if i had to train something for 2months if new players are complaining about it then they should just shut up this game isnt for everyone and is especially not for the noobs that play wow however for some reason you want to turn it into that i have put the time into training my learning skills if they are removed and everyone gets a base set of 5 then why why should people be allowed to recieve something that most people had to train a couple of months foryou know what this is all probably aboutyou probably look at your skills wishing them to go faster but then when you look at your learning skills you dont want to train those just to make something go faster so its not a sense of it being mandatory its a sense of just because you want something to go faster you have to train your learning skills and you just dont want to do that but when you look at the pilots around you who have put in the time and are bragging about how much their skill train time went down you get jealous and angry that you didnt do it from the start and you think about all the time you lost since then just because you didnt spend those 8 days training somethingthere are those who decide to make a choice and then there are those who are indecisive just because you feel regret that you couldnt make a choice doesnt mean you need to punish those who did
i read over this and while the csm got a lot done the issue overall is one of time i dont think a meeting should be going on that long  not just for the comfort of csm members but it got confusing with people leaving though understandably and who was voting and a lot of the votes seemed rushed through particularly when peoples votes would hinge on a particular pointso im starting to see the need for a csmonly forum and probably alternates too given if theyre going to be filling in and actually voting they should probably have a chance to discuss things before hand as well by csmonly i dont mean privacy  i think transparency is important in discussions  but one in which only csm members post to discuss issues amongst themselves visitors to the board are readonly yes we already have a discussion forum for the csm here but thats between players and csm not for the csm to discuss amongst themselves the problem being if they tried to discuss things amongst themselves here players would jump in and then it wouldnt be discussing amongst themselves anymore and yes they can do that in the meetings but then they end up being 5 hours longrather than explanations and arguments in the meeting that could have all been done and dusted on a forum the advantage to a forum over a discussion meeting is that anyone can swing by at their own convenience and in their own time zone  also that they can explore issues more fully the disadvantages would be issues being explored a bit too much and egossniping going on which seems to happen in all forums so it would have to be professional and if not ccp moderatedhosted then self moderatedhosted if possiblethe link to a csm only forum if not ccp hostedmoderated could be posted as a sticky on jita speakers corner so everyone could read what the csms arguments explanations to each other are also theres the issues of the minuteschatlog making sense so when an issue is brought up and briefly described just so csm members remember what it is a link could be put in either at the time or afterwards to the thread on the csm forum so people can read what the arguments between csm members for that issue was i dont think a link to the current eveo csm forums is necessary as players would have already had an opportunity to read all that as well as the opportunity to post and make their own argumentsown votes thereso i wouldnt see it as adding an extra layer of confusing bureaucracy more like removing any explanation argument from the meetings and having those elsewhere nor is it replacing the discussion between csm and players just that its necessary to have discussion between csm members tooso id see the meetings going as3 skills and balancing issues for example the   being changed to the   thread link vote yay or nayyaynaynayyayyay etc then onto 4 basically less debating thered still be  if people had problems  such as errors but most of what they didnt understand or didnt agree with to the specific issue would have already been debated and theyd then know what their vote is without all the ill vote this if you make this clear in the documentsalso there seem to be confusion on the documents  could those have been read before hand posted on a csm only discussion forum or are they only published at the meetings if the latter is true it might save confusion to put a motd on irc sayingfor meeting 9 you should all have docs filename filename filenameto hand for reference  then anyone who doesnt have those knows from the outset that they dont but shouldapologies if ive misunderstoodmisrepresented the process i only follow things vaguely and its what the meeting suggested to metldr  csm onlyforum seems like a good idea in light of long meetings and irc motd with the filenames for documents might be useful
i dont know but even tho the op wanted your view on the situation i dont think it really matters the issue is not going to find a solution based on jades reasoningsbut if you want my opinion leave it the way it is who is to say what loot belongs to who in fleet battles the guy with the most damage the final blow the little frig that tackled the guy so you could kill them in the first placejades view will be skewed anyway
sounds great heres to hoping
i like this idea
it would be interesting if colonies were needed instead of poss for sovereigntythey could be used to produce people ieworkers marines slaves militants the products could in turn be used to establish new colonies and disrupt or conquer foreign coloniesthe inputs would have to be settlers prospectors livestock tourists ect made available in empire
i support this generallymy only thoughts to add would be that with the dread needing split weapons it should be able to do maybe 5 or 10 more damage when fully trained to makeup for the extra time also if possible i would like to hear how these ships were originally balanced when first designed and brought into the game as there ahs obviously been an error somewhere
since your limited by how many poses you can put up total per day per system i dont think this would enable pos spam

i have been reading this thread for a few days now im quite split on this issue i agree that when a new ship is released people should be able to test it for everybodys sake the more testing the betterof course ccp could just apply these skills to all characters but thats timeconsumingso i guess this is the best way to work this out

i propose that an option to vote against a suggestion posted on the assembly hall forum be added this would enable the csm and players reading the forums to more easily assess the actual support for a particular suggestion for instance the post riskreward of empire has 70 votes  a substantial number but that is out of 396 postshow many of those posts are discussion by a few individuals who are in favor how many of the votes are the result of flame war what percentage of posters believe that the ops idea has meritgive us a way to know at a glance  let us vote no

supported im not sure that the exact nerf that ccp has suggested is the best one to fix the problem but nanoships are clearly a gamebreaking issue and make a large percentage of ships and tactics obsolete
so you just finished 245 missions with the sansha or serpintis angel ect and theyre top agent has said to you wow youre doing an amazing job working for us here this is just the best darn work ive seen out of anyoneso you feel all proud of yourself but youre sick of running missions so you go try some time at mining and sit down for a little quiet timerats spawn of the same faction and just start ripping you a new one wtf i just did all your level4 missions what have i done other than sit here to provoke youwhat i proposeadd a loyalty point store function of whatever lp amount ccp deams worthy to put your character on a watch list for npc patrols or something to that degree so that you will not be shot for a period of time be it a day week or month based on lp requirementsalso if you are on their safelist or watchlist you can still be engaged by them under the conditions that only you engage them firstfrankly this should have been introduced the same time that pirate npc missions were made but am i crazy is this a good ideathis feature should also be disabled for those that have the lp to pull it off  but have negative standings
this is something that needs a good fix in empire space you will be shot when you have a negative standing towards a faction when you arrive in theyre space but when you dont you will be left alonepirate factions should work the same wayneutral negative standing  you will be shotpositive standing  you wont be shotits just odd that if you have a positive standing with a faction that you will still be shot
ive never gone out of space controlled by one of the main 4 factions or concord so i had naively assumed that this was how all factions worked its such a basic premise of game design  if youre friendly with a faction they dont try and kill youfrankly i am staggered at the news that you will get shot even with good standing eve does have a standings system and the pirate factions are represented  so they should be used
makes sanse other mmorpgs do the same
with the latest patch making the station window movable so it needs to be pinned making it transparent an option to have pinned windows non transparent is needed as the transparent option makes it very annoying to use with other windows except overview which should be transparent anyway there is no need to pin them but there is with the station windowmake pinning a 3 way selection  offpinnedpinned and transparent
obviously i support this
isnt that what happens in wars the defender must either prevail by whatever means maybe asking for help or they must surrender in this case leave the corp pay the ransom whatever that might be fyi  i have been on both sides of thisthere is infrequenlty a good reason for starting a war but they usually happen i fail to see what point is trying to be made hereby the very statement above however ank is in fact saying the corporations and alliances are bad because they encourage you to get attackedrather than allowing game mechanics to control events let the players a new corp is a prime target sure however their ceo should have made plans for this either with friendly other corps or have some isk to hire someone to help them out without this the ceo has failed and does not deserve that corp when it splits the players will go to another bigger corp and um guess what be safe with other playersthe consequences areyou winyou loseyou surrenderthe corp splitsnow you are talking more sensei personally believe that some of the csm are being narrow minded and on a single track and this is to dumb things down and take the control from the player and put it into the game frankly this worries me because it resembles governments controlling people by rules regulations and redtape rather than using common senseexample new roads on new housing estates in the uk are short and have many sharp right and turns the reason to stop boy racers driving at 90 miles an hour in a built up area this is what the csm and ccp are moving towards the real answer to the problem is not to hit everyone with that punishment but to educate them better in the case here drivers to be made aware of what they are doing and face the consequences if they dont the same applies to eve rather than changing the road setup read game mechanics ccp and the csm need to educate and inform the players of what is expected along that roadthe protection comes from oneself and learning how to do it not from a set of strictures and rules that force actions upon you this simply turns people into mindless robots following instructionsi have experienced all of this first hand and i still play eve i read once on the forumwebsite as my first day as a newbie a phrase that got me very far and made sure i was safe assume everyone wants to kill youexcercise caution learn educate yourself and learn how to look after yourself do not rely on the system to protect you because the moment you do that you surrender yourself to that system and become a mindless robot to itlink to what id said in a previous topic that lead me here
no she says that eve is bad because you can pvp i guess her game developer job means she is making 2d flash games
if the problem is an overpowered profession and the majority of the player base use it then there is no way to fix it without screwing them overand the only reason missioning is a huge portion of the game is because its the perfect money makershould we move crokitebistot and the highend 1010 ded plexes to hisec why not
believe it or not a large percentage of those players like to run missions same as some people like to mine ice why i cant comprehend why i feel my soul shriveling even tryinglooks nope they arent there now hence for me to ask for them would be a major gamealtering feat i would be hardpressed for even considering getting people or ccp to agree with this one the status quo and all that mentioned aboveif we were discussing whether level 4s belonged in highsec before they were first implemented you might be able to pursuade me but it is way too late to take them out now it would be like telling 00 players hey we want to balance everything no more sovereignty no more caps and concord will be at every gate to make things safer and more playerfriendlytoo much of what your average player does in eve revolves around missions and the results there of you cant just take such a significant part of their daily eve lives out without huge consequences it would cause more subscription losses than going to consensual pvp in high sec i can pretty much guarantee and is as radical of a move to those players it would effectand yes moving level 4s to lowsec is taking them away from the majority of highsec players because they will not go there to run missions something the pvper types dont seem to understand maybe try listening to some of the carebears for once and learning how they thinkright now eve is a pretty good balance between pve and pvp players leave it alone
even so kahega hits the point you cant fix overpowered missions without screwing over the people who run those missions sure make them more fun make them more dynamic just make them pay a lot less its like the nano nerf you cant nerf nanos without screwing over the people who fly nanos i bet they really think its fun to fly nanos but thats beside the pointno you make the pvepvp distinction where no such distinction should be pve should only be possible in a highly competitive environment there should be no free rides
so you keep saying ccp says otherwiseyou still havent convinced me why your idea would be good for eve as a game and ensure its survival
i had a lengthy post written with arguments and such why bother  screw the missions so i wont regret not continuing my subscription its the last thing still keeping me in game but why would anybody bother righti think the goons realy are successful with destroying the game for everybody else and some people even help them 
level 1  10  09level 2  08  07level 3  06  05 level 4  04  03level 5  02  01 as the stations in 00 are mostly player ran giving them mission agents wont work well i say this because they are not stable enough for consistent missioning conquerable 
good luck w this ccp dont seem to care or have the ability to do anything about lagplus they rather keep adding useless things to the game like faction warfare this ambulation crap they want to add etc etc that only add to the lag issue in order to gain more and more subscribers which also adds to lagso in other words they are only worried about increasing thier income from this game and thats itimho the only way we going to fix it is to put a dent in thier income and then maybe just maybe they will get thier heads out thier arse
walking in stations will a hopefully be on dedicated servers and remove the stresses to the in space serversb keep the akfers in major trade hubs in seperated servers while they are in stationc prolly not set up at this time to be on seperate servers at this time and will only increase lag with virtual lap dances by manginas for isk
good pointsbut then if we all protested by not playing it kinda defeats the need to fix lag as there wouldnt be any pilots shooting each other and we wouldnt be posting here anymore i really believe that changes could be made in the server that would improve things regarding lag within fleet battle systems when they occur however i do admit it would involve ccp investing heavily to fundamentally change the software and hardware running eve at some point in the future well not see anymore huge battles because there will be a new 5th empire within eve controlling vast tracts of space or ccp will have so many subscribers walking in stations screwing around theyll be no more laggy pew pew in spaceif eve ever breaks 500000 subscribers and 50000 online consistently ccp will be forced to do away with massive fleet battles all together or replace the server and software with something more dynamically scalable and much higher performance
the disadvantages of shield tanking in pvp have been well known for as long as i have been in eve and largely boil down to the fact that warp disruptors scramblers webbers and microwarpdrives  modules that are considered essential for pvp  take up midslots which shield tankers need for their tank in contrast armor tankers who use lowslots for their tanks generally have free midslots to spare for these essential modulesto address part of this problem in a balanced way i propose a new module be createdprototype warp disruption generatorrange  20kmwarp scramble strength  2requires propulsion jamming ivcap usage  510caps balance pointfitting requirements  2 pg 60 cpu balance pointpossible objectionswont this make caldari overpoweredno while this would certainly make caldari more viable in pvp the fitting requirements and cap usage of this new module would make it difficult to use on most current caldari fits a passive drake would have to give up 12 shield power relays in order to remain cap stable and either fit a cpu upgrade or give up a missile launcher to handle the additional cpu required to make the module work ravens and other caldari ships with extra highslots would be similarly affected many traditionally passive tanked ships may have to go for an active tank in order to fit this module effectivelyfurthermore giving shield tanking ships a highslot tackle does not miraculously fix all their problems  mwds webbers and cap boosters still compete for valuable midslots a caldari pilot would either need to further sacrifice their tank to fit these modules or would have to rely upon other ships to fill these rolesdoesnt this change just boost caldari at the expense of everyone elseno this boost would also aid minmatar shield tankers and make any shield tank pvp ship more viable and enjoyable
hi im not sure you play eveonline so you may not have realised this low slots which are used for armour tank are also used for damage modsarmour tankers choose between gank and tank caldari choose between tackle and tank
partially true in reality however most caldari tanks require both midslots and lowslots to be effective the lowslots are either used for shield power relays to increase passive tanking or for pduscap flux coils to make active shield tanking sustainable so it would be more accurate to say that caldari choose between tank gank and tackle while armor tankers choose between gank and tank and get tackle basically for freeadd to this equation that hybrids projectiles and lasers have had their damage balanced so that they require fewer damage modules to get the same damage as missiles  the traditional caldari weapon and the disparity increases as a test for whether the current situation is really balanced ask yourself whether you would be happy if the situation were reversed and damage mods required midslots and tacklemwdcap boosters took up lowslots im guessing that armor tanking pilots would consider this a nerf and would not be happy about it to me that is a fairly good indication that the tradeoff you just mentioned favors armor tankers to the exclusion of shield tankersone last note  the high cpu requirements of the module i proposed would require a caldari pilot to sacrifice either a high or lowslot ie give up a damage mod in order to fit a cpu upgrade or give up a missile launcher that would seem to solve the problem of caldari getting to keep their high damage while fitting a tackle
wrong shield tanks can be passive armour tanks cannot because they dont have natural regen therefore they require cap which because lows are used by damage mods  tank are found in the mid slots in the form of cap rechargers and as for missiles you seem to forget that missiles dont have to worry about tracking or falloff which id say makes up for the minimal damage loss
to answer your first point  yes shield tanks can be passive however an effective passive tank requires both mid and lowslots essentially a passive shield tank requires that you sacrifice both tackle and gank this is fine for passive tanking your drake for missions where neither gank or tackle are that neccesary but is nearly worthless in pvp the cap problem faced by active armor tankers is also faced by active shield tankers with the notable difference that armor tankers can fit cap boosters without sacrificing tank while active shield tankers have to give up a valuable tankrequired midslot to do the same not to mention that armor reppers require less cap for the same amount of repairon your second point you seem to forget that missiles take time to reach their target  allowing a target to warp away before being hit this makes missiles worthless for sniping furthermore armor tanking ships can easily fit webbers and mwds  which negate the disadvantages of tracking substantially missile users still have to deal with speed  which reduces damage per missile and in extreme cases makes a target impossible to hit basically mechanics that are similar to tracking penalties also gun users have access to tracking computers which increase both range and tracking  a module that missile dont have access to essentially if your missile range or speed is inadequate you have to fit rigs or just be content to fire uselesslyfinally caldari ships generally cannot use the same sizequality of drones as their sameclass counterparts which again negates the caldari damage advantageagain i ask you to consider whether it would be a nerf on armor tanking if the tables were turned and tackle modules were moved to lowslots and damage mods to midslots or put it another way  would you rather have a drake or a brutix sitting with you on that gate a megathron or a rokh i think the answer is pretty obvious and my time spent reading battleclinic killmails would seem to support the fact that shield tanking is less viable in pvp than armor tanking
i agree that shield tanks are weaker than armor tank i think this can be proved by looking at the  of players who use the various tank types please ccp run data base querry and release real numbersi think the solution is to buff shield tanking some how not to make armor and shield tank more alike i think the best way is toa give shield 20 higher resists example 15 armor 5 thermal this should be based on the most common damage types ie if thermal is the most common damage type add to the resistsb my favorite and xl shield extenders multiple titans are a growing factor in 00 warfare xl sheild extenders ie double strength large would free up extra tanking slot therefore making shield tankers strongerc buff faction shield gear many sheild items such as gallente navy rep fleet etc are not as good as t2 items i would recommend boosting all faction sheild mods by 10 i think the huge cost of these items would keep it in balance boost only the main itemd how about faction damage controls as an idea this helps shield tankers more than armor tankersthere are many more possiblilities
overpowered much
neutrals in 00 are killed bocs they are threat to your members not bcos they are threat to your infrastructure also as 00 has no unlimited resources it makes sense to keep others away from your resources
i know this is a big departure but what if we moved all the belt rats to key areas each system would have the same number of key areas as belts these key areas would be like the faction warfare sites except instead of limiting types of ships they would be limiting number of players i think warfare without mwd would be fun at times i would like to see some key areas be dead spaces
this makes a lot of sense but i would like to see only npc items auto supplied and i would like to see a cost premium of 15 added to the bill shipping and handlinganother option would be to use the all items includig ice products but i would like to see the npc required to buy the product off the market
i have to agree ui customization is always good in an mmo but i have to admit that this ui is a lot more flexible than most others which is awesomea lot of combat sounds in this game are just annoying though especially missile sounds while doing some missions you just get pelted for 10 minutes with ultra loud fire crackers it seems more of a nuisance than weapon dont you thinkanyway yes more work can go into equalizing stuff and other neat effects even just based on camera distance for instance hearing some thumpyominous low frequency crossover effects would be cool kind of like hearing a battle from far away just being able to alter or tone down the missile sounds will make me very happy

i propose we move the people who are okay with the lag to servers from back when clinton was president that way we don t have lag on tranquility and they can go live on lagville
if i notice the lag caused by the servers there is too much even when it is well within tolerable levelsim assuming that all the lag fixes i can think of have either been implemented or have been ruled out by ccp so i have nothing more to say
a simple proposition when a shield booster module or armorhull repairer is activated it should turn itself off when theres nothing left to boostrepair and if your shield is full you wont be able to use shield booster module this could be implemented as an option available when rightclicking the module in space
what a good idea although keep it optional dont want to give us permatankers the heebiejeebies now do we

outside of 00 pods are generally pretty safe so i dont think removing them would be a wise choicespamming warp as you start to hit deep structure tends to get you out 95 of the time barring lag poor luck smartbombs etc
while increasing the availability of jump clones would help the 24hr jc timer still impacts pvp availability if i am in my implant clone and the a neutralred comes into system i have to decide whether the target is really worth jumping to my other clone 8 jumps away and taking a 24 hour skill training nerf of course each time i jump into my implanted clone i am effectively locked out of pvp for 24 hours unless i want to risk my implants thus negating the advantage of jcs in the first placealso for a pilot in 00 the old click warp trick often doesnt work due to the prevalence of warp bubbles pvping in 00 in a implanted clone is therefore even more dangerous than in lowsec a danger which often i think leads to pilots foregoing pvp for fear of losing hundreds of millions worth of implants  the whole problem i am seeking to addressi am certainly not asking that implants be removed from the game  that would be overkill and probably very unlikely  but what about making standard nonpirate implants insurable that would remedy some of the ill effects of the implant system
imo insurable implants would be counterproductive because what would happen is that if the implants were insured for around what you bought them for no one would ever worry about losing them and people would end up losing them right and left that means that once they get their insurance money and go to buy new implants theres a huge demand which means implant prices go up this is compounded by the fact that the insurance puts a price floor on implants so in the end you might end up paying more for implants after this proposal than you do now
suggestions then it seems the prevailing opinion is implants are fine  yeah they discourage pvp but thats too much trouble to fixis there a way to fix this can i get some support saying its worth talking about or am i the only person who thinks its worth debating
supported
yesget a jumpclone only fly what you can afford to loose
implants are pretty cheap you dont need huge amounts of isk to use them set up some jump clones use a 4 for primary stat 3 to secondary stat and youre risking less than 30m at a timeas for insurance no just no the last thing eve needs is another isk source
despite the fact that you have apparently neglected to read what i previously posted ill respondit seems that fly what you can afford to lose can become only pvp in a clone you can afford to lose serious pilots will want to insure that they increase their rate of sp gain to its max 4 implants all the time if possible thus even with a unimplanted jc they have to sacrifice 24 hours of ideal skill training time to avoid risking their nice implants furthermore when they switch back to their implanted clone they have to wait an additional 24 hours until they can go back to their unimplanted clone and pvp safely this leads to scenarios like what i encountered yesterday a neutral comes into system i have an onyx in the hanger and a friend in system with me however im in my implanted clone should i bother to switch to an unimplanted clone and pursue the neutral is one potential fight worth the 24 hours wait until i can get back to max skill training or is this guy just in a damn shuttle or cov ops ship hopping from system to system having implants just adds another level of decision making to the should i pvp or not thought process we already have to contend with what is this guy flying does he have friends is this a trap is pvp likely enough that im willing to take a break from ratting mining etc to chase after it and so on it seems to me that the last thing eve needs is another barrier in terms of either time or financial risk to pvp participation thinking more about the issue two ideas occur to me although i believe supporting this post would only require that you agree that changing the implant system is worth mentioning to ccp 1 make implants insurable this would provide a moderate isk sink like all insurance and instead of having multiple tiers of coverage platinum gold etc there would likely only be one tier the payout could be something like 80 of the value of the implants that way riding into pvp in an implanted clone would still cost something but not be a total deterrent factionpirate implants would likely be insurable but only in the way that t2 ships are insurable  for a fraction of their real value this would prevent pirate implants becoming musthave items under this system2 reduce the time delay between clone jumps substantially perhaps down to 16 hours this would make choosing to enter pvp without implants less of a sp sink while encouraging players to log on a bit more frequently something ccp likes and is thus more likely to implement
new skill advanced jump clone name up for grabs20 timer for j cloning per lv
see now thats a brilliant suggestion maybe it could require jump clone iv though a 20 per level might be too much at level 5 there would be no timer which would likely be too big of a database hog perhaps a 15 reduction or a 4 hour time reduction per level
lets examine this claim about cost assuming that someone just keeps a set of 4 3s in their implanted clone no charisma implant thats a potential loss of about 45mil isk in 00 ive found that i average about 18 iskhr ratting in my raven thus it would require about 25 hours of ratting simply to replace those implants while that isnt a huge amount of isk two and a half hours is a fair amount of time  enough that the thought of replacing those implants definitely gives me an incentive not to pvp casually add into that consideration that the cost of replacing a rigged bc is about 70mil isk and you are talking about a loss of 115mil isk per podding or about 65 hours worth of ratting to replace both ship and pod not including the time it takes hopping systems to collect implants and modules that is a substantial amount of real life time that i have to risk every time i pvp the amount of real life time lost increases if a player has 4s as most serious players do faction implants or doesnt have access to 00 and must either mine or run missions for a livingin all implants do pose a considerable barrier to pvp while there are ways to minimize the risks associated with owning implants it seems that the implant system encourages carebearing over combat id like to see battles become more frequent and people feel free to take greater risks in pvp maybe then wed see a change in the 80 of players stay in highsec statistics
this is enough to keep casual players out of pvp30m might not seem like much to a vet player or someone who puts in hours per day but for someone who can only run 1 or 2 missions per week a loss of 4 implants can put a good monthlong dent in play time
ok now for my own suggestionmuch talk goes into a balanced suggestion easier jumpclones insurance smaller jumpclone window etcall these really do is decrease the barrier they do not remove itso my suggestion any one of the following1split combat and learning implants into something handled differently by the codebase learning implants are simply not lost when you are podkilled2 learning implants are removable  take them out and leave them in your hanger3 zero jumpclone timeany of these make it easier for even new or poor players to jump into pvp at a moments notice without having to worry about slowing down their skilling which especially for young or moderate players is a big deal since skills are the gateway to what content you can access
id be fine with any of those suggestions my only concern is that the hardcore playerbase not to mention ccp would be unwilling to support such sweeping changesperhaps this problem should be discussed in a larger context  namely that pvp the lifeblood of this game is too hard to get into implants are part of that problem but only a partoh and id love it if your suggestions came with a support since you seem to also think that the current system is in need of revision 
i would be happy to see all implants done away with and combat boosters too then at least every player in the game would be equal as far as combat goes with the only differences being upon the skills trained and fittings choosen not the ability to spend billions on pirate sets to boot ones speed armour dps whatever would probably be no need for the nano nerf either if the speed boosting implants did not exist gang bonuses are another item which disadvantages some pilots
then you use a 3 and a 2 and stay the hell out of 00in empire the only way you should lose your pod is to smartbombs or to an unusually large blob

why not a spray shop module for stations i dunno bout the rest of you guys but dont you find a bit boring that on the outside your class of ship looks exactly the same as somone else with the same ship classwhy cant we personalise our ships by doing our own paint jobs with the options for standard corp colour schemes so your corp or alliance has the same colour scheme regarless of ship class also have the options to put logostext onto the ship as well
i am sure there is only 1 reason lag
actually there are 2immature teenagers and lag
yup theese two reasons would be enough not to implement thisedit heres the third one unable to do a propper content filtering you could put some text on the image that you want to use as a skin for your ship  lots of advertising i hate ads great new source of keylogger victims etc and yes unappropriate content

id think id borrow everybodys cpu and put a covops cloak on a titan
personally i think the covops cloak is flawed anyways it doesnt need a huge cpu to go along with the other ships having a buff to counter the covops cloak should simply say can only be mounted on covops crafthowever that is at least taking my idea into consideration if a titan wants to fit something big and nifty then it needs a sufficient fleet beneath it to supply the resources it would keep fleets from deploying a dozen titans and little else since each one would be practically useless without all the bells and whistles they like to have without a supporting fleet the titan could barely keep their repper online while everything else would be offline until the fightanother point of this approach is the detrimental effect of losing your fleetmates as ships go down during the battle the capitals would lose the resources being provided by that ship lose too much and your gear starts going offline starting with the heaviest items first doomsday drone control etc until the capitals are forced to withdraw then the battle could continue with the smaller craft without the looming threat of dd annihilation overhead
marcus that would be a blob multiplier you would see huge blobs that sounds pretty crappy
to move 40 carriers from empire to deep 00 and back costs roughly 16 billionfor one return trip  thats just 40 carriers now add dreads  super caps  extra fuel for jump bridging  stront for your dreads capital maintenance costs are very expensive where large fleets are concerned  i dont know where the idea that every 00 entity is a 160 billion a day earner idea gets started but its just not like that  capital warfare costs go beyond just the fuel for the ships consider the pos deathstars that are required for jumping and staying in for safety at a billion a pop

imho eve is about the choices we make and the consequences of those choiceslearning skills are just another facet of those choiceswhat makes eve so enjoyable as an mmorpg is its depth and variety of choices ie skills etc learning skills are not compulsorythey are not required to learn other skills lol except for other learning skills but they do present a set of choices that can affect the choices you make laterall the more reason to love em
if you journy into eve industrialization to any depth one problem youll encounder is the discrimination of bpcs from bpos i typically have 550 blueprint copies of any given blueprint original currently the only way you can find your bpo amongst a set of bpcs is to open every single one checking to see if it is the original the typical work around is to never store your bpos in the same hanger as the bpcs when you finish a copy job they all get dumped together and the search begins chewing up time and bandwidthsolution please just change the backgroud color of the bpcsdb deckard
im pretty sure this one has been around the block a few times already but cant be done sorry basically as we were told by devs a while back a bpo and a bpc are in fact exactly the same item so far as eve is concerned the only difference is in the production limit there were thoughts being cast though as to what options might be practical but they arent as simple as being able to change the colouriz

station camping valid tactic as it is is causing horrendous lag and unnecessary traffic to various systems most notably jitarandomized or multiple undocking paths are the way to gomakes it harder to camp and it wont cause stupid traffic jams much like driving the bloody freewayall im saying is if im going to leave the station get the  outa my way so i can go blow something up o pps i said station camping is a valid tactic but its making a lot of people suffer when they arent even the target to begin with not to mention turning various systems into slum systems with there smack talk
i support thisalso personal hangar divisions just like corp ones which is for me a more annoying issue so we dont have to keep all of our stuff in cans
the thing is rats and mission corps are actually diff corps with different standings iircthats so that one may rat all day and still do their missions if they ever want to down the trackstandings are only reduced when you do a misison against say sanshas nation for a caldari agent not when rattingplz correct me if im wrong
missions affect the corp and faction standing rattings affects teh corp standing onlyalso we should have some empire navy spawns in some belts for the pirate minded to hunt as rats di think you shouldnt be shot by pirates for 20 standing and up and by empire for 20 and up pirates are more likely to want your stuff

id be scared that if we demanded this  it would take much longer to see this game mechanic installed before we let our imaginations free againwhat ive proposed uses all the mechanics the game already has and i would really like to see it in play
why would they do thatthey are pirates
theyre pirates which means theyre interested in money the angel cartel has an entire division devoted to guarding serpentis since serpentis pays so well obviously if you do a lot of missions for a pirate faction they should realize that theyll make more money letting you live than killing you
they have fixed the lag before people just keep adding more people to fleets when they fix the lag this time it will just happen againi would rather have more new content then extending blob warfare which is rather boring and anyway the new sovereignty proposal is going to get rid of blob warfares practicality
wow thisoh and to the op plz edit ur post and meniton how  the system of getting primaried is no i dont mean by shiptype as htats fair i mean by alphabet it sucks that the only thing determining wether u live or die in massive fleets is ur name and not skillplz remove alphabet enabled overview

leave the tech lab alone its practically the one section on this forum with almost 100 quality posts rather then random crap like caod and its got some great information
im not entirely sure what you are referring to as overpowered the module i proposed perhaps i essentially based it on the warp disruptor  giving it the same same range less if you include t2 warp disruptors roughly double the cpu pg and cap use requirements and an additional scramble point to offset the huge costs of fitting it i doubt anyone except a shield tanker would prefer this thing over the existing t1 warp disruptor i cant imagine how this thing would be overpoweredto repeat my position in stronger words  t1 caldari ships and other shield tankers suck at pvp in a way that no other race does period i doubt that is even debatable while caldari do have several good t2 niche ships recons sbs hictors interceptors etc their meat and potatoes ships  bss bcs cruisers and hacs are grossly inferior to other ships of the same class in pvp primarily because their tank requires that they forego many of the modules that are so essential for pvp to list just a fewcap boosterssensor boosterswarp disruptorsscramblersmicrowarpdrivesafterburnerstracking computers rokheagleferoxmoastasis webbifiersremote sensor dampenerstracking disruptorsecma shield tanker who wants to put up any significant defense will likely only be able to fit one of these midslot modulesin contrast heres what an armor tanker might have to give up to fit their tankdamage modulescap power relayscap flux coilsreactor controlpower diagnostic unitsbackup sensor arraysoh and passive shield tankers would have to give up this same list of modules just for added nerfingshield tanking and armor tanking arent even close to even in pvp this proposal wouldnt make shield tanking more powerful than armor tanking  in fact it would still be a far cry from making them even it would help a little though maybe enough that pvp drakes ravens and rokhs would be able to fit both a mwd and tackle or webber and tackle maybe enough that they would cease to be punchlinesif that seems overpowered to you we must be playing different games
caldari is fine and does not need fixing we do not need highslot tackle and it would not be good for the gameedityou mention pvp passive drake and shield power relays in the same sentence i dont think that you really know what youre talking about second edit ive read the rest of your comments oh dear
this is kinda my point  the thought of flying a passive drake in pvp is ludicrous a joke this despite the fact that a passive drake can simultaneously put out 500600 effective hp recharge and still deal 450dps by the numbers one would think this is a great ship for combat unfortunately the very thing this ship is designed to do passive shield tank requires that it be totally gimped in pvp
brick drakes are also slow and have huge signature radius for even easier targetting i couldnt tell you the numbers but shots against drakes are typically higher quality because they have to dedicate almost every slot to their tank and then a nos or neut still turns off their hardeners and destroys themcereberus arent bad snipers even with the missile issues however i am not sure how well any caldari ships can do close range part of it is the bonuses are typically range bonuses more than damage bonuses like gallente but the other part is the lack of survivability or usefullness up close becuase of the choices you mentioned i could support this or something like the other poster said
i dont understand you mention pvp but describe mission fits
its not the lack of a scrambler  somebody else can tackle its the lack of a mwd that makes them terrible
my point is that shield tanks  and particularly passive shield tanks  are only useful for mission running and all caldari ships are designed to active or passive shield tank i think that shield tanks including passive shield tanks  should be useful in pvp  and i think they would be if they didnt keep you from fitting any useful pvp modsi would also agree with that poster that said that mwds are more the problem than tackle that may be but i suspect that the speed changes coming down the pipe will help even the field in that regardmy first time enjoying pvp in a caldari ship was when i got my onyx the gank and tank on it was decent  much less than i could get on a drake  but having that highslot tackle made the thing a decent gatecamper now obviously i dont want drakes running around with hictor tackles but it got me thinking that caldari ships could find a role in pvp if they had access to tackle
the grass isnt always greener on the other side
no this is all wrong ask for some advice about pvp fittings the best pvp tanks are neither active nor passive theyre buffer tanks and they work just as well for shields as they do for armour  the lesser ehp boost from lses relative to 1600 plates is countered by inv fields being superior to eanms and the small regen you get on shield buffer tanksthe drake in particular is a formidable pvp bc it fits a solid buffer tank with decent dps and mwd and full tackle  the onyx is just a hic
yes ive fitted a drake that way and it does work quite well for many application there are however times when a repping fit would be much better  and in that regard shield tanking falls on the wayside
caldari ships suck when players fit them wrong that is not news mission fits do not work in pvp period cap flux coils and pdus fact caldari lowslots are used for damage mods three minimum and a damage control iiyou rely on buffer rather then tank to carry you through caldari ships do this well if you want to active tank then you use a cap booster just like every other sane person in pvp doesthere are no times when a repping fit is better then a gank  buffer fit outside of a 1v1 or niche applications such as sitting permaagressed on a gate and assuming a tankbonused shipin even a twoman gang any repping fit is just a total wastefact is highslot scramblers would be amazingly overpowered take a drake currently it will generally kill any other bc add a highslot scrambler and even a slaved pimped mad gank bc has no chance whatsoever and you cant tank a drakes damage output can you say overpoweredhell take a raven a buffer tanked raven will most likely read certainly at equal skills kill a megathron if the fight starts in megathrons optimal range if you fit raven with web  point the only way mega can win is by spending 700m on implants so it can match the effective hp give the raven another free midslot and what is the reason to fly a mega ever seriously now
congrats what youve basically described here are static complexes which used to exist in 00 and were removed due to a various exploits with the complexes b the inclusion of exploration complexes as a replacementthe issues with 00 sovereignty are much deeper than what you propose many solutions for the sovereignty and 00 warfare issue have been discussed endlessly for a few years now outside of this thread
pos warfare is te failpants atmfix plzmake it more small scale not by only x ships in x spotbut by making it more important to do several tasks with smaller gangs at once rather that blobfest on a pos stylealso isk from i dunno concord  for patrolling systems to cough stop rats cough without needing to rat lol would encourage constant roams earn while u pvp brilliant

i know im late to the game but i just got a ship that could fit a clone bay the rorqual in my excitement i started a deep mining operation and jumped some miners out to my nice new rorqualonly to discover that youre basically screwed now that youre out there because you cant use the jump bay to go back what is the point of a clone bay that is one way onlyalso why do you charge me 100k isk to install and i get none of it its my clone bay if theres a fee for using it i should get thatclone bay needs to act just like a station i should be able to leave from there just like when i leave a station and leave my implanted clone behindthat or let me dock pods so i can jump them home

right now your hangar is just a huge pile of junk you have to sort through often it gets really cluttered with stuff you dont use so you have to keep rummaging through all the useless items to get to the ones you needit would be much better if you could have several different hangar divisions so you could tell where everything is without having to scroll past 700 pieces of junk
thats a great idea strill what an original and creative suggestion
great idea more useful than the wallet imo
um have you ever heard of station containersvaultswherahousesthese are baicly huge boxes of a million cubic meaters and above that you can use for the purpuses of filling moduals and packaged ships very usefull and they are seeded at all stations baring outpostsim not saying this dosent have any merit it does would make my life slightly easyer but there is already an alternitive that works pretty well
those have pretty big disadvantages like you cant see whats in them unless youre docked at the station theyre at and you cant sell their contents unless you empty them
the solution here is an upgrade to station container functionality make them accessible remotelyintentional access only for lag reasons make them able to store spaceexpanding containers and make them able to store unpackaged ships also make a nonsecure variety
awwwi think it would help to get divisions station containers etc are great but if you move home you have to have them left about for 3 weeks till you can repackage them if i recall correctly
oh yeahthumbs
yes ive never been successful in filling a station container which can be purchased at any station i think but if this was created it would need to have a poweroff switch if i only want one bay  ill only ask for one seems like another window to get stuck to something and have to pull apart  then reapply glue and all that there junk
bad idea simply due to the fact that is there is a mechanism for this you can bet ccp will add a bug oops feature to enable it at bad timesyou can always set autorepeat off and hit it when you need it for 1 cycle
yet if its optional then this problem is solved im not suggesting that this would be even the default option so if you play the game without changing this setting you wont have any problems since everything would be just like it is nowsetting autorepeat off is not very usefull when doing missions having to deal with multiple targets i usualy forget to deactivate the shield booster and my cap runs dry since im an active shield tanker this is just one of the reasons why i suggested this change
not supported as sometimes its a good idea to turn the booster on early if one wants to tank alpha sure boosters arent for alpha tank but meh least theres an option there if hp tanks get nerfedleave as is tks
not supported i like being able to keep my reppers on all the time without having to worry about them turning off
i wouldnt use this option for pve although i might for pvp but it should be there although if you wanted to make the option really useful make it leave autorepeat on and just skip cycles that might make it a little too easy though
torn on this true autorepeat handles most of this feature but there is one area that it might be of benefit high lag engagements where normally running an active tank is just another way of draining your cap to zeroif the feature can work reliably in highlag situations like drones then supported otherwise this is superfluous
noit makes pve and pvp in eve even more boringlet us be aware of whole situation while taking punishment
support for lag fests coming back to no cap is annoying when i havent been able to turn anything onoff for 2 minutes
think his point is that people do exactly that  they stay out of 00 and fit lesser implants this results in a larger and larger disparity between casual and hardcore players which most of us i think would agree is bad for the game in the long run ccp has repeatedly said that they want more players out in 00 and lowsec i think that implants along with other systems prevent that from happening and a few changes would go a long way to easing the transition without dumbing down the game24 hours jc cooldowns dont make the game more interesting or challenging its an arbitrary number which simply serves to make life more irritating and discourage pvp participation
for pretty much any change there will be people complaining and lamenting the end of eve as we know it and wow in space but ultimatly if ccp did something along these lines i think people would end up happier long term as more casual players enter pvp and sp gains level out between carebares and other groups and of course you still have to decide between high grade learning implants and those low leanring bonus  bonus to combat implants versions so there would still be a trade off in implants
thiscurrently jcs are a tool for the total carebear with 80 standings requirementalso the 24 hour delay could be lessenedtheres little reason to lose implants in lowsec basically smartbombs and getting horribly horribly lagged out
excactlyunless they dmg by 4 and make racial effectively no change in total dps then no support
no they dontforcing people to just blob more and fight less actual fights at gates is bad sentries are fine really they raise the bar for camping to a bc for limited sentry action or a tanked t2 cruiser so you dont get all the annoying instalocking interceptors and suchnerfing pirates trying to fight under sentries even more is just a bad thing sentries are already a significant advantage on the side of fw  antipirate gangs which insist on fighting us at gates they remove a solid part of our dps via drone killing and contribute to the overall damage in addition to preventing us from using faster lighter ships which we occasionally needif you think that increased sentry damage would make people stop gatecamping it wont itll stop the easy to avoid 12 man gatecamp and it will nerf actual interesting fights under sentries where we already have a disadvantage since we do get sentry aggro if we remote rep each other or shoot someone who has agressed our gang mates which is really stupidwhat you people seem to want is for haulers to be unmolested the whole point of gatecamping is killing people in transit nobody is going to stick 500m of stuff in a t1 ship costing 1 mil and go afk sit in a belt they will occasionally stick 500m of stuff in a t1 ship costing 1 mil and autopilot while in transit however catching and killing these people is the point of gatecampstravel must be interdictablebtw someone solo camping  what are you whining about yes ship tanks have increased so did ship dps of people you attempt to fight and so did hp of people you attempt to fight too i would laugh at the gatecamper trying to fight a ship of equal size under sentries yeah sure you can get a drake to tank 1000 dps and have a point if you sink 80million into it my hurricane delivers about 800 dps  352 dps from sentries want to know how much time it takes for the 80 mil sentry tanking drake to go splata lone gatecamper in a bc is after killing industrial ships and t1 cruisers piloted by absolute nubbins attacking a properly fitted t1 cruiser while tanking sentries in a bc is very risky much less trying to pick a real fight
itll promote more ss  dock tactics by gatecampers to avoid fights which are already very annoying under sentries but will not deter us from gatecamping and ganking 51so it achieves precisely the opposite of what you want
maybe it is time to reexamine gate guns in general possibly even getting rid of them all together or at least make them destructible they are pretty useless at this point anything big enough to tank them will wipe out a t1 indy and anything small that might have been an interesting fight gets popped in no time they also discourage young pirates leaving camps to the people who have the spisk for battleships which granted is no longer a big deal
the issue is that removing gate guns would make lowsec more dangerous for legitimate lowsec dwellers the same way fw and the associated gangs of small fast and fast locking ships has made lowsec more dangerous for pirates personally i used to roam in bigger ships without too many worries except running into a really big and really organized gatecamp those days are goneitd effectively mean that even frigatesetc would get caught and killed and cloakers would have a much much harder time given a ceptor can mwd and decloak it in mere second cruisers would literally stand no chance and nanoships would get much more common in hands of piratesall that is really a bad thing i like lowsec for what it is well fw killed a part of it but oh well a place where you have good reasons to fly bigger ships and where someone in a frigate or interceptor or agile af can roam far and free without too many worries sans smartbombs id like to keep that placewhich would increase the sp required to compete  its reasonably easy to get in a bc and much harder to get in a hac
i dont know if this has been brought up already but this has been an issue for as long as i can remember and i know a lot of people who turned off the sound completely because of this ccp really does need to put something like a game sounds slider in the audio tab like it does for music auras voice ui sounds etc lots of people like having ui sounds and background music but find sounds such as cloaking or jumping gates very annoying and sounds like autocannons firing to interfere with voice comms during battle
i agree this is needed and i would use it if it were available i currently have sound off while i play
eve has sound seriously though the whole system needs an overhaul badly
you can really advertise something by having a different colour shipkeyloggers how exactly this isnt a mod
lag would be no worse than loading char avatars or personalised names on ships imo

lets take this from a player and game stand point for the longest time from the point eve was created the game was mostly advertised by word of mouth when such mouth would describe eve it would describe it as a vast world with limitless possibilities but cold and dark repercussions for the unaware what made and what currently makes this game is the fact that it is player ran and player based pvp as you so describe as a versus between players is an ignorant remark to video games in general this game strives on the fact that its a cold world and that people have equal opportunity if you were the victim of a gate camp well then that is your fault who told you to go into low sec without a scout if you got hit in high sec well again thats your fault for not paying attention to what your doing i once lost over 200m to 300m worth of mods and implants because i was carelessly transporting to jita i thought that if i autopiloted there i would be safe by the time i returned from whatever i was doing in the age before warp to 0 when bookmarks were a lucrative business i was horribly mistaken when i get back im in my pod and my ship was destroyed almost everything blew up in the explosion so the suicide was worth nothing however when i realized what happen i was more angry with myself because i knew better i knew what people were capable of and i knew what i was transporting was valuable enough to suicide run forpeople who do it just to make someone cry people who do it as a business these are the game mechanics and i hope it doesnt change i dont want this game turning into another wow a game where people complain because they dont want to make a choice with the options they were giventhe market would also fall if we took out the pvp or gave people the option to fly where they wanted without consequence how you ask where do you think the stuff from the market comes from how does everything get built for what purpose do people put out sell orders and buy orders its because we need it its supply and demand if someone blows up your ship well hell your going to need another one not only will you need a new ship but new mods how about something to replace those implants you lost everything that is sold except for certain skill books bought at rookie stations is sold by the player everything that is built is built by the player pvp fuels the market for supply and demand if things werent lost then there would be no demand if theres no demand then theres no supply ultimately killing this game since the only possible way to make isk is to rat if we end up having to rat for isk then again this turns into another wow where people have to kill npcs to turn a profit wow doesnt have people completely committed to supplying the auction house with stuff no people just put  in there hoping it will sell not knowing anything not only that you have to grind and grind to get stronger just to farm not to mention have the stuff in that game is lost through the raw materials it takes to make some of those items you can reprocess toilet paper in eve to make raw mats eve has a dedicated player base for mining researching and building eve gave these players a choice to do what all that by giving other players the choice to give them a reason to do all that if you dont want to be caught up in the mess that is pirating then you better take the necessary precautions because guess whateve gave you the choice to be able to do that if you dont want to then live with the consequences of being spanked aroundwith this my rant is over so basically please before posting look at things objectively and intelligently before you go ranting off just because someone popped your balloon this game was made to be coldps  sorry if my grammar or spelling is off i just recently lost a finger to a work related injury so im still getting used to typing

if you have the advantage to camp someone you might as well work a bit on howwhere you position your ship instead of just few shipsblob outside one gateid expect its not that difficult to set more than one incoming gate to a station and a random selection routine or something like that for outbound ships

agreed the same effect occurs in fw missions when a militia member enters an enemies mission they are shot at by their allied navynpc factioncorp standings should operate in the same way as alliancecorp standings after all theyre the same thing arent they
i hate transparent windowsyeah i know how that sounds
yes im in favour of more ui options
err maybe post this on the thread for the patchbetter still dev and ideasstop wasting csm time with these small little pet hatesthey have better things to be doingnext csm should just refuse to consider ui changestweaks etc and concentrate on the larger issues
very support this
pshhhhh maybe in ur little world and ur just jealous cuz chribba is more popular than ui support seein a cap mining would bring more giggles specially a titan mining those roids would get pwned but a hulk would destroy em all roids must be shakin in their feilds right bout now
its not a one person thingjust because chribba is the only one that uses a dreadnaught with mining lasers it doesnt mean that dreadnaughts can not be used like thatnote itd be evewide news to find a killmail of a dreadnaught in nonhighsec fitted with mining lasers too the amount of lols pricelessmore to the point it makes sense no real need to code new lasers but since they fit on the ship at least make them react properly to the ship status
i am a shameless chribba supporter
battleships are used to mine all the time support chribba
oh yeah right i see what your trying you give dreads mining lazers and chribba is gonna set those beams on the amarr station itself pull out every last unit of tritaniumthen when his lust for steel and bones grows more he will start mining our ships ripping the trit right from our burning hulls then what am i left with ships made of pyrite i think notim on to you

swg there i said it please keep readingone of the single most appealing aspects of star wars galaxies was their live events system for player events you could basically spend your credits isk on a large number of npcs props actors items etc etc that would spawn for 16 hours to assist you in immersing your audience into your live eventplayers had to be directly invited by the storyteller or designated assistants and the npcs could only be interacted withattacked by those participating in the live event to prevent griefingits actually a very well thought out system and brought me years of fun there i would really strongly urge eve online to introduce something similar especially with ambulation coming could make for some interesting station events
i never played swg but i like the idea of ambulation being fleshed out and trade goods having meaning stick a few qualifiers on my support but it seems reasonable
i dont know much abut pos management and logistics so i cannot comment on thatno matter what the changes will be two things will be crucial it must be viable to attack sov without sending in numbers so large that the server cant handle ittherefor it must be viable to defend sov without sending in numbers so large that the server cant handle itright now mechanics dont actually allow that if the attacker sends in small numbers he will get blobbed so he brings the blobb on his own to make sure hes gonna win the current system with the cynojammers is encouraging bobbing very much to attack sov the cynojammer array needs to be shot down although that would be possible with 30 ships its not done with 30 ships it would take so long that a suitable defense fleet could easily stop the attack so the attacker assembles a fleet large enough to kill the cynojammer within a couple of minutes sadly though this number is so big that the node dies if the defender tries to get in toothe solution to this is not to reduce the hitpoints of the array the attacker would still use a blob if this got the job done faster and more secure the only solution imo would be that blobbing made it harder to actually attack sov sounds weird but you somehow need to force people to intentionally not blobb in order to be more successful imagine a situation like for example party a attacks sovrelated structuresobjectswhatever and party d has to defend party d sends in only pos gunners lets say they send 5 people attacking party a is coming with 50 regular ships they got 10 times the numbers of party d so party d gets an appropriate boost like lets say increased hitpoints of all sovrelated objects or increased tracking of guns or increased damage anything like that its just an example to show what i mean so please dont pick on these and read furthernow attacking party a can go on with their 10 times number advantage and take down the object or they could reduce their own number seeing that the opponent only has 5 people in system lets say they could withdraw 20 ships and keep on attacking with 30 ships they would only have 6 times the numbers of party d now therefor the initial bonus granted to party d would be reduced by the appropriate amount the withdrawn 20 people could go attack another systemwhat if there are no defenders you might ask the number advantage would be infinite obviously in that case the posattacked object could have the biggest boost but as an unmanned pos is stupid 30 or 50 should be able to take down what they came forthe mechanic here has to be like this somehow if the defender has 5 people in dedicated positionrole to defend a specific object it should be totally stupid to attack with 200 people while they could eventually win they should take horrific losses it needs a real drawback to blobbing other than just lag and lack of funwell thats about my opinion dont come down on me because of the used specific example pos certain arrays hitpoints and stuff if it was for me i wouldnt mind all poses in eve exploding right now and we never had to care about them again

ok its time for a topic about lowsec i know ccp has considered viceroys which would be allowing corps to control a section of space in return for a tax off the top of transactions happening therethis topic considers the followingwhy doing viceroys just anywhere in lowsec isnt as interesting as it could bewhat creating imbalances in the profitterrain of lowsec will do to the social fabric of lowsec and evewhat it will do for lowsec as a wholehow the mechanics might work to take and hold a viceroyaltyhow empires and players both gain from this systemextra considerations and limitationsi think we can do bettermore than just providing incentives because a corporation is there lowsec should offer greater differences in direct profitability rather than letting corporations settle anywhere in lowsec as a viceroyalty a much more interesting mechanic is to create a dozen or two dozen systems in lowsec which are much more profitable than others either they spawn better ore or better rats or are home to a special complex this creates extra value in these particular pocketscreate 1220 viceroyalty systems in 01 lowsec each of these systems can be claimed by one corp at a time and each system holds influence over the 68 nearest lowsec systems the viceroys system must include a static beconed complex containing either high end ore or faction npc rats extremely valuable ice ores or valuable gas clouds it must also have station with good services including refinery factories and cloning but not research extra inventive for poses challenging this claim involves promoting trade in the system the viceroys station will have a special agent who gives trade missions to ceos of competing corps only more on this dynamic laterwhat social dynamics could we expect from thisprofitable systems will attract the most organized and best able corps from empire to take them for themselevs whoever owns these complexes gains access to a powerful revenue stream this will lead to compettition among corps for the valuable resources presented by this system adding profitability to lowsec systems will support a middle class of corporations corps not yet big enough or organized enough to be part of 00 but certainly big enough to defend a few systems in lowsec and to war against pirate corporations in the area having experienced this dynamic personally its incredibly fun to create informal alliances with nearby complex holders and fend off or drive out pirate corps with their helpit will bring lowsec alivei have seen a similar version of this work already but it was an unintended consequence of static 510 complexes the corps in charge of these complexes warred against each other for control of the resources they presented and warred against the pirates in their area that threatned the security of pilots in lowsec its a great chance to bring a life and complexity not available in lowsec which is currently mediocre across the boardthe mechanic of taking and controlling a viceroyaltythe empires want to promote two things in lowsec trade and security they do both by offering aspiring corps a chance to prove themselves with missions these missions are about escorting a hauler with important supplies for building a healthy lowsec medical supplies researchersscience graduates tourists and marines one is given out each week to the three largest competing corps for the viceroyalty by the same agent the agent also freely gives out the starting timerandomly determined and ending point of the missions hes given he will tell anyone that information so that wannabe viceroys will try to shoot down each others convoycompeting corps must then sabotage each others hauling missions while protecting their own in case of a tie the current viceroy remains in power or it stays empty
what do the empires gain from thisescorting this hauler or battleship full of goods through lowsec at a randomized time proves that this corp can maintain a military strength round the clock and can protect trade in the area this brings the stability and peace to lowsec that the empires really want while supporting corps who are growing in power and influence and of course providing some epic small scale pew pew between the viceroys and nearby pirates trying to hold their own turfwhat do corps gain for becoming viceroysthe gains for holding a viceroyalty must be twofold first you need to support the corps wallet corps have their own needs including supplying members with capital ships and fuel paying for offices paying for poses and fuel and paying for wardecs against their enemies some profit also needs to be available for players in that corp to support their own growth and ability to buy and finance ships for the defence of the viceroyalty sales tax and weekly security bonuses go to corps while the complex is there to support the wallet of corp members and bounties can supplement individual walletscorps gainrespect notariety visibility for recruitingpvp challenges vs piratesprofit from the complexsome tax from sales occuring in their viceroyaltysmallsome bonuses paid by the empires for killing minus sec status characters and for promoting mining and industrysome bonuses paid by players for killing bountied piratesadding these up should result in very good profits for a corp but it still must be overall only the same profitability as 00 to consider moon mining normal mining and ratting in 00remember there are only a limited number of these systems and these are for grooming corps to exist in 00 rather than driving corps from 00 in we want viceroys to get a taste of the profitability in 00 and realize that while there are a dozen of these in lowsec there are hundreds of such systems in 00further bits for considerationviceroys might be able to invest in better sentry guns or navy protection for their systems depending on success and seniorityadding benefits to viceroys based on numbers of minus sec status ships destroyed in their areas and also for the amount of ore mined in their sphere of influence it might be very cool to allow viceroys to spread the benefits of their holdings to a few other corps say 3 others around them allowing the viceroy to build alliances with friendly corpsit could be very very cool to allow viceroys to be the arbiters of the bounty system or bring them into it since they are intended to compete with piratescreating alt corps to impede or influence the viceroy system must be an exploitcorps in alliances cannot take part of the viceroy systemive done my best to build a system that does not support or favor farmers any system built around who runs the most missions or kills the most npcs or who does the most anything will favor farmers thats why theres only one viceroy mission a week per corp
saved for archiving insightful comments id love to hear from designers what their thoughts are for the viceroy systemmods please consider if this belongs in fi instead of assembly hall im not sure which move if neccesary
so your suggestion is to make lowsec more valuable and give people a reason to control it i like that suggestion but im not sure your mechanism is necessary if lowsec is profitable people dont need to play king of the hill for it theyll just use it and fight over it naturally i like the kind of gameplay you refer to but im not convinced by your methods
thats good feedback lowsec as a whole shouldnt be more valuable across the board because there is actually quite a bit of it and very few corps able to take the risk and put in the time to make it worthwhile there are a few reasons why value in lowsec should be a concentrated resourcefew good organizers good ceos who can organize a defence of an area and attract enough people are rare they have to be special people at a special time in their lives where they have enough time empires should want to attract and retain the best few of these not a dozen mediocre onestoo much lowsec to cause contention there wouldnt be people fighting over lowsec because theres too much of it and not enough people everyone with enough time and organization could setup their own viceroyalty and youd have space left overprofitabillity if every part of lowsec can be carved into viceroyalties to support 1 corp each then holding several of them means enormous profits or they get prenerfed and holding one or two just isnt worth it either way that makes for an imbalancewhen i was running one such corp i knew maybe a half dozen corps outside of 00 who were organized enough to actually take advantage of the resources presented if we could have sat anywhere in lowsec huge expanses of it would have sat empty or underutilized or we would have been over our heads in riches because of the expanses of underutilized systemsif all of lowsecwhat im suggesting here is to concentrate talent and rewards in order to allow people with the time and means to hold a place in 00 to attract the attention and rewards you need to have to make it worth itcreating a limited supply of special systems allows the best corps in empire to rise to the top and ensures that there will be real competition around these areas
thanks for giving us overview tabs we really needed those that saidgenerallytabs are good they allow us to switch between settings in a split second please  keep this in mind and read onthe default tabjust as well that you removed it it was messy anyway without the default tab though we have one less tab  which is badthe number of tabswe really need more not less increase the maximum to 10 pleasethe 11 load setting disasterearlier you could select a tab and then simply right click to add wrecks or even load up a brand new overview setting all you had to do to when you were done was click on the tab  and you are back where you started this is no longer trueif you change or load an overview setting through the main overview menu its easy to do by mistake  it edits the tab too as if you had rightclicked the tab selected load overview setting and made a choice this is a terribly bad ideatake me for example i have three tabs for fleet  pvp duties i have one for missions i used to have one that made navigation in crowded areas easy but for reasons you will soon see  thats gonei also do salvaging looting mining etc this means i have extra overview settings that i can load and lots of them i have settings for scordite kernite veldspar wrecks structures fw beacons and objects etc etc this is a lot of settingspre 11 all i had to do was load up one of these less used settings when i needed them and then click a tab to get back to normal this doesnt work any more so now i have to use one of my five tabs for junk settings and now we are down to just 4 tabs left over for presetswhenever i need something that isnt in one of my tabs i must1 switch to my junk tab2 load setting  change manually  whatever3 switch back to another tab when im donewhat happens if i forget to switch tab bang kiss the overview settings goodbye  you just ruined your tab best case scenario you curse and repair the tab by manually reloading the right setting worst case scenario you try to switch to a lowlag combat tab and get a facefull of veldspar asteroids or something similarly evil this is really really badtabs are no longer easy quick and foolproof please pretty please with sugar on top  make it the way it wasso heres what i suggest changing and fast1 editing the current overview setting must not manipulate the current tab this new behaviour is a disaster2 while you are at it increase the max number of tabs to 10

without a doubt a landmark that should stand well and good where it was especially since there was no problem to begin with that i am aware of
sounds like a good ideaat firstthen you realise all you really want is loot drones
one way to balance the idea would be a small or medium salvage drone that does its thing on the wreck and then puts the salvage in a can where the wreck was rather than brining it back to the shipalong with that you could have a modified sentry drone called tractor drone or some such this would pull in canswrecks like a tractor beam but at a slower speed
so you are basically advocating for macromining because the mineral prices would be raised by the shortage caused in the light of lack of cheaters producing abundant amounts of mineralstranslation let the macrominers cheat all they want because if they are not around the isk i pay would be distributed at the honest miners out therei feel the need to kick your head repeatedly
1 as a suggestion i would add the upgrading of highsec belts ie bettermore ore found in high sec2 the warp stability bubble would be an idea but it would most likely be abused for pvp p3but that would make miners in general easier victims4 i have another suggestion tuning of the lasersstrippers as time passes by the lasers need tuning in the form of user input or the output is less the tuning needs to be periodic 1520 mins and brainlesseasy click left arrow once or right arrow once depending on where a bar in the middle has moved towards so as not to start whining possibly even forgive one tuning mistake so as not to punish missclicks if this dialog can not be addressed by a script it will make macrominers mine less and less ore as time goes by making macromining deliver nearzero output
its already in the client esc reset settings
exactlybe able to set more filters of the type avoid system avoid sov

who said i was okay with it i was making fun of this thread for being oftrepeated and having no insight whatsoever not saying that the problem doesnt exist ill agree that the problem exists but ill disagree that you can find a solution by yelling fix teh lagz1 for the 11893rd time
its funny i keep trying to come up with a reply to this post but i fail to do so because most of you people dont know what your talking about when it comes to technologyso with that said ill just keep it simplejedimindtickthis is not the lag your looking for move alongmove alongps im a it professional and i know enough about whats going on that its not ccp to blame its something else entirely and you wouldnt have the capacity to understand that because its something thats way over even my headps2 its never as simple as getting better hardwareps2 hint why do you think ipv6 is being kicked around  o p
dude amazing name
lol i doubt this thread will make any difference to this issue but what the hell
lag should be their 1 priority sadly i doubt that theyll ever fix it
no they wont18 months ago jita used to be a laggy hellhole with 300 pilots now its a laggy hellhole with 700 pilots ccp fixed jita and so more people crammed in until it was laggy againpeople in 00 alliances complain about lag even when their fcs deliberately bring oversized fleets with the specific intention of causing lag conditionsto a certain extent ccp bet on the wrong horse when they were writing eve at that time it looked as though the future of cpus was everfaster singlecored processers and they planned accordingly things turned out differently  and possibly the eve playerbase grew beyond their expectations as well  but even now tq is able to provide better performance than any comparable game ive been in 100 vs 100 fights that were quite playable 10 fps 1 sec module lag of course ive also been in 100v100 where the overview took 5 minutes to load lag is a fickle godhardware improvements can only increase performance by small percentages if say we would reasonably expect a 30v30 to be not particularly laggy a 25 hardware performance improvement and thats a big improvement only gives us 37v38  hardly noticeable and completely irrelevant to the 200v180 fleet fights fixing lag will require a wholesale rewrite of the code base  basically eve ii and that  costs money and takes time lots of both and it may be that ccp have run the numbers and decided that the percentage of players who are actually affected by lag simply isnt high enough to justify the expense
ive been in a system with 40 people shooting a station and getting multiple minute lag there are a ton of things wrong with the servers and they should really work on fixing problems rather then add features
yes as long as the extra hangar division can be managed read createddeleted so as not to clatter the items window and the in station gui
absolutely excellent idea
id support this if you had to pay isk to the stationowner for it

too true
i would like the devs to revisit the issue
theres no good reason not to have the issue clarified given the very large scale of investment required
supported for lag situationsalternative fix lag
is it just me or have several people who posted here joined our corp within the last week pusually i dont ask to salvage if they say nothing or target me then i wont do anything but grab as much as i can if they are good natured about it i send them a cut of it backi also volunteer my services whenever someone in local offers to let someone salvage i dont mind splitting the salvage if the loot is good enough
posting in an epic thread where a player in eve actually apologized for something good on ya farrqua
no kidding  im posting from the hospital ward still in recovery
when is the next meeting with ccp i was under the impression that it was late august but dont see anything about it
when is this getting addressed
having efted the nag nidhoder and hel against its counter parts with similar role setups i have found it is that with all its skills at level 5 the minmatar cap ships consistently have the lowest firepower the fewest effective hit points and with the exception of the carrier the lowest defence efficiencythis is why as a dedicated minmatar pilot i will be training caldari battleship five in order to fill my capital ship ambitionthe dreadnought really needs the most attention there is simply no point in fielding one
i wonder why they are the rarest capital shipsbut seriously what sort of advantage is it to have a slightly greater top speed slightly reduced signature radius and slightly greater locking time on a dreadnoughtlike come on ccp none of this matters as soon as you hit siege mode thus the minmatars enjoyed a general inferiority with their dreadnought
five stars

i think some minor nano nerf is ok but if the nerf is implemented as described in the dev blog it would totally throw the balance of the whole game out of whack
againstand just a thought that i think could end all the nerfs swap the amarr and minmatar recon bonusthey are fighting each other so why the hell are their ships designed against each other rather then against the opposite raceminmatar  speed and web wtfamarr  tank and neut wtfgive the minmatar the neut bonus and the amarr the web bonus the curses value will drop slightly but it will balance everything
very interesting and well laid out ideas
what does the csm think would they support raising it to ccpshall we iron out the kinks  is the suggestion merely adding functionality to the already existing station containervaultwarehouse or are people supporting the brand new ability for individuals to obtain extra divisionspersonal wallet divisions sounds like a nice idea should they be a fee based luxury
i think they would both be a great addition both would be easy to implement i think as corps have them at the moment the advantage of the wallet divisions speaks for itself really the ability of having a spare fund incase you wake up after a drunken night in jita to find that cnr wasnt actually a cnr although you should hide your head in shame even still i think 3 divisions would be enough for the average player a current account a savings account and a omg wtf did i just buy account i dont think they should be a fee based luxury though or skill based the n00b eve player wontbe worried about spreading their isk and saving etc although players starting a new char can immediately understand that they will need to save some isk bounties  loot sales  whateverthe advantage of the personnel hangar divisions would be a less asset lag when checking your assets  why because you wouldnt have loads of station containers  warehouses etc everywhere cutting down your assetsb less market lag  because there would be no need for them to be on the market less items for sale less lagthey could both be implemented easily as they are already in the game if they were implemented it would mean less 1 man corps  alliances and more people in player corps more people playing fw more people enjoying the game as it was meant to bei cant think of a single disadvantage of having them
okay fair enough they would be a godsend for all the reasons you statewhy should a character get extra wallet and hangar divisions for freeim not saying it should 1m per week or anything like that but a token amount 10k per week per division payable to the corporation the extra corp hangar is located in or to concord for the extra wallet divisionyoure absolutely right it would cut down on solo corp entities there are players out there that like the ability and freedom of slots and joining a corp  no matter how good or organized it is wont be able to offer this to their membersthats an idea make it corp purchasable for members perhaps a corporate granted role this would make npc corps even less attractive than they are now join a corp gain personal wallet and hangar divisions in the corps hq and office locationsim not sure how much smaller the markets would be though sure there are pack rats already being able to organize assets could lead to even more market activity as you can easily sort out between what you want to refine what you wantneed to hold on to and finally what you actually want to put on the market today or next time in a different regioni personally like the corp granted role of being able to use 1 extra station hangar floor and a wallet division with an escalating fee system for subsequent additions
maybe the reason i brought up the idea of the personnel hangar  personnel wallet divisions was it was easy to implement as it was already in place in one form bringing in having to have rights  paying for the priviledge  different combinations or divisions etc would just had more work to ccpmaking payment to a corp or having to have roles to use your own personnel divisions takes away the point of them being personnel though why would you need to pay for extra divisions or have to get a director to give you rights to get another division on your personnel wallet things like that dont involve the corpi understand where you are coming from and maybe the paying of concord could work but i think that will just open up a whole new can of worms as i doubt people will pay for the right to have access to thier own walletseven so i agree that it would nice to hear from csm as to their view on it
would make finances a lot easier to manage
would be nice if not particularly vital
agreed
great idea
very much needed this would mean i can actually take a vacation to visit 00 once in a while since i wont have to stay in empire to manage all the corps market ordersobviously it needs to be looked at some to ensure its secure  make sure one can only edit market orders made using a wallet division you have access to and that an audit log is generated and i dont think one would be able to do more damage with this feature than withoutthis is a really great thing it would be absolutely wonderful for my corp and probably most other corps that do any of the following trading buying of large amounts of good or selling of large amounts of goodswhich probably means a fair number of corps

signednever missioned for pirates either didnt know it worked that kinda broken wayon the other end it would mean that once you mission for a pirate corp you cant rat anymore 
kill other rats
id say dont even require one to buy stuff from the lp store to be safe    as long as you have certain standings you wont get shot at i mean that kinda    seems like it would be logical right
oh well why not
supported kind ofwhile i agree that the logistics of mining need a severe overhaul i dont think the orca is the way to go about doing that the ore multiplier is a good idea that deserves implementation so you can have like 8 grades of each ore with the yield going up substatially as the system security goes downwith the multiplier there will be a reason to mine veld in 6 systems at the moment aside from population there is no reason to move to lower securities to mine ores available in the higher ones this will also solve the problem mentioned above as the veld roids in 00 will be 2x  5x as much yieldthe base yield could be the same but higher and lower grades varied even if on a set naming system therefore in 00 youd get exquisite veldspar 4x yield but basic arkanor while in 09 you might have only basegrade veldspar but also polluted arkanor 1 yieldhonestly while the orca does sound kinda neat its guaranteed use in the hands of macrominers would become a nightmare for honest miners i cannot either give support to this thread or malign it but i simply think it needs a new method for achieving the muchdesired goal
well i think we will see the orca in the industrial patch in december i am against moving large ammount of oremins in the universe why because it destroys local markets in favor of 1 big universe wide market if you ask me they should remove all cargospace on jumpdrive able ships
then what use is a jump frieghter
i always thought it was odd that 00 relied so heavily on empire space you cant actually fly out to 00 space start a corp start an alliance get an outpost and hold a system without heavy heavy logistics from empirethe simple fact that you need pos fuels which are sold by npc makes 00 unrealistic to be honest there is no reason why you need to go to empire to buy stuff to live in 00 space but thats my opinionthe thing the op brings up is just another reason why 00 is just not as attractive as it could be there should be capital mining lasers and mining fighters ccp have said they want people to spread out and live lose in lowsec 00 yet they also want them to be tethered to empirefor the ops specific issue i would much rather see different levels of oreveldspar only in empire denise veldspar in low sec concentrated veldspar in 00 then push up the amount of trit in each level so maybe double the trit in denise and then double it again in concentratedthat way the 00 veld roids will not be the size of planets 
they would still be huge just not totally worthless in comparison my problem is that ratting provides more lowends than mining i dont think it is the ratting that is broken as it scales up rather well you simply cant mine bs level quantities of veld
00 is the wild west in 700 and 800 from the est and civilization come glass precision machinery pieces chemicals for the ammunitions dynamite trains and steam boilers for the sawmills and so on for a myriad of items some small some big some of them could be produced locally but the cost was prohibitive you dont build a plant capable of building steam boilers to power 1 sawmill for others it required expert personnel that was available in numbers only in the east mostly it was because the production was convenient only if you could sell to a large number of costumers so it is pretty normal that 00 cant live at his top level without imports from empire and at the same time empire cant live at his top level without imports from 00
sprs  pvp the fact that you think any nonidiot caldari pilot uses sprs in pvp proves you know absolutely nothing about the subjectand caldari ships are just fine in fact they are better than fine theyre arguably the best race right now amarr have more pure gank but caldari are better at everything else sure they arent that great at solo pvp but these days nothing is good at solo pvpoh and shield tanking is just fine as well what you conveniently forget to mention is that 3x damage mods are even more mandatory in pvp than webpoint so armor tankers lose more tank slots than shield tankers
rofl 2 points 20km bleat on caldari f1f8 headrollers
preciselylook at ships like the myrmidon  it has a armour tank bonus yet the best setup for the ship involves a buffer shield tank  and it gets to fit mwd web and point on top of everything while having the same sort of buffer a plated gank harbringerhurricane doarmour tank the same ship and its very meh for most situations outside of gatecampingetc has relatively low damage output and its active tank is rather worthless outside of a 1v1 and in fact in 1v1 situations very often unless youve got combat boosters  tank rigs  blame it on the fact theres no combat boosters which boost flat out dpsimagine that a shield tank which is supposedly so bad outdoing a armour tank on a armour tank bonused ship for most pvp applications
i used to be behind this idea a long time ago but a few skilled caldari pilots taught me how wrong i wasa fullrack tank max damage mods or tackle is fine and a defining difference between armor and shield tanksa lighter tank tackle and damage mods is fine and available to both armor or shield tanksa fullrack tank max damage mods and tackle is overpowered especially when handed only to one type of tanking
well op youre forgetting something very importantarmor tankers have fewer mid slots than sheild tankers so they are in the same exact situation for armor tankers its just as difficult adding any sort of tackle ewar cap regen or whathaveyou to their mids when they have 13 as many as a comperable caldari ship
though im not sure if this is the proper thread for such an idea i do like the sounds of it seems to me a much more long term thing  but cool concept to bring into the game either way
that would be very cool thumbs up
signedand it would fairly well integrate into a kind of lowsec viceroy thing spoken of elsewhere a kind of toolset for player to create content
do want
hrrrr
as the former rp senator in swg id be remiss in not supporting this
i remember that there has been some sort of talk about doing this sort of thing from ccp for all of auoras problems it was still a way for players to pull a little influenceparticipation in the eve storyline and id support anything that gives us more of that andor more tools for us to bring stories into the game
this has my support
voting for this or any implementation of events again tbh
all for it
please please please please pleasealright so it needs to be looked at carefully and one needs to ensure it wont be abused and all but    very good idea to at least look atedit oh i have some fond memories of this in swg    as part of big rp plot on starsider that we were making a movie of the imps invaded a player run town    ah such fond memories
signedhas anyone actually ever used a clone vat bay outside of the test server
definitely needs to be looked at
full support
have used it to get pilots from empire to a 00 station system  but can only do 8 at a time so it is a little hard on the wallet  lol
ive used one to get to 00 was a bit of a pain getting backthey do have some limited usage    key word limited quite limitedsupported they could use the boost
id argue that the biggest reason such corps dont exist is because theres no benefit to it as such anybody ambitious and interested in controlling space will either join an alliance in pc 00 or fight over npc 00 instead of fighting over npc 04 which is at present utterly worthless and where defence of your space ultimately denies you access to highsec as such im not convinced theres the superabundance of lowsec up for player control that you seem to think there is there are 23 regions in empire of which 10from the looks of it are used for factional warfare and as such are unlikely to be fought over by pc corps the remaining 13  the forge molden heath derelik domain tashmurkon kador khanid korazor genesis aridia sinq laison everyshore and solitude  contain 200300 lowsec systems at a guess that sounds like a lot but remember that many corps will aim for control of several systems not merely one also if lowsec becomes valuable expect 00 empires to extend their reach inwards and eat up a lot of the slack that isnt even a bad thing either  i care more about the space being usable than who uses it given an adjustment period i could see 50 corps being willing to carve out a constellation even without alliances that fills the space 100 corps means everyone has someone to fight and that again isnt unreasonable seriously what do you need to defend a halfdozen systems of no special value 30 or 40 people should be able to do it handily as for what youd do to make lowsec worthwhile just bring in buffs across the board the sec status changes were a very good one but more are needed l5 missions need a major boost and there need to be more and better l4 agents in lowsec ive proposed solutions to the worthlessness of lowsec minerals beforethe market prices in that are outdated but they should still be workable lowsec could have better deadspace complexes also i dont know what current moon distribution looks like but i can guarantee some epic fights over dysprosium and promethium moons where they exist  if theyve been kept out of lowsec in whole or in part bring them back in and of course rats could use a boost too although not much of one since we still want lowsec ratting to be noobfriendly ultimately nonfw lowsec should be a lot like npc 00 except without bubbles right now you have all the same risks but with very few of the corresponding rewards whatever changes that is the fix to lowsec not setting up capture points
hmm i did not read all of it i have to admit however it looks like a system that i previously thought about myself there is one distinct problem with this static resources create static revenue if this revenue is significant enough 00 alliances will come in and claim it after all they are the most powerfull entities ingameso the revenue has to be unatractive for them or too much bother however then it will be also too much bother for the usual target corp or small alliancei would like for lowsec to become kind of a colonial space for the empires what you get are roid belts moons planets as we have now and thats all folkssome systems will remain as they are now some will have nothing but belts planets and moons you can rent that space from the respective empire then you will be able to build an outpost just like in 00 with these options1 basic outpost with medicalcloningrepairoffice2 outpost upgrades reprocessing labs factory market agents  gate gunsyou can not control the basic facilities as they are part of your duty to the empire however you can control the upgrades qualitytaxesfees you have to give back a certain monetary tax back to the empire you rent fromthus this promotes investment into the area as the more you invest the more you get back the holding criteria is simply the tax of the empire you are free of it for the 1st month or so then you are billed on a weekly basis should you fail to pay the full tax for 3 weeks in a row or 5 weeks total you loose your license and you have one week to clean up the station also your standing with the empire is lowered this means that warfare over valuable systems will be based on economics your activities get disrupted enough for you to not generate enough money and you loose the licensefor this we need freelance agents to be introduced all levels and progresive less qualityl1 q20 l2 q16 l3 q10 l4 q0  thats the limit on freelance agents they also require a tax for you services you have to pay them on the other hand they will give you back some money from their operation also a certain amount of players and completed missions is a factor or the agent will loose interest in the areasounds doable 
as i said before ive seen this in action with 510 complexes there were not 50 corps willing to take them at best there were half that and honestly id say more like 14 youre also assuming that each corp would take only their share if every few systems supports a large corp why not take several our corp covered 2 510 complexes and there were others that held 3 or 4 there were some complexes like ostingele which were held by farmers because no corp was organized enough to take itif you make all of lowsec valuable like that youre going to get single large corps taking all of it not a clean distribution of smaller holders and those large corps are going to make more than they could in 00 nerf that in the other direction and its not enough for the small corps to benefit from its not a balanced system some people might even try to say that limiting it to one viceroy per corp would fix that but thats a stupid claim players know better youd have one powerful corp that would dominate a dozen smaller ones and fight for them in return for 34 of the viceroy revenue and again they would make too muchyou have to make it a very limited resource so that those competing are the top corps strong enough to fend each other offas a side point adding in moons would just cause the 00 alliances to swoop in on the profits as they already do i am willing to bet that every single one of the lowsec dysppromethium moons are already held by 00 alliances id remove those moons from lowsec altogether tbh
sounds good to me
oh yes
yes please
200 supportedtabs worked they had their issues of course but they worked just fine now theyre just a waste of space and time alsoput in a backup feature let us export our overview settings and import them later after the next patch has deleted them
i dont know how much work this would be but    if it isnt to much it would be kinda nice yeah you can manually find your way around jita when youre going through the forge but the in game map can be a bit confusing and hard to use and not everyone has a copy of ombeys by their desk    would be niceactually slightly more useful might be an autopilot function to avoid systems with more than a user definable number of pilots if thats not technically feasable then possibly several options aviod systems with more than 10 25 50 100 250 500 pilotsjust a thought
sadly this wont work i even put in a petition for itto sum it upall roads lead to jitaand in that region its pretty much truei cant seem to find a way around it without going long distances
i was curious about the many scam contracts that you see in contracts i was wondering why ccp has never just looked at them and dropped the scam ones and fine the people responsible i would think it would not take a great deal of time i mean how hard is it to see wtb useing the cents as major numberssome guys will have 10 or more in a row we get told buyer beware because we cant be bothered with you being cheated well they dont really say that but it is the attitude you get was just wondering 
helloobvious issue long time standing issueif you declare war on a corporation within a miltia it should be that you declare war on every corporation in the miltia and the faction that miltia is withinif you are at war with someone they join the miltia after the next timedown since they applied so they cant just join the miltia to avoid a fight etc etc and you are no longer at war when they join the miltiamiltia corporations cannot declare war with any corporation that is within the miltia alliance caldari may not attack caldari or ammar based corporationsthen i wont find myself in a large miltia fleet with people screaming for help as 2 ships attack them and there is nothing we can legally do to help them
bad idea on many many levels also a repost of existing topic thereand you can find the general discussion thread here with a lot of debate on the general issues and full and detailed explanations of why allowing fw membership to damage wardec functionality would be a bad thing for game balance consequently no support
what jade failed to tell you is that there is a perceived flaw and beyond all the rants and raves made by both sides of the debate jade we hope should be pushing this issue thru the proper levels to reach the devs for discussion
its only really an issue because it gives alliances a backdoor into fw combat which is something the devs stated that they didnt want to happen at least not yetat the very least they should either disallow decs from corps that belong to a player alliance or just open up fw to alliances and let them in through the front door
i think that the salvage and tractor drones should be separatesalvage drones could fly out salvage wrecks until their internal hold is too full for salvaging another wreck then return to your drone bay but you will have to move the stuff from the drones hold to your main hold before they will launch againtractor drones shouldnt be too hard to visualise you target a wreckjetcan they fly to it then you hope that they tractor it back towards you instead of tractoring it in circles while they orbit it one it returns with the can it drops it by your ship while it awaits the next order you still have to remove the loot from the canbut i dont think that these drones should ever automatically target a wreck or can
i think these would be cool theres even room for t2 salvage drones to allow for varying levels of salvage skillt1 light salvage 1 5m3 cargo t1 medium salvage 2 15m3 cargot1 heavy salvage 3 50m3 cargot2 light salvage 2 10m3 cargot2 medium salvage 3 25m3 cargotw heavy salvage 4 75m3 cargospeedhitpoints as per gallente dronesthe cargo bays may seem overlarge but you need a certain amount purely because of the dreaded metal scraps
while i do support the concept of salvage drones there is one problemhow do they report a salvage failure  atm if you dont have enough free cargo space the salvager ends a successful salvage cycle with an error and does nothing to the wreck however drones do never report anything so if the same situation happens to a salvage drone what should it do  also in the case we make the heavy salvage drones have enough cargo for the worst case scenarion so they can salvage a wreck always then the smaller ones will have no use at all and are redundant for all practical purposes other than if heavies are slower than normal tractor speed
medium drones separate tractor and salvage drones low cargo spaceheavy drone tractor and salvage capable variant high cargo space
yes to tractorbeam drones no to salvage dronesfor a couple of reasons1 you cant tractor in wreaks that do not belong to you so if youre raiding peoples missions you still have to jet over to the can and do it this is much better then just showing up in a big bad ass tank battleship and unleashing drones on peoples wreaks there is already too much mission salvaging going on and its very easy to do i know because i do it often a salvager drone would make life ungodly simply if i had salvager drones2 tractorbeam drones would have more usefulness for everyone where as salvage drone has pretty much a singular usage in missions sometimes you are 75km away from a can that drops that has your objective in it with salvager drones you still need to move to the can tractorbeam drones will go and collect it for youthe simple fact is salvager drones are way too easy mode however making life a little easier for everyone and not just a select group of people would be a bonus tractorbeam drones would have much much much more functionality for almost everyone
not all wrecks produce scraps drones simply return to the ship when theyre full as do mining drones
i would like to see a addition to the game that using input form the player reduces or increases cycle time i have thought of minigames downside takes players attention away form security of the shipi have thought of another skill of mining efficiency this would just increase macro pocket booksmy big issues islow sec and 00 veldspar risk does not meet the demand you have for it if you buildice mining  omg this sucks but has to be donei would like to see a bigger bonus for the rorqual and would love for it to be alot better then a command ship also if the bonus would get better per member in fleet that way when you have large alliance mining ops you can get the mining done fasteredit btw i support this and would love to see a mining rig
hello allheres a brief few things that i would like to see for mining buffs1 variable ore quality have high sec ore give massive bonuses in nullsec 4x yield veld for instance or nullsec ore give pitiful benefits in highsec 1 arkanor so people can mine for their ships2 remove t1 loot from drop tables its been suggested elsewhere but i think this will massively boost the mining occupation since you wont have huge piles of reprocessables from missions3 highsec pirate raids this idea is expanded upon in my website but basicly give occasional raids of highsec that wont be detectable from a macrosniffer but will lay waste to those who dont pay attention in asteroid belts4 asteroid veins certain areas on a map displayed of the asteroid which will give bonuses to ore yield detectable but not macroablejust my 002 isk
very good point i had neglected this maybe minigameperiodic input is a bad idea after alla faster response on macroing tickets andor better detection methods is probably the way to goirrelevant the way macroing works is in the long run so initial cost counts for nearly nothing for a macroer
whythat just degrades possibly in detrimental proportions the value of highsec mining making mining a profession only profitable for 00 alliances
no it makes low sec mining more viable and lets people who want to build there own ships able to mine it all wherever they are balance the numbers so that veldspar in 10 is better than ark and ark in 10 is better than veld and then let the market dictate who needs whatand rebalance drone mins i dont care if you have to give them more low ends without taking high ends from the melt having such terrible high end heavy amounts means they have to import as there is no way to get trit in required qty in 00 without hauler spawns
as i was saying ive seen that it also dumps a lot more than youd wish
since the 1st drone bug was present over 3 years ago i dont have much confidence that this will be addressed cant hurt to vote though
how do you determine the enemy sov  standing  wardec  id go for wardec 
yep use autopilot and whine when you get ganked
are you referring to just learning skills as in clarity ect  or are you talking about all skills in general like gunnery electronis engineering ect if you are talking about all skills im afraid its a really stupid idea skills are fine the way they are though skill ques would be nice
keep em in the game they help weed out the adhd crowd
i am a salvage and make my living of the carcass of other ships but it seems to me despite salvaging supposedly being a deliberate profession put in by ccp there isnt much to support the professioncurrently most salvage in the game comes from missions to get this salvage you have to either run missions or you have to find a mission someone else has run this causes problems because the only way to find these missions is to probe out the mission runners and their dronesthis causes two problemsthe first is when you enter a mission being run by a person there are issues with the runner claiming he owns the wreck and complaining starts despite the wreck not belonging to anyone not the point of this threadthe second problem is if the mission runner turns in the mission and leaves the salvage floating in space with no one around to probe out these wrecks cannot be found and are lost to the depths of space where they will pop after a couple of hours worthlesslysince ccp has made it abundantly clear the wrecks belong to no one i wont focus on that instead i am concerned about the wrecks that i cant find due to the fact they have been abandoned miners can find their rocks archaeologists and hackers can find their sites how come salvagers cant find salvageplease let us probe for wrecks
ok so alot of people do camp gates for the fun of it and the killmails but one thing you should know is most pvp alliances camp the 00low sec gates to their space  while they may enjoy doing this it is for security reasons not just to bully carebears oh and by the way the first thing you learn when u start a new char in eve is that its a dark and dangerous universe also i know heaps of guys that have been pvping since they were a few months old look at agony empire and goons for instance
eve is and aways will be a dangerous predacious placehowever that isnt to say that such predation should be so easy that it holds no real consequenceeve is also about the choices you make and the consequences of those choicesso those 16 bss camping the jita gate to insta pop that huge lumbering freighteryou know the one without any module slotswell they will go boombut should it be so ez for them to grab billions of isk and meanwhile collect issurancerumor has it you still can btwfor said bsyes they lose sec rating but hell even id consider losing sec status for a few hundred billion isk with the promise of insurance money still
i gotta ask pole dancing injury
the chafing from that pole can be quite inconvenient
issues were submitted on the 26th of august so it will take at least till next weekbut i dont think the date has been announced yet
more intriguingly when is the next csm meeting the 17th of august was almost three weeks ago
i believe we are in a waiting position at present for when ccp gets back to us at which point we will start the meetings again
surely it would make more sense to be holding the meetings regardless of waiting for ccp to get back to you for their second meeting that way you guys can be processing the issues that will make it to the 3rd meeting and so avoiding the problem with the last two meetings where issues were deferred as you were trying to address too many issues in too short a space of timefor example instead of you having a marathon 6 hour meeting every three weeks to discuss up to 30 issues of which 6 or 7 get deferred to the start of the next meeting thus making it more likely that a new issue will be deferred during that meeting why not have 3 shorter 2 hour meetings discussing 10 issues each on a weekly basisat least that way people arent getting frustrated by time concerns as much and it helps to keep the csm in the public eye unfortunately in the last few weeks its seemed like the csm has dropped off the face of the earth i think the only csm ive seen around the boards doing csm business has been yourself lavista though will confirm that through evesearchcom i dont doubt that there has been plenty going on behind the scenes however were just not seeing thatedit heres the posting stats for each of the csm membersjade constantine  last posted 4th september last ahjita post 29th augusthardin  last posted 4th september last ahjita post 19th augustlavista vista  last posted 5th september last ahjita post 5th septemberdarius johnson  last posted 4th september last ahjita post 13th augustbane glorious  last posted 18th august last ahjita post 11th augustdierdra vaal  last posted 21st august last ahjita post 21st augustserenity steele  last posted 3rd september last ahjita post 2nd septemberankhesentapenkah  last posted 31st august last ahjita post 28th augustheh for some of them i thought it had been longer guess i just shot myself in the foot with this one
then limit your agenda items to ones not relevant to the questions you asked of ccp otherwise your backlog will be truly frightening thats still pretty bad  only two have posted on csm forums in the last week and its been over two weeks for four of them
i agree pretty scary statistics i think
not being funny but before you wring your hands at how terrible your fellow delegates are at communicating you might consider replying to the message i sent to the csm mailing list ten days ago asking the csm delegates for their opinion of when and what the next meeting should be and involve lavista please dont express public moral outrage when you arent able to respond to messages yourselfas for the statistics  well ive not personally seen a topic im particularly impressed bywith general popular supportand or something ive got specialist gameplay knowledge of in the last couple of weeks  certainly not one for which ive got a strong desire to promote or the confidence that it could be voted through guess everyone is busy at the moment players includedim guessing the other csms must feel similarlyfor the record  the only issue any delegate has requested on record for next available meeting was the cribba mining dreadnaught thing that got resolved by the gms the same dayin any case ive asked the other delegates to post their opinions on what the next meeting should involve and when it should be and when ive got answers from them all ill make a decision
i have recently been given an idea by one of my directors about corporation incomeshe said wouldnt it be good if when the corporation holds sovereignty we could charge people for entering the system via the stargates it takes so long to get sovereignty of the systems there should be more benefits from thisas it does actually take so long to get sovereignty of a system there should be more benfits and as the corp has had to spend so much isk on the pos there to gain it then the corp should be entitled to full control of the system and the corp should also have a full source of corp income  via the stargate charge or charge to use the asteroid belts it is only an idea but for a corporation there isnt really much we can earn from wow kill a few pirates or mine a few belts or manufacture some ships you know its not really that new is it at least with system control the corporations can make it a hell of alot more funlike i said just an idea thanks for readinggods honour  dark assylum industries
why doesnt ccp just stuff isk directly into your wallets i mean hey youre paying for being onlineno pain no gain
sooo  ok i am a hostile i have to pay the toll fee to come and kill you what if i dont want to pay
one thing i dont get  the server has to pass the information to the client on which bps are bpos and bpcs why not just get the client to sort out the colour difference  flag it in some other way
i dont see how its that complicated have all prints with unlimited build limits blue and onse with limited runs a different collor
hmmmi think the fairest if there is such a thing and i think there should be the corp a  b has access rights anyone else should be on a timer flagged to both partieswhy do i think this because it makes more sense than just a free for all and once the bottomfeeder gets in range and opens the wreck or puts a salvager beam on it because theyre watching the action it should be flagged as stealing from both parties not just the guy who just managed to warp off in their pod or is currently waking up 25 jumps away or whatever trying to remember to upgrade his clone or crying because he forgot to do it beforehandthe alternative to leave current system in place could end up with more suicides in empire than there is already and really we could do without the lag
i think if you blow up someone the loot should belong to both them and you and anyone taking that can should be flaggedthey would be a huge uproar if mission wrecks could be looted without the looter being flagged because lets face facts this argument that the loot belongs to the person that blew up can easily be looked at the same as the faction rat you blow still owning the loot if this is not a valid changing then mission wrecks should be made the same then well soon see you bears change your tune
yeah what vista saidword of caution thoughsuicide gankers most recently pandemic legion can still do suicide gank freighters in high secand unfortunately the insurance pay outs for suicide ships still existyes even after the last patch unfortunatly so just be aware that you do run that risk and so do your customers
you may also run into trust issues  its all very well contracting out your massive cargo bay to other corps but at those kind of volumes even a relatively innocuous cargo becomes valuable plus if the corps are requiring that kind of volume of stuff to be moved they are quite possibly already in the cap building business themselves and will have their owni sometimes use my freighter to go on big trading journeys having found some npc market cargos where i can get a 50 profit margin but for the most part its just a portable storage for all the bits of junk ive collected over the years i know im not using it anything like its potential but its definitely not paid for itself yet i reckon ive made about 350mil tops with it and ive had it over a yearnice toy though
very interesting and well laid out ideas

against the speed changes that were on sisi as they constituted a huge buff more to heavy missiles than anything to caldari and nerf to the two benefits for flying minmatar webs and speed tankinga proper speed adjustment would be to the effectiveness of certain implants primarily high grade snakes and perhaps extending a portion of the minmatar reconeas web range bonus to a t1 ship like the bellicose in addition two particularly overpowered ships could have their base speed and agility adjusted downward the sacriledge and ishtar as their bonuses permit them to do significant damage without tracking issues of these two the sacriledge is more overpowered than the ishtar
i read this post last night and i honestly couldnt sleep because i was still trying to wrap my mind around iti think your idea is the best of local fixes however i think its been over thought just imagine how much more server side work this system could cause as i thought more about your idea i tried to think of a way to have a similar effect but simpler here is what i thought ofconcord neural networks would be high seclow sec nothing to do with your npc standings they will function for you the networks would corp controlled this means that your ceodirectors would have a new panel in the corp management tab where they are allowed to add xmaybe 5 or 10 number of blues and xmaybe 5 or 10 number of reds each slot could cost a certain amount of isk for adding or changing these bluesreds also there would be a 24hr delay for concord to update the networkskinda like a war dec notice npc corps would always show in local due to being npc controlledin high sec local would function as it currently does everyone shows and blueredsnuets are shownnow here is where the changes startin low sec blues show up only if they have you set blue also reds show will show up also the local counter will show the number of bluesredsneutrals this way you can see if you have any friends any enemies and if there is a unknown threat you have to discover neutrals can be discovered if you a probe them like you currently would b if they aggro any bluereds in the system they become visible in localin player controlled 00these networks dont have to be pos based we all know pos warfare is boring and doesnt need more added to it they could simply be associated w stations if a hard target needs to be established however this system will work only in the corpsalliance sov systems and it will work the same as low sec the only difference is the level of sov will change the number x of bluesreds you can have visible obviously lvl 1 could be significantly lower than the concord number lvl 2 slightly less lvl 3 on parslightly above lvl 4 sov may be unique in being able to show the bluereds  neutralsin npc 00again works the same as low sec however instead of concord networks you would have the npc faction network for that region this is where you could bring standings into it for instance the serpentis constellation in fountain may charge more per slot because you have high standings towards an opposing factioni think this could cause a increase of roaming gangs you have a incentive to travel to a different region and attack someone you dont know because they wont see you coming this allows the recons to do their job go into system find targets that will show neutral to the gang get the gang a warp in and pew pew this also allows traders to move further through space with less chance of being noticed this wont stop gate camps in low sec they will still sit on those high seclow sec gates and pop anything that comes through because even if you dont show on local you show in space this will help small corp solo pvp players they can fly around without being noticed immediately and hunt targets
sorry but i firmly disagree with this ideayou can not improve player experience on a broader level with thisno matter how you present this ideastagnation is not a valid game improvement tooland thats exactly what this will bring to eve
i read the pdf and i like it bounty hunters system is really something that is long overdue and this idea is a nice start good luck
yep nice idea
so instead of double clicking on a can to see its contents youd single click a tab seems like a waste of programing time to me however the wallet divisions does sound like a good idea although i dont see why i should have to pay for different divisions i dont have to pay in real life so why should i have to pay in game realism and all that
this thread was supposed to be about wallet divisions but the hangar idea keeps rearing its ugly head too lolthe idea of personnel hangar divisions was so you wouldnt have to have loads of cans littering your assets meaning that you could check your assets without having to be docked in the same station as them and you can sell them from a distance something you cant do when they are in a secure canand i dont agree with the paying for wallet divisions either edit also updated the topic to try and get a csm to look and respondorwellanything
i could honestly swore i already supported this i already have a draft for the submission template
1000 agree and signedshould be part of the corp trader role and key off wallet accessofc i also think we should have a new galactic sales order management skill along the lines of the corp mgmt skills to expand control of orders beyond one region at a time after all some people just dont have the rl money to afford multi accts to sit alts in each sales region who dont do anything buy post and modify sales orders
i would appreciate if people would stop the supporting now and would like to discuss this furtheri have written up a submission template which looks like thisthank you
well first of all i do support it but there is another problem right now if the person who created the market order looses hisher roles all market orders are deleted the only way i see this working is to make the corp wallet you use for creating the order also be the owner of the order

id like to note that if its tied to corp wallet divisions permissions then that eliminates a lot of griefing potential
hi thereid like to address the situation with level 4 agents in nasesharafa solar system while everybody understands that its a part of your job to change things around to keep the environment of the game dynamic and interesting you also have to remember that some of the players have stayed in certain systems for a very long time  sometimes years also a lot of those players use high level missions as the sole source of their income in the game thus removing agents from nasesharafa will create a situation where established players and entire alliances that regard the system as their home and have invested tremendous amounts of money and effort into it will be forced to move on behalf of these players i would like to strongly encourage you to replace agents that are moving with an equal number of other agents of level 4 or to leave the existing ones in place we do appreciate your understanding in that matterbest regardsresidents of nasesharafa solar system
1 45 all my corp living in nase and working on there agents
i support
i support this totally
dont kill sukanan please replace or reinstate those agents or the entire constellation will be pointless
here is the pat i put into and have yet to get a respone but thought i would post it herei noticed we are loosing most of the agents in our nasesharafa viii  moon 3  chemal tech warehouse station we put a lot of time and effort into the sukanan constelation keeping it free of pirates and such and this system was a good resource for us to fund theses efforts is there going to be any replacement agents why is this transpiring this will effect many corps that operate in sukanan space 20080905 1054 i will be moving to ravarin iii  moon 4  chemal tech research center on 20081005 note that if you are performing a mission for me during that time some of your mission objectives may change during the move with regards rolettes ambettone 20080905 1042 i will be moving to egghelende vi  moon 19  chemal tech factory on 20081005 note that if you are performing a mission for me during that time some of your mission objectives may change during the move with regards penagier rieres 20080905 1058 i will be moving to ravarin v  moon 13  chemal tech research center on 20081005 note that if you are performing a mission for me during that time some of your mission objectives may change during the move with regards esmecet boystin 20080905 1033 i will be moving to sotrenzur v  chemal tech factory on 20081005 note that if you are performing a mission for me during that time some of your mission objectives may change during the move with regards bauwinon bonailles our corp djlx 65 members use this station as well as many other sa alliance corps that directly operate in the area1st german space force gsf vega vincent russian specialists group rsg shadowofwind shadows hunters shuk shadow merceanrie cor unum corun midori blacke ferrus syndicate fss hereric miz japanese mutual aid organization ja okome faction inc facti relier area 42 a42 unwesmily 2 klaus kline werke kkw klaus kline the nighch xii mrsfurbie apotheosis of virtue alliance aov shadow ranes missing in action ii mia ghost viper australia inc aust johnhoward die argonen argon ltdcmdr yellow ttgb munitions ttgb randellmen freedom builders inc fbi cdubmt brothers of destiny bodi  viper187 firestorm fleet hav0k lehadriel eat my shorts emsi antaiir last dawn ltdn  lexion tibirius russian wolves community rusko rokkot entenhausen enten donald31 tenichigo kaigun kgn eurzadahn templar industrial tridl chatan rockius m3 m3 exphexis shinra shra thora rhodan swedish chef cake factory cake atar mnemonic enterprises mnee smint adams the roost roost suffen aeden aeden fremenfighter exponential zagadka ezinc ciranousche red clover redcl minicarman herrscher der zeit hdz treptiomedes

i really dont want heavy tanked torp ravens with god may know how much damage mods and the ability to tackle yes this would make caldari overpowered as they can choose gank  tank and more gankwhile amor tankers have to chose  gank or tank
i agree slaves should be freeable drugs handinable and under certain circumstances ppls enslaveable although atempting to enslave 1000 marines who are sitting in your ship should probably go badly p
why just pump their cabins full of something narcotic follow it up with something else that makes them more pliable and bingo 1000 hopefully elite slaves
signedand make it possible to enslave nonslaves
this actually sounds really exciting could you maybe give some examples of how it could be used also maybe talk about how to prevent it from being abused
instances are this way  wow
a little more detailswg has not supported npc actors providing lines for a very long time and the storyteller system is not instanced but only invited characters can actually engage in combat with the npcs thats really all the invite does its even further away from instancing than the eve deadspace mechanic isprimarily the storyteller system currently supports deploying combat npcs  a tool eve does not have  though they do not provide xp and the only loot theyll drop is whatever the storyteller  gm gives to the npcs for that express purpose combat npcs can also be converted to flavor npcs and a select few eg life day wookiees can only be flavor npcs this means they stand stationary or perhaps loiter walk around purely to add atmospherea huge number of props and obstacles are also available to create locations for use as rp events this includes everything from setting up parties to pvp events to archaeological digs to almost anything else and every few months more get addedswg does an incredible job of supporting flavor rp with systems like this as well as clothing player housing etc eve in turn does an incredible job of supporting mechanics rp with at least halfwaydecent inuniverse explanations for almost every mechanic and a skill system thats not just levels and talentsboth have a lot they should learn from each other
thanks for the good detailed explanation the actors having lines were removed due to abuseheres a common example for swg player cities were a very big thing so you want to have a big party you go buy decorations stages various environment props racial npcs that stand around etc they become part of the environment you can walk on the stages etcor you want to do a pvp event you drop a hundred stormtroopers choose their level etc you can even put loot in npcs for your participants to get to prevent any player from engaging the troopers or abusing this sytem to level up your toonthe storyteller or the one who places the items is in charge they can assign assistants to help with the event and only the storyteller or the assistants can invite players to be involved nobody else can interact with the npcs thus ruining your good timethere were things like shuttles that you could make fly in and land atats all kinds of goodiesnow bring it to eve in space you could spawn a fleet of ships crucial to the plot of your event they would only interact with say your corp members if it was a corp event or a select list of players that you invitein stations you could basically decorate an empty room anyway you want or even an entire section of the station all to support the event they have no real value but were a great moneysink and a wonderful way to immerse players into a little more rp and believable galaxysince they have no xp values or bounty values and cant be interacted with outside of those in the event it would be hard to abuse the systemthey also worked in code so you could only place things a certain area from each other you couldnt for example surround a house with stormtroopers so the person inside had no way of getting out by always allowing a little space you cant reverse abuse it either
yep do it
support the idea
i support ofc
i didnt say theyd be spread evenly 4 to a corp i was using the numbers for illustration some will have 1 some will have 20 but 4 seems a plausible average and what i suggested was not making lowsec valuable in the same sense that nullsec is valuable you do not have the same tools to defend your space  no bubbles cyno jammers or nontitan jump bridges  your ore is maybe half as good even if my new ones are added your complexes cap out at maybe 710 instead of 1010 and you face sec status bleed every time you defend your space unless ccp is staffed by idiots you do not have to worry about alliances swooping down on lowsec space like its highvalue 00 given how many of them seem to show disdain for wide swathes of actual nullsec and my point was that it is a pretty limited resource  players manage to find things to war over in the thousands of systems of playerowned 00 im sure they can find flashpoints when you narrow them down to 250 systems even if the space isnt as good and so what if alliances control the moons im trying to create incentives for players to visit these systems not determine what corp size you have to be at to do so i want goonswarm and bloodmoney incorporated to both be able to visit lowsec and feel like theyre not wasting their time different parts of it perhaps but there should be something there in the areas where fw isnt doing the trick
sighthe past couple of months i have noticed a decline in the general direction of our eve community now while some things haven been for the better i fear that our world is in trouble please read this and consider what i say objectively and not only from your own view try to when you think of your own situations think of the ramifications your choices have made to others even if it was beneficial towards you pirating cheatingwhateverthis is going to be a loteve is in the state of it trying to better itself developers trying new things out while implementing ideas from either themselves the csm or even the eve pilots even though good intentions are always meant for good outcomes they are usually met with disastrous results i am talking mainly about the financial stability of evewhat is the basis of financial stability that is supply and demand even though the eve economy is on the rise with new players it is in a inflation due to over population yes i know how can eve such a huge and vast environment be overpopulated with only 30k players at any given time the ratio to supply and demand can not be met equally everyone is saying how mission runners are getting their isk too easily while flooding the market with resources reprocessed from loot or t1 mods miners have a problem in the end just trying to find a stable mining market to use to supply their businessthe demand is not high enough to meet the supply that is given to the player by eve asteroids are being mined out almost immediately after they have respawned from either actual miners actual miners with alt accounts or by the infamous macrominer the same goes for mission runners i know a few mission runners that dont even bother to loot their missions i especially for the soul purpose that while in a l4 mission you dont have the speed nor the patience to loot everything thats within a 50km radius from you in every direction now some people do and can either because they are dedicated enough to go get a different ship after doing the mission or because they have an alt account doing the looting for them or again the infamous ninja that does everything while your busynow we must understand that a majority and i mean probably 80 to 90 percent of feedback is from players angry at others so now their judgment is impaired and their anger is aimed at another players success something that takes a person a year or more to train for in eve is now nerfed because a player base was formed of new players that didnt understand that you need to put the time in for something worth while but i hope this turns into a respectful argument from out eve communityhow can we fix supply and demand well thats easy how does any country make to where demand runs high for a supply of something that is war ladies and gentlemen yes war fighting destroying of peoples ships and items low sec has all of the demand in the world why because people are fighting over territory so supply is in high demand to fuel this ambitioni do understand that eve is brought on the idea of the becareful or you could lose everything you worked for it is this concept causing the inflation people are afriad of losing what they have in fear of never getting it back 500m in implants 100m to 500m ship with an extra 200m in mods and drones to secure that kind of money would take a while for any high sec person low sec populace is probably a days worth of gatheringin the next post i make in this topic i will suggest somethings to get thingsgoing introduce a little anarchyupset the established orderand everything becomes chaos im an agent of chaos quote from heath ledger character the joker from tdk
now lets fix the problem with macrominers while introducing demand for supply why not make miners criminals after so much ore from a region is mined constellation or even solar system after so much m3 is mined into one ship the person becomes flagged lets face it if all that mining was real and asteroids never respawned it would be a criminal act to mine something protected correct which we could do this would keep miners having to move or if they are willing enough they could have some company to keep them safe from harm how to actually regulate this is still toiling around in my head how much ore is too much when does it become a problem from the miner how do we keep supply high enough to meet demand without killing the supply if miners are flagged it would honestly get rid of macrominers how you ask because they could just program to go somewhere else ah yes but how far is somewhere else if we did region it would be too far for them to fly and it would slow down mining considerably for them almost completely ruining the market all together this wouldnt be a problem for rookie pilots since they probably cant mine that much that fast anyways also giving a range of people a chance to minealso to help the demand with the supply we have to make sure people can fill their demand reasonably due to losing more stuff now how about increasing the yield and number of each asteroid in the belts since now people will be flagged this will give a lot more other people a chance to minei want this to work even with people who like to solo mine so the flagging issue is a consequence to the events at large how to regulate ill leave to suggestions i really dont want people to have to go here and there to mine even though this does bring more grouped base mining for people using miners with haulers going from system to system giving bonus to haulers when they carry only asteroid ore so that people can go from belt to belt in different systems without having to stop as much this will in turn bring out more miners to the game since their is now a steady market because only an actual person who can call themselves a miner can follow it again increases demand by introducing the possibility of destroying the ship will add more to this later this is just a rough draft for people to readlets start with the basic life expectancy of a character in eve unless stupid a character will keep their ship for a long time they avoid things like roaches to light why not make the consequences of losing stuff more light still keep it severe but manageable we have insurance for ships why not have insurances for some more how about letting people have more than one clone add skill books here with the clone comes their implants again skill books here since people will still be worried about losing their items due to the price make it reasonable demand for ships and items goes up do to the lose of items and ships lower the value to go to war but while a corp is in war insurance to their ships clones and implants is reduced even though i am a big fan of shut the hell up this is eve and if you want to whine and cry go play wow i mean hell thats why i joined was because of the freedom of choice you have in this game i dont want that taken awaybut i want this game to work things cost too much as it is decrease the number of resources needed to build stuff this will cause more people to be able to lose it and just say screw you and work towards another onewell its late and this is a rough draft of what i wanted to say please understand how much i like this game i want things to work but with all things to make things work you have to do what joker says introduce a little anarchyupset the established orderand everything becomes chaoswhats wrong with chaos its what fuels the stock market 
dont you mean the supply isnt high enough to meet the demandis your post a pti cant agree with much that you have written nerfing mining by making them able to get flagged and thus destroyed will lower the amount of minerals making it to market hence forcing up prices not sure what you want to happen to prices exactly from your post the cost of items on the markets is low invention has pushed down many t2 items considerably if you played a year ago youd have noticed thisflagging miners just makes mining that much harderhaving to move the ship from the sysytemregion etc to mine again would be a right pain anyway how would you track it i could mine get to near the flag limit warp and dump at a station and return to mining flagging is an unworkable solution really asteroids shouldnt be protectedthey are lumps of rock that happen to have minerals in themeve has competition on its market sure you can find some small price spikes etc as market pvpers do their thing but overall undercutting and belowcost selling happens which brings prices downthere already is more warfare happening of late its called factional warfare go and try it out take carearithron
argh stupid ideas and even more stupid readingu really didnt think enough before postingand u are missing few clues on how economy works
your solution to inflation is to make mining a criminal activity i sincerely hope you dont vote  and i dont mean for the csm i mean in real life
lets outlaw miningok so we can do the following1 increase the cost of modules2 increase the cost of ships3 decrease the avaliability of modules4 decrease the avaliability of ships5 decrease lag in jitawaitwhat6 remove an entry point for pirates im on about can flipping7 remove cap ships from the game no fuel  as thats mined no ships as the mins to produce them are mined8 remove mission runners as they wont have any ships  ammo to use9 remove pirates see note 8i think i could go onbut im bored
here is an idea for csm to really garner from this thread ban the op from ever posting in the assembly hall again cause he just doesnt get it at all
xutanis  do you even bother to research or consider what pilots are saynig or did you just start flapping your gumsi mean at least bother to do your research before you spout stuff offme thumbs downtalk about irrationality with eloquenceand i hate to break it to you inflation is pretty low on the list of problems that need to be resolvedi can think of much worse things as i can imagine everyone else can as welland criminalizing mining is just flat edmacrominers should be banned yes but thats as far as it goesminers who bother to sit there and grind away for 2 hours straight or more deserve the fruits of there labors if that guy sits there all day and eats up an belts worth of rock then he deserves that as wellits called first come first serve so long as they are still there actively communicating and presentmacrominers script it up and walk away thats called cheatingsome people work hard to get what they wantthats just 1 of thousands of issues i have with your so called proposal
hmm solve inflation by creating inflationhmmm look its upto to players to report macro minersand its upto ccp to ban emi see no real problems buying ships and stuff in empireand stfu about mission runnersthey have to contend with thieves and griefers just like anyone elseand um i sell the mods i bring homeunless i realy need the mega zyd etcso thats contributing to bringing down the price by meeting demandwhich is exactly what we neednot some poorly written op by someone who would prolly benefit more from inflation
agreed holy crap they broke something that was working great aaaaaa
this has been posted before but i cant find the thread offhand so ill just support this one as well and yes avoiding jita is a pain which is why its the hub but if youre willing to make the extra jumps you should be able to do so and still use the automated routefinding software a slider for how much you prefer fewer players in the style of the sec preference slider would be quite handy
new idea dont autopilot
i dont know how you plan long routes but i set destination and then warp to zero on the gates it tells me to its the route planner that hes complaining about not the autopilot
hey guys whats going on over here
jita is actually easy to avoid unless you are goin to maurasi which you probably wont be set a waypoint through either new caldari or tunttaras
1 open starmap2 right click solar systems3 click add waypoint4 set your own route5 ccp doesnt have to do everything for us after all
yes if you know which systems to use to go aroundbut anyways just an idea as indicated by the responses not vital by any means but makes things slightly easier
the real problem is that so many routes lead through jita that plotting a course around jita often adds a few jumpswhat we need are more gates around jita if we had more routes around jita then the autopilit would pick them already anyways
i like this idea support 100
scamming is legit in eve caveat emptor and all that
give me an option to filter away want to buy orders and im happy its a real pain if you want to look for a ship 
let me think about it  your carebearideas and instead remove all warnings on contracts including freeform warnings sounds good eh
thats easy enough to do  set a minimum price of zero
i would love to do massive courier hauling but the current setup is highly corupt and flawed many courier are either bait runs to get a hauler into low sec so that the shipper can blow them up and also get the bondor they are fixed scams cans with huge single container cargos that 99 of the players impossible to haul forcing them to fail and loose their huge bondsand lastly these courier missions are way too vulnerable to pirates its like the courier system was designed to benefit pvpers and to hurt shippers and haulersyou need to have alot more sorters and filters including low sec filters and odd sized cargosif i were you to make the system functional and enjoyable i would take the real object out of the equasion make it so that the shipper at least in highsec space has 100 reliability in the shipping system make it more of a postal systemhave shippers buy boxes based on sizedistanceriskand special handling instructions like rush or fedexthey could also set up bulk shipping contracts that would emulate single m3 boxes so that any number of shippers could cooperate in getting the shipment to its destonation only limited by their cargobay sizeif a hauler is blowup or leaves the game whatever the box would return to the origin after a preset time to be shiped by another hauler it is even possible for a pirate to still blow up a hauler and deliver the shipment himself for the hauling feethis would mean that pvpers or scammers would not be able to profit from haulers as much but it would function and be enjoyable which it is not right now unless you want to risk 25 million isk to make 15000 isk
3 this would allow a battleship to be moved in a hauler over the course of 10 trips this seems obviously wrong the size cap does need to go up but breaking down has to be limited by the contents of the packagehe did say ore and minerals when he stated his example use some common sense he obviously didnt mean breaking down a battleship or capital ship into tiny little loads
to make this as simple as possible suggestion  make it so only ew ships can fit ew modules remove the ew cycle make it like it was in 2004
to make this as simple as possible dont fix what isnt broken
its notbroken it just sucks
currently the pilgrim needs a small buffthere are allready some topics about this matter  but as far as i know no csm member or dev responded to any of themso i made my own here and i ask the csm to bring this to ccpthe thing the pilgrim needs is a range bonus on its neuts but we really dont want curses that can use covert ops cloaksthe pilgrim currently has these bonusses amarr cruiser skill bonus 5 bonus to tracking disruptor effectiveness and 10 bonus to drone hit points and damage per levelrecon ships skill bonus 20 bonus to energy vampire and energy neutralizer transfer amount and 96 to 100 reduction in cloaking device cpu use per levelrole bonus 200unit reduction in liquid ozone consumption for cynosural field generation and 50 reduction in cynosural field durationthe curse has these bonusses amarr cruiser skill bonus 5 bonus to tracking disruptor effectiveness and 10 bonus to drone hit points and damage per levelrecon ships skill bonus 40 bonus to energy vampire and energy neutralizer range and 20 bonus to energy vampire and energy neutralizer transfer amount per levelthe basic idea behind the recon ships is that there are 2 versions  1 of them is a stealthy ewar machine and the other is basicly an ewar hacif the pilgrim gets a buff  it shouldnt take away the role of the curse so the curse should have either more neuting power or more range the things the curse and pilgrim share are a tracking disruptor bonus  a drone damage and hitpoint bonus and a neutnos draining amount bonusthe curse has a neut range bonus and the pilgrim has the ability to use a covert ops cloaking devicebecause the pilgrim lacks the range bonus for the neuts  its too hard to actually get your ewar to work on your targetsolution remove the drone damage bonus from the pilgrim and give it a 25  range bonus for neuts this way the curse keeps on having a range and damage edge over the pilgrim  but the pilgrim isnt totally useless anymorefor a very detailed but a litle dated post aout the amarr recons problems press me
i would much rather see it loss the neut amount bonus for a range bonus and keep the drone bonusneutnos have minimal impact on missile boats and without any bonused weapons system it will get used even less solo
okay i posted on other thread and how does this csm work you decide issues on your views or the peoples view
move it
since i already have the salvage drones skill on my main im guessing they already thought of this and just havent implemented it yet
there was a feature in the old ea game earth and beyond that might be of great use hereasteroids come into contact with many things so why not make the archeology skill have a new second purpose make there be a  chance of something being discovered within or impacted with any average asteroid could be as small as a tech 2 part or a small can with somevaluable minerals in it or a bpc or bpo or for extremely large roids perhaps even a small damaged ship or some damaged gear im not suggesting that every roid contain something just a small  chance who knows might make mining intresting againjust imagine the delight of some n00b mining a veld rock and they have the archeology skill at level whatever and they pop a nice little supriseofc i would hope it is impd in such a way so that macro miners cant take advantage of it though 
1 shortcut folders onto desktop2 open folder 3 delete content that is cached4 profit
heres a new suggestionwhy not make attributes contribute to actual ingame performance of the playerfor exampleevery point into willpower adds o5 more damage to all weapon systems used so that be about 1015 maxevery point of charisma adds o5 standings gains or taxfee reductionevery point of perception adds o5 to scan resolution and targeting rangeif you make all attributes tie into to somthing or even possible multiple somethings it would become an incintive to train learning skills to the max the bonus should however be minute minute as possibly o25 instead of 05
i disagree with the whole concept of this thread im a fairly new player and havent found having to train learning skills have limited me at all you just need to use your imagination and find ways of playing that you can do there is plenty of activities to choose from if you dont like the way the game works you dont have to play
just for reference ill provide a little eve life storywhen i joined eve i wanted to mine i did my thing in 10 during my trial period learned how some stuff worked etc etc i thought id get rich flying to low sec to mine so i did and promptly got popped in the belts the guys who were there were nice enough i talked w them and i realized mining was boring versus the rush i just had in getting blown up i joined their pirate corp and started to yarr in my first month of eve how does this have to do with learning skills how do you think a 1 month old pirate training nothing but learn skills does crap i trained the learning skills a few levels in nothing special but immediately started on getting that warp scramble better gunnery skills better tank skills when your that new training a basic skill from lvl1 to lvl 3 makes a huge differenceand heck alot of basic skills you might not even have and they take next to no time instead of immediately training learning skills for over a month so later on in eve when im training rank 8 lvl 5 skills i can do it faster i trained my basic survival skills so that i wouldnt get wtfbbqd all day longhow has this affected me a year into eve i consider and the pilots around me consider me to be a good pvp pilot i can fly 2 races of ships t2 ships up to cruiser and t2 fit my ships w good support skills ive worked on my learning skills since that first month here and there training them up being able to fly worthwhile ships has allowed me to make isk and buy implants to make up for my learning skills as i begin to train longer skills i see the importance of those learning skills and will likely be training them higherin short learning skills arent a mistake they are there for you to grind away immediately if you choose to they will be there later on if you choose to get some immediate pew pew on is it to your advantage to train them yes is it to your advantage to train gunnery skills of course however the level at which you train them and when is entirely up to you if i were a newbie flying around in drone boats i surely would be concentrating on my drone skills while gunnery sat on the back burner remember if you have every learning skill to level 5 you have the learning advantage against an opponent who doesnt so at first that opponent may kick your butt but later you may be able to kick his because you got to that new itemship faster
would need some balancing the problem is that it would make it much easier to probe down missioners in lowsec or for highsec wars
actually the way i saw it was that if you had access to more wrecks your chances of hitting a person running a missionbesides missions are in deadspace so you would be less likely to find wrecks there than wrecks left abandoned after a mission has been turned inmissioners are already easy to probe down by searching for drones since you dont deploy drones unless you are fighting somone
dear csmccp recently updated thier drawing board and has future plans for exploration and science vesselsi have an extensive 15 page plan on my computer now about introducing soe ships as the premeire civillian science vessels where as ore would be seen as a equal in industrythe way i have it setup is a love hate realtionship between the two organizations they paritally can benifit from each other but most of the time one sides actions will short change the otheri also plan to have soe to be just as extensive as their ore counter parts currently ore is used to mine ice roids and gas and a capitol to increase logistics ability although expected of a mining ship this gives them into three different markets something thats soe is going to have a hard time getting to compete with soe products would be for artifacts current cosmos exploration and data in an attempt to be competitive with ore and help generate this love hate relationshipthe idea goes as far as from the simple civillian ship to its most advanced variant a support capitol ship and further expands to player owned empire mechanics similar to how moon miners are used the science equivalent would compete with itthe end idea is to allow for expansion of other civillian branches salvage and hacking to also be added and provide thier services that would assist thier allies and disassist thier not so friendly neighbors ie salvaging clears out riod belts of garbage keeping them healthy for miners while soe would rather keep those garbage places to look for important data that might collect therethe reason why i was delaying the publishing of the notes let alone streamline them was the fact i wanted to get a visual aspect done first however time seems to be shortening for me so i think its in order to get this idea out early enough to make a decision impact on ccp before they go to far into this on thier own path and having a new suggestion getting introduced may cause hardships on the development team as they consider the new options vs how far they already got doneif you approve of making this suggestion to be heard or at least drafted i would love to see support though suggestions thoughs and changes as this is for the entire eve player base not just myself before we the players via csm submit a finalized suggestion to ccpupdate sept 13its up but not posting the link here yet as its not fully ready got alot of things to hammer out and artwork to get done with itthe little guy with too much imaginationnova fox
could you maybe try and outline the range of ships and their specific use casesthe concept looks interesting indeed i like the colour scheme
i was going to plan on posting this in full in features and ideas if csm agrees to at least take a look at it
id happily take a look
ill be assembeling the document into fourm format for easy reading then and ill hit this page up once its finished if you have any possible bright ideas hit this thread up and ill see about it
oh come on andrew thats just stupiddo i really have to repeat what ankh said when she hit the nail right on its headand where did you read that my fellow delegates are terrible you are obviously not reading my message i used scary which is an informal way of expressing that one is surprised
gotta love the inside baseball as for the meeting i agree that theres been rather a paucity of interesting topics recently but i was under the impression that meetings were regularly scheduled anyone staring at a big blank agenda can easily enough find some lessinteresting topics still worthy of advancement or bring some forward on the assembly hall and see what players have to say or dredge for old topics that never got brought up for one reason or another but with no meeting even on the horizon and lameduck syndrome starting to show upfor those not running next time at least its not a surprise that laziness is setting in and people have stopped really caring it is however immensely unfortunate  not only does it mean that less is being done but it casts a bit of a shadow upon the idea of player representation in mmos generally i dont know that any other game has ever done something like a csm and id hate to see it fail for procedural reasons or because those involved have given up on something or other im not trying to attribute blame to anybody here  im not on the inside i dont know if its everybodys fault or nobodys im just saying the system seems not to have been working especially well for the last week or two its not time to throw up our hands in defeat of course but i would like to see the resumption of regularly scheduled meetings at the very least
weekly meetings should be a desirable goal of the csm if not i definately agree that fortnightly meetings need to be held if there arent any agenda items suitable if then why not discuss an issues for development purposesheck why not even get around to making some firm rules for meetingscsm scope etcsince you arent allowed to raise these concerns in a voting meetinginteraction with the playerbase via the forums has always been poor for a number of the csm members im starting to think that some werent supported to do csm stuff but to occupy a position to stop others doing csm stuffit could however be a disenchantment with the process and csm given the rocky beginnings and clear noncommunication between many members or negative communication between members lets hope for better next timetake carearithron
well charlieyes it would have been polite to answer a direct question on when we should have the next meeting and what that meeting should cover if you had agreed with ank then you should have posted i agree with ank  seconded simply saying nothing looks like you werent interested of course you are not the only one who hasnt replied or commented on the question but you are the only one posting in public disapproval of poor csm communications standards with sadface smilies at the lack of activity  hence you have voluntarily claimed for yourself a higher standard than those you are critical of from my perspective as chair i need feedback and comment from the other delegates on this questiondo we wait until we get ccp feedback on the 2nd session issues do we continue with the biweekly meetings do we have a brainstorming session on general issues such as those proposed by ank if we do are those in way way shape or form official are any of the delegates going to disagree with such a meeting being on the record one of the topics ank suggests is improving 00 sovereignty warfare are the goons going to veto that on the continuing grounds that nobody else on the csm has their specific knowledge of territorial warfare if they do that is anything the rest of us going to say on the issue going to matter anyways there are a lot of unanswered questions we have 9 csm delegates and so far 1 solid answer and 1 what she said if i go ahead and schedule a meeting on that basis whats the chances somebody accuses me of making up the rules and rewriting the csm again is more drama what we really need at this pointbut the bottom line charlie is that you are occupying a seat on a committee when the committee chair asks for suggestions on how we proceed with the meeting structure simply saying nothing and assuming that your silence is meant to signify assent for what somebody else says is poor practice whichever way you cut ityeah right and this means that im looking at a fascinating ceilingornament not expressing exasperation with you
well weve been thrown a curveball in the timing anyhow because the late august feedback on issues is being delayed but the bigger issue is the lack of topic advocacy im one of nine csm delegates i cant be advocating everything and ive drawn a huge amount of criticism already for advocating issues that the other csms dont like for one reason or another and those were issues i did care about if you look back through the last meetings a fairly high proportion came from me  if im not seeing anything at the moment that has either a significant popular support and i perceive as being in the interest of eve or b that im personally enthused over  then its probably wrong for me to just keep on scooping up issues for the sake of issues if people care enough about an issue they are welcome to write to me and ask me to take a look at something and argue the point and they can certainly do that for any other csms  but if that isnt happening then maybe the case is that people just dont care that much about the current issue threads well like i said i asked almost two weeks ago what the other delegates wanted to do about upcoming meetings and ive now had two responses of eight both in favor of no more formal meetings until the ccp feedback but mooting the principle of a generalized brainstorming meeting instead but as you can appreciate thats not exactly a consensus as for lameduck syndrome i assure you if there was an issue in the assembly hall i genuinely felt passionate about id be supporting and pushing it for this last session i obviously cant speak for anyone else on that matter thoughwell this csm does have problems its true and once my turn is over ill be pretty outspoken on what they are but even that said i think you are being a little melodramatic reality was that everyone had a bunch of issues they wanted promoted at the beginning and most of us have managed to do what we promised to do in our manifestos in turns of issue advocacy speaking personally i think ive 80 of the manifesto stuff i wanted through to get a hearing and have only failed on the 00 sovereignty improvement and local chat replacement stuff sure im disappointed about that but ultimately you dont get everything you want but the point is once the csms have done their best to meet their manifesto pledges it becomes a matter of reacting to genuine emergencies or inspired good ideas at the moment there isnt much of either in the assembly hall i think there is a sense that weve done as much as can be done on our individual election pledges i for example simply dont believe well get movement on 00 issues in this csm now i think a future team might but this one is too divided and logjammed on these issues but its going to be vital that the electorate choose wisely
not sure i like the way this thread is going i voted for the csm so they could discuss and bring to ccps attention the issues which the players felt were important not to be taking cheap shots at each other and apparently not discussing anything at all that is what rl elections and rl polititians are for for example look at prime ministers question time in the british parliament  an embarassment to the whole democratic processi agree with herschel in that there havent been many great and innovative topics in the ah lately but i also agree with arithron when he said that there are plenty buried back in the assembly hall that are good ideas have decent support which were never raisedi would far rather the csm spend their limited time looking through some of those than wasting it attacking each otherbut what do i know  im just a voter
well mate its for the csms to advocate issues and if the players or alternates want an issue advocated then they need to make the argument and persuade other players to support that issue and talk csms into doing the advocacy and sure for what its worth i agree with you and ank as it happens who say it would be nice to have a brainstorming session in the absence of any issues on some important issues  example 00 sov warfare local chat removal improving lowsec et etc but we do need a consensus to change the focus of meetings otherwise itll just get bitter and snowed under in recriminations again 3of9 votes does not a consensus make at this point i think its best left for the next csm to choose how it wants to handle itself this one has had some successes some failures some pr triumphs and some forum fiascos and its for the next group to define its own rules and regs with any number of the current csms either not standing next time or maybe not getting reelected itd be a bit rum to spend the last month making rules for the next people i think well best can be hoped for is that the electorate factor that into their votes next time around speaking personally i do feel weve found the limits of what kind of issues can get through the csm and im disappointed that limit prevents us addressing the big issues we were asked to consider but theres a very real question on whether the essential nature of the csm would ever allow advocacy of those issues since it is a virtual council of ingame interest groups determined to argue their corner given that the big issues are almost by definition political issues its no surprise that agreement doesnt come easy or indeed possible between ideological enemies
i completely disagree about prime ministers questions by the way i think its the cornerstone of our democracy in the uk and its absolutely neccessary for a leader to stand up to robust debate and challenge on a regular basis but on topic this is what tends to happen towards the end of a term when most election promises have been kept and people have done what they said theyd do some of us wont be standing again others will with the outstanding issues covered then some csms are beginning their reelection campaigns early and a certain degree of backbiting and personal attacks on rivals is to be expected ccp named us tribal chieftains of the internet not marrage guidance counselors so its not exactly a surprise to see delegates sharpening their bootknives for a little character assassination in the runup to the next poll nothing is stopping you posting and getting them back onto the first page and trying to engage players and csm delegates in the discussion if you feel ive missed something that you think i should support then let me know make the argument and if it persuades me ill support it cant really say fairer than that
i dont think it will cause any drama to go right ahead with it people cant whine if they didnt voice their opinion in the first place no that would be silly if they did even if they did during a meeting then the logs will always be public and even the community can identify the reason why we are not discussiong the issue which bothers a lot of people
interesting reading in all cant say i buy the arguement about csm members having fulfilled their manifestos etc csm are elected to represent the players first and foremost its the narrow focus of their own manifestos that have limited the effectiveness of the csm in the first place of course its easy to use the 5 rule regarding current issues in the assembly hall to justify nonactivity its just not doing what you were elected to do arithron
they say its more complicated than most of us can dare imagine ajoining some sort of a tabels have millions of different entries and this game would simply be an exhasting manpower effort
i read this post last night and i honestly couldnt sleep because i was still trying to wrap my mind around iti think your idea is the best of local fixes however i think its been over thought just imagine how much more server side work this system could cause as i thought more about your idea i tried to think of a way to have a similar effect but simpler here is what i thought ofconcord neural networks would be high seclow sec nothing to do with your npc standings they will function for you the networks would corp controlled this means that your ceodirectors would have a new panel in the corp management tab where they are allowed to add xmaybe 5 or 10 number of blues and xmaybe 5 or 10 number of reds each slot could cost a certain amount of isk for adding or changing these bluesreds also there would be a 24hr delay for concord to update the networkskinda like a war dec notice npc corps would always show in local due to being npc controlledin high sec local would function as it currently does everyone shows and blueredsnuets are shownnow here is where the changes startin low sec blues show up only if they have you set blue also reds show will show up also the local counter will show the number of bluesredsneutrals this way you can see if you have any friends any enemies and if there is a unknown threat you have to discover neutrals can be discovered if you a probe them like you currently would b if they aggro any bluereds in the system they become visible in localin player controlled 00these networks dont have to be pos based we all know pos warfare is boring and doesnt need more added to it they could simply be associated w stations if a hard target needs to be established however this system will work only in the corpsalliance sov systems and it will work the same as low sec the only difference is the level of sov will change the number x of bluesreds you can have visible obviously lvl 1 could be significantly lower than the concord number lvl 2 slightly less lvl 3 on parslightly above lvl 4 sov may be unique in being able to show the bluereds  neutralsin npc 00again works the same as low sec however instead of concord networks you would have the npc faction network for that region this is where you could bring standings into it for instance the serpentis constellation in fountain may charge more per slot because you have high standings towards an opposing factioni think this could cause a increase of roaming gangs you have a incentive to travel to a different region and attack someone you dont know because they wont see you coming this allows the recons to do their job go into system find targets that will show neutral to the gang get the gang a warp in and pew pew this also allows traders to move further through space with less chance of being noticed this wont stop gate camps in low sec they will still sit on those high seclow sec gates and pop anything that comes through because even if you dont show on local you show in space this will help small corp solo pvp players they can fly around without being noticed immediately and hunt targets
sorry but i firmly disagree with this ideayou can not improve player experience on a broader level with thisno matter how you present this ideastagnation is not a valid game improvement tooland thats exactly what this will bring to eve
full supportits been out there for two years and its still popular should be a hint to ccp

ccp likes these threads to go the math route so heres my analysisincreasing optimalfalloff increases the arc length at that range raising the necessary absolute velocity to achieve necessary radial velocity to avoid being hit by a turret thus a range increases and tracking increases both work to increase the overall hit envelope for a turretscorch25 penalty to tracking  lowers hit envelope50 bonus to range  increases hit envelopeno goofy third bonus  ammo is usefulconflagration25 penalty to tracking  lowers hit envelope50 penalty to range  lowers hit envelopegoofy third bonus  ammo sucks cap quickly this is the pattern for all tech 2 short range ammolong range ammo gets one bonus that increases hit envelope and one that reduces it however short range ammo gets two bonuses that both reduce hit envelope and a goofy bonus that further works to make it uselessmotion to instead give short range ammo a tracking bonus so that like long range ammo it has one bonus and one penalty to its overall tracking envelope
totally agree that t2 ammo needs some rebalancingi make and sell one particular type that has been mentioned here so i suppose you could say i have a vested interest that said the shortrange ammo types have had a raw dealmaybe ccp wants ammo to be free anyway im hoping not and will ask some csm members to support thistake carearithron
t2 ammo needs this
like i said the ideas are boundless what would be really cool is if ccp decided to put this into the game but before started a huge thread with brainstorming ideas on what the players what it to entail
full support great post
give em their pixels
supported the naglfar needs this or a buff as it is the worst dread by far
it looks good you could also add a pitch for players who want to see if a ship class is for them there are a lot of times players especially new ones who think bigger is better waste a lot of time training for a ship and find out they hate it in my opinion nothing is worse for business where a client cannot test a product before they buy it you can change anything i said to fit in your proposal but i think its another valid reason why skill training should be changed a little bitedit supported your proposal
the devs commented on this earlierthey said that the test server needs to be an exact replica as the real serverif you alter certain parts because its just the test server then it isnt the test server anymorebecause if you alter training speeds and stuff like that it will be harder to find bugs that give you better training times and stuffdamn eve search doesnt wanna work with me 
i do see what your saying however ccp have already removed the poss from sisi so its not a exact rep of tq even if they cant give us the option to pick what level of skills im sure they can reset the skill training times all to rank 1 on it without dire comebackstbh its ccps choice however im done with the testserver until ccp either stop mirroring the damn thing or when it is the skills you have trained on there stayive lost count the number of times ive trained or even started to train to help them test like they have asked only for it to get mirrored if a sub capital guy wants to test carriers out they either have to spend all that isk on tq and wait for the next mirror or train it on sis and hope to god they get round to learning the skills to a functinal level before the next mirror both of which isnt really a good model for a testing serverareaive used capitals as its the biggest isk value skills
against fix the nano problem without throwing the whole game off balance these changes affect everyone in special blasterboats too much
stagnation how so
this idea is just as stupid as every other nerf local whineif im in a roaming gang you want me to wait a minute to see if there is anything in local to hunt or i have to drope scan probes in every system i enter thats going to make it even harder to find and catch anybody when youre roamingno support and please go back to your mining
i was reading through the posts one at a time and thinking that this was a good idea then i got to a part where you started talking about fuel costs for cloaking devices and you lost my supportnever ever should there be a cost to cloak on a ship that was designed around cloaking being its primary defenseas long as any idea is based with this potentially in mind somewhere down the line it should never be given thought
yea im sure your ok with the fact that 8 out of 10 guys you encounter in 00 are already cloaked or at a pos by the time you load system cause they saw you come into local something needs to be done about that and this is not that bad of an idea to say that its not a problem is ignorance at its peak 20 second scan times are not unheard of on cov ops frigates so its not like its that much of a wait to see if the system has people in it it would seem the only person whining in this thread is you really
absolutely as long as its protected by a role

in modern air combat simulators you have active and passive radar systems while active radar provides the pilot with more situational awareness its disadvantage it gives away information to passive systemsso why not give local a switchable passive and active mode active  as is with the exception of not seeing players in passive mode and passive mode  invisable but able to see players in active modethis system could only be implemented fairly if asteroid belts had to be scanned in order to be found as hunting miners and ratters would be too casually easy then the hunters would have to scan for belts etc causing a brief portraitname to appear in the passive local window the hunter finds a ship scans again to locate it this is even better than local as it indicates intent but if the minerratter is afk or not paying attention they get gankedthe constellation solution would do if asteroid belts werent made scanable
making local a little less local i like it good idea
if u dont show local you boost cloaker recons to such extend you can not believe gate camps become so more potent00 becomes so much more deadlyim pretty sure every ratter will die in 00 daily as a gang scouted by a cloaking ship will be virtually invisible nowand if u remove local every ratter will use scanner every 30secs can be a demanding job for ccp servers remember why local is showing reds and blues now and pls be realisticand auto updating constellation chat will kill the forge what 1000 ppl updating every secif it wont slow the game though i can live with it but honestly local is in favor of defender or weak atm do u really want to tip the ballance
support
you are basically right except for one thing no ratter will be killed because there will be no one ratting or very few why risk a ship and your pod killing rats when you can just run level 4s
i support
for the love of god stop spamming support messages without checking the support box if this is a joke its not funny if this is an alt bomb its being run by an idiot and if this is a legitimate outpouring of support i weep for the human race
simple question this is one of the systems used by the farming and probably isk selling haulersfrom the location and plethora of nonkill missions agents it seem to be one of them
there you go clicked your support box heart attack averted you going to be ok now freaking out over such tiny issues is bad for your health man maybe channel your tremendous concern for the human race into something a bit more proactive than proper forum procedures would net a more gratifying result
answer is no its a base used by several corporations mine included to run level 3 and 4 missions to help support our attempts to keep pirating out of the area i think that was explained a in a couple of previous posts but there you go one more for the road
it just doesnt make sense to nerf suk there is not much in the way of isk income from rats so why take the missions please sort this out
actually not so tiny people can spam they support an issue as often as you like but it doesnt become an offical 1 until its done its not exactly a tough thing to do  makes you look kinda dim not to do it reallyits the difference between an issue having maybe 10 supports of 27 posts or 24 supports of 27  the 2427 version looks much more emphatically supported to people not going into the thread and is more likely to draw support  attention from csmas for me  i dont even know where this system is so im not supporting
10
i support this request
definitely need to be able to do something else with the slaves and the exotic dancers
maybe when ambulation comes along these poor girls and boys and all the other genders represented will have specialised clubs where they can gain employment if so and poses become ambulatable as well then i would definitely employ some in my corporate pos  with a name like pole dancing vixens i couldnt avoid it really
i never played swg and probably would have if i knew something like that existed it sounds like a fantastic tool for evehowever it could degrade into characters creating very stupid events that just clog up the stations theyre set in if implemented it shouldnt be easily available to anyone who wants to make use of it approval should be requested from some department in the isd and upon granting approval the personcorporation could set up their event this would keep the ccp with some control over what goes on in their world while allowing players to further contribute to the story of eve
if it happens instation it has to happen inside your corp officepostambulation does that sound like a reasonable fix
actually thats another aspect i forgot to mention and solves the issue as well as having it in your corp officein swg you were limited to where you could place these things they could not be in npc cities they really could only be out in the open wild or in your player city this prevented the very issue you are talking aboutso for eve yeah corp offices work or you could rent a bar for the night and for space well space is huge so if you put in a 10 au from any object in space youre probably ok
hmm very interesting idea here some small issues thoughi know you have no put up ships for each race yet but im going to go with what i have read here so farthere is already a module that increases the speed of ships under skirmish warfare and im curious as to why you say there are only 3 sets of warfare links as a remeber there are 5 armor siege information skirmish and minning but the minning one really dose not count for this discussion and as far as this newly proposed module is concerned im not sure people will use it when they have a slipnier or claymore that can give a much higher and longer range bonus then your modulei love the positional engagement idea all ships are in this position so they get a bonus so on and so forth the only issue comes down to blob warfare where that will make a fleet super and male your ship carrying that module pop faster then anythingan unfortunate bit of reality is this any ship that is at the core of a fleets strategy or bonuses will suffer this problem in a fleet battle that ship will be primaried and as a general rule no matter what the ship can do it will die even the speed tank idea will not give it much more survivability remember there are ships out there that can move faster then it and are far cheaper even if it had the speed to deal with close range combat it would still fall victim to a sniper ship or sniper fleet at that range the transversal the number you want to get really high to avoid damage will be so low reletive to the sniper that its going to hit the target the unfortunate bit is that in order to make the ships tank with speed you need to get them moving so fast that they become invulnerable to all ships and dronesyour bonus to abs seems a little to good and here is why using the t2 ab speed 135 bonus to speed and doubling it for your proposed bonus 270 and adding another 50 for zors custom navagtion link and other implants that give bonuses to afterburners 405 and skills 25 for acceleration control is going to be about 50625 bonus to speed note that the proposed bonus to speed for the new mwds is going to be 500 so basicly you have made a much cheaper and easier to run mwd this is just a pilot and his ship there is a good reason why few battleship pilots equip mwds on their ships they are hard to run and unless you need them to get your guns into range they are not worth the time or energy also ships with this would quickly become solo gank machines because of their speed and that is something that ccp has been working a lot over the past couple of years to get away fromthese are really interesting ideas but i really think they need a lot more working out the biggest problem with making ship designs is trying to figure out how the ship could be used in a way that you had not intended and even then you are not garenteed to make a ballanced ship keep up the idea and see where it goes man best of luck to yah
completely agree
agree including the part about the ship owner getting the 100k
fking makes sense but meh lol ccp logics
sadly jade is correct as annoying as it is to have corps singled out of fleets the fact remains that changing it would open it up to wardec avoidance a corporation would be able to dodge a wardec by movingreforming in fw and still remain intact that is unacceptable as it would prevent corporations being destroyeddisbanded which is an important mechanic in eves player run economyif a corporation in fw was completely unable to affect the market in any something which would likely be impossible then you could do it
i just bought a freighter and am helping my corpies move across system when i find out that i cant place standardsecure containers in the cargohold finding this rather annoying  i cant see any reason for it im suggesting that this be rectified perhaps by allowing giant and huge containers to be placed in the cargo also that freight containers could be given a capacity bonus
giant secure container takes 3000 m3 but has room in it for 3950 m3 that is the reason why you cant put them in freighters you can put freight containers in freighter tho as they are specifically for that purpose
thats a truly awful explanation so what your saying is a freighter cant store containers that compress their cargo because
yes that makes sense its just a pain in the proverbial but hey less lag is a good thing
that is how it is designed in my opinion its quite ok if you need more room then train your freighter skill higher or if you need to move then 980 000 m3 then you will need multiple trips
youre quite missing the point i dont need more room i am moving all my corpies stuff across the galaxy now i would like to put each of the 15 corpies stuff into indiviual containers so it doesnt all get mixed up but i cant cause i can only use freight containers
you should be at least be able to put the hugegiant containers into a freighter aswell as the freight ones in my opinion
i think i read somewhere that the ingame justification for this is that you cant put the compressing containers into a cargo hold unless they are stacked and not assembled because the cargo bays of these ships are already of the compressing type  so its like putting a large can inside a giant can  you cant do that eitherhowever i do think there is room in the game for a slightly smaller noncompressing container a tad smaller than the general freight container  at 100k m3 its a bit of a jump from the 3950 you get off the next size down or would if you could even use the buggers which you cant even a 50k cumet would be a help logistically
ccp does a lot of really strange things with cargo space and this is just one of them yes freighters need more sizes of containers either that or just make noncompressive cargo dividers items arbitrary size  you can change the size on the fly and use them in any ship if you want to containerize at an arbitrary sizethough obviously it cant be bigger than your remaining hold or smaller than the items within it everybody from freighters to interceptors could make use of them in a worthwhile fashion of course i dont know if the database would like that proposal but its plausible and would be incredibly worthwhile

if goonswarm wants to hold a system then bloodmoney incorporated is definitely wasting their time looking for any resources there00 alliances have their playground if you dont want to have growing corps hide in highsec there needs to be a gradual progression of difficultyif one entity discovers they can hold 20 viceroyalties it would be a disaster they would make far more than they ever could in 00 and it would be completely brokeni dont think the developers have any vision of moving the large scale endgame anywhere but 00
of course not were not stupid enough to try to horn in on the dysprosium market my point was that lowsec should accommodate both not that we can go head to head my vision is of a fairly steady progression from empire spacelow risk low commitment low reward to fw lowsecmedium risk low commitment low reward for nonrpers to nonfw lowsecmedium risk high commitment decent rewards to npc nullsechigh risk medium commitment high reward to playerowned nullsechigh risk high commitment spectacular reward only the last supports allout private war on a large scale either financially or logistically four of those exist correctly at present but private lowsec is a glaring hole and thus i try to address it not with artificial wars but with a proper valuation lowsec should be noticeably more profitable than highsec  you get better ore better agents better rats better complexes and you can randomly steal other peoples stuff if you care to it should be noticeably less profitable than 00  worse ore worse rats worse complexes worse agents and no ability to build up all the nice sovrequired structures if it fits into that zone then you dont need viceroy systems because the level of reward will attract the kind of corps you want anybody big enough to hold 00 space will do so because its just better so what you get will be the 20man corps who have a taste for the dangerous while the 200man corps with a taste for capital warfare will go to where the real money is instead a 200man corp who chooses to roll over lowsec will be wasting their abilitiesbarring the odd dysprosium moon so itll turn into a training ground for growing corps and a playground for established small corps who want a system to call their ownedit how exactly did i mess up aggress with address
some things you might want to add to the rewards section1 if you control a viceroy you should be able to get a percentage of the refinery taxs in your systems up to 10 as this is based upon the already set tax youd be getting 10 of the 5 tax that the stations charge or 05 of the tax would come to your corp 2 viceroy entitlement would allow moon mining in a 04 you control this is only allowed to the viceroy so while another corp could take out your tower they couldnt moon mine there without owning the system in their viceroy3 make standings effect your viceroyship holding this works in two ways one it gives the corp controlling it a reason to ratexploredefend their area ship kills npc and player in your controlled systems count towards your control of the systems limit of say 5 per day this would make it so that 00 alliances couldnt control one with an alt corp and just sit there theyd have to actively work their space to keep it under their control4 ability to add agents to your viceroy stations using the sov 3 system time progression of holding simple you holding your viceroy for 5 weeks you can begin luring agents there this has a cost and you can use lps with your empire faction the space your holding is in to lure better agents5 ability to upgrade the services on npc stations in your viceroy tired of a 30 refinery in your viceroy making it so no one refines there np upgrade it signifigant cost for this but would help make areas more profitable6 upgrades you put in place are attackable so if their brought down time and time again until you repair them then you are losing standing with your viceroy and the attackers are gaining as a strong corp that could hold it7 a percentage of all services goes to the viceroy corphope that helps
no no no they will still have an entry point  they can mine to get their lawbreaking jolliesbut would that mean it would be entirely lawful to can flip the renegade miners or would you just count as an accomplice to the heineous crime of setting laser to rock
the nano issue has seen a lot of threads some of the ideas are good some arent hopefully this one gets some attentionproblem mwd is too easy to permarun on a nano fitsolution increase cap usage for mwds not the cap penalty possibly add a ship bonus for cap usage on interceptors and other ships meant to be speedtankedeffectsnanos are still a viable option but their flight time is limiteda ship can be made to permarun the mwd but uses slots for cap mods hurting the nano andor removing valuable mid slotsmwd remains useful for closing distance and escapingeverybody wins
what ships are you flying that a mwd permaruns the pvp fit where i can run my mwd for more than three cycles withoiut crippling myself is rare now i tend to run beefy blaster boats not nano ships but those things are utter pigs asis a battleship mwd uses more cap than an entire large cap booster provides and the cruiser and frigate ones use significant portions of their respective boosters i cant imagine making them worse would actually improve combat itd just annihilate legitimate fits as well as degenerate ones
your forgetting that this wld gimp the ships that have to sacrifice their tanksewar etc to fit a mwd even more which is a bad thing and was one of ccps reasons for trying to remove the need for nano owww i trademark that one d
i agree with these above two comments but only to a point imho the only reason a mwd really cripples a standard fit is the capacitor penalty more activation cost especially if the penalty was gone wouldnt cripple these fits as bad the point remains however getting four or five cycles without sacrificing any slots for cap mods leads to this modules abuse

umyou do realise that the cn variant is 25 better in terms of hpsec right rightand that shield boosters are one of the most pimpable items in the game going all the way up to the billions for the top deadspace stuff
yes i do understand that but for a 1 sec cycle difference shouldnt be as staggering as it ismaybe a 2 sec difference or 50 powercycle needed im not talking like make it magical or anything just better then it really is
subtracting a mere one second is a 20 reduction yielding a 25 increase in tank thats huge saying that one second doesnt matter is like saying that adding one second to each operation your computer does should be irrelevant when it would actually slow it down by a factor of a few billion its not the absolute size that matters its the relative size you picked about the worst possible example to support your point here  cnxlsb are one of the better bigfaction items if you want to complain start looking at factional hardeners for example even those are plausible because of the fact that theyre far easier to fit but theyre generally not worth the money but the shield boosters definitely are if youre using them on the right ship  heck 110 mil is a bargain for something like a pvp golem
fw nodes have been seeing a lot of combat that is almost as big in terms of numbers and capitals as 00 big battles most of the 00 battles get the uber nodes to reduce lag yet the fw nodes are still crap thus exceedingly bad lag could ccp please reinforce the fw nodes so we can get some good fights without waiting 5 minutes to lock something
no they have said they want small gang warfare for fw so they obviouslly arent going to do thisi for all agree with them i dont think fw should be 00 lite with all the blobs and crap but more about real pvp fun
big fat pile of support for this
i agree
agree argh
overview was fine as it was quick change of temporary settings was a very useful thing
build the jita bypass simply make sure there is a gate from every system connected to jita to every other system connected to jita then unless your going to jita the shortest route will take you around it
it would be nice if they would just add two systems to jita one dead end system to push all the mission agents off to and a bypass systembut yeah id throw my support in for an avoid crowded systems option to the autopilot for route planning
this the op is totally negating the point of webs except agianst the rare ab ships which i honestly dont think well see much of
a fair point and as youve said above youve taken enough flak over the last few months that i cant blame you for trying not to rock the boat as i said people are getting lazy also as i said im not trying to blame anybody  not you not lvv nobody i dont know who is at fault nor do i have any way of knowing im just trying to assert that there is a fault something that all involved seem to agree on  you and lvv in words the other seven by their silence yeah a touch melodramatic im just annoyed by ccps tendency towards excessive ambition  they do immensely cool things but because they go haring off in a thousand directions at once 999 of them fall short due to lack of support the csm is not failing merely because theres been a couple slow weeks but i dont want to see it fail at all thus im raising the issue after two weeks instead of waiting two months and having it be irreparable yeah but thats always vital the scariest thing about politicians saying this is the most important election of our lives is that theyre usually right  they all matter as much as the institution that theyre getting voted into matters obviously the csm is not a government not even ingame but if the csm matters and i think it does then its elections matter just as much and if you cant work on promises work on the ideas of others its not as flashy and its way more disjoint but its far better than giving up

u dont get into the system its for saftey throughout the system not like it would be a massive charge but atleast if a pirate comes to raid you you have the isk to buy back the ship a corp should have control over everything it owns even soveriegnty of the system
that is a terrible horrible awful idea
you say it wouldnt be a massive charge  but what is to stop the defending corp putting an entry fee of several billion isk into a system with the understanding that corpalliance members will get it reimbursed instant mostlysafe system in low sec i dont know about cyno fields  but if you have a cyno jammer field up as well wouldnt that make the system 100 safeheck why not just make it so if you have level 4 sov in a system you can declare it to be 10 sec empire spaceif you want to charge for entry into your space put some effort into it camp the entry gates and enforce a toll on pain of destruction  or just make destruction to toll that is paid eve is more about that than sitting in a deckchair while some automatic mechanism for collecting cash makes you richer
ccp should disband the csm and apologize to the gaming community for preceeding forward with it then sweep it under the rug they currently use for placement of lag related issues and claim it doesnt exist
stagnation how so
this idea is just as stupid as every other nerf local whineif im in a roaming gang you want me to wait a minute to see if there is anything in local to hunt or i have to drope scan probes in every system i enter thats going to make it even harder to find and catch anybody when youre roamingno support and please go back to your mining
i was reading through the posts one at a time and thinking that this was a good idea then i got to a part where you started talking about fuel costs for cloaking devices and you lost my supportnever ever should there be a cost to cloak on a ship that was designed around cloaking being its primary defenseas long as any idea is based with this potentially in mind somewhere down the line it should never be given thought
yea im sure your ok with the fact that 8 out of 10 guys you encounter in 00 are already cloaked or at a pos by the time you load system cause they saw you come into local something needs to be done about that and this is not that bad of an idea to say that its not a problem is ignorance at its peak 20 second scan times are not unheard of on cov ops frigates so its not like its that much of a wait to see if the system has people in it it would seem the only person whining in this thread is you really
i hope it gos through this time the csm and ccp need to make this one happen
oh please yes currently poses look silly

now if we dont want faction ammo nerfed significantly wouldnt it be better to have close range t2 ammo be well close range as in less damage than normal but higher tracking maybe even bonus to gun sig resolutionexplo velocity
againstfaction gear should be better than t2 it only makes since that big empires keep the best stuff to themselves it is realistic who has better bombs usa or chilei think a better route would be to have t2 faction items that combine the bonuses it would of course be hugely expensive but would make sense
t2 does not need to be better than faction but it needs to be equal to its t1 version which for many t2 ammo types this simply is not true because of the pointless stacking nerfs on itmake the nerfs singleissue regardless of the quantity of bays loaded and it would actually be functional currently the idiotic limitations make using base t1 far superior and faction renders most t2 flat useless esp caldari which is being farmed to death because of the insane profit margin on faction missiles

makes sense
um whats that got to do with anything leaving aside the fact that stations dont change hands all that often if an alliance decides to spend the isk on a hypothetical outpost upgrade to provide an agent then thats an investment theyre making just like adding a refinery upgrade
so if hisec missions were made more entertaining but less lucrative youd quit being able to endlessly grind dull safe repetitive killmissions is the only thing keeping you subscribed
the average idea here by anti mission guys is make them more grind and less rewarding nerfing them both ways they see them as mining arknor or bistot and want them to move them to mining ice especially ki an and his clones not a surprise has he has stated more than once his pure hatred for mission runners to avoid large or huge after effects mission running must be changes with the chisel doing a small change and then looking the effects some of the new missions seem to go that way from the reports of people running them you and your friends want want to sue the sledgehammer
i support this since they got rid of lofty scams and made it harder to high sec gank the reward for missioningcearbearing is to high v risk ccp say there game is equal on riskvreward but they are missing the fact that carebearing has to risk no more part from beeing scammed in jita but thats there own fault for not reading and nowing what is and what not fix the risk in high sec
people who advocate the nerf of hi sec never play in high sec
sorry but i missed the part about making mission interesting in the opmixing in pvp dangers does not make the mission interesting  its still the same mission just lot more dangerousoh yeah i wrote its the last thing keeping me here  that should imply i tried lots of other things  seems you did not catch that 
moving all lvl4 agents to 00 is dream of big 00 allianceslvl3s in lowsec actually by product of this dream and not even useful for anything probably ratting in lowsec better than farming lvl3syou can not group against of any 00 alliance big or small you go there in cloak ships and farm belts  because any alliance even a npc station based corp is in 00 for constant pvp chance not for the moneythe will of the op is asking faction fitted npc ships run into 00 and die in their gate campsbtw dropping of lp and isk generated will make faction stuff much more expensive and carebear stuff much more cheaper and a quite many account cancellations because there are many ppls in this game playing game for occasional lvl4s they do in relative safety of high secbecause its a challanging while staying comfortablefyi this game penalize shippod loss heavily im against this proposal
seems you didnt catch that i said entertaining not dangerous seriously all you want to do is log in and do the same old kill missions lining up a bunch of completely predictable red  and popping them kill missions are basically space invaders on a nice 3d backdrop
and who are u that u can judge what peoples should do or should not and what would entertain others if they like to do this than they should able to do thisevery empire cb could crywhy so big part of eve universe is 00 so they cant play there for the money they pay in peace in style they like without joining 00 alliancesso lets make every 00 to highsec would be that not a bit sux because what the guys here suggest is the same with the cbsps no im not a chinese isk farmer my english sux just because i never learned english and because the majority of the forums would not understand what i write if i would use my mother language
here is a solution to the ops problem doesnt need any intervention from ccp and that can be done today1 if you just hate carebear missioners and2 this hatred propels your nerd rage to a fever pitch you can3 get some of your nerd raging buddies together and start invading high sec missions 4 while there steal loot salvage whatever you like 5 hell shoot a few rats and get some bounties while you are at it and of course6 even get the chance of annoying a poor carebear to the point where it decides to open fire on your flashy ass7 profit or you can just continue to whine for ccp to do your job for you but i wouldnt hold my breath for that
the biggest problem in 00 is simply that it isnt scalable you reach belt saturation point ratters and miners normally very quickly it takes a lot of intelligence to keep a few systems safe enough for people in big pve fit ships to come out to make isk this requires a lot of people to maintain while at the same time reducing the rewards 3 ratters can take care of 12 belts 2 can with really nice fits and skillsin u4 in syndicate their is an l4 kill agent q20 and an entire corp use to pay a fee just to have access to that station that single agent was worth the 150m a month tax on that corp that is my biggest problem with both sides empire argues that 00 can make 60mhour ratting and leave them alone and 00 people complain that that only happens every third blue moon on a tuesday when they are mystically alone in system i normally mine 00 but have been running l3 and l4 mission courier and kill in lowsec and now l3 kill mission in high sec to get standings for a datacore agent i have seen both sides the last few weeks empire is even more dangerous for me because of war decs on my main
damb dude youre mighty defensive about a bunch of stuff i didnt say i thought it was a pretty uncontentious assertion to say that missions in eve are dull and unimaginative
atm caldari stations have a 35km docking range from the undock point wich is something that should be lowerd to that of some of the gallente stations wich atm only has about 1km from undock to your out of docking rangeit should never be completly safe to undock from some of the stations like it is today

hello all i posted this in fi and got some pretty good reception and now im sending it to the assembly hall for votingwarning alot of text but please continue to readmy idea would require a bit of work but i honestly think it is a very good ideaweve all heard about the pirates  alliance members complaining endlessly about how carebears can make horrid amounts of money in high security with virtually no risk save ninja salvagers and can flippers well while i was having a long debate with someone in fi about ninja salvaging for some reason this idea popped into my headwhy not make agents contractable to alliances and corporations this idea is pretty refined and didnt have many wrinkles to start out with but the ones that were found were ironed out here are the main onesagents can only be placed inside 03 sec systems or below so you must have a pos or outpost in 03 space or below no high sec agents this idea is out there to help pirates an alliances not high sec dwellers even more another one i can recall is that again since this would be to help ease pirates and alliances all these agents would give payouts in between lvl 4 and lvl 5 agents in both monetary and lp and standings rates there would also be no faction standings requirment to use agents for any corp the rp reason the empires are having a flood of npc pirate corp activity and now there are simply not enough pilots in high security to deal with the influx of these activities and the empires are now allowing outsourcing from the pirate rp point of view the empires are putting more pressure on them so they need help to fight against the empiresthere will also be a penalty so to speak for having an agent in your sovereign space now while you can hire an agent to work for you and do get loyalty points from them the agents do not come with an lp store you would have to go to one of that npc corps stations to use the lp you have earned with themok my idea is pretty simple allow alliances and corporations to hire agents for their corporation for a price here is the price listthere will be a generic agent level in between lvl 4 and lvl 5 agents so to speak a lvl 45 agentthe price for this agent would be approx in between my original prices for lvl 4 and lvl 5 agentsto hire these agents it would cost approximately 395million per week if your going to hire this agent it needs to be something you plan on doing not just hiring as a cash cow you can use when you lose one to many shipsnow since we all know many alliances could easily afford this price as well as some corps there will also be limits on how many agents can be hiredalliancesa maximum of 8 of these agentscorporationsa maximum of 3 of these agentssame prices apply for both alliances and corporationsok now that we have the prices and limits out now locationwhen you hire an agent you have to put that agent up in a pos or outpost if you place them at a pos they have to be placed into a habitation module anchored around a pos living quarters for the agent and they must be destroyable if their habitation module is destroyed you lose that agent obviously hes dead but also if they are killed there is a minimal twoweek cooldown period towards all corporation and you can no longer hire agents from any corporation for that two week period in addition to that all other agents from all corporations are pulled out by the corporation and again you must wait two weeks before you can hire another agent from them and you dont get a refundnow if the agent is put at an outpost no habitation module is needed they are simply placed inside the outpostanother limitation would be that to use that agent you must be a
must be a part of that corporation  alliance to use any agents they have hiredok now in fi we got a few concerns about alliances making alt  ghost corps to hire practicaly infinite amounts of agents i have also thought of a way around that as wellagain the limitation that is already in place is that you must be a part of a corp  alliance to use their agent well this one has to deal with makine a ton of alt corps hiring a bunch of agents then joining the alliance with those addition of a ton of agents here is the way around thatwhile individual corps can hire agents if that corp has an agent and then joins an alliance he loses access to all the agents he has hired immediately and again no refunds and then he is part of the alliance and thus can now use the agents of that alliancethis also works both ways if your part of an alliance with access to agents and leave you lose access to that agent immediately simple as that but also another catch is that you must also wait a mandatory 2 week cooldown period after you leave an alliance before you can hire any agents of any npc corpnow there is still the concern of hiring those ghost corps but until we can find another way around it its a problem that would have to stay because tbph its no different than most pvpers having mission running alts in dodixie and auniathe main reason i thought of this idea is because to be perfectly honest low sec and 00 space should be at the least more profitable than high security imo and in many other opinions more risk should  more reward and while this idea might not clear up everything and all the problems that exist it would help clear up a tremendous amount friction between the pvpeers and the pveers and with this way it doesnt nerf anyones profession or occupation its purely a choice that im almost 100 sure that many would use if the option was simply therethis concludes my proposal thank you for reading please show your support for this idea
i supported the principle of this idea in the other thread on this topic and ill support it again here however i think this is actually a significantly worse proposal than the one in the other thread arbitrary limits on how many agents can be hired are a bad thing  if l5 missions ever become as good as they should be the goonspace l5 agent will reside in a system as laggy as motsu there should be costs and fairly serious ones but hard caps are usually a sign of poor design especially in the context of eve how about instead making a new corp management skill or even skill tree for the hiring of these agents say one skill for number of agents131050unlimited at rank 6 or so one skill for level your corp can hireskill level  max agent level at rank 8 or so and one skill for quality201001020 at rank 10 or so it would require a large sp investment give the ceo skills besides corp size and provide real progression also no agents in poses they need an outpost lowsec should have enough agents native to it that it wont need new ones installed by players
what was done for graphics should be done for audio quite a few people actually appreciate audio more than they appreciate graphics to me snazzy graphics are fairly unimportant but an immersive audio experience would transform the gamefrom a pilots perspective audio has the ability to attract attention graphics can convey more information but the pilot has to actually look at them to read them audio rarely conveys as much information but has the advantage that it can attract the pilots attention aswhenif neededsome specific suggestionsui informationalincoming ordnance sounds different with different levels of shieldarmourhullweaponsmodules sound different at lower levels of capacitordrones start to complain  when they come under firemore atmosphereradio chatter at gates and outside stations there isused to be some but its very quiet if its still there at allthe sound of rocks knocking together in asteroid belts thing of the rock banging in blair witch projectsound of distant electronics if a probe is activated while in the same grid as the player
eve has sound obligatoryyes the sound system needs a lot of work aside from eve voice i play with sound off and its a real shame that it has to be that way we need fewer annoyances more information and the ability to warp without deafening yourself
1 eve sound is horrible but what bugs me more is the constant buzzing i get when i have it disabled 
yeahupdate and resample all of the sounds in the gamesome are uh idiotic like the oversized rubberband sound of rail guns or the gatinggun audio of a pulse laserwith the advancement of audio peripherals available the sound of a 1400mm should be a heck of a lot more impressive deep and bassy with a lot of throat currently the only weapon sound thats half way impressive is a tachyon discharge
if only you could mute that darn warp sound and the jukebox do like the songs but after 5 years they tend to get to my nerveplease
go thread go
wars should flag all pilots for the duration of the war period regardless if they jump corp theyre still flagged until the end of that billing cyclemake wars last 30 daysallow victory conditions using an escrow interface such as we currently usethe yulai terms of warthe terms of surrenderusing an interface identical to the current item exchange escrow window a corporation declares war on its targetthe target has 24 hours to prepare for the war orthey can satisfy the terms of the warfare contract by supplying the isk andor items detailed in the contractif these items are currently available in any of the corporations hangars the ceo need not pull  compile them in any single location they can simply click the accept terms of surrender button and the items  isk are withdrawn immediatelyitems go to the declaring corporations deliveries hangar and will need to be picked up while the isk goes directly to the corporation in the wallet selected during war setuplimitationsthe declaring corp can select a region in which the items must be located to satisfy the terms of surrender but cannot choose a specific system or stationthe target corporation if they choose to deliver the goods to a location determined through diplomacy need not open an office the party fulfilling the contract need only select use local hangar and the items will be drawn from that hangar and go to the declaring corporations delivery hangaronce the terms of surrender have been met the war ends in 30 minutesif the escrow expires unfulfilled the war will terminate in 24 hours unless one of the parties reinitiates a war contract within that 24 hours
i like the idea of explicit terms of surrender as long as they can be changed midwar im not so much a fan of the 30 day part though  that can be punishingly long for both sides and sometimes its good to have the ability to have an automatic ceasefire perhaps a price per week with the ability to buy for a given number of weeks up front but yeah quibbles aside this is good stuff
im a fan too i especially like that corpjumpers remain individually flagged after jumping corps but i dont think that they should remain flagged forever maybe just for a weekthere should also be a default surrender option that is always available to the defending corporation maybe onehalf the value of the defending corporation wed need some way of calculating that though to set an upper limit on how much the declaring corporation can extort the defending corporation other surrender options could be offered and altered throughout the war as well through the contract format you suggestoverall great idea
a superflous ship with soso bonuses pre nerfed to hell and with a clear role set out for combat in a game other than eve  this ship already exists its a black ops 
signedme is always up for new ships this sounds good
just the opportunity to have somone drive you round is awesome sould lead to some proper comedy kidnappins though
itd be nice if there was some way to move multiple rigged ships specifically thru empire relocating several rigged ships can take an age especially if youre moving from somewhere like ned to akora
im kinda torn between the two choices on the other hand that is something you pay for rigging your ships otoh its totally frustrating timeconsuming and really bothersome activity thats most often done afkbut of course if there was such a transport itd be an another advantage to alt freighter pilots and the like who could easily transport entire rigged fleets wherever in eve without worrying one bit about any possible wardecs atm its possible as well but at least you need to repackage the ships and lose the rigs in the process changing the corp staging area would be so much safer easier and invulnerable to anything except insanely dedicated suicide ganks if there was such a ship
how about a tier 2 freighter with half the tier 1 freighters cargo capacity but a ship hangar of say 15m mUFFFD  no jump capacity ofc if you want that you can use a carrier obviously
i think 10km3 is enough for the other freighter it hauls all teh ammo and mods you will need for a lot of ships it should really focus on ships instead of cargo i say whatever less than another capital assembled is
i think it balances out that you can skip training skills for rigs instead but you either have to fly them or use a capital of some sort to move them in bulk
the solution to this should be 2 repackaging optionsrepackage for transport option  this does not destroy ships rigs while in this state the ship can not be placed on the market for salerepackage for market  this destroys rigs in place allows ship to be placed on market for salewhat do you think
just delete the assembled ships cannot go in cargo restriction with that out of the way a freighter can transport enough rigged cruiserclass ships to make a real difference if you want to add a corphangar freighter then that could work too but the rule against ships in cargo whether they fit or not is just a dumb one
i have heard that you can put a rigged ship in a courier contract and transport it that way
i believe we already discussed this at the csm which will be addressed at the next csmccp meeting
freighters should by default be hangar capable since you cant eject anything when not in a pos or station what is the huge problem about hauling assembled shipscurrently you can make a courier contract for anything up to battlecruiser to transport your fittedkitted ships but for battleships youre stuck because theyre above the 120k single unit size capimo ships should be the same volume assembled and disassembled keep caps above 1m cubic and you still wont have any worries about them being hauled around empire in freighters or just put a hard limit on nothing larger than a bs being transported
make sure your clone is updatedclonejump to the rorqboard some ship in the rorqs ship maintainance hangar and then do your stuffwhen done put your ship back in the rorq and selfdestruct to get back to your cloning station
works great when your clone is cheap but it costs several million for a lot of vets why not have it be 4 wait out the jump clone timer then clonejump back to your normal clone or something of the sort
yes do something with that useless module
agreed
after looking into this a bit more its not as big an issue as i thought it was i think the factions that are getting backdoor alliance help are truly deserving of the charity and frankly it isnt helping much
the only thing here i would like to change is to have alliances be able to join fw as long as they are not space holdingi do think its a bit lame that the rest off the allaince read milita cant help but on the other hand there needs to be a system for newbs to play pvp and if you dont want wardecing dont join a player corpbasically i dont think the system is brilliant with regards to fw but on the same note i do not support wartering down of wardec mechanics
look i spotted a jade alt
you can make hauling contracts for it so their stuff gets packaged in a plastic wrap
i think that the database problem is that the container can keep 999 individual stacks of items at least that was the old limit and your cargo space could it they were not banned keep 999 containers when you jump or if seomeone scan you it can create severe database problemsfor your problem there is a solution your corpmates can create a contract i think only the delivery is usable and bundle the whole hangar contents in a plastic wrap up to 100 items for each wrap and contract selecting the new corp base as the destination station that will make life easier for you as you will only need to move the wraps to the station and hit contract completed the wrap will be delivered automatically to the right hangaryour only problem can be if the destination system has no station and your corp is living out of a pos as a generals suggestion giving us the possibility to generate plastic wraps for stack of items without using the contract system would be niceeven more if we could rename the wrap after creation
agreed with everything you said here except for level 3 i could blow away the dronesnpcs with my hulkdronesagreed it should be more like 95 percent almost all kill mission are that much except for command but it is only 97 percent no 100  chance to be honest for anything than 65  or we the hell it is i hate to do storylinekill mission in my hulk as if it could fit large weapon laugh at him cause of ccp logiclast thing you forget to click support this topic if you do support this topic
mining missions should be limited only to 100 mining agents and they should provide as much output in an hour as a combat agent of the same type factoring loot pickup and salvagingno other agent should issue mining missions at alland get rid of cargo delivery storyline missions from combattype agents its utterly pointless to work through the standard missions only to get an idiot haulage mission that returns like 0003 faction gain
refinery tax instead of a sales tax is a great idea and opens the door for viceroyalty upgrades as you pointed out it also brings in a progression of natural quality the best viceroys have systems with naturally good refining while lesser ones have vulnerable upgrades to reach that level and the worst havent been upgraded yet i really like itthe moon mining idea again brings us up against dysp and prom moons i want to be very shy of anything that pulls alliances out of 00 high end moon mining is an example of something that would make a viceroy more profitable than a comparable expanse of 00 spacethe others are all a ideas especially luring agents there based on how stable your viceroy is i love that oneits like redestributing agents supporting lowsec and building player infrastructure all in one youd have to be able to lose agents if there was unrest and the viceroy changed hands not all at once but if it was questionable who ran the place for month id expect some percentage of the agents to pack up for greener pasturesoverall awsome ideas just hope ccp reads the forums as much as we do eh
rofl  op
not a miner myself but how about cutting base mining yield and adding some kind of mining related minigame that increases your output above current rates but requires the miner to be active at the keyboard if he wants to profit from itthat would make mining more entertaining and macro and afk mining less viableofc it would just increase the amount of macroratters as well but that is nothing that a simple fix of cloaks on noncloaking ships and giving shooting and npc an agression timer couldnt fix what the mini game could be i dont really know maybe something where you get a 3d image of a roid and have to pick the areas with bonus ores to mine from mining from other areas gives less yield and also makes the roid collapse faster before you can get to the good areas also requiring to cutting a path into the roid using the mining laser to reach pockets with especially good ore could be included or maybe something entirely different and more entertaining
first your recipe is the way of rampant inflation reduce the materialsitems produced without reducing the isk inflow is the step to make inflation terrific even for t1 itemssecond macrominers will simply have 3 mining alts on the same account when one of them has filled his quota they switch to another characterinstead regular players have normally 1 mining character for account and will be the one getting the impact of your ideaso a strong no vote
kids and mini games  no thanks
you did not hit your head hard enough

have you actually played around with one of these or any xlbooster it just seems like you dont really get how tanking scales because a base 600hp every 3 seconds is making it pretty damn magical compare that to the pith and gist versions and theyll run you billionsif its the price youre worried about then i take it you dont understand the economy either because things in eve are worth what people are willing to pay for them and in this case every bear that ever there was wants one
hate to point out that tech 2 variance compared with tech 1 is for the most part 20 or very close which means your faction shield booster in the example given is on par with a t2 module but does not require the same skill investmenttherefore one could summise that it is in fact superior to many t2 itemsthat 1 second reduction is frankly pretty damned sweet if you look at the pith xls which use approximately 50 the capacitor of other xls then you have an awesome boost to tank sustainability i certainly cant see any reason why faction shield boosters could possibly need buffing at the moment
sure lets see them be as wondrously lagfree as the 00 battles that are the same size are you sure you know what youre asking for here
dropping a line to update my progress on making my idea presentableanyways 3 posts made and chopped down 4 of the 15 pages out so only 11 more pages remain and 6 of those are for the ships stats themselves so i got about 5 more pages of things to post and try to reduce down into a more to the point lesser detail and more playing around room ideaif there is a certain time limit you guys have for me to get this done i would love to know and may just chope out a few pages of the idea to get it done in time
ship stats etc will be up to ccp to decide and debate if they like the ideapost your general design and capabilities for this class of ship and why the reasons its neededoh and dont forget to succinctly state what the current issue is by not having ittake carearithron
it wont hurt to include some stats but its certainly not needed as long as you include the bonuses and what amount of slots it will have
of course the design angle paragraph would be included also the first 4 pages of the suggestion are what going to allow the new ships to exist and prosper as it will be about a new profression the field scientistimo the current issue of not having an soe ship is a not so diverse job market not involving pew pew i seek to end this and increase compition for resources and the sortill be getting hopefully the last two core posts done today involving reason and system to be introduced then copy paste most of the ship stats over after i nerfed them
true i can probably save about 7 pages killing the cargo and other non stats
this is now wow sp does not equal pwning noobs people with a lot of sp lose expensive  in stupid ways all the time that being said the game has a huge very populated and comfy newbie area called high sec when you feel ready you should skip low sec altogether and move into 00 npc 00 if you have to dont go out in your most expensive ship dont try fighting the first thing you see learn how to run a large portion of this game seems to be terrified of leaving highlowsec when even ccp states it would like more players to migrate into 00also for the love of god learn to line break
simple really  restrict membership of the csm to one player per alliancea lot of us who really dont care much about the csm had a feeling from the start that it would be held in thrall by the big power blocs just simply owing to numbers of posteriors on seats that they could muster when it came time to vote we do seem to have had our feelings validated though you can muck around with the procedures all you like end of day though its this realisation from the majority of the player base that unless you have a gbc or goon tag on your name  the csm is not the area for you and its just best to move along whether it continues or not is not really a matter of concern for most of the player base tbqh
hmm maybe smaller alliances and corps should throw their weight behind nonalliance csm runners then ill be looking for some support next time round take carearithron
at present it is possible to blockunblock individual players in local and to be fair it is s a very very handy tool to have in eve i could even make the stretch and say that it is used by many players more often than most care to admitone problem with this tool though is that to block members of an individual corporation or for that matter an entire alliance necessitates having to trawl through member lists and individually block players or alternatively to block them as you see themnow to be honest i do have the members of one particular alliance in mind when making this request no prizes for guessing which  and my block list measures in the hundreds however a simple change whereby a player can right click on a name in local select block player  block corporation  block alliance would be a boon for those of us who get a bit weary of seeing references to relatives and farm animals popping up in local before we get a chance to right click the player and hit blocksure there are lots of players corporations and alliances that you can get gf out of but from this players perspective there are some that you know you will never see anything said but insults or innuendos and others that you really couldnt care less aboutpersonal choice is after all personal choice and this change is not forcing anything onto anyone  but is merely providing an enhancement to an already existing systemdo others agree

the t2 range ammos are ok maybe a little too powerful but their penalties counterbalance spike barrage null scorch aurora tremorthey are all useful because whilst they have penalties they add a capability  ability to stand off a little further the t2 damage ammos are basically inferior to faction  in most cases theyre doing very marginally more damage if any at all fury cruise missiles do exactly the same as faction for examplethe reason is simple  1 more damage is acceptable for capacitor cost and sometimes range but not shorter range and worse trackingt2 damage ammos should imo simply be a 75 range ammo with a high cap cost where relevant so its just another notch down the range ladder in return for about 5 more damage than faction gets range reduction might be reasonable to apply to falloff too but tracking is what kills this stuff stone dead  theres very few situations where 1 more damage with a tracking reduction is useful

i withdraw my lukewarm support for this proposal on the grounds that1 rp reasons my toon is hardarsed anarchist in an unforgiving and deadly universe yet somehow makes no attept to disable that iff device that broadcasts her presence across the consellation yet for some inexplicable reason the device fails in the system that shes in how are the backstory writers going to explain that one2 peeps like their local why take away their favorite social tool for the dubious justification of making covertops work as intended3 the constellation solution only displaces an implausable intelligence tool from one chat window to another achieving nothing if instantly knowing who is in local is a problem then why is instantly knowing who is in a constellation an improvementlocal as it stands doesnt make sensei should have the option of radio silencei should light up like a christmas tree when actively scanning for victims asteroid belts should move and be found through scanning if only to add a level of complexity for macro coders
how do i do thumbs down lol oh shi
yes local shows only those whove spoken until they leave const chat shows everyone in the const just like local works nowthis change would be balanced without benefiting a single segment of players any more than another i dont buy into the argument that it would make less people go into low sec and 00 thats bullsht low sec population is another issue imo
as nice as this idea is im not sure 100 about itcarebears  would be able to see people coming from ages away at first they would dock but when they get bored of docking constantly they will start working anyway but scanning constantly server lag might increase a bit covert ops instantly become hugely powerful for landing ontop of carebears before they can scan you in nearby beltspvpers  can now see if anyone is in the constellation rather than flying around so much bottleneck gatecampss will form on the fishtank edges where the constellations change holding constellations is now hugely important so that the chat is kept clear most of the timei think it will too heavily increase gatecamping and make isk generation in 00 alot harder i mean its not even that much better than high sec atm they would have to heavily buff 00 rewards or nerf high sec if this was followed throughedit meh nvm
while i like the idea you would be unable to tell if a wartarget is in the system and vice versa how would you suggest getting around that problem im talking about highsec and low sec here as its not an issue in 00
i like the idear
would be very nice for the smaller people out here even if you are in a big alliance much of your efforts are from personal supplies
give it 50km3 agility of a frieghter and 5 low slots required skill is trainsport ship v
it should be t1 so no t2 requirements here also no nont2 ship requires a l5 in teh previous to fly that is like saying you should need caldari frigate and crusier v before you can even train caldari bs 1
something inbetween industrial and freighter would be nice but its not really necessary
could not bombs get a pre boost as opposed to the usual pre nerfs as in cut the price heavily on bombs until you figure out what to do with themplease
the rts game star trek armada featured very expensive very slow and very frail ships that would act as suicide bombers with a tremendous damage output if you managed to get one of these close to the enemy you could change the outcome of a roundas a bomber pilot i would gladly die with my ship if i knew that i destroyed or at least dealt enough damage to a blob to give my fleet a chance to win the battletherefore i suggest1 activating the bomb destroys the stealth bomber and pods its pilot2 the bomb must have a large damage radius of at least 50km3 damage dealt by a bomb must be sufficient to cripple battleships larger ships could take more damage then smaller ones4 the bomb must detonate once the launche has been activatedthis would make the stealth bomber a sort of suicide smart bomber
currently watching the end of the packers game read whole thread  no not at allnerf empire missions why whole game out of balance yesokay so what we have here is the skewed isk making machine that is fun and safe in empire no ships should be lost in a mission short of desync or lag and the fun rattingminingexploration and pvp in 00so you move all level 4 agents to 04 and 03 the missions dont change the ship fittings do supposing the systems that get seeded see an increase in population as an individual you have a much lower chance of being the one that gets probed out and gankedim all for keeping eve the pvp game i love even though i rarely pvp myselfwill it truely make low sec more profitable than empirenot really if you can run level 3 missions in perfect safety for less isk they are actually even easier to do anyway so you can run an extra one or two anywayanother point is that the casual players log in to say hello to corp mates as well as run missionsmine with them i call myself a casual player because a i live in empire b i mission and mine in empire and c i cant be arsed with 00 politics lag and capital online im not isk rich but i do tell other players about 00 and what it takes to survive out there to start with minimal requirements at least what i had when i first went its made me a better empire citizen at least and i wont break a sweat if i take some corp mates to a low sec system to do a level 4 mission or two because it might get the heart pumping and itll mean the pirates will have more work to be successfulthis post is my own opinions and not that of my current corp
actually i like it
arent we talking about making missions entertaining in a thread that starts with a complete bs suggestion to move them to lowsec with no other change  i think this is the wrong thread for such a discussion hello yes i want more interesting and challenging missions  but that does not include a pvp element please make them long interesting challenging with deep story behind some puzzles and unpredictable twists and turns  i am all for this but do not include pvp in that  that is not my or the usual mission runners game  if i want pvp i can go lowsec 00 wardec  there are many optionsi am not forcing you or anybody else to run missions make your isk in whatever way you actualy like  but dont try to force me to pvp  i can do so if i choose to

some gallente stations have close to 100km dock rangeand all stations should kick you out tbh so you cant dock right away and have to travel back
this on all stations please 10km docking range no more
meh get over it you can move stuff in empire a heck of a lot easier than anywhere elseof course why they moved one to eggelehende sp makes no sense arent there agents there already isnt it lowsec or are all of the new systems lowseclvl 4 agents need a major shuffle around so that theres no more than 1 in any given system anyway and perhaps only 3 or 4 per constellation

1this is quite annoying for us as we dont have the standings to use the other agents in the area i would like to know why the change was made was it due to too many of the same type of agent being in the same system or is it faction warfare relatedm
why you cant turn down accept or complete these missions if the agents havent still moved they are available at the old station if they have moved you can find them at the new station and most missions can be delivered remotely if needed you can petition to have them resetcancelledi am very curios about what is stopping you from completing and delivering the missionedityou have 25 days to complete your missions20080905 1054i will be moving to ravarin iii  moon 4  chemal tech research center on 20081005so i dont get your problem

a good idear i have seen this asked for many times in the past
already gave support earlier some suggestions1 remove any npc sales of freeable slaves or enslaveable freemen2 add agents to each faction that work exactly like the trade cosmos agents except that they ask for slaves in the case of matari agents to be freed or nonslaves in the case of the amarrians to be enslaved and give some sort of reward standings money andor lps3 as opposed to the previous lp offers no item is returned to the player this prevents recycling operations alternatively the player could get the altered item instead of the rewardwith the exception of the later half of point 3 all of this should fit easily into the existing systems using the cosmos trade agents as a templateas an additional option the slaves and freemen options should become significant drops in fw as well as in normal missions to a lesser extent for example if the tribal liberation force captures an amarrian system large numbers of slaves should be dropped to be brought to agents for medical attentionreeducation
opposed first the costs are silly as long as you intend to suggest the costs be so low why not just make it free second there is no reason that for example the caldari navy would spend even a microsecond worrying about the increase in npc pirate activity in bob space let alone be willing to shell out large sums of cash and faction items to those helping patrol bob space third if you want to shoot npcs there are already belt rats to shoot at and if thats not enough you can always fall back on the exploration system including sites that can be located with shipboard scannersagent missions need to have at least the semblence of being intended to further the interests of their empires if the cost of the agents was more significant and missions required going to combat sites or delivering goods tofrom their home empire then this would become slightly more reasonable  but then there would be little or no incentive to hire these agentstldr opposed
you konw lol i actually proposed this idea to help low sec based corps and alliances as well mainly because i quite frequently hear on cp and even general discussion about how its completely insane that you can make hundreds of million in high sec in 100 safety the reason i proposed this was because it would be a way to help the pirates and alliances make more money since they choose to do higher risk activities they should also imo have the privelage of having at the very least their own agentsas for the why would the caldari care about bobs problems well that could easily be adjusted so to speak rp reason they are fighting terrorists on their own ground and where they conjugate most lower sec areas and 00 space and they are willing to help pay to rid the universe of terrorists or something like thati konw its a rl comparision but still it applies kinda how like america is in iraq and afghanistan fighting the terrorists over there so we dont have to fight them here the rp reason could be switched to that they are trying to rid the universe of the angel cartel or serpentis or whateveragain its like saying terrorists arent a threat if they arent in our borders when in fact the opposite is trueas for herschels comment i konw it sounds like a hard cap on the agent limits but honestly that is needed as was brought up in the fi thread any large alliance would easily be able to hire at least a dozen l5 agents and that would be a bit extreme and give alliances way to much influence on the faction market as far as i konw l5 missions pump out a few dozen thousand lp per mission iirc and like was said in fi we dont want ot give alliances to much power because hell the problem wouldnt be with having to many l5 agents i dont think i think it would be the probelm of hiring a load of l4 agents i mean honestly lol wouldnt it throw the game a bit to much out of balance if an alliance could field the equivelant of like every l4 agent in eve but i would be willing to compromise lol i will edit the limit a little bit because perhaps only one l5 agent is a bit to limited but it cant be to high either im thinking of maybe 2 l5 agentsagain as for the they should be in outposts only again lol that gives alliances to much power because to put up an outpost means you need sovereignty and to own territory and this is supposed to help low sec and alliances i think the being able to put them into poss should stay because still remeber the habitation module needs to be anchored around a pos and it can be destroyable lol hell maybe give it a tiny amount of hp so it can be easily destroyed if the pos is attacked but dont completely take it away from low sec pirate corps
no nada never i am opposed1 lvl4 agent cost 285mil a week in your plan one lvl4 mission runner can make roughly 20mhr running missions that means that one mission runner would only have to run 1425hrs of missions to pay for an agents whole weekly feelets say you have 20 mission runners in a corp who run an average of 20hrs worth of missions in a week20 ppl  20 hrs  400man hours a week400hrs  20mhr  8billion isk a weekthat is just an insane ammount for a player corp to add to their 00 mining and ratting revenue streams one can also suspect that some corps would have even more mission runners that thatthe only way i would even consider something like this is if the agent rental fee was in the 10s of billions of iskwhile there may be a isk faucet in high sec missions the solution is not to add another isk faucetbesides ratting and 00 mining to all of 00 there already exisist low sec and some 00 agents if you want to run missions go there if some one else controlls that area and wont share with you get off your arse and kick them out
okay i can see where youre coming from you shouldnt have an empire faction agent in any 00 region fair enoughwouldnt it be more interesting to hire an agent of the local pirate faction instead to scout out the opposing empire faction ships instead sansha rats in belt  amarr npc gurrista rats in belts  caldari navy npcs etcim sure empires do carry out incursions into low sec and 00  its a realistic story theme to use and while it may increase standings to the same rats you blow up in the belts it will also lower the empire faction standings which might hurt a lot if you intend to ever want to come back homebut then thats the point right the starting point of a level 1 agent is a bit silly though it could be a generic level agent on the premise that if youre able to live and thrive in 00 youre already at least able to tank a level 4 mission just long enough to warp out again until you learn how to fit an appropriate shipany balancing concerns are not my own thankfully however the bonus of using a generic agent that represents the local pirate faction means that there will be no bounties just loyalty points salvage and mods which is fair enough surelyive never understood why ships were a bit more expensive in 00 than in empire but it was only due the fact that people didnt mine the low end ores for their local market silly really all that scope not being used somewhat off on a tangent sorrythank you  i support this idea if it used a single level agent 45 representing the local rat populationedits they should come with an lp store and only be used in outposts not poss poss are temporary placements certainly not for visitors or guests and wouldnt be able to support a vip of such diplomatic weight it could be linked to the diplomacy skill too p
hmm ok well you kinda have a point on the lvl 1 agent starting thingi guess i could change it for the lvl 45 agent thing as well but still remember people i remember saying eth word empires in relation to hiring agents maybe i should not have used that my original idea would be to be able to hire agents from any corporation in the game whether it be serpentis or the fed navy i will change thatergh but you put me in a touugh position with the generic lvl agents thing but i suppose it could be changed as well but the limit on the amount of agents i will haev to redo so to speak there still needs to be caps on these thingsi will edit my posts accordingly
if the agent rental fee was in the tens of billions no one would use my idea because they would probably not break even and would again probably rather spend that 10billion isk on a carrier fleetim introducing this as a semieasy way for low sec and alliances to make that easy money that mission runners can in high security the numbers you put up apply as well to high sec mission runners 20 members putting in 400man hours of work can still make 8 billion isk wheterh it be in high sec or low secbut the alliances and low sec pirate corps are taking more risk first of all by simply beign where they are and in most peoples books more risk should always  more rewardand honestly your argument only really vaguely has roots for the 00 allianceswhen you and your corp start whoring missions in low sec as fast and as easy as you do in high sec  salvage and loot them and survive the gatecamps  pirates 100 of the time then you can come here and have a little weightas i said the 00 alliance argument has only a small amount of back behind that 00 alliances while they make alot of money by low sec belt ratting and mining you konw what they earned it by going out there forming a fleet and kicking the previous owners out they deserve to be able to make a load of money the same goes for pirates but instead of kicking out the previous owners of the space they live in low security and survive all the time in low sec and they deserve to be able to make a crapload of money simple as that
but theyre already making billions on the moon minerals and advanced reactionsinvention t2 productioni know agents in 00 would be nice but they dont have to come with isk bounties on top of everything else
technically 20hourweek is a bit much but going with that 15 tax means that the alliance would be making 12 bil a week with 400 man hours of effort ratting and mission are both an isk faucet but mining is not someone else buys the mins so it is just money changing hands everyone seems to forget that you would need to higher several agents to get enough spread for the people who have already done the mission grind for a different corp or even faction i would be getting a caldari agent you would be getting a minimitar noob11 might be getting a different caldari agent dont hard cap this just get decreasing returns like everything else in eve also you shouldnt be able to spam l4 or l5 agents make it take 3 of the previous to get the next level 9 l1 and 3 l2 for 1 l3 agent that number is of course bad but the idea there is that you would send in small guys before you sent in the elite
live events were awesome in swg and some of the best times i had not only the player created events but the rare events that the devs would randomly setup give you a system message and everyone is looking for the battle those were alot diff and were given badges for being there but as far as a player eventi loved them and hope something like that could be picked up
people have been asking for sound improvements for a long time to be honest the warp sound doesnt bother me im sure they could make something better though i dont care for music however would love to hear maybe the hum on the engine workings of the ship ect makes you feel connected with the ship also like many have said in past posts on other posts somewherealert sounds when being targetted or attacked it could be a toggle or something that way if ur doing something u know ur gonna be targetted or hit many times overu dont have it going off every 5 secondseh the details im not worried about graphics are awesome right now we just need to the sound to be on par im sure they may have more important things to do just hope they address it at somepoint
the ability to turn off warp stargate and declaoking sounds is enough to turn sound back on
yes sound is lame right now make it better n stuffs more sounds need to be able to play at once etcalso i would like to have separate sliders for practically every group of sounds in the game currently you cant have just ui sounds
gm told me it would be great if i posted this in here to bring to the devs offline towers can be a problem if they are on a moon that you wanteasy solution is to blow it up get some buddys together and give it some hurtafter 410 hours depending on the pos you killed ittaking that amount of time on a unused stucture in space is frankly a waste of time if the tower has been abandend its no loss to the owner of it or the owner that has left evewhat i suggest is that towers have a timer for being offline before they get set a to an abandend tower on which you can unanchor or refuel for yourself or corp usecurrently my allaince has conquered a allaince and they have alot offline towers which they cannot recover it would be fun to destroy them but even better after a while that you can steal that asset and reuse it against themim not complaining about them if i wanted i nuke them but i think in future it will make better use out of offline towers than reducing them to dustso here are the rules i suggest with offline towers1 tower goes offline timer starts2 2 week or month down the line the tower changes to an abandend tower on which you can unanchor or refuel and it will change into your corps name3 if 1 or 2 is not possible after time the tower becomes weaker having no power and hitpoints are reduced dramaticly so you can kil them quickly and if they are put back online they regain their strengh instantlywhat you think guysedit this will work in low sec and high sec aswell so you dont need to wardec to kill themtonkin
makes sense to me supported
reasonable idea but unnecessaryplus i like the idea of something that i anchored in space is mine till it dies
if you set up a pos and it runs out of fuel it should be easily destroyed or should self destruct over timeits ridiculous to see this problem cropping up because its likening to trashing up spaceim in favor of any solution that makes it easier to remove offlined stations

hello everybodyive come up with a mechanic that would allow people to respec their characters to a limited extent and allow them to unlearn skills which they no longer have any need of such as energy emission systems this would create a new option under the rightclick on the skills menu to unlearn skill to  level 1 2 3 etcthe user would be forced to pay 50 isk per skill point unlearned at a special facility the corporate stations that make implants for each faction  eifyr  co inherent etc the unlearning would occur gradually outlined as followsthe skill points would be deducted at twice the rate that theyre placed into a skill being learned this skill would gain sp at 15x the speed meaning that the sp of the original skill would deduct as fast as they were being transferred although only at half efficiency if you unlearn a skill completely you will need to rebuy the skillbook if you ever wish to learn it againadvantages of this planskill training still takes timeunlearn some skills to gain otherscannot be manipulated even if a stat is very low you still need the training timedisadvantagescreates another option on the rightclick listpossible to damage some characters if they get into the wrong handsallows characters to respec very minorlywell what do you guys think
supporting my own topic
not supportedi see no reason for it to be possible to forget a skill outside aesthetic reasons and even then i see it as being unnecessaryif the game had a skill cap then it might make more sense as it doesnt however there is no reason to allow characters to unlearn skills as those sps dont affect your ability to learn other skills unless they happen to be a prerequisite for the skill or happen to be a learning skill
corp jumpers only remain flagged for the duration of that initial war declaration period currently 7 days after that since theyre part of another corp they are safe for a whilethe default surrender value should be 2x the declaration cost 4m for a corp 100m for an alliance thats a pittance for most corpsalliances so the declaring party would be well wise to set some greater level in the declaration termsthanks i certainly hope its something that ccp looks at since the underpinnings are already in place and work amazingly well compared to what we used to have
its a step in the right direction but how do you plan to keep pirate corps from simply asking for untenably large sums of isk in order to get an open ended war that the defenders couldnt pay even if they did pay what stops teh same war from being redeclared the next month or the next week
you have only come up with a way to surrender what about victory or loss conditions
setting a ransom will just be abused but if the surrender terms was twice as much as what the declaring corp put into it then they run the risk of losing something instead of just constantly war decing folks just to get a pay dayi would like to give the option to vassal your corp to an alliance or corp that decs you as another option to surrendering it would be preferable for a lot of people because they may not want to fight and might not be able to afford the surrender cost it would not allow them to kill you without concord interference but it might allow for people to more or less get into pvp in a manner that is much less a leap of faith since you know there is a corp of pvpers backing you up and in fact giving you ordershow long you would be vassaled is determined by the amount of money the war decer initially set as a surrender term once that time is up the vassal corp can choose to leave remain a vassal or form an alliance with their overseer the overseer could tax the vassal but only as much as they tax themselves in the case of an alliance the tax would be the lowest tax rate of any member of the allianceseem reasonable
as for victory conditions it could be a cash sum the aggressor deposit a sum at the start of the war for the defender to match if they want to surrender if it reaches an armistice the deposit is given back if the aggressor somehow gets overwhelmed and surrender thats the reparations theyll pay put down in the pot already the aggressor committing cash to the campaign will help make sure there are less random declarations as there would be little to gain having spread out the own funds there would be just so many wars of oppertunity if you want to secure profitable conditions
i assume that surrender means the defending corporation loses and the declaring corporation wins as to the other way around the defending corporation has to make the war so unbearable to the declaring corporation that the declaring corporation voluntarily terminates the war contract which they can at any time if the declaring corporation voluntarily terminates the contract the defending corporation winsmore defined victory or loss conditions would have to be mandatory to be used at all and if they were mandatory i think wars wouldnt be used as a game mechanism  organizations would seek ways around them to wage wars illegally police actions if you will
the same thing that prevents openended wardec extortion from happening now nothing
no one really uses the surrender mechanism right now i dont see why anyone would use this either
extortion is a very big problem in war decingspecially if the corp is small time and there sps are very lowthings should be factored into that before we start proposing changes
absolutely not signedi hate this idea this is a sandbox game it is up to the diplomats of both corps to find a solution to a war if there even is one you have a bigger corp beating up your small corp you have still have many options at your disposal no need to make silly victorysurrender conditions war is not a freaking word of warcraft quest
well then it should be changed to racketeering sp o p
if a corp is too weak to handle the pressure from its competition it should fold just like a corporation in real life if eve changes the game mechanics to give weak corps a survivability factor outside of open ended war then its unrealistic and watered down gameplay
fail
make wars last 30 daysallow victory conditions using an escrow interface such as we currently usethe yulai terms of warthe terms of surrenderusing an interface identical to the current item exchange escrow window a corporation declares war on its targetthe target has 24 hours to prepare for the war orthey can satisfy the terms of the warfare contract by supplying the isk andor items detailed in the contractif these items are currently available in any of the corporations hangars the ceo need not pull  compile them in any single location they can simply click the accept terms of surrender button and the items  isk are withdrawn immediatelyitems go to the declaring corporations deliveries hangar and will need to be picked up while the isk goes directly to the corporation in the wallet selected during war setupand exactly how you expect nonpvp corps to deal with this pay your extortion money every week no thanks
your options are tohire mercsfold corppay extortion moneyjoin a real corpalliance that can hold its owni repeat no special treatment should be given to any weak corp if you cant hack the heat get out of the kitchen does your mommy make your bed pack your lunch and iron your clothes no then why should ccp cater to the equivalent of that in game
ah so you identify with the bigger bullies i get itim with the group that prefers to pick on people our own size  o pmore challenging that wayno biggie anyway as i can see this isnt getting anyone anywhere
i am part of a 23 man corp that decs 1500 member alliances as well as small industrial corps we dec whatever we feel will make us isk do not paint me with a bully brush war is business and business is war adapt or die change the mechanics and you do not have a sandbox game anymore
i support this ideaalthough may i propose that the that the cost of declaring war becomes x base amount plus 15 of the value being demanded as surrender terms this should pay for a week in less than 5 weeks unless the looting is good the war will seem pointless
hells yeahthis could really be awesome an awesome idea supported
been asking for this for ages it was an awsome idea then and its an awsome one now
sounds sorta neat but having a copilot operate things such as drones would be a waste because they could and most of the time would be in a second ship which would be more beneficial than not having to micro your own drones tbh basically there would always be more to gain by having friends bringing more ships rather than friends wasting their sp to micro stuff on your ship if you were that concerned about time you wouldnt autopilot this feature also wouldnt get used very often it would take more time to get someone to jump in your ship so you could afk ap than if you had just undocked and afk apd to begin with i mean its just a stretchthe taxi thing isnt right cause to get in say an interceptor or something you need to have the damn skills people who dont train the skills shouldnt get to roll around in said ship and receive any of said ships benefits even if they dont really get to control it im not really against this but theres just no real reason to be for it a waste of devs time tbh
yep would be good to have
clones in general need to be looked at
agreed i should get a rorq for free oww wait
fully agreed
wow just wow so what you saying is a person doesnt have the right in eve to post anonymously since there isnt a mechanic for it people who do not want to be hounded by forum trolls in game do post with alts if you dont think it doesnt happen your wronglook at your public behavior since you have been in the csm jade pot calling the kettle black dont you think your here insulting a persons right to post anonymously and have the audacity to say that they are the ones who are in fact rude abrasive and unwilling to see other peoples points not to mention your clearly biased in this topic and defending that stance to the death atm which makes the bias all the more obvious what are you doing you have more or less dominated this thread with brow beating and insults on a position that you are biased on because of your direct involvement in war decing fw corps you cant agree to disagree with people instead you come in and tell them they are clearly wrong and ignorant of the actual intent of ccp using the sandbox moniker of the game as an excuse to break the intent of ccp to use fw to get new players and carebears into pvp your reputation is less than stellar so i dont know what your bragging about your constant attempts at brow beating people into submission is very unbecoming of the chair of the csm the csm itself you your corp your alliance and of the eve community for allowing you to be elected in the first place good thing the csm is a popularity contest of who has the most corpalliance members instead of forcing every person to vote when they log in because you most certainly would get no where near reelected because your opponents would simply have to post the pages of ignorant drivel you spout and the intolerant behavior you display to condemn you to the ranks of the the has beens and never wass your right and its your duty as a member of the csm to represent the community as a whole too ccp and not forum  for the good of you your corp and your alliance granted they got you elected not going to go into how stupid the system is and how a blind monkey could get elected the first time a position like this is created but you still have a duty to the entire player base even the ones that post as an alt and not as a mainas for my support of the topic fw corps should in my opinion only be allowed to be war deced if all of the corps in the faction are given the status of members of an alliance and can defend each other equally just as alliances do
i disagree of course i will never consider the opinion of a posting alt to be the equal of a character with a fullydeveloped ingame reputation i consider anonymity to be counterproductive to the interests of good political debate hence i really wont be taking the opinions of altposters seriouslyas for your opinion about fw corps being made immune to wardecs you are simply wrong its not a change that is in any way shape or form in the interests of eve online
fw corps should not be immune to wardecs if your corporation cannot compete it should close just like in real life
so a anonymous vote for a csm member doesnt count as much as a vote from someone you know right i will make sure your opposition knows that you only want people who you personally know and respect to vote for you because those are the only people you representagain you prove your ineptness in dealing with people its an opinion jade it cant be wrong i didnt state it as fact but you do proving that you incapable of making a rational decision outside of kowtowing to your own agenda
yes it can and yes it is fw corps being made immune to wardecs would not be in the general good of eve this thread shows its only a handful of alts in favour of this move  you all sound very similar to each other and you all make your point with a mix of bad information illformed opinions personal attacks and insults your stock in trade but end of the day you are still completely wrong not sure what kind of weird liberal nonjudgmental form of education you attended but if id handed in a paper claiming it was my opinion that the world was shaped like a cheese sandwich then my teacher would hand back a score of zero  not plaudits for the attempt and a condescending commentary well done you might not have gotten the correct answer but you are differently rightthis is a debating forum if you put your name even an assumed one to a terrible opinion you will get refuted and called on it
oUFFFDpinUFFFDion   pUFFFDnnyn  plural oUFFFDpinUFFFDionsnoun definitionpersonal view the view somebody takes about an issue especially when it is based solely on personal judgmentnow that you know what an opinion is and that it is not 112 maybe you can come to terms with the idea of being wrong i wont be holding my breath on thatwhy it would not be in the general good of jericho fraction but you have only argued that they shouldnt recieve special treatment and then thrown down insults about using alts you obviously dont know wtf your talking about because i am not an alt but you havent looked into that your simply blowing smoke up anyones ass who would think your csm tag makes you an authority around herethe fact is they already get special treatment but dont get the benefit of being in a quasi alliance despite the fact that thats what they are part of more or less it makes them easier targets because they have a lot more to worry about and cant help each other by forming an alliance to defend one another they have to act in an autonomous manner and war decing an alliance for a handful of noobs who are just trying to get into pvp isnt a very good option due to the massive cost involved in doing so you have every advantage in farming fw corps for kills and you dont want to lose itbrow beating again jade you say that we are here attacking you but nothing we have said is in error we say your biased because jericho fraction is directly involved in this activity and you dont refute it then you make back handed insults about how we know nothing and how alts opinions cant be considered as viable your the one coming in here insulting people and attacking them for using alts but when one defends themselves by pointing out the error of your ways we are attacking and insulting you you should talk to obama about running his campaignagain with the ignorant and backhanded insults in an attempt at avoiding the subject at hand your behaving like a 12 year old who is being threatened with having his ball taken away and yet we are the people misbehaving yet you dont refute anything here you simply say that it shouldnt be changed for such an expert you seem to have no offerings as to why it would be bad only that they shouldnt receive special treatment the fact is they do and it makes them an easier target than being an alliance because they cant band together without leaving fw if they all war dec it costs them as a group many times more to do it than it would a single corp or alliance this makes them all that much weaker and the vicious circle continues
the best solution would be just to allow players to wrap grouped items in plastic wrap while in stationlike with courier contracts and rename them no freight containers needed beat me by 1 minute 
this is your solutionand it has the added benifit that it comes with an itemized list stored in game
and it has the added penalty that you and your buddies have to do 20x as much work as should be necessary in order to keep everything organized this is a workaround not a solution it works yes but it should be better
smaller freight cans would be very nice
re posted here for hopefully more recognitionhaving only played eve on a trial account and now a full account for a few days my experience with the universe can only be called minimal at most yet in my time things that could be changed have stuck out like a saw thumb and things that could be added like flashes of inspiration although i doubt they are original or ground braking for the sake of cohesiveness ill divide this post into said sectionsfixesfirst on the agenda warp problems vastness is one of the most resounding aspects of eve game play both in the sense of a ground breaking gaming world and the illusion of a fully functional reality scifi universe without adding to the problems of ccps maintenance improvement and the strain this puts on their resources id like to suggest some ways ive noticed that the immersion of eve could be enhancedanybody here remember the first time they interstellar warped to a warp gate activated it their ship dissolving into space as a seemingly distant beam light supposedly shot you into another system and the background dramatically shifts into a new set of colored gassy clouds and sunswhat i would naively like to suggest is a two fold system one that firstly results in the maintenance and reconstruction which from a role point perspective may be pushing the envelope that increases the size of all warp gates to not only fit all ships but engulf them in a vast space to prevent ship clumpingso instead of dissolving youre enveloped and instead of waiting several seconds and watching a beam of light you are the beam of lightthe next part would be a lovely segue between universes something involving a first person view of travelling between solar systemsif anybody remembers sliders you get the gistanother warp issue occurs before you even get to the gate unless your lucky enough to have found a rare path that doesnt pass through any planets moons or stationsi dont fully understand the mentality that creates elaborate and beautiful textures that create the game we love then allows you to zip through them exposing them for the wire frame shams that we know deep down that they arereading up on the material for eve we find a description of the interstellar warp drives us podders use it involves our ships existing in a bubble of nothingness seemingly paradoxical considering our ships in the bubble but from my understanding it works like the bubble is an inverse patch of space the outside of which connects with the universe but at the same time ceases to exist thus causing frictionless motion speeds which where once limited now fade and our ships hurtle across systemsusing this useful explanation of how we do what we do when were rocking it with our rockets out ive come up with some fairly simple ideas for how the illusionshattering interstellar warping can be circumvented firstly we make the warp effects denser showing less of the universe around the ship while still providing inter connectivity secondly whenever our ships fly through an object instead of the current consequences we could have the warp effects grow denser for a few millisecondsboth of these are hard to imagine from the current point of view seeing as when we go into warp the effects are localized around our ship and our camera although always contained within the effect is slightly of to the side for it to work fully i think there may have to be either a lock on the camera implemented or a camera specific effect i cant see people being happy about the lock
improvementsthe biggest improvement i have to suggest seemed so convoluted that id have to implement some ty diagrams so i have it involves creating a moving background within eve while warping without reinventing every system in eve at the moment you have a sphere of perception surrounding your ship which depending on the universe you are in has a texture pasted onto it presumably there is also the sphere tangible at the moment that contains everything in the solar system making this set of everything the sphere that contains your universe backdrop would be the easiest to suggest but also the hardest to implement verging on impossible as well as an impossible waste of server and your computer processing what i have in mind is using your sphere of perception along with a percentage of your coordinates within a system and distortingenlarging the system backdrop as you move through space cue diagramsplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesthis first diagram shows a ship in the middle of space for the purpose of my inability to create spheres were in flatland for this the green is the first 50 of the solar system the purple is the rest now when the ship moves 25 forward maybe warping to a station he gets deeper into the purple thus the image in front of your ship seems to enlarge as an image that once filled 50 of a sphere now fills 75 and stars that where once nw or ne are to your west and east flanksi think also that it would be great if everything under the attribute for items was categorized much like ships are also it would be a good idea to implement rules on the use of negatives and words such as bonus and penalty i think seeing as the description of the item for the most part has whether or not its a penalty or a bonus its not strictly urgent but it would be nice to get rid of bonus and penalty and stick with negatives and positive or get rid of negatives imagine a power grid penalty of 3 whilst trying to compare 40 items at oncefinally some minor improvements every time i come out of warp my ship jerks a little in speed causing my own jet stream to appear in front of me no not lag always also when i activate an accelerator gate after aligning my speed drops to 0km instantly then into warp feels a bit weird the speed that is viewed should be the motion of my ship not the speed im aiming for how can a ship drop to 0 instantlysummary and minor changesnew warp gates warp effectsinterstellar warp changes to avoid viewing internal structure mesheschanges to solar system backdrops to incorporate position in solar systemjet stream fixesbetter structure to the item attribute tabability to view multiple overview tabsusing multiple filters when using the world map
your warp gate proposals run into gameplay problems  you make it so that the player needs to get closer in order to warp and that it takes longer to move between systemstime for the sliders graphic to display the first one has major implications for gate camps though i could see a couple ways to work around itmake the gates physically larger and have a smaller activation range lower autopilot range to compensate the second would have no effect but an aesthetic effect that lengthens travel times space in eve is big enough asis if it was used as a pretty picture to cover over load times then maybe but we all know now how long those load times areie not very and we wont accept anything longer i like the idea of planets looking like planets when you warp through them im not willing to pay much of a performance penalty for it however if its simplethe correct response is to make inplanet views opaque of course then sure but even a 1 performance hit is too much backdrop changes might be cool again but they could also be very systemintense pretty much the same response as above either that or make the whole eve universe have scattered stars and nebulae and then generate a texture for each system therefrom which would naturally be invariant would yield a bit more connection while still making everything easy on system resources jet stream fixes i think are a result of the physics engine and the speed discontinuities around a warp startingfinishing theyre odd agreed but im not sure that theyre even fixable without a major overhaul of how the game functions better structure to the attributes tab i wholeheartedly and unreservedly support its a truly sad statement when my skill monitor has more and better data on what an item does than the game itself you get a thumbsup for this idea alone also while were at it lets include some actual information in the item description  any game with the 10000 items eve has should not assume that you know what they all do or even that you know what all the categories do im not sure what you mean by tabs changes  please elaborate on the world map agreed the ui for that section utterly sucks
ship attribute tabs have categories for example structure or propulsion my proposal is for items that affect multiple aspects of a ship or have multiple types of properties a lot of rigs for example give penalties to some things and bonuses to others are categorized the same way as ships not because i want items to be categorized like ships i just think ccp has done such an excellent job with ships that there doesnt seem to be a reason why it spills over into all ship related itemsother implications are things like overloading in items i think that should have its own category and the thermodynamic skill required for overloading should be included in the skill req under an overload headingright now when we jump to another system there is always going to be a delay between when we see the system and when we are in the system this is to allow time for everything to load and prevent you from being overwhelmed or ganked my proposition is for the warp sequence to initiate and for the system to load in the background maybe a few or even one and a bit seconds of a sequence then you arrive in a fully loaded system obviously it could be made optional for hardcore pvps or low sec systems
there are functional problems with the game to be dealt with before aesthetics come into it at all not supported
these are valid views that ive experienced through the game as a new player a market ccp is desperately trying to reach im sorry if your battle cruiser missiles are doing a 1 less damage then they should but the team ccp hires to work on graphics could be working on this
i meant overview tabs i know what you meant with the attributes tab as for the delay on system entry there really isnt much of one  id say it averages a second or so under normal lag conditions and the mechanism that prevents you from being overwhelmed is the 30second cloak not the delay on the system loadingissues are issues and good ideas are good ideas yes these have lower priority but theyre still worth doing
for someone whose not spent much time playing eve nice to see your not acting like your average joe noobbut remember your talking about a game where 30000 pilots plus are having to load these very things your talking aboutthe literal engine of eve online itself would require vast changes and adjustments to accommodate your ideasi support it but not likely to be seen in the near future for sure maybemaybe not
materials for war is the worst mission for faction gaini had a 40km3 haul through low sec the other day that gave me 8 though

have you read the empyrean age novel the reason i ask is that there is an element of the amar storyline that could connect quite well to expanding exploration
just for the record i do not believe we should proceed with any meetings until ccp actually acknowledges those issues already submitted and sets a date for the review meetingthere is no point us debating and preparing issues if ccp is not going to make any effort to actually listen to themnow i am aware that andrewjade is putting pressure on for a date  which is good  but is currently being stalledi do not believe therefore that we should continue with business as usual until ccp realise that they have to firm up a date and actually process all the proposals that are already in the pipeline otherwise we simply create an unmanageable backlog
sadly i must disagree with both of these whilst it would be very helpful if a date was set for the online ccpcsm review meeting it doesnt actually stop us doing everything else on the second i see no evidence that they arent making an effort they sent us a timetable and we erm i sent them a response to tell them we could send them the second list immediately rather than the three weeks away of their proposal it is now with them and will still arrive back to us before they asked to receive it this is a good thing so far as i can seethere is a backlog though the one created by the other pilots of eve the ones we are here to represent as i see it either we stop those we represent from using these forums  and become the puppets of ccp to some extent in shutting down discussion  or we take our responsibilities seriously and show pilots and ccp alike that we are here to do the business we were elected to doiz
i agree with inanna im certainly building up a backlog of issues which has to be discussed
you have your opinion and i have minei just do not believe we should be be ploughing on regardless when at this moment in time ccp cannot even set a date to get back to us on the issues already submitted they have known the schedule for a long timewe can of course continue to look at issues  hell i have some of my own on the assembly halls  but the whole thing is rather pointless if we simply turn into a talking shop  which is what we will become unless ccp gets its finger outof course we have a responsibility to the players of eve but in my opinion giving people the impression we are achieving anything when everything is currently stalled is not exactly being responsibleyes we can go on examining and voting on issues but unless that process is leading to something constructive then its all rather pointlessmy view is that more pressure needs to be placed on ccp to get this sorted and that refusing to do anymore work until they take this seriously is a good way of getting their attention and the process moved forward of course we can all pretend that everything is rosy and if people want to have more meetings simply to be pious and look good then i will certainly participate  but my heart wont really be in it unless we get some indication from ccp that they are interested in taking this seriouslythey clearly demonstrated this interest in iceland and i was very positive about the process at that stage but there seems to be some drift now and we need to get back on course we cant rely on the csm working only when there are face to face meetingswe  the members of the csm  have had many meetings since our return from iceland  often long tedious and argumentative meetings  we have been doing our part  it really is up to ccp to do theirs we still do not have csm forums  these are still promised soon tm we have not had any detailed feedback of action on the priorities we agreed in iceland we do not know when ccp is going to respond to the last batch of issues we submittedall of these things can be resolved and i know there are some good people in ccp working on these but it is taking too long and i really dont see the point of continuing to mislead the voters that things are progressing normally when they are not
on reflection maybe i am being too negative if people want to organise another meeting then i will certainly be there and contributing i would however like to see more concerted pressure being put on ccp to progress things
my opinions are not a hundred miles from yours hardin i think you make some very decent points there and the process does need to start moving again from ccps end certainlyonce we get the responses from issue pack 2 lets look at posting a new meeting time and well start handling the backlog again speaking personally i dont have that much more i want on the agenda at the moment but i can think of some issues that should be discussed before we finish the proper local chat replacement topic from tusko for example how about if we get the responses from ccp prior to wednesday evening lets look at a meeting this sunday 14th or if later than that the following sunday 21st
a build up or backlog of issuesfor ccp to deal withi hardly see how this affects the elected responsibility of the csm members to hold regular meeting to discuss player issues if ccp has a buildup of issues its not of any concern to the csm they have fulfilled their obligation to players by submitting them in the first place i might go as far as to suggest that maybe ccp has been a little busy of late with patches etc its just more of the same excuses for not doing something rather than proactive reasons to do itits irrelevant if csm members any csm member feels they dont have any issues to bring to a meeting look in the assembly hall where player issues are postedinteract discussessentially put personal agendas and manifestos aside and look at issues that may just benefit players outside your narrow focustake carearithron
this only makes sense if you believe that ccp is intentionally ignoring the csm and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future and in that case the correct thing to do is resign in protest en masse and probably head straight for the gaming press to raise hell rather than sit in a corner of course i dont believe that ccp is lying about their commitment to the csm and i dont think you believe it either yes theyre busy yes theyll get back to you soontm but given that the time between being raised in the assembly hall and being put into a patch is likely going to be several months at a minimum for the vast majority of issues whats an extra couple of weeks in the middle of that besides even if they dont get back to you they can still take your ideas and implement them  its far worse for accountability and communication of course but it doesnt actually harm the csms core function so given that the only reason for your delay is ccps delay and that youve all known about ccps propensity towards delay for years now this all seems kind of pointless clear your backlog and let ccp worry about theirs
csm just received a preliminary response to all the issues the issues weren sent on the 26th of august so the issues were handeled in exactly 2 weeks as the csm document describesso everything is fineas for the actual content of the response ill not comment on for now till i make sure it wont break the nda or anything since the information we got is that there will be official posts for it after the discussions with ccp we will be having
good to hear like i said i dont think ccp is shirking their commitments here and i dont think that hardin really believes that either id fully understand if you guys had decided not to bring forward issues related to those you were awaiting response on already that would just be natural but the submissionreply loop is close to a month and theres three of them in a sixmonth term does anybody really want the csm to spend 13 to 12 their time in office passively awaiting a response this is a big game and theres a lot of things that can be discussed even with a few dozen issues outstanding already also two questions on this topic is there a clean list of what topics are up somewhere or will i have to search the minutes to find out what they are and when can we expect wranglers forum bomb
just put the corp or alliance name in your blocked section
your all kinds of stupid if you cant put 2 chat tabs on a window and minimize it
i think youd go a long way towards making t2 ammo better by reducing or removing the often massive penalties for their use this is especially true with most t2 missiles people use faction ammo now because its all benefit no drawback other than cost which isnt that significant

hell i think the whole race needs a serious look at after the nano nerf yes i support nano nerf as long as minmatar get looked at give us alpha or something personally id like to see it switched to all turrets and have 20 dmg bonus per level at 5 rof penelty roughly same as 5 rof and 5 dmg so it could 1 shot any bs stupid enough to stand still for long enough but im just dreaming p
while the flaws in the minmatars flexible ship design are well known and hotly debated nowhere is it more unbalanced than in the realm of capitals i support

what id like to seelocal works much like certain chat channels do now you can see how many people are in local and you can see anyone who spoke in local since you entered unlike the regular chat channels however they would not appear to be in local after theyve left you would not know who is in local unless they say its me or something to that effect in locali also think that the constellation should work the way local does now youd still be able to use it as an intelligence gathering tool supplemented by your knowledge of how many people are in a given solar system however while youd be able to use local to track the movements of larger fleets it will be much less useful in tracking the movements of small gangs and nearly useless for tracking single ships
agreedi would like to see local functionality replaced by an albeit less powerful ship scanner system this passive system will warn the pilot when a warp signature is detected within its scan range 41 au i think i would also like a stargate activation warning to be issued to all pilots in the local system this warning could contain information like which stargate was activated for systems with multiple gates of course and vessel typekeep chat at a constellation level if really needed i guess
omgz no need to fool around have a 1 minute update timer if you cant find someone in 1 minute then you deserve to die and eat the scanner no free intelshow up after 1 minute in system nuff said
the enitre point of this thread is that a 100m rigged uninsurable ittyv with 38km3 18km3 unrigged and 5m tops and a 750km3 freighter costing 900m1bil is too big a jump
you realise that a km3 is 1000m  1000m  1000m thats 1000000000 m3 what unit could you possibly mean 5000m3 is obviously an industrial and something that can just manage to squeeze in an unpackaged battleship sub cap is already in place its the freighter
a rigged ship must be assembled only packaged nonassembled ships can be put into cargo packaging a rigged ship destroys the rigs assembled ships can only go into a sma ship maintenance arraythe 5km3 is for fittings to move with your ship
supported but this ship type should not be able to carry ore or containers containing ore that function is already spoken for

not worth the programming effort
i disagree its a simple change in the specific fields being fed to the api you add ten fields one for each implant and voila youre done hopefully this changes your view as more information is always helpfulsupported
i agree with this it would show if you actually hurt someone when you pod their sorry ass
actually from what i remember explorer saying in a conversation in iceland its actually a lot more involved than for example putting rigs on killmails i dont remember specifics but it involves pulling data out of the server cache or some business and i dont know crap about programming but suffice to say it really sounds not worth itbesides some things are best left to the imagination
but you think instruments in ambulation arepffti would love implants on a podkillmail all killmails already pulls data from the cache but i assume the actual reason is that the killmail has to pull the implant data from another nodeso once infiniband is in place i must assume this is quite possible i would love to see it
this is such an old idea that one has to suspect that there is good reason for the fact it hasnt been implemented already as bane has hintedbut that still doesnt mean the idea isnt a good one ben

i see wut you did tharcome on lavista vista even i saw this one coming after your comment lets stick to the issues at hand and not turn this into yet another lavista vs bane thread quite honestly im tired of reading through issues that i am interested in only to find them derailed by these pissing matchesbane thanks for your other comment above in regards to the comments by ccp about the data pull im not privy to the information myself but im thinking that it might be easier than one might originally thinksoftware developers are notorious for saying something is extremely complex and difficult when in fact it might mean an additional couple of hours of work i know because i am one
this  winsbeing a programmer and 3d modeler myself and havign extensive amounts of experience with several large game engines and a rewrite of ogre910 x devs just cant be arsed with the small stuff but rhather focus on the big changes they can aply firstunless ofcourse its a small bugfixlike the guy said a simple field add towards the api that supports implants for podkills will suffice and wont take more than 1020 minutes to implement
this is similar to my idea herehirable agents for your conquerable outpoststhe main opposition youll get for the idea is that some people dont buy the backstory of any npc corps having enough interest in 00 space to support missions of any sort despite there being already quite a few npc corps that have agents in 00 space right now personally i think this argument is weak especially given the distribution of agents in the game right now you can find serpentis in angel space soe in guristas for a couple of examples im sure theres more in short supported
havent read everythingrightso why not use the underused factions im sure the sisters being apparently also some sort of explorers do have interest in 00 spaceadd new missions with that and it suddenly makes more senseperhaps that factionnot empire is doing exploration or has some hidden base that is overrun by npcs
wholeheartedly agree it would be nice if i could have a way of only hearing the sound that indicates a targets been destroyed as oppose to having to have to hear the repetitive game combat sounds along with it i read while missioning and the game sound is distracting but the target destroyed is informative
even while i know that many many many capsuleers have tuned their ears elsewhere any improvement will be much appreciatedmaybe adding own music mp3 and the like to the ig jukebox might be worth a thought toosupported

aye
if youre going to have detrainingand i think it should be an option of some sort if only for those times i want to have 255999 sp in repair systems it should be pure detraining with no respec people should live with their choices not be given incentives to cannibalize their longterm performance to satisfy shortterm whims and fotms
you left out the biggest problem with this ideaallows people to respec to the flavor of the month at willgiven the neverending cycle of nerfbuff that is eve encouraging people to constantly reinvent their characters would be bad imo
i really dont see why you would do thismy pvp character can fly all kinds of cruisers pretty damn well why because i keep wanting to try something newthat means every month i feel like flying something new i could respec but why would i do that its still going to take time anyways so why give up a skill thats the idea of eve that skills are persistentwhile it would be cool to untrain my mining ii i really cant see it being important enough for the devs to spend time doing thos
this is effectively already possible through character trading if people arent happy with the skillset of their current character they can just go buy anothernot supportedben
there is absolutely no point to delearning a skillall skills have a value of some sort or another in the long runwhether you use that skill however is something that you have to deal withif you train something your not going to use you only have yourself to blamedelearning is nothing more than a waste of time the fact you proposed paying isk is a major turnoffunless you can find a positive spin on delearning skills your better off buying a lower graded clone and killing yourself in game that is and chancing it in not having a skill or 2granted you cant control that but im trying to highlight just how foolish your proposal isnow if you can trade skill points at a cost from one skill book to anotherthats different that means its going to something more positive but the cost should be based on the value of the skill book itselfand the rank as wellhigher the rank and value the higher the cost per skill pointthat makes more sense then what you came up with
two problems i can see with this1 encourages training for flavorofthemonths2 devaluates specialization today ill mine on a hulk for isk with all mining skills at 5 tomorrow ill fly a titan on saturday ill refine my loot with all my industry skills at 5 next week ill just respec all my hauler skills to level 5 to transport my lootim sorry but i give this idea a thumbs down
id like to see some form of sp reallocation possible maybe with some sp penalty associated with it ie you have 100000 points in industry after unlearning the sp you are penalized 30 just a number could be more could be less and allowed to spend the remaining 70 on other skills a total sp penalty would prevent the abuse of such a system
i could only see that working if it figured the time to train with your highest attributes and reallocated figuring the same amount of time with your lowest attributes that would prevent power learning a select few skills and then spending the sp on skill your attributes were terrible in
cant see any use for thatwhat does the op mean with unlearn some skills to gain others you can learn as many skills as you want there is no cap that allows you only to learn a limited amount of skillsbesides change clone so that it doesnt cover your current skillpoints selfdestruct your pod
neutrals remote doing anything to a war target should immediately flag them as redneutrals that warp into a fw complex should immediately be flagged redits clearly a flaw and it needs to be changed
againstwhen fw characterscorps are flying in public space ie the citadel all options should be open to nonfw charracterscorpssry mate
you forgot two options  fighting back and evading the enemy both of these are effective in many cases you can tie up three or four guys for hours by sitting docked up in a station and cruising youtube while maybe smacking in local once in a while to keep them interested and most corps who actually have moneyie are worth extorting are missioners which implies large amounts of combat sp if you cant fight at least a decent guerilla war youre not trying
nice good idea i agreebut as already objected the 30 day thing can be a bit much
hmm not quite surewould be easy for spies to smuggle enemies into a station in a system where they would normally not be able to dock
the proposal is as followsccp should create new avatars used for bpcsthe difference between a bpo avatar and its new bpc avatar should be obvious while retaining a familiar lookthe differens could be made as simple as adding a gray flip in the upper left corner with a white c similar to t2 vs t1 bps and itemsbut the important issue is not how it is done as long as it is doneall edisons einsteins and henry fords of the eve universe that agree to this proposal please post your support in this thread and spread the word of wisdom best regardstorden
support to my own topic of course
excuse me alts and mains  but can we get back to the discussion of war decing in fw seems this thread went off topic a bit and needs to come back to the pointimho  war decing is fine  we are fighting in both now fw and a war dechowever the one thing that does need to be changed is fleet operations for fw ops onlyif you are in a fw fleet and you are fired on by another militia corp neutral pirate or whoever all fleet members have the right to fire back on you without consequence no matter the sec rating of space they are inif the corp is not in fleet ops at the time they are fighting then the militia cannot get involved then it is just between the corps this would apply to both hi or lo sectake it from me in rl if you fired upon any group of soldiers sailors airman or marines they would not care if you were whistlers mother  you would get a complete retailitation from the entire group in rl when you have are taking fire you always returned fire and then figured it out latersimple  end of story
i agree with this i just dont like the fact that an alliance can war dec corps that have to leave fw to form an alliance as well when they are already in a quasi allianceit simply allows the alliance to spend very little money to fight a very vulnerable enemy that by and large has less experience than themselvesin turn the corps can seek out help but the cost is astronomical for them and not for the alliance
i would like to see corps insure ships in the corp hangarfor an increased price so that anyone in the corp can fly that ship and if it is lost the insurance money goes back to the corp this would allow corps that supply ships to their pilots to supply bigger ships without as much risk
you already canput the ship in the corp hangar and try it
oh i thought it just insured it for you guess my next idea will be to have myself flagged as a dumbass and let this thread die
there are far worse things to be known for o 
why not start newbies out with 4 in basics and 3 in advanced if they want to go higher they can other wise they still have a decent boost to their stats to start with
skills starting out higher eliminate learning skills you dont have to train learning skills if you dont however expect other skills to take a little longer i trained all learning to lvl 5 before training anything else i was thinking of playing eve longterm payback for doing all learning long rather than looking for an instant character to play with i could have gone to a number of other online games for such a thingpersonally i find such games a little tedious and get bored with themim currently training titan skilldo you hear me complaining about the 54 day training timearithron
i was just curious what you people think of a wreck timerroll over the wreck with your mouse and it tells you how long it has been there as well as the distance size corp ticker etcthis would help a lot when you are running a harder mission and are not sure when the wrecks are gonna disappearits after two hours correct oo
thats a good idea in my opinion and could be extended to both jetcans as well as wreckslets say a mining team is jetcan mining and has been doing so for an hour or so if they havent named their wreck with the time ie 0230 or if theyre not playing close enough attention they might lose a full 27000m3 worth of precious ore
this is a pretty good idea put it on the assembly hall so we can vote on it properly
yea it could be used as intel also
as with any effectively run and managed council the csm secretary will have a list of discussed issues and will have recorded escalationfailed vote etc that can be compiled and displayed in the forum if this isnt what you were after serenity had a thread with current topics on it in the assembly hall although im not sure how current it isthere would be a few no doubttake carearithron
i could ask ank to mail it to me but id prefer a public list for people less forward than i ultimately id like to see every submission the csm makes to ccp ccd to jpsc and then updated with responses when theyre available so that theres a single easilyaccessible list of themas well as keeping a sticky on top of jpsc with links to all such threads and serenitys list is ancient  i dont think its been updated since midjune i was keeping a daily update of new threads but when it became obvious that i was talking to a wall i quit and nothing has been done since except incorporating them in and deleting my posts a month or so later

so if i were to say invade your space id have to have my entire fleet pay a isk per every gate we travel for the duration of the entire campaign until you lose sovthats a horrible idea no offence sounds nice ata a glance but if you think about it for more then 5 seconds theres too many reason not to do itif you want isk for people in your sov you have to have a station of your own to charge them to dock charging for gate jumps is just well no
because noone ever has an out of corpalliance alt they could run with
true no outofcorp playersbut there will be outofalliance players such as myself runningtake carearithron
he was i think responding to anikadirs bit about one character per alliance if that rule came in then people will run with transparent alts in other corps it does us no good to havefor example bane may well have better taste in alt names than i darius johnson and banesgloriousalt as the characters on the csm when its the same humans even if you consider it morally wrong for two members of the same alliance to be on the csmwhich i dont the rule is unenforceable and thus worthless
would be nice to see the ability to implement an motd option in corp chat and alliance chatfor corp the ceo has auto op status in the chat aswell as directorsfor alliance the ceos of each corporation have op statusany reason why this isnt around already
supported and surprised to see this isnt already here also surprised to find the topic since i was asked about setting a motd on corp chat up just last nighti recommend posting this in the section where you can vote for such things
this was already suggested and we got the preliminary answer from ccp yesterday please hold on a few weeks while the official minutes from the forthcoming ccpcsm discussions are made
cool keep us updated
you have not heard from them at all or have you heard on some issues and not on others if you have not heard from them at all it is not a big deal since i would give them a while to go through the list and do their stuff  however  if you have heard something on other issues and nothing on this well then i be starting a riot soon with pitch forks and tar and feathers
we have heard from them but its a preliminary answer which im not sure if is covered under nda or not so i wont say anything till im sure
t2 short range is lol please make it notsucksomuchkthx
you know i realized something when someone pointed it out to mewhere the nerf on an ammo effects a weapon increased power usage tracking reduction range reduction ect only that single weapon is affected and it is only affected once by the ammo it has fitted the weapon is not adversely affected by the other weapons also loaded with the same ammo typewhere the nerf on an ammo affects the ship itself energy regen velocity handling ect they stack one on top of another until the ship is so crippled it makes absolutely no sense to use those ammo types except in very closed situations typically pvethis is something ccp seriously needs to look into for it adversely affects missile users beyond any other ammo type hail also has stacking penalties to the using ship cap recharge

maybe we should have multiple sized stations for the different racesmuch like airports evolve from grass fields to metropolitan to hubs to internationalof course the larger the station the higher the taxes  i think something needs to account for the average number of ships docked per minute which would dictate the size spanned over a monthly average
give us our choices back

first i do not think this is a great idea of bringing in another ship that can transport large amounts of cargolets first focus ourselves on fixing the jf1 give that ship a possibility to fit rigs or a captractor beam2 give it low or med slots to fit something of a tank flying a 4 billion isk ship with no slots is scary i know there is some logic behind this so flame me for that p3 if you are really going through with this first boost the jf with first 2 points p
randomly seeding more t2 bposlottery all over againhasnt ccp already failed enoughadding more t2 bpos at all is dumb make another blunder to try and make up for your original blunder pathetic that this is even a topic of discussion
i think that new manufacturing skills should be introduced when new items or tech levels are introduced and apply only to those it doesnt strike me as right that a player should have to learn new skills to do what they can already do now or continue to be competitive at it if they are nowbe careful with componetizing t1 t1 components are used in t2 and if you have to build components to build components to build something thats too many slots that have to run for any player to be able to do it effectively unless you increase the number of slots a player can useyou should only introduce t2 bpos as a rare result in research if you plan to transition items away from invention after theyve been in the game for a whileyou should deal with empire only players by giving them a more gradual path to integrating with the rest of the community not by giving them additional incentives to stay in highsec right now the difference between highsec and lowsec is distinct a barrier players should be incented to gradually accept more pvp risk as they progress i think many empire players perception of pvp is worse than the reality of it because their only experience of it may be having been blown up at a 4 gate camp
doesnt have to be that way just make sure the timing on a bomb going off is less time than it takes a small gang to warp or get to the gate and more than it takes for a battleship to do the sameproblem solved right
my sentiments as well this doesnt have to break the game ccp you want a playerdriven market we need ways to securely implement the purchasesale of stock

good idea
are you sure it is only transactions have you confirmed thisin economic circles the market average of a stock is defined as the sum of all current values of stocks in the group divided by the total number of shares in the groupby extrapolation to commodity markets the market average should equal sumofpricevolume divided by sumofvolume for all buy and sell orders
its based on transactions not on orders because orders are massively variable and often bear little resemblance to market prices look at a market where someone has a buy order up for a million kronos at a penny each and the market average would be about two cents if it was the average of orders or look at a market with no orders up  it wouldnt have an average if it was orderbased but it just takes the value of the last set of transactions and carries it forward

ferris bueller youre my hero
thats exactly what im proposing the balance is implied in that you only get back half of the skillpoints that you discard and since it takes time to unlearn a skill the difference in attributes have no effectto a certain extent this is true however all this will do is give a slight boost to the training of one skill at a penalty of unlearning the other skillno all this does is give a boost to training the skills you want at the cost of some other skills you may not want youd only be able to use half the sp of the skill being unlearned into a skill youre training and it would be a very gradual process since the skill youre training would only gain sp at 15x the current rateby doing this you minimize any damage my friend logged on and had me untrain xxx skill for this useless one since it takes a long time to unlearn a skill especially one at level 5the cost was simply thrown out there as a way for people to not do this at their whim but having it require some effort a 256k sp skill would cost over 12m isk to untrain this can be discarded to make the idea work betterif i didnt phrase my original post adequately ill revise it im looking for a way to allow people some freedom with their character such as mining or salvage drone operation skills in a way that minimizes exploitation and satisfies the respecification crowd
im all for the remote rep thing but if a neutral goes into a complex theyre not combatants theyre tourists its not until they actually do something there that they should become free fire targest
yeah assisting a war target in any way should flag you to the opposing side that should be true of any war not just fwneutrals meh yeah theyre probably spies but in my experience so far the problem with fw is in getting fights not getting too many let them spy
agreed then the 30 day timer may be a little steepi also like the idea that the declaring corp has to pony up a chunk that rides in escrow as reparations should they terminate the war unfortunately this does not allow an amicable termination of the wari have been a part of wars where both sides were so impressed with each other or through what ever other reasons that the declaring party withdrew the war and let them alone with no ransom paid under the reparation contract the declaring party would never be moved to recind a warat the end of the war period if no surrender terms have been agreed upon the contract would then what expire no reparations with the only costs incurred being the declaration costsand under the yulai terms how would mutual wars be declared that one i had not thought ofthe declared party may perhaps be able to put up a countercontract within the opening 24 hours with no outlay of isk demanding their own wartermination requirements if the countercontract is fulfilled the war ends in 30 minutes not instantly to prevent concord hostility trapsthese are just perhapses maybe a csm will poke their head in here to do something other than pss on another csms tree and actually respondaccomplish something
sure you can have an amicable finish you just need mutual approval to do it  make the contract end with a null payment via contract its only if you want to end without mutual consent that you need to pay the escrow i think this is a bad idea for other reasons but the difficulties of an amicable truce are not among them
for the love of all that is holy no i dont want to have to deal with kidnappings in addition to everything else that can go wrong the last thing i need is to long on to find out that i have been utterly betrayed and oh by the way in the middle of highly hostile spacei know just leave and get podded or use a jump clone but still itd just add another aspect for newer players to get screwed by
agreeda rider or copilot who can have a function their skills increace certain limited ship functions or just sits there and runs the camera for all of those fraps fans out therei would also like to stick my egg in a ship and then go to a movie log off whathaveyou and when i come back im wherever the ship ended up if they log off and i log on i end up wherever i am in my egg stationspaceif the ship goes pop my pod ewarps normally if its bubbled or whathaveyou i come back to find myself in my home clone station too bad so sad for me
just bring some ship maintainance freight containers in the gameproblem solved drag and drop your assembled ships in the special container and voila 
why bother with that you already have a cargo hold
basically a propoal to move empire away from being a starter zone and toward being more consistant with the rest of eve and its backstoryto read the full version click hereshort versionaccess to the more lucrative resources and services in empire space would be limited through various mechanics to player corporations and alliances war decs would be moved away from sanctioned criminal activity in high sec to be a way to contest access to resources with enforceable surrender conditions
on 2nd read maybe not
so missioners traders and freighter pilots dont get to play unless they do it your way and youre not allowed to mine a belt anchor a pos or dock unless you can win wars is this actually your proposal
this is an old old issue and ccp has stated repeatedly that it cant be done for reasons of database efficiency  in essence itd require another bit be given to every single item in the database whether its a blueprint or not im slightly confused by this response but theyre the programmers and have access to the code in question and thats the party line if you need more information consult the sticky in fi
first of all avatar is the wrong word icon is the right word also this is already covered in a really good thread in features and ideas discussion
i have read most of the dev posts about this issue and by that i know its dificultundesrirable to implement thisstill i see this as a must be done i dont care how its done but this should be resolved even client side solution is better as no solutiongreets mabari
they need to implement an overlay rather than a different visual affect though this will indeed put a good bit of load on the server process callsbpos should show mepe with the infinity loopbpcs should show mepe with the remaining runs availableif nothing else put an infinity loop on bpos and make bpcs gray rather than blue just put a code in that decolors copies no new graphic needed
i for the removal or learning skill
interesting conceptas for possible bonuses how about scan probe duration bonus probe accuracy bonus probe launcher fitting bonus to not give the ship imbalanced cpu amount hacking success bonus or something along these lineseg you could have a cruiser sized ship or even bigger variants with the same scan time as a covert or at least faster scan time as in 5 per level but without the cloaking benefit advantage would be that you could run certain plexes directly after scanning them out without having to change shipsanother question is what skills would these ships need two or even more empire faction skillsets eg all races cruiser to 2 for the cruiser sized craft or would they need a new unique skillset like the ore ships eg exploration craft skill rank 4 or something like that 
just to add if this ever does get put onto csm for suggestion i would like to add that not only should this work when you roll over it in space but it should work on the overview as wellit would be nice to know how much time you have left before your mission wrecks expire
while i like the idea i dont believe it should constantly update on the overview unless you mean a static canwreck will destabilise beyond recovery at 2326 110908 instead of a constantly updating time till destabilisation 1h 34m mostly due to lag reasonsif it was to be a dynamic timer it should be restricted to the currently selected object in the overview that way it minimises the impact on server performance as it should only need to call the database about the object youre looking at instead of all the objects on grid simultaneouslyhaving said that im no database designer i could easily be wrong about the impact on the server
i like this idea a lot if it couldnt be a standard countdown due to lag or whatever reasons even attaching a this wreckcan will expire at such and such eve time would be an improvement go get them jordan make this happen

there are a couple of false comparisons here first of all you dont have to stare at your ammo being built so yeah the faction stuff may appear favorable in raw profit per hour it probably doesnt compare so favorably to profit per hour played and yeah as someone pointed out lp arent free since you could have bought something else with them that you could either use or sell so they need to be factored into the costaside from that the over farming argument doesnt hold water if they were truly over farmed theyd be dirt cheap and youd have nothing to complain about i guess you could argue that if they were even less common theyd be really really expensive and nobody would use themall that aside yeah t2 ammo especially torps need a boost to be comparable to faction or at the very least attractive costbenefit wise compared to t1
just two things1 gang storylines are not a good idea imho as it would make having a high or low faction statnding absolutely trivial2 from an rp respective to get past 50 with a certain faction you may have literally killed millions of their ship crew members and destroyed thousands of their ships i wouldnt get over that for anything and i cant imagine governmentspirates can either
yeah itd be nice if there was a way to get out of the standings hole and with my support i offer this idea to achieve that
i support this but whatever happens i hope it doesnt become so trivial as to make standings near meaninglessif you get a faction to the point where they hate your guts it should take a significant and consistent effort to get back on their bright side you should be able to change your mind and work your way back but it shouldnt be the kind of thing players would want to do on anything approaching a regular basis
against
i wonder if the fact that this thread has twice as many supports as the other thread will actually serve to influence anythingnot trying to naysay the whole assembly hallcsm scheme i just really wonder
not supported this would take station docking gotry to a whole new level
isnt there already a minimatar station with multiple undocking tubes
lol
support
support
yep
sure last time i brought up this idea someone in the thread said that i should also mention an lp store requirement to show that you are activly helping the pirates but on second thought that doesnt matter becuase hey  factions of empire remember that they like you why cant pirates
this would make me a very happy pirate roleplayer
supported but i think missionrats should be excluded from thatbecause otherwise it would be too easy for a pirate to invade missions think ninjasalvaging for example  just warp out and let the npcs kill him doesnt work anymore then
they already are concord rats attack you when you run pirate missions
signed
on a side note why do i get a standing decrease with serpentis for doing nothing but defending myself they prefer i run away pretty soon i wont be able to buy my drugs
a very interesting topic i support oh and a few other ideas hisec could be autoupdate too since it is suppose to be highsecurity and ran by huge empiresalso if not implemented at least give cloakers the ability to stay off local chat maybe even constellation and stuff to i dunno i havent really looked into the balance for that to much but i hate being seen in local while cloaked
a nonrigged itty v gets 18km3 a max rigged ittyv gets 38km3 the smallest freighter is 750km3 there needs to be something in between there man that doesnt cost nearly a billion and is insurable
there are already enough skills they simply need a use besides being only a prereq or have some use in t1 production
i support the request also
support why hasnt this already been implemented anyways
supported
mehwhy should we add more useless information for kb queens epeen wavers and chest beaters around the eve galaxy
because they make up a majority of the player base between them
this
 all the people that say it isnt worth ityou may be all cheery when you know you killed a faction bs or something you know yeah i caused damage to that guy  and you can totally act like the 1337 pvper and stuffbut if you kill a guy with snakesla
the reason its hard to do is because implants arent actual fittings to a pod like rigs and mods are fitted to a shipthey are effects that work upon implemntation giving you bonuses and arent actually a physically manipulatable entityif ccp finds a way around this id definatley be happy d
not supported i would rather you didnt even get to see what was on my destroyed ship in a km
mods and ships have value pods do as well we should be able to see that would also help figure the value of various implants due to their creationdestruction
unfortunatly i think the average also counts the days with zero transactions thus the average is lower than it should be with items that have a lot of quiet days
no the average just doesnt change because there are no transactions the market average changes when there are transactions at zero isk not zero transactions
sry for necro i missread the date of the last message
unsupported if anything jumpclones should have 24 hours at max skills never shorter
why thats not snark i actually want to hear your reasons
edit plz read thw hwole post before commenting now we all know in the real world that great feeling of seeing a yummy cheque that makes you feel less antiestablishment from all that taxwhen we get taxback in rl we can breathe easy a moment the extra cash helps with financial problems for a little while and one can maybe invest it somewhere save it for a rainy day etcwhat id like to see is tax back in eve dif say 001 of our income per session ie ratting session market sell order etc was capped off our wallet and sent to the ded or something i doubt many of us would careif this was implemented we wouldnt see a huge difference in our day to day eve doings but wed have a rather nice bonus awaiting us each year the amount that was capped from us would be reimbursed in a lump sum tax free of course and o we can buy that shiny new ship weve been saving forthe amount returned would be like in rl in comparison with what was capped so if you earn only a small amount per year youll get it all back plateauing at a certain point so that only a maximum can be returnednow i hear some ppl screaming inflation the market will die etc etc on return day but no i dont think that at all if tax return day was spaced over a few weeks say over fanfest how fitting hehe and your return date was categorised against char name alphabetically the returns will be spaced and less spending in huge amounts at a time will occurfurther more this could act as an isk sink for ccp as one only has their allocated day to get tax return or they get nothingps this relates in no way to corp tax and is only similar in the word tax nothing more sort of like the concept of jump clones vs med clonesthoughts
brrring on the tax back d
and what good purpose would this serve apart from giving players free money
if you want tax money back talk to your ceo not to the csm
save loot for 3 months and then melt and sell it nice little savings if you are a ratter
read the end of the post first before commenting plz
it is not giving htem free money if youd have read the whole post youd realise that with this you actually lose money or only break out even as you do in rl but i think the benefit of a lump sum outweighs this fact
your throwing a fit over chump changethis is utterly a total waste of timeif your looking for money go do some level 4sthis tax return doesnt make sense considering how easy it is to get that kind of moneygive the csm something worth there time not this stuffme thumbs down
i cant imagine many eve players living paycheck to paycheck and i dont think a sudden injection of isk will stimulate an already buyers marketcant say this upgrade would improve the game as a whole
i agree with everyone else not supporting
sureno
how stupid is it to break cooperative teamplay elements in a mmoi think your proposed changes are illthought out and they heavily focus on the aggressor having completely unfair advantage you do need a chance or a way to opt out of violence because you shouldnt be able to force people to play the game your way why would you even form a corporation ever if all it takes is a fee to be shot on sight for 30 daysthis would completely destroy any sort of corporation based in high sec unless they were gankers themselves to appease the empire pvpers no freaking way
not supported your surrender option will only encourage mafiastyle extortion on a galactic scale and would make it almost impossible to have a small corporation
have you ever been involved in smallcorp wardecs extortion exists asis the thing is virtually nobody pays  gamers as a group have a wholly irrational reaction to threats and are generally willing to pay five times as much to a merc as they are to an extortionist or theyll hole up and deny a fight until you get bored but they dont pay no matter how easy the game mechanic for surrender is
not me personally as i dont want to be in a corp but ive had plenty of people that come to me that whine about wardecs but now that ccp thinks that wardecs equates to paytogrief i think we can better wait to see what their plans to overhaul the current mechanics arethe reason noone pays up now is of course because if they do they got no guarantees plus the next corp can just come along to dec them again
remind me to vote for you next electionme thumbs up  csm
the reason nobody pays now is that people have a moral opposition to giving into extortion and you cant usually inflict sufficient pain upon them ingame to make them want to pay up it isnt even particularly irrational  its ultimately a form of collective defence since if nobody pays up nobody is going to bother trying to collect theres some suspicion about whether youll actually leave when they pay their danegeld but thats not really a big issue the mechanics used to organize surrender have very little to do with it yes a surrender contract will remove the possibility of fraud but fraud is a minor concern for most targeted corps if people continue their pigheaded refusal to pay up  and they will  then no mechanic will make aggressive wardecs popular at least not on the level of small corps
i support this
seems like a solid idea i like iti never thought of kidnapping but that is pretty cool
did you read the purpose would be to put an assembled ship in the fake sma can so it could be hauled because no ship can be hauled in a cargo hold assembled
and my proposal is to evade that restriction by eliminating it entirely why use hacky workarounds when you can just make things work logically
this issue is for the csm to present to ccp our support recognition gratitude and acknowledgment of bane glorious being a great csm especially as measured up against presentday lame duck csm chairman jade constantinefeel free to discuss your motivations for supporting this issue be it his inferior perspective on game mechanics or his racist remarks on other forums you know where but please be aware that although individual reasons for supporting this measure may vary all are equally valid
bane ing rules quote this
a fine csm if i do say so myself popular and a man of principle what more could we have asked for
finally an issue i can get behind
dont blame me i voted for kodos
bane is an extremely unselfish lover whos unwavering faith in the csm concept is to be respected and admired i am shocked by and quite disappointed with the recent behavior of a certain individual who appears to want nothing more for what can only be described as a focused campaign of petty slander than to drag banes good name and stellar voting record through the muda regrettable development to be sure and one that casts a slimy shadow of stink upon the entire process that cannot be easily or quickly washed awayfor shame id have expected far more honorable behavior from a welltraveled master of the british arts
no this issue is just another silly flamebait with no other intention or content whatsover and should be reported and locked promptly
excellent suggestions there combined with a general change to missions id say that would solve a ridiculous number of issues  even without the mission change it would solve an incredible number of issues something would need to be added as far as mining goes but other than that its a solid list ccp needs to implementsupported
i can see where youre coming from and i do actually agree with some of the proposals some excellent suggestions to help deal with some of the perceived problems with high sec  i particularly like the suggestion about making lvl 4  5 agents only want to deal with privateers rp reason a pc corp has less obvious affiliations  why would a gallente aligned agent want to give lp and cash to someone in a caldari starter corp for example same applies to a lesser extext to npc corporations of the same factioni was about to hit post when i just thought of something regarding mission runners in npc corps tried 4 times to put it into words and its being tricky so please bear with mepremise as per suggestion level 4 agents will only respond to members of pc corporationssuggested corolary sp the starter corps have their own lvl 4 agents which members of that corporation are free to use but they are of poor qualitythis would make it so that those players who just like the npc corp missioning lifestyle can keep on doing their thing but those doing it for iskfarming reasons are better incentivised to get into a player corp even if its just one they create themselveshowever  getting back onto track the reason i say perceived problems above is because there are a lot of empire dwellers who dont see these as problems there is a substantial base of players who like the way empire is set up like doing their own thing in an npc starter corp without the hassle of having yo join a player corp who just play the game because they enjoy missioningminingsitting in station smacktalking the corp channel this represents a large chunk of income for ccp and i dont think they would be prepared to risk losing it also as the ideas as proposed go further than i am comfortable with in what should be high sec and relatively safe space i cant give support to this but some excellent ideas scattered through the post might have better success separating them out and proposing them individually
not agreed with anything in the npc corporation change there is a huge amount of players that want to play the game solo and it cannot be justified to remove even more game content from them npc corp players already cannot set up poses which is a severe limitation creating a oneman corp is not an alternative with the wardec system being the way it is nowi understand that people use alts in npc corps as income source or for criminal activities and i agree that this is a problem but we shouldnt nerf an entire legitimate playstyle because of itas for the second part i fully agree with the intent you havebut what is to stop players from using these new mechanics against random weaker corporations for extortion and what is to stop rich grief corps from contesting multiple regions or whatever new region the victim chooses as new base of operation to completely cripple the defending corporationall of these change wardec suggestions are only focussed on the attacker and i wont support any of this until weaker corporations get game mechanics to harm random griefers back
good feedback so far i had no doubt that this would be a controversial proposal when i made it the way i see it right now eve is headed toward two virtual shards theres the empire pve eve and the lowsecnullsec pvp eve with player bases that are interacting with each other less and less and increasingly demanding different versions of eve that fit their play stylesin the recent meeting minutes i see that ccp is floating the idea of introducing even more content for empire only players i think thats a shame at some point you might just as well shard the server what they really ought to be doing is providing smoother integration of the entire player base empire shouldnt be safe it should be lawful they arent the same thing the same player conflict politics and power plays should apply there as apply to the rest of eve they should just be governed by the rule of law where as 00 space is essentially lawless empire also shouldnt be a licence to metagame and protect your pvp gotten gains from pvp using npc corp altsi know this isnt the direction that ccp is heading in they are hell bent to make a pve eve and a pvp eve with a decreasing amount of interaction between the two i just thought id offer an alternative vision that i think is more consistant with the spirit of eve and its backstoryi did update the war dec mechanics part with something i meant to include in the first place that is that once a corp surrenders they may not be decced by the same agressor again for the duration of the surrender terms which the surrendering party gets to choosethank you for your comments
my proposal is twofold first as a new player you should be able to play the game at a basic level without coming into conflict with other players until you learn you way around make a little money and get to know people as a veteran player or the alt of a veteran player you should be potentially subject to competitionconflict with other players if you want access to the parts of the game that are attractive to veteran playerssecond wardecs shouldnt just be an openended licence to kill in highsec they should be wars not crime in eve the society centers around cutthroat corporations competing for resources with weapons if necessary so consistant with the spirit and backstory of eve concord sanctioned wars should be about resources and denying access to them
while i cannot in any way support your idea in its current form if you were to present them as 2 different ideas i could at least support the wardec idea which i quite like but the changes to npc corps as you suggest them are completely without meriti actually like the war dec suggestions as an industrialist i would find having to move my operations out of a system or constellation far more damaging to me than losing a ship and staying in a station until it all blows overhowever i would suggest some protection for a corp that loses the conflict as it is the same corp cant redec for a set period but any half decent alliance could potentially do a rolling series of war decs with each member of the alliance take a turn and thus forcing the surrenderer not only out of the system but the next system and the next and the next  a bit excessivealso i disagree that the surendering corp should be able to set the period of the surrender after all to the victor the spoils if the surenderer dosnt like the terms of the peace treaty dont ratify it
thats some very big changes amd its probably way too radical for eve but it shows many of the current problems with high sec and solves them so if nothing else its a good starting point
well thing is i think they work together which is why i proposed them together putting the war dec changes in by themselves would somewhat hobble random griefing but it wouldnt really achieve what i believe needs to be done id like to get new players into the game and integrated with the player base rather than having them stall out at running level 4 missions and squatting in highsec because the game beyond those 4 gates is so much different from the empire game id also like to push the metagaming of pvpers using npc corp alts out into the open if youre going to be a pvp player corporation or alliance you shouldnt be able to shield your money making or logistics from pvp i think that at a relatively early point in their career new players need to start learning the facts of eve life which is all about player competition and conflict and having to choose sides and make friends and allies if you want access to the good stuff like i said i think that the path were on right now is going to lead us to two virtual shards with two completely distinct player communities who are barely even playing the same game at what point does is start to make sense to just shard the server into a pvp server and a pve server and be done with it
perhaps the disscussion of your perceptions of the possible problems facing eve would be better suited to the general disscussion forum where threads similar to yours pop up every day or twohowever i think on your changes to wardec you underestimate their impactacctually i think they would add much much more than simply hobbling random griefing they would add a whole new layer of economic pvp to the game why undercut your opposition when you can temporarily dustrupt their ability to actually produce or sellwhat do you think it would mean to a corp to be denied the ability to sell their produce through jita as a result of a surrender in a war dec you would quickly get large groups of corps forming high sec alliances and hiring merc corps to go at each other over valuable market hubs it could certainly help with the lag around jita if anything your proposal could very well bring more pvp both economic and combat to high sec than youd at first imagine and whats more the people involved in that pvp would be the people who want pvp rather than forcing a majority in all probability of players to play the game in a way other that what has been the accepted norm now for many yearsedited to include obligatory comment about lag in jita
i think it would be awesome and great for the game if that happened if you implemented the wardec changes alone though it wouldnt corps would simply drop their freighter pilots out of the corp into an npc corp and it would be business as usual
theres a lot of good stuff there and it actually addresses the problems in a sensible non partisan and story based wayi like
i see where youre coming from here and i even agree to some extent a lot of the appeal of eve is the utter brutality of the play model that makes it actually feel real i dont like the idea of empire turning into pve territory exclusively and i like your view of lawful not safehowever you run into the fundamental objection that empire dwellers have to losing their stuff and the fact that theres so many of them that ccp literally cannot afford to annoy them en masse while you cant give everybody their own game to play you need to give them the ability to play the game that does exist however they want to play it and thats where your proposal falls down if somebody wants to be antisocial and do missions in secure space you need to let them do so in one fashion or another i am not philosophically speaking a carebear but i cant support any proposal that will eliminate or seriously impinge upon those who are there needs to be bridges between 00 and 10 but there needs to be separation too
this should be an easy onewhen you open the 3d map  it by default opens the map with a sideon view  completly uselessso each time you need to reorient the map to get the usual nsew orientationdisplay as used everywhere elsea quick fix so the 3d map opens up in the proper orientation would be nicealternativly have it remember how you had the map oriented the last time you had it openeither would do
this would be an amazing change
small enough you could probably bugreport it been broken since forever one of those things
thumbs up
i 100 agree good argument for it btw
when i started playing eve you where pretty low on skillpoints  trained skills and it took me quite a while to get to where todays starters startin my opinion that change was allready not the best ideathis game has a very high learning curve and having a lot ofskills right from the start doesnt make people think about whattheir doingtoday you see alot more of noobs flying in battleships or battle cruisers in lowsec while they dont even know enough about the game mechanics those pilots get angry  frustratedwhen you shoot em and they dont do the most important thingfor eve learn your game this is alot more important then havinga quick start skillwiseremoving learnings would remove another learnyourgame timebuffergiving a even faster start skillwise but will still not help em tolearn why they should not put a 100mn ab an xlarge shieldbooster a few smarbombs a plate and some cpu enhancer on a phoenixso totaly wrong ideainstead of thinking how you can get em a faster skillwise start youshould look into finding ways to interest those guys for trainingto teach em and to use the given time to have pilots that knowwhat their doing at the end

good idea good thread something that should be on the csm page here at eveo but hey there doesnt seem to be much point in asking for more ccpsupported infrastructure so lets do it ourselvesone suggestion could we get tldrs of the ccp responses added to this thread would make browsing the actual results of the csms efforts much easier
good idea ill edit the posts
this and the other index deserve a sticky
probably easier to have one master thread of submissions  we dont want too many stickies clogging up the place ill go make it
so did you clarify the nda issue with ccp where are we here
why isnt this implemented yet

one of the big things missing in eve is the people it does make alot of sense that there should be some form of planetary colony as well as people transportdifferent planets could have afinity for different types of produceables some might be grain or cattle while others might be some metal or ore while others might just be good stratigic base locationsa well stocked planet mught have several cities a couple of planetary defence weapons a planetary shield and a couple of military bases 2 marine and 2 fighter squadron and a factory or two these planets would indeed have needs to function and produce goods for their owneryou could even make it possible for small raiding parties to come in and steal a portion of the goods you might even have players deticated to maintaining these planetsmoons
those are some really great ideas you could have an enemy come into one of your systems and raid planets it would bring a whole new element to to pvp it would also be great if you could go to a planet and it would give you missions based on what resources they have say they need cattle for example in this case you can either go to enemy space and raid one of their planets for cattle or you could go to a friendly planet colony and trade for the cattle and bring to back for a reward
this is a great idea and now we might actually have it happen with the csm in office ive seen other ideas where the planetary interaction was limited to a simple ship fitting screen so you could allocate people to specific projectsthis would tie in well with my original concept of training livestock to different roles that way you could train the homeless to work in geology scientists over time and with some expendature of resourcesanother idea is the quality of output could be based upon an insubstantial happiness factor where giving them livestock instead of frozen food would let them do more this would still ensure a demand for items from empire space and so the logistics of running a nullsec empire would remain
i dont know about the happiness factor thing we want to make this easy for the owning alliance the last thing anyone wants is extra work maybe things imported from empire could be more of a bonus more than anything remember there is a potential of dozens even hundreds of these planet colonies for each alliance we want to encourage them as adding to the games fun not makeing it harder

bump for more hot drone action
yet another reason why allowing any goon to be in the council was a bad idea
get 10 adress pointers to implant data cacheanchor that pointers to killmail fields and tell compiler to write data from pointer datamhm realy hard p i had much more complex programs to do uner 15h but it was c not soem strnge pythoon
ccp look at the op plez
needor at least let us disable the shootingor customizable i can make my own sounds thenits important cause how they are now they are much too loud i usually zoom out while fighting and cannot see whats going on
so you want to take isk from people then give some of it back as a lump sum why 
the same reason why people have a savings account nad the same reason ppl have college funds etcso u can get a big wad of cash at once 
im not throwing a fit just proposing an idea go troll somewhere else plz
that would be the following reasons  those are safe places to keep money safer than keeping it lying around but the eve wallet is secure so this doesnt apply  because money in those accounts earns interest thus giving more money than you put in but you clearly dont want that applying  so they can prove they have that much money by showing their bank statements but the api key takes care of thatand what exactly are the benefits of getting a lump sum of money when it is at best the same amount that you earned slowly in the first place not being able to touch those funds for a while is a disadvantage and i see nothing to make up for itwhy would i want a big lump of cash at once when i know that it is at best the amount i put into it in the first place 
interesting thing i just noticed apart from this line which is clearly an edit he added onhis post is in nearly in complete english very few abbreviations but his other posts have a lot more problems with them like they were written by someone other than the person who wrote the suggestion itselfbiggestt where did you copy and paste this idea from 
lol on longer posts such as this i actually check for typos as u stated im pretty bad like that x
no i pay money to the man already i dont want to do it in game too
if your allowed to make such outrageous proposals then i can make outrageous opinionsdont like it tough
hrr how about npc corps charge 20 tax to fund the storyline wars or something making it worthwhile to start or join a corp and thus being wardecable
i concurbut you need to remember one little thingwhats to stop the cycle from repeating for those corps who do pay upits one thing to war dec for the sake of pvp its an another when you do nothing but grief them for no reason other than your boredi understand the necessity for the sandbox and all datbut im of the honor in combat type camp so call me oldskool for my reasoningsomethings gotta give somewhere
if they want big improvements to all the little stuff in the game they need to open it up to the masses this would be an excellent place for them to startsigned
yes please then make a place on the eve website where players can post their sound effects for download by other players
neat idea would bring so much to the game combining skills maximizing ship capabilities kidnapping spying roleplay friendship trust the list goes on and on
make it a modularized capitalship you have one primary pilot and the core ship and the ship depending on its class has so many multiplayer connection points from 15and those extra players skill up in a particular module ecm drones guns missiles bombssupport ect each player module would have so many equipment slots and deticated cargo storage though for a ship like this i would really like to see shield facings and weapon facings and maby even some detailed hit locationscurrently i have no aspiration to fly anything larger than a battleship but i might consider flying in this kind of ship with a veteran pvp player at the helm
i like
the only issue with the csm is goons being allowed on it or even to post about itban the goon
do not supportb gloryious has been wrongly credited for the titan nerf he is just a a big headed nerd
incorrect our congress in the united states passes bills like this all of the time whose only intent is to recognize or credit an issue or person as the csm is my electoral body in eve i find it entirely appropriate to at the very least propose similar measures
im sorry but what was the point of this topic and how does it encourage positive aspects in eve online againall i see here is political trollingwhich should be handled anywhere but hereme thumbs down
our congres doesntcaod  that way
omg another emobbing campaign
this
theres several videos showing either a noob getting poded or how boring the game really isshows two ships shooting at each other pew pew pew pew pewshows miningshows skill leveling lol funny but very sadyour gonna need 10 more tv commercials to make up for vids like this
yes youtube has snarky videos about eve just like it has snarky videos about everything else im a fan of eve online is for bob myself but your mileage may vary what precisely is your point are you suggesting that the csm recommend to ccp that they run 10 more tv commercials or do you just want them to allege copyright infringement and get the videos taken down in future please post pointless whine threads on eve general

if only there was a way to vote for posts other than the op
no your right your idea isnt in itself the perfect solution but it is a good base to start a disscussion fromas for dropping freighter pilots to npc corps the solution is already in game for that problem suicide ganking this is still a very valid mechanic its just no longer economically viable to a large extent but then this is war and not random opportunistic ganking so the economic downside of doing this isnt as importantthe real problem is identifying those people in npc corps to gank for that i suggest these ill thought out game mechanicsguilt by associationthe ability to include specfic named individuals from npc corps at the time a wardec is declared they would be subject to the same conditions as the corp being wardeced and would probably be treated in the same way as if they were a single player corp they would be bound by the same surrender conditions as those put upon the losing player corp at the end of the war the winner of the war would not be able to impose a seperate agreement for each named individual and would not be able to carry on a seperate war with different individuals after the corp named in the orignal wardec has agreed to surrendernow as with wardecs as they currently are regardless of if this is unfair or not members of a deced corp can disband and form a new corp so individual players in npc corps should be able to do something similar therefore if the player in the npc corp forms their own corp or joins a different player corp then they are removed from the wardec but of course at that point they are wardecable anywayswill random people get caught up in this mechanic  probably will someone find a way to use this to grief  alwaysthis of course still dosnt cover the main problem of who is guilty by association therefore we have forensic accountancya new skill which allows you to discover and add specific people to a wardec since the aim here is to include individuals in npc corps who are actively supporting a specfic corp you cant just add anyone you like to the warde they must be guilty by associationhow possible the following mechanic is in terms of coding i have no idea but it would work something like this after a succesful check of the forensic accountancy skill at the point of war dec the person declaring war will be presented with a list of players in npc corps who fulfill one of the two criteria1 has been part of a player to player trade with a member of the corp being wardeced2 has created a private contract to either the corp being wardeced or a player in the corp being wardecedthe level of the forensic skill will of course determine how far back they can examine the records for such transactionsthe person declaring war would then be able to say if they want each person to be included or notall in all not the most elegant solution and probably not even possible to implement however i think a better way to be able to stop people hiding away in npc corps while actively supporting a corp under a wardec there are ways around this im not presenting this as a perfect solution far from it and will be open to griefers and exploiters as would any mechanic introduced into the game but better i think than your blanket npc corp nerf which i think would ruin the game play for so many innocent solo players who are in npc corps and who at the end of the day pay the same subscription fee to play this game as you and therefore have as much of a right to play the game within the games current framework as you
one thing that would be good to create is ways for smaller weakerless financed corperations to hurt or raid larger enemy corpscurrently in general the bigger corp has the most combatants and the most money and will allways defeat an equilly skilled enemy of a smaller guild to say nothing about how vulnerable all nonpvp corps currently aremany pvp corps are 10x 100x larger than similar nonpvp corps because the wardec forces players to quit to npc corperations and to misson as far away from low sec as possible such places like jeta
little thought in this idea right you want to know how it can be exploited to death create alt corp wardec it and select every member of npc corps that you want to grief offer the worse conditions possible to your alt corp for surrender accept them within 5 minutes from war declaration the npc corp members are bound by the therms of surrenderit make your first suggestion a bit better if it is applied at the start of the war but still is too open to grief play in every instance invert the order of your suggestions putting guilt by association fist kill your proposal at first reading i doubt there is much people reading the second part after reading a so little thought first part as the only thing making the idea vaguely reasonable is the second part changing the order will make people at least examine your whole proposal
the fighting style in eve is strategy everything boils down to statistics which is great dont get me wrong but i think that having statistics that are based on physics as well as wonderfully agile ships at our disposal we should work on doing what we do best flyingnow obviously we dont really know how to jump into a raven and bombard enemies with missiles so obviously we cant be expected to maneuver our ships with ease manage enemy distances and increasedecrease transversal velocity of multiple ships at once especially if the tools to do so arent at our disposalstell a guy to drive a car without a wheel and you quickly get where im coming from he may get out and push but he wont get very farnow for a rough draft of a proposal maintaining distance from multiple locked targets if you are keeping distance from one ship and moving towards another ship you can keep distance from both thus your ship will turn leftrightupdown looking for an alternativesetting the interval the increasedecrease velocity hotkeys doa new movement zig zagging this allows you to increase transversal velocity handy for missel boats fighting gunners while keeping distance from a targetif your velocity is 300ms and his is 200ms your ship will travel in little zigzags or straight until you reach the keep distance then zig zag maintaining distanceshow a max range of missiles using their speedtime in the tactical view much like optimal gun rangefalloffa setting to toggle between showing the bounty or the threat level of ratsif you can think of any more ive no problem with adding them to the proposalthank you for reading in advance
a couple of those already exist your zigzag sounds a lot like orbiting and generally speaking rat bounties are directly related to rat threat levels
lo allwell the title says it all give the corp chat channel an motd so your members log in and see the message of the day this is very simple very handy and i should think would be implemented very quickly as ccp obviously already know how to do it the reasons for this are simple if you want to get orders out quickly theres no better way if you want to give orders for your corp to go out and get 15 kills that day then you just change the motd all people with the communications officer role all directors and obviously ceos can change it pthoughtslunn
this is a common request that the csm has dealt with it was a part of our issue package we sent about 23 weeks agoso you will hear something soon
cool thanks
somone uses the 3d map wow
tech1 ships scan bonuses are similar to covert ops the tech 2s go albit furtherno empire faction skills required just archeology to a certain level and spaceship command and will get thier own skill setanyways the idea is posted in features ideas and discussion now its a very long post and still have alot of construciton going on
the over use of dreads and other caps in pos warfarei do think there is a problem i am going to use the benchmark of a dreadnought fleet that can melt a large tower in one siege cycle as an example its a given that the top ten alliances in game can field such a fleet given advanced notice with a capital fleet like that the only time a support fleet is necessary is to remove one pos module the cyno jammerimagine that you have a medium to small size alliance with one outpost a hostile alliance is attacking your cycno jammer attempting to bring in capitals to seize your outpost now you have managed to defend your system cyno jammer from battleship fleets using bubbles snipers and capital support for several days you log off to go to sleep then within 8 hours while you were sleeping a coalition battleship fleet incapacitated your jammer you now have 6 death star pos in reinforced including the tower containing your jump bridge and jammer your outpost services are all offline and there are several large anchored bubbles on the outpost to prevent undocking attempts hostile 40 support fleet on the outpost and there is a hostile cap fleet active in system continuing to reinforce remaining towersthe swiftness an alliance sov can be torn down is totally counter to the arguments that pos warfare takes too long for the smaller alliances sov only needs to be taken from the outpost systems to win it should be a very lengthy and costly make or break effort for a alliance to attempt to siege another when larger alliance can come in and in a matter of weeks take two regions several outposts and displace three alliances its too short it lends its self for 00 to be too much of a risk to new alliances and prevents them from taking space and prospering instead they only become renters of the larger top ten alliances and never owning space of their own new level of constellation sovereignty of the little guysright now if an alliance dont have sov 4 the attacking alliance only needs to break the jammers and take away sov in outpost systems to kick a alliance out the fewer number of outposts the alliance have the easier it iswe need a easier more basic and less restrictive level of constellation sovereignty for smaller alliancesone outpost at sov level 3 and 50 of the constellation under its sovereigntycyno jammers in outpost systems are invulnerable until 50 of the sov in that constellation has been lostdefending alliance sov can be regained at downtime if the number of towers claiming is greater the dreaded focus firethere needs to be some dps loss given when focus fire is used especially when its used by capital ships there should be no amount of dreads that can melt a tower in one cycle that takes away the need of the support fleet and allows the reinforcing all sov towers in a system in hours not days if there is a point where the gain of an additional cap isnt worth bringing to bear it would lend it self to the use of more support ships andor smaller scale pos warfare
how about changing the link in item 1 to direct a person interested in the actual dev blog regarding the ludicrous speed issue thereby allowing the educated person to make their own decision posting a link to the thread against the change makes the op appear biased did i read something to that effect already unless there is another link for the changes to the ludicrous speed issues the devs clearly elaborated onya this is late no i dont care
fits in nicely with small anchorables so i think ill bring this up in a later meeting
could be a good idea if they produced a lot of pos fuel  like if one colony in a solar system could produce enough fuel to run every pos in the system even then im not sure if itd be worth it  depends on what the real bottlenecks of pos logistics are otherwise it just sounds like itd be a lot of extra work for nothing
and the longer a colony is established the more selfsufficient it becomes lets say a starting colony has a lot of needs  food water oxygen personnel electronics big listbut as the world is terraformed the need for oxygen reduces eventually disappearing completely as the colonists can breathe the air full time as more land is made available for agriculture less food  livestock are required seams of ore get found factories get built and so on and so forth the larger the colonies the more likely they are to be able to fill specialist personel needs from their own staff etcthis would mean there would be a vested interest in keeping colonies active and growing because in the end they will become net exporters i figure this process should take quite a whileheck just hire sid meier and have a civilisation minigame in eve edit  oh and make it available in high sec as well with the same requirements on standing as you need for pos at the moment
against
yeah i like this i mean i dont jc that much but theres certainly been times when ive had to sit around waiting on the next clone jumpalso it would help people with multiple clones with implants managing them more like a module than a rig if you see what i mean
jcs already make the universe too small no
the way it is now the regular clone jumper needs to plan ahead and coordinate hisher jumps at least a little bit this is goodreducing jump intervals sounds very very much like the lazy option to me eve should be made more challenging not the oppositeapart from that with everyone involved in some fighting jumping around every 14 hours aka pply every time they log thered be even less loss of implants ruining that market even moreagainst
id like to see this id also like to see modsrigs that increase more drone related things like rigs that increase drone bay size
yesi cant even believe this problem still exists the stupid tactical situations caused by ships travelling at implausibly fast speeds was one of the reasons why i stopped playing for a year
come back here where i can catch you
and a bump towards ccp  an update on what they currently think about whats said so many years ago would be niceyours truly
couse its chribba and miners need lub to
sounds like a sheer pwngage look at my killll optionneed nowant only by those who wantlike just that im not on that boat however
what i wonder now tough will the csm talk about this idea with ccp 
i guess we are talking about two different thingsi think you are talking about the chart and table averagei am talking about the average thats listed in the window where you enterchange the pricedurationquantity of the sellbuy order
are they not the same i couldnt tell you whether its the 5day or 20day that the order window uses to tell you how reasonable your price is but i assume its one of the two
pretty sure i heard some ccp guys talking about the effects update including new sound effects but just in case theyre not it needs doing
bump for great justice
good idea on more than a few pointstower capture  less tower production necessary  less boring grinding bs and more playing the game
eh a tax just so you can get a refund dumb idea go get a rd agent and then only cash in the cores once a year if you want a yearly bonusyou probably are one of those types that spends every single isk you have and are perpetually under 5 mil in the bank in rl as well take this as an opportunity to learn some budgeting skillsthe easiest way to do it is either save up all your loot for a few months at a go and then finally be able to get enough cash together at once to buy what ever it is you were wanting or do like i do and set up an alt every time i log on i transfer 1mil isk to that character and every time i finish a mission it adds up very quickly
ahh well then sounds like ur saying tax back in rl is a dumb idea fair call i spose xi personally dont mind the tasty check every july tho of course i can see why its not excactly the best ideaoh and your right i dont often have more than 5 mill in my rl bank account but i im not that poor in eve either still not excactly rich thoedit typo
hmmmmm not bad at all
when i think of rigs i think of crazy bull like fitting a v12 merlin in a pintogive us rigs for that kind of thing then youll see some specialized setups with really tricky behavioroversized engine mounting  50 ab pg requirementmagnum shell chamber  50 damage 80 tracking a matar junk rig thats for slinging oversized ammo at amarr ships requires beefing up the turret mount to compensate for the increase in propellantwhatd be really cool is if rigs would respond to certain ship bonuses ie gallante ships with hybrid damage bonuses have dedicated cyclotron hardware that can be jimmyrigged into boosting plasma smartbomb outputbrutor hobo tents  brutor tribe engineers who are laid off from ccp fly around in spaceships collecting parts of other ships and attaching them to your ship until youre flying a naglfarchimeras r us  strip the guts of one hull and replace it with similar systems from another ship thorax with bonuses to small projectile turrets for efficient support swattinglimit to t1 hulls as the stuff has to be simple enough to begin with in order to be mated without major headacheslauncher tube extensions  fit multiple missiles in a launcher by ripping out the rapid reloading mechanisms 400 rof but 200 damage increase sb fun rig oh and my absolute favorite candidate for rigs that can truly make some cool shipspinpoint defense calibration  shield systems on the ship are turned off and instead used in conjunction with the armor system intercepting incoming fire that armor is bad at handling applying shield resists to armor shield base resists and shield mods apply somewhat to armor in exchange for zero base shieldharmonic containment destruction  hybrid turret optimal cut 50 and damage increase of 30 plasma containment collapses on itself at short ranges causing an even more massive explosionammo overfeed  sacrificing accuracy for raw output mini engineers jack up the ammo feed rate beyond the turrets vibration damping capabilities 25 rof 50 sig resolutionanalog launcher control  reduces cpu requirements of launchers and lowers missile explosion velocity as missiles no longer do higher order trajectory correctionsbarrel extensions  25 kinetic damage of projectile ammo 50 tracking 20 falloffecm failsafe removal  sacrifice shielding systems designed to protect an ecm boats own sensors for increased pwn 50 sensor strength 30 jammer strength for pulling off really intense jams where counterjamming is less of a concernjust slewing out a bunch of numbers but yeah rigs are really kinda boring and dont offer any real increases to interesting setups with singleminded purposes
i had this idea about a week ago not sure if it was new or notbut still would be helpfuli would like to see a notice when wrecks and cargo canisters are going to expire that way i know how long i have to loot or salvage wrecks before they poof into nonexistencebasically you roll over the item in space or on the overview with your mouse and it tells you expires in x amount of time or expires at xx xxeve timeidea posted here
personally not too keen on this i can see how it would be convenient in some circumstances but it just seems a bit easy mode for me i would prefer cans to have a random duration before they pop or destabilise due to the ravages of space or whatever it isas for the intelgathering aspect from a role playing point of view you see a can floating in space how to heck are you meant to know when it pops do they have a digital timer on the side counting downnot supported even though it would make my life easier
your proposal is surrender terms while they make it so you cannot be scammed you need to put in a clause such that the winner may not redec the loser for 6 months or whatever or else you can redec them and laugh at them again also how about if the aggressor gets bored and retracts the war then he owes the loser 50 or whatever of the surrender fee of course i dont think we are getting any impovements short of an entire rework of war declarations and objectives
hello i will try to be brief and concisepublic pos issue i know that it was stated that this would not be possible as there are many concerns about ownership but what about a contract that allowed temporary access to a specific function of a pos so say a corporation with extra slots available could place one of those slots up on the contract system for a price per project basisthe party that gets the contract then has rights to use but not ownership of that single slot this could turn into a corporate financial model with out the need for ccp to expand current facilitieswar decsas a victim of wardec griefers and extorters i agree that there needs to be a few fixes corp size may be one things that only corporations of a set size can do war decs or be the victim of wardecs but more then that a way to end them the best way i can see would be to use the contract system to create treaties a proposed treaty could have both penalties and terms terms used to cease the war while penalties to make sure parties that violate the treaty are punished works for the rest of the world why not a gamesecure cansconsidered useless except as billboards i would like to see them useful seeing as the flagging system is useless in my experience at least to the small time miner so the idea allow seccans to be anchored and then expanded in space this is used in ships to save space why not allow a seccan to do this after it has been anchoredsimple really you take it out in a indy plop it where you want it then anchor apply your password and expand the can a can is after all nothing more then a box with allot of empty space inside it does not ned to be assembled in transport and this in no way would harm the current method of cargo expansion as this is only for seccanssize wise this would allow a seccan to compete with or exceed the jetcan a huge sec can could have double the capacity of the jetcan and protect form thieves and griefers that would pop the can for fun just a thoughtother thoughts limited capitol ship licenses for high ish sec areas industrial and the such hey you do it for poss point defense array hot topic the thought is simple array has x chance to hit incoming missile skill in pd array boosts chance by x total not to exceed 2025 total defenders could then be removed as useless any way arrays could use faction standards for ammo with standard ammo possibilities and effects point defense drones pd drones would do the same as the above higher chance to hit and kill but are vulnerable to attack and to be killed by other ships or dronesi remember the days when i could use a smart bomb to pop missiles when missiles could be seen as entities with speed and distance readoutsi miss that where are those true asteroid belts we were promised so long ago i am tired of empty belts it is annoying and no i am not interested in low sec and speaking of lowsec a better way for small groups and corps in empire to contact and gain passage into a lowsec sovereignty with out being podded on the spot finally what about allowing players to purchase licenses for a set amount of time so they can hunt bounties in highsec thus making bounties worth the mechanic
feedbackin short some think its a cool idea but some dont believe the damage mitigation capabilities would be sufficient for the t2 roles and that its still just a 1bn liability that wont see the light of pvprole insufficienciesokay so i have these cool mods that i can use to give solid buffs my gang mates as long as we fly with marginally superior coordination when compared to a bunch of jackasses but one big problem im supposed to be mitigating damage while trying to hold a formation together at the same time isnt this quite the paradoxhow much bling should a blinged ship bringwell as a bs it can become too much if its given too many tools to function in its t2 roles but doesnt this remind you why siege modules have penalties imbalance isnt uberness imbalance is uberness without concessionsthe solution t2 roles flip switch bs rolesactive stealth deactivates weapons and reduces signature radius by 75 comes with an inertiaagility penalty stacks takes up the same slots as the fleet maneuvering modules so you can mix and match how much damage mitigation and special bonus mods you want to fit and tailor the ship to your gangs needsthis is probably ideal it can be either really good at the t2 role or pretty okay at the bs role with the same fit but not at the same time thats tactical flexibility and something i think pilots would enjoyexpect from a t2 bssquadron vs starfleet marshallsquadron marshall gets only two slots for special mods with one active stealth array it has room for one special role and also does okay in the bs department when its not having to worry too much about damage mitigation if everything goes to hell flip the switch and get a cruiser sig radius while trying to buy time to get to a gate or for the rest of the gang to do their thingmost likely i would see squadron marshalls taking on the role as warpin interceptors using their special warp signature detection mods to get a wtz for the gang while being able to probably tank whatever they fly into being able to detect ships warping in before they actually show up on grid isnt a bad perk by itselfstarfleet marshall has four slots for special mods can comfortably fit two active stealth arrays and two formation mods if an absolutely essential formation mod is desired and you only want to bring one ship you can go with three active stealth arrays and take nearly zero damage while doing your thing on the other hand if you want lots of tricks up your sleeve you can go with three formation mods and one active stealtha word on formation link effect strengthcommand mods are nonconditional as in you press a button and your gang gets the entire bonus formation links require coordination and will actually impose penalties to ships flying against the grain formation link strength should be set in light of the fact that they sacrifice tactical flexibility for tactical focus potential bonus should be larger than simple gang mods can offer you have to be doing something right to receive the full bonus and in eve i think this is referred to as either skill or teamwork and is looked favorably upon in some circles
woudlnt mind having own music through the jukebox and tbh a full sound overhaull would be awesome i dont want my strip miner sounding like that civi mining lasser i used to use all those 4 years ago
opens up a whole new world of spying opportunities but hey sounds kind of cool
ed idea
seems to make sense to meobviously it would be nescessary to allow the passenger to simply eject if something went wrong taxi driver ctds or decides to go berserkit would be interesting as a proffesion for people if a secure isk exchange system was implemented for it an escrow system could release isk after a person has been transfered from point a to point b for example
interesting but it has pretty limited use combat functions would be pointless because theyre hardly taxing as it is plus it would pretty much assume perfect implementation for it to be worthwhile ie no extra lag space taxi type stuff could be neat though  for either shuttling pods with implants around to bringing people between trade hubs and 00 gateways itd be an interesting subprofession to pilots with great nav skills especially blockade runners that said im not really sure if the demand for something like that would make it anything other than a quickly forgotten novelty
what about standings i could see this being easily exploited by alts as a way to temporarily deal with war decs and standing both occupants would have to adopt all the wardecs of both and the lowest standings of both to avoid abuse of thison the whole though this is an interesting idea im pretty sure its been suggested before though and never went anywhere then im betting it would be extremely difficult to implement
in all honesty this should have been done with the birth of carriers motherships and of course the titan if you can fit a ship in there why not the pod as wellthis should be fairly easy to impliment
looks awesome but it will need some tweeking so it doesnt get exploited
i see why they did the assembled and disassembled states and really i agree because it allows the transport of more goods with less space i some what disagree with the destruction of rigs though in the processbut a solution still is needed so here are my two iskproposal for fix a rigged ship can be disassembled with out damage to the rig but the cost comes as a increase to the disassembled space taken so for each rig that is on the ship more parts of the ship must remain assembled this would mean that your custom ship can be packed and transported but to do so is more costly but less costly then replacing all the rigs or taking the time to transport the ships one by one
visa guy doing a better job then any of em tbh
no goons thank you for visiting the csm topic goons should not have control over anything that can change the turn of the game we have seen what your representative does on the csm as such the only reason a goon rep is there is due to your own numbers because no sane regular eve player would ever vote for a goon i am fairly certain that if we polled every single person in eve with the questions should all goons be banned unilaterally by ccp we would receive about 80 of yes i was hoping most of you went to warhammer
lockedtroll
is there any update on the issueoh and yes signed the background for the third bloodlines was promised more then two years ago but then pushed back and forgotten
awful idea one of the nicest parts of eve is that your attributes dont really control you started off as pve but want to go into pvp no problem might take you a bit more time than someone who went pure perwil but youll get there and be just as effective shoehorning people into certain roles because of their stats is way too much like every other generic mmorpg out there honestly i like where things stand with attributes and learning skills if you really want to get into the whole minmaxing thing to get the absolute optimal training times then yeah you can do the learning skills thing if you dont thats cool too if you have good sp in gunnery it wont be any more or less effective just because you didnt bother with learning skills beforehand
not discussing if we have to remove em skills or notbut i keep reading there is no practical ways to do sohere is a practical waylets say weve find a way to enhance the pod interface and it now gives a perma 5 or 7 or 10 weee to all attributesremove the learning skills from the learning treeallow each existing char to selfreassign the number of sp he had in the learning specialitylike if you had 12m you can rightclick  instant train the skills you want till youve spend it allmaybe double the bonus of cyber learning implants 246810 instead of the actual 123 to keep significant differences between playersthis would lead to a general decrease in skilltraining time meaning youd have to train for only 15 years to get all skills to vwell ccp if you dont like my idea you can as well x2 everyones sphour much appreciated thanksedittrain of the skill spelling level ii completed
la vista you better not let it slip this time
dont worry it was a part of the package we sent for sure
quick question thoughim trying to peice together a project fancy word for a 15 post idea in features and ideas discussion fourm and its not done yet how much time do i have to the next meeting or pass up
15 months
thanks for the heads up ill try to get done in time then
an updated ui would be great
rolling this back on up to p1 so that maybe someone who gives a damn will take a look and make a commentt2 inferior to base t1  bad
i think planets would have differences based on their conditions im not big on the idea of tereforming as much as adaptability to a particular planetsure a jungle world will be easily populated but a stony moon i dont really see that being tereformed as much as exploited ive also seen icy planets jupiter gassaturn gas volcanic stone earth like and many of these are different like an earth world with storms or worlds seemingly covered in lights i do believe that colinists should have a morale and a faction so that after war or after a new owner takes over morale and loyalty will be low as will any production and will need to be rebuilt this might mean bringing in medicle supplies or luxuries above any basic needsthese colinies could also have random occurances like diasters like floods factory explosions riots plagues solar flares ect that have to be delt with by players sort of like naturaly occuring quests which would bring alot to richen the stark and boring world of eve and make it more personal and less spreadsheety
this should actually be the alternitave to moon mining having people to do it on the planetmoon may not get you much to begin with but over time it could become more efficient then with an arraythis topic is endless
excellent ideasupported
still no update for us even with recent update to the in development bit really would be nice to know what the deal is
i love this whole concept id be able to wake up and jumpclone to screw around with my cousin way off on the other side of the galaxy in the morning before class then later in the evening i get done with class and work and jc back to wherever at the end of the night
you leave amarr spaceoh and supported
planetary flight opens a large can of worms that i am not sure ccp wants to deal with admittedly it would be cool but the issue is once you have it what good is it ok you can fly around a planetummmok this is the can of worms to make it worth wile they will need missions they will need models and terrainsplanets and planets of terrains atmospheric effects structures ground clutter little commuter ships and shuttles the list just goes oni think it would be good but it would have to be done right and there is just to much to do it right now especially once you do do it wellthen we are going to want to land the ship and wander around do clones even count if your eaten by something and you ship is derelict on some distant mooni frankly would rather have them implement real honest to god asteroid belts in systems instead i am just so tired of having no rocks to mine in empire cause all the belts are mined out of existinse i am a miner i like to blow rocks to dust and sell my minerals darn hard to sell something i can not find cause they have been picked clean and this one predates castoryeah
this is just an idea but while recruiting i experienced a lot of players who stated that they want to stay in npc corp all day cause they have no tax and cant be wardecced this seems a bit odd me thinks that a flat 10 tax or even a dynamical rate depening on the time the player stayed in npc corp would be good for eve as it would encourage some people to join a player corp and play together and on the other hand considering the complaints about high sec carebear farmers we would get a fair system and an additional isk sink if players dont want to get wardecced they stay in npc and pay taxes like everybody else in a player corp if they dont want to pay taxes they can join a player corp or build their own though having the risk of beeing deccedsure this wouldnt help if the player would go back to npc corp when wardecced but that would be another problem to solve then maybe something like a 7 day 50tax rate after leaving a player corppleased to hear your opinions
sensible but no proposal that nerfs isk farmers will ever be accept4ed
you know the phrase no taxation without rapresentationin this situation it will be no taxation without services if a player ina npc corp can open hangar to share with his altfriends plant up a pos possibly with pay for use services for the corp members sharing a pos service in one of the npc corp would be wonderful it will be ok to pay a 10 tax rate and even get some form of war dec against against the corp or individual in it as long as that is not implemented there is no corp service you should pay with your tax
being made immune to capsuleer corp wardecs is a service well worth paying for
i agree with daelin  being immune to the entire premise of the game should have a cost10 for the first month or two then 20 for another month or two with a daily increase in tax rate of 05 allowing someone to remain in an npc corp for 200 days before theyre at 100 tax after two to three monthsleaving an npc corp reduces the tax rate toward that faction by 05 per day while in a player corp standings for refines in that factions stations would be after leaving the npc corp based on the characters standings against the established tax rate they accrued while in the npc corpcollege corps ie newb schools should limit players to tier 3 skills max level 2 agents max and completely bar their members from lowsec ie newbs should not be able to jump into lowsec00 at all in an rp sense its because the colleges simply cannot afford to train pilots to such advanced levels and for their own personal protection the gates deny passage into dangerous spacenonschool npc corps could allow jumps into lownullsec and have no limitations on the level of skills that can be trainedbut freighters or capital ships could not be flown just trained and all mining lasers yeild only 50 of their peak efficiencylevel 4 quality 0 agent capin the end get players out of npc corps by any and all means available
you cant force people to make themselves vulnerable to pvp too many will just up and quit what you can do is impose sufficient penalty that it does not remain the common sense solution for all players and alliances looking to do trade industry logistics or missionsthe npc corp residents pay through taxes the rest pay through the risk of being wardecced so long as wardecs either lock players into their corporation for the duration or remain active on players after they leave their corp for the duration this could work quite wellid also go so far as to suggest outright banning certain ships from use while in an npc corp such as covops recons exhumers freighters and carriers id be all up for all t2 and capitals but that may be considered too harsh to avoid the use of npc corps for high level logistics scouting and mining this leaves only pure industrialists and station traders unaffected and they really arent going to be greatly effected by a wardec anywayi strongly believe that while npc corp protection and concord need to exist to support certain player groups they should not by any means be free otherwise theres little practical reason to ever expose yourself to riska sensible npc corp tax amount would be around 20 10 more than typical player corporation tax
my opinion is that there is no tax that you can impose that will cause a dyed in the wool pve player to do anything other than gripe or quit make it too low theyll just gripe and keep right on doing what theyre doing make it too high and theyll quit so unless your objective is simply to punish them because you dont like the way they play i dont think youre going to achieve anythinghere is the fundamental question you have to ask do pve only players belong in this game if your answer is no sure make it as unattractive for them as youd like if your answer is yes what you really ought to be doing is improving the pve content in empire cause it sucks the fact that we have pve only players in this game at all is just a testament to how deeply averse some players of mmos are to pvpi proposed something similar here recently it didnt get much support i doubt this will get much support ccp is moving in the opposite direction theyre floating the idea of enhancing empire to give the very players youd be trying to discourage with this encouragment to continue what theyre doing and for more of them to sign upas my grandpa used to say i think youre trying to shovel  against the tide here
esp with fw theres now a perfect rp reason for taxes the empires need to pay for their wars so no more free rides for capsuleers personally i think 10 is too low but i support the principle
thissupported 100
i can agree that the npc corp should have a negative effect for the privilege of staying out of corporate pvp the issue is that some people just are not interested in pvp and the npc corps fulfill that roll some people just like to hang out and rat or mine nothing wrong with thatthe issue i have though is that npc corps are used also by experienced players to cause trouble and escape repercussions while others use an npc alt for their corporations gain scouting and the such so the question is how to you maintain the play option for those that just want to spend their 15 a month doing that while getting rid of those that exploit the safety and anonymity it provides
20 for non fw npc corps if your character is over 2 million skill points or 3 months old 10 for fw npc corpsi think drawing the distinction between fw and non fw is important however before the differing tax rates are implemented it needs to be much harder to joinleave a fw corp at will keep in mind tax rates do not harm real newbie activities at all low bounty amounts are completely untaxed by the games tax system for example
i like the sentiment encourage people to leave npc corps and join player corps and take more risks but the stick is entirely the wrong way to do it as has been observed here already  if the penalty is small the npc corp community will gripe not change if the penalty is large the npc corp community will leave neither of those outcomes is good for the gamethe carrot is a much better answer improved pve and empire content and fw is a good example of both legitimizes the npc corp community and gives them more to do an improved 00 experience i think overhauling sovereignty rules will help a lot with this to reduce newer alliances entry barriers will encourage players who can handle risks to take themsorry not supported

definatly worth the coding effort i think
techlab is invaluableif closed i can well see the only possible compromise being a sticky thread on the gamedev forum with the title for information about the eve api and player generated tools and then simply have a link to an externally hosted forumdo ccp really want to push this information onto an external forum  and make it harder for new devvers to find
im very sure that is not the case at least not with the items that see a lot of quiet days
how are you sure a dead day contributes to the average at the price of the last transaction im referring to the red and green trend lines in the price history display
you stole my i dea i posted this idea weeks ago still supported tho
totally supported offline towers that take ages to blow up is stupid and the idea of being able to steal these assets is very appealing the only change i would make is that i would make the timer much shorter before a tower gets tagged as abandoned maybe 24 or at a push 48 hours by doing this an extra layer of depth would be added to 00 territoral conflicts as aggressors of territory would now have the ability to attack space by holding gates preventing fuel from getting to such poses until the pos is labeled abandoned then simple going up and switching ownership though obviously this would be only done in weaker held territory such as systems where only 12 poses are claiming sov
simply no you want the moon you wardec the corporation and destroy the tower in high sec or you can destroy the tower even without a wardec in low sec00towers of closed corporations are removed from the game but as long as the corporation exist the tower should stay anchoredas a added note ccp love you for destroying towers as they are sold by npc and so a isk sink

cargo cannisters yeswrecks nahmaybe a generally well known fact as to how long they wreckslast okbut your going to add a major load to an already taxed system o 
supported this would be helpful this is no more an easy button than it is for the market window to display historical sales data  its useful context which is already available to the player but at the moment you have to go out of your way to calculate it makes life equally easier for everyone  the people creating wreckscans and anyone trying to steal from them i dont think it would tax the servers at all clearly the timestamp already exists since the canwreck vanishes at some point and the servers already know when no additional serverside calculations are necessary even the timestamp time created can be sent to the client computers and the client computers can calculate how much time left until any visible canwreck expires
after my previous post yesterday i figured i would place this as a single item i will do the others at a later datethe purpose of this proposal is to look at a retooling of the secure cans and their purpose this is not only to make them more useful but to reduce load on the servers and to fulfill their original purpose that being to protect miners from can flippers and thieves this would be done through two key methods increasing the seccans m3 to surpass that of the jetcan and allowing a new function in space assembly in spaceaddendum this proposal could also be applied to the drop can the drop can is an insecure container deployed by industrials and was originally intended to be the can for mining but was never used due to the free nature of the jetcanhistoryas many that started this game five or more years ago know the jet can was never meant to be used for mining the only reason it has been is due to its massive capacity something that is its self a remnant from the early stages of the games developmentlater the secure can was created to combat ore thieves something that was much easier way back when but due to changes in the system this has become a moot issue due to capacity sizesm3 increaseseccans suffer from a lack of space this limiting factor is their primary failure their lack of capacity limits their usefulness by miners as miners would need to place 705 giant seccans to every one jetcan by increasing the seccans capacity to surpass the jetcan their usefulness will be more evident a giant secure can could feasibly be double the capacity of a jetcan and thus fulfill its rollbut this opens a problem what could be large enough to cary this huge can the answer is simpleassemble in spacea can is nothing more then walls and empty space why does it need to be assembled before it is deployed and anchored players planning to use the new cans could do so simply1 drop secure can in space2 anchor secure can3 assemble secure canwhen your done using it you reverse the steps this would allow an industrial to carry a giant seccan in the hold even if the seccan was just a 10x reduction in space one that has a capacity of 55000m3 double the jet can could compress down to 5500m3 for transport just 500m3 more then a disassembled frigate and far less then the capacity of even a moderately outfitted industrialthis alteration would mean that can swapping flipping and thieving would be reduced and with fewer entities in space less activity and more security miners can do their jobs as intended when the secure cans were originally createdoh and almost forgot it would give the animators something to do as they could probably come up with a really cool animation for it assembling and disassembling in spaceedit all values listed are for example or proof of concept only if approved and fulfilled values will probably be different
let start out with why do you think miners are entitled to worry free mining with out taking some loss in productivitytbh i think is too easy just to sit there and mine away as it is npcs pose no real threat to most miners in highsec all they have to worry about is the occasional can flipper and even then if they are paying attention and arent complete noobs they dont run any real risk of getting destroyedminers currently have the choice to avoid the whole thing by fitting expanders or mining in to secure cans for this they pay the price lower productivity and thats how this game works you get rewarded for taking risks and the last thing we need to do is to remove the little risk that is left in mining
i do not believe that entitlement has anything really to do with it can flipping was a side effect of a faulty fix criminal flagging was a product of the insecure nature of things the developers originally created the secure can to help stop ore thieves some thing hat was much more common after beta but because of the size of the cans they never were popularcan flipping came about with the criminal flagging system that being an attempt to make thieves more accountable for their actions but given miners rarely mount enough weapons any way to stop an ore thief and that the one fix opened up another can of worms flipping cans it just opened another hole to cause grief to people that sit there for hours repetitively miningthe goal of this is just to close those holes that ccp tried to close in the first place but could not through five years of work and frankly everyone benefits from miners even the pirates and griefersplus eventually many of us will find a group and goto lowsec or 00 at that point it is not our ore on the line but our ships and pods i just feel in that situation that our ore be safe relatively speaking and that any losses be recuperated through its retrieval this would allow that and hey you get your kills and our stuff
it is my understanding that jetcans were never meant for mining and that originally there was no such thing as jetcan aggro this meant that if you discarded of anything in space and someone else picked it up there was no aggrodoesnt sound like a faulty fix to me since ccp has stated that jetcan mining is a byproduct of someones original thought and not a reason for having jetcans in the first place
nope that is what the bears asked for they wanted the ability to kill the thief because thieves were snaking cans and could nothing about it and they got exactly what they asked for and the jet can was never and intended feature for mining so you have a balance
jetcan mining came about as a byproduct of ccp giving the jet can a ludicrous 27500m3 capacity the intended cans could not compare and were relegated to obscurity but ore thievery was becomming an issue in those daysccp created the secure cans as a way to fight that but the capacity of the secure can was nothing compared to the jetcan eventually ccp created the criminal flagging system cfs that made jetcans and things killed by a player that players propertythat did little to really stop thieves unless the mining op was heavily armed and created the can flipping griefer something that had not existed before the cfs that is why i stated that the cfs was a faulty fix as it did not completely fix ore thieving and created can flipping
you yourself can fix ore thieving by simply using the intended cans yet youre looking for the perfectly secure method with huge returns and no risk suck it up and either take that risk or mine smarter have an alt or a buddy in a hauler pick up from a secure can as you fill itthere are already a huge number of solutions youre just looking to complain about the lack of the one you want
this is my understanding of it as well jet can aggro was only added after miners complained about not not being able to defend themselves from people taking their cans now they have the option to fight back its there option to fight it doesnt force the engagement at allregardless i think that the idea of these super large secure containers atleast in highsec applications completely distorts the riskreward ratiothat being said i wouldnt mind them for lowsec00 useage cause there getting you can stolen is the least of your worries and could be quite useful in a number of appilcations
what you are asking for is a no risk afk mining solution there is a myriad of different solutions yet those solutions might be too inconvenient for you you might be required to play the game
we keep running into each other and seem to share the same ideas id like to subscribe to your newsletter
i am not complaining i have merely stated a fix to the original solution that did not work and i accept that there are those that will dislike it because it closes off their mode of funas stated if miners are happy to mine in high sec for piddles then so be it let them have their piddles but if they want to goto low sec or 00 then they can assume the risk out there it is after all high secwhy should pirates and griefers have an easy time of making havoc in an area meant to be secure from that sort of thing its not like there are not enough ways to drive people nuts besides this method
this is where you logic fails repeatedly ccp have said highsec is ment to be safer not safeyou either take the safer route and lose some productivity or you take a little risk and potentually lose some ore but bring in larger sums this is how risk vs reward works and it is the idea that this game is built apon
its not meant to be secure even the gms say so its meant to be safer than lowsec and nullsec but not safe
true i used the wrong term but even this does not guarantee safety if the player in in a player corp they can still be war decd if the player is not paying attention they can still be popped heck some one in a retriever can be easily suicide ganked even with the new concord revisionsand the list goes on and on heck given the restriction on anchored cans right now there is no perfect safety short of staying in a stationbut in all honesty and here is my assumption are you two at all after the ore or are you just fighting it because you do it to cause havoc and the occasional isk pay out by a noob for the hyjack of their ore judging by the resistance you guys actively are part of the pirate side of things so what do you loose
anything involving containers is not afk the norisk afk mining solution already exists and its called hauler with a miner ii dock up once every 2 hours and make a good million or so every time you do the rate of income is pathetically low but its easy as falling down and riskfree with a proper setup
while i dont really steal cans anymore in my first 6 months or so i used to steal cans for profit used a rifter to pick it see if i could get an engagment if nothing happened i would bring in my alt to scoop up the can but still i ran the risk of losing my ship and i did a few times rifter vs hulk  fail it ended up being a fun way to make isk and its an easy way to introduce yourself to pvp alot of pvperspirates have grown up in this manneras a side note to this story the guy that i used to raid his can alot actually starting training pvp skills to fight me and we had all sorts of fun hes acctually joined my corp and now almost a year and a half later we go kill stuff together
well then with this insight what might you suggest the securecan suggestion was to help miners hold onto their goods but that does put the thief completely out of business heck it is almost out of business as it standsbut what might make the pill easier to swallow may be tie it into something else may be allowing a potential pirate to decrypt the can and access the good inside so while secure for a short time not completely fail safe that could start a lucrative business of thieves where people are foolish enough to leave there goods and some one can come along and with a little work and time break the lock to the safe

ok i know there are 1 million posts on this and im sure somebody has already posted this idea or something similar but going through pages and pages of threads to find the right one to post on is quite dull so ill start a new post the idea is quite simple change local chat from immediate mode to delayed mode and then add a line of text under the system information at the top left of the screen which would show the status of a systemfriendly  only corpalliance members and members of high standing in localneutral  system contains players of neutral standinghostile  system contains players of negative standingwarzone  system contains players who are at war with youfollowing the system status would be a number which shows the number of statistical contacts in local for example if a system has a hostile status then the number would show the amount of hostile and neutrals in systemof course there are those of you who would say that this simply puts the problem of local chat in a different format ie an early warning tool which makes players near uncatchable indeed you would be right so to facilitate this we add a simple timer to it by making it only update every 3060 seconds this would mean that when a system status changes there is the risk that hostiles have had this time to search you out making it too late to allign and warp out while still giving rattersminers a little bit of warning which doesnt make things totally impossible for themadvantages of this changelocal chat is no longer a requirement freeing up screen realestatelocal chat can still be used to post intel on nearby gatecampspromotes the use of scouts while not forcing metagaming levels of gameplaywould not add to lag as the information for status is obtained from data which is already sent to the client by local chatpromotes the use of scouts again but allowing the possibility of gangs hiding there numbers which adds a level of depth to fleet based pvpother changes that would be neededthere is one change i think that would be needed to make this work currently scouts are able to post intil into channels by dragging names from local to intel chat channels with this change this becomes very difficult so i propose the ability to drag names from the overview instead this makes the role of covertops scout even more important as he would need a physical view of hostiles to get good intel to fleet commanders
ive been looking around but i can only seem to find notes for 1 meetingand when are the next ones
next meeting hasnt been announced  last i heard the csm is having discussions with ccp on the replies to the last batch of issues and has decided to hold off on more meetings until after thats concluded foolish imo but thats whats happening as for meeting minutes links to the chatlogs for all the meetings have been posted in the relevant meeting threads and minutes have been posted under csm on the left sidebar for a couple of them unfortunately the chatlogs are scattered from hell to breakfast because they cannot possibly be posted on the eve forumsgiven character limits and that ccp and serenity have both fallen off the face of the earth when it comes to posting what they said theyd post in terms of supporting documentationfrankly i think your best bet might be to evemail ankhesentapemkah and ask her to either post the minutes on the forums or email them to you personally she has apparently been submitting minutes for all the meetings and shed presumably have copies actually  ank if youre reading this please post the meeting minutes in the meeting threads if ccp wont we get to do this stuff ourselves
the next meeting is actually this wednesday its just not announced because ankh has arranged it due to lack of meetings otherwisebut you are right we need all the other minutes i assume they are stuck at ccpill try and figure out where they are
somebody give that lady a medal
i just suggested in an another thread there should be a 1 to 2 week cooldown period after the end of a wardec6 months would be a bit too long but anything longer than a week would give the victimloser a chance to repair and regroupwould actually put the challengein war decing for a changeeven the small frys need a chance to eliminate the big fat juicy corpsotherwise you get a very boring and stangentsp game
oldschool what matter of reasoning is this time period from honor in combat is some mythical notion of paper and pen gamesthat notion of reasoning is used to make peeps feel good about themselves while they bury their heads in the sandwar is ugly ruthless and with no other reason but to destroy your target period
public poses have been brought up before and submitted to ccp their response was that it wasnt possible given current mechanics though ive heard rumblings that those mechanics will be changed in midas meaning that we may see some progress on that in some months wardecs i agree though im pretty sure similar topics have been broughyt up here before your secure can idea is actually very good anchoring multiple cans together to form a megacan in space with effectively no change in functionality but less need for clutter would be a great change also itd probably be good on lag the ore thieves and flippers wont like it but there are people who will still jetcan either wayif only for cost reasons so they shouldnt be completely out of a job capships in highsec i might allow rorquals under some circumstancesmaybe let them use the civilian cyno thats been mentioned somewhere previously for jump freighter use but no combat ships  thats just bad point defence i favour defender fixes instead theyre a very plausible mechanic they just need to not suck nearly so hard belts im not sure what promise youre referring to lowsec im not sure what mechanic you want also if you get podded easily youre doing it wrong  when your ship is dying spam the warp button and bounty changes dierdra had the definitive thread on this topic a month ago and its already been forwarded for ccp consideration  we should see their response soon
pd weapons i am not sure the defender missiles can be fixed the reason is that the idea of two projectiles traveling at their own speeds hitting an intercept coarse even if fudged requires allot of processes to work out that is probably why they fudge up in the first place combine that with the fact that not all ships have a missile hard point  punisher thorax omen harbinger etc yes i pilot mainly amarr it makes them of limited usewhere as a pd array requires less calculation missile in range fire  to hit failure missile hits and it uses the current weapons systems and really any ship can use it now i am not interested in invalidating certain ships just adding another option as well as i do not condone that there can be a 100 guarantee that a missile will be downed that is silly but missiles always hit when in range mostly where as all other weapons can miss even at point blank this would just make misses more possibleas for real asteroid belts before castor and subsequent page revisions the devs were talking about real asteroid belts but when castor went live they were not to be they held the promise of ore when you wanted it and as a miner i like that ideai think the real glitch was the navigation points after all how do you work that when you have a huge ring of rocks floating around a system interestingly that is simple and there have been talks of fixing the navigational ui alsoif you want to break from the usual waypoints one way would be to create a orbit ring around all celestial bodies when your planning to warp you can select a point click or drag and a coarse along that circle will be plotted and you then warp to that point at what ever distance you choose warp to zero and your right on the ring this means that when it comes to a belt you choose the belt you click where on the ring and you warp hey a new use for that zoom out and see the system uias for detection nothing would change players can still be found and killed hiding is never really an option any more but it would mean that there would be plenty of rocks for us all and the macro miners could be more easily detected after all they are the ones that have just been mining for three days strait and cleared one au of belt single handedly
pd weapons are an option but i dislike deleting segments of the game that already exist since there is no practical way to give people respecs in eve intercept trajectories arent particularly difficultat least not when everything is inside a computer i posted a thread on this topic a while back and i think it has a reasonable solution to this problem as for belts i really like that idea have rats scattered around randomly respawning daily  would certainly make ratting a more interesting adventure as you shortwarp around the belt hunting for officers a belt the size of sols is only about 15 billion km around  you dont mind doing 10 million jumps to clean it all out right i wonder how many people would go crazy when you told them that theres hundreds of officers floating around insystem with them right nowand even a couple in a highsec system and all they have to do is go find them also to make use of the belts sane just draw halfplanes centred around the axis of the belt and you warp to the point where that halfplane cuts the belt it might look vacant towards the end of the day but that already happens asis and this kind of empty is at least fixable by moving around maybe building a safespot
well the only real reason i even thought about pds is just that not every one has a missile launcher defenders only work if you have a launcher and the skills if the defenders could be made to say get close then explode with a smartbomb style explosion say about 100m then as long as the defender is 100m from the target missile it will go downbut if defenders do get fixed then where is the equivalent where is the anti missile system for other races that are not missile oriented ccp likes balance i think this is really why defenders do not play a roll right now if they fixed the defenders they would have to balance out the rest of the races with something elsethat said lets see asteroids and seccan modification are good ones lets go from there as i like a shotgun effect for ideas sorts out the crud from the gems
did anyone consider tacking on a cooldown period to prevent a repetitive war decfor example require a minimum of 1 to 2 weeks to force a greifing corp from wardecing the same corp per incidentexample corp wardecsgets its satisfaction via any number of methodsbut cant war dec the same corp again without having to wait 1 week minimumthis would put a nasty little grinding halt to the repetitive nature of war decs that may crop upnot to mention gives the victim half a chance to regroup and rebuildeven then most griefers would get distracted or bored or go off and war dec someone elseattention spans tend to be shorter than one would expect
i see a certain trend heremainly you forgot one category to received bonusses from a fleet commandship you have short medium and wait nothingsorry but i find your proposal lacking one sided and an attempt at nerf balancing long range fitted shipswhen you have a good idea how a fleet command ship on the other side could be used to a counter your fleet command ship or b boost his own long range ships do tell
snipers can already gain utility with the ships in their current form via the enhanced deployment capabilities allowing them to get to short range faster to use high damage ammo or sending support on top of an incoming group to pin them early there are a few other situations where the needs of snipers and shortrange bss overlap like getting out of bubbles quicker when trying to deploy or retreat from a fight so its not all bad for snipersas far as counters the answer is support below tier guns will still be hitting for full damage in most cases paint to get the sig radius back up a bit web it bump it into a low transverse heading and try to bring it in front of full sniper fireim aiming for a ship that provides means of increasing the effect of movement and coordinated maneuvers in combat as well as providing enhanced means of deploying friendly forces in combatthe main advantage of having lots of support is increased control of where combat takes place and when it beginsends by supplementing the effects of mobility what the ship would really do is increase the importance of supporti would like to develop some dedicated formation links for snipers to do their thing however the problem is sniper bss can align towards xyz and perform their function just as well regardless of what they are shooting or how they want to position themselves in relation to it since snipers dont benefit from movement to a great extent how can you enhance the effects of their mobility so far the only solutions ive come up with are things like armored front or broadside fire control which require snipers to at the very least face a common direction to gain some beneficial effectsanother great problem for dedicated sniper mods is that snipers dont typically fit for mobility and that means theyre not going to be able to move effectively in formation compared to short range bss even if they are given links a fleet marshall boosting sniper bss is going to have to fly at a crawl as not to leave its own group behind no transverse  no damage mitigationso as you can see its not that im on a hate tirade against sniper bss but rather symptomatic of the low importance of mobility for snipers to begin with they sacrifice mobility for the advantage of not needing it and thereby cant really gain much from it and have little to apply to begin with

not supported  npc corps are limited in services they offer to legitimate playersif you want to get more wardecs why dont you propose a decable npc corp that everybody joins once they were in a player run corp  i mean you leave your npc corp join a player corp and then leave the player corp you end in a decable npc corp  similar to the militia corps 
this and the fact that some players have a hard time finding a pc corp that they would like to join
if they dont like whats on offer they can start their own corp and run it how they want toit was suggested in another post about looking at empire that at least the missionrunning part of the npc corp membership can be enticed out of npc corps the solution there is to make the best level 3 agents and almost all level 4 agents not respond to members of an npc corp but they will if a pc corp member has high enough standing for itthis way those who are solo mission runners because thats what they like to do without being decced can still do it although their earnings will be cut as the agent quality decreases but those doing it as an isk earning mechanism to support other characters are more likely to join a pc corp in order to gain access to better agents and better rewards
i like the progressive corp tax rate over the months that way it doesnt burden our nooblets who just found eve but it still encourages people to join corps because each month they loose isk and unlike in a corp it doesnt go anywhere after there taxed
how about everyplayer over 6 months goes into a decable corp youre way is making it harder for people to make the leap to a player corp as if they not like it therell be no way back to the safety of a war dec free npc corp  the services a npc corp offers its members is a tax free income and the safe knowledge that they safe from harm as long as they not get baited or afk around not everyone saying tax them very few i wager are looking for war targets as nothing is easier than baiting one player knowing he got no mates waiting to spring the trap etc tax them why should they get 10 extra income from missions etc
i like this idea but like some others said before being in a npc corp has drawbacks as wellyou can compensate this with egcheaper insurance at your npc corp stationscheaper clones at your npc corp stationscheaper repair costs at your npc corp stationscheaper lab slots at your npc corp stationsmaximum standing bonus refining efficiency at your corp npc stations
well thanks for your replies so far i just want to make clear that my intension was not to nerf nor force players to anything if someone enjoys playing alone thats fine but he shouldnt get rewarded for that all serious player corps have taxes except those holdings giving them immunity to pvp and zero tax at the same time is unfair compared to the casual playersif possible it would be cool to have dynamic taxes in npc corps they should raise either by total time spend in npc corps or by skillpoints0  5m sp  npc with 0tax5 10m sp  transfer to another npc corp with 5 tax2025 tax should be maximum imho they would still be free to make their own corp its their descission and this would be fair for the industrialist next door giving him the opportunity to do something about that competitor ruining his prices with mission loot fethinking this further it would also be a good idea imho if player corps could join an npc alliance like its actually implemented with fw joining the specific faction alliance would render them invulnerable to wardecs which i find a good thing for new corps i hear a lot of new players complaining about a pirate corp with 2 year old players just deccing and ransoming this is not good for eve as some of those players might quit rather than sitting docked in a station all time till they payof course they would have to pay a tax as well and after a certain ammount of time in a npc alliance maybe some 3 months the taxes would rise above a level which isnt reasonable affordable
this be verrrry dangerous groundbe careful and tread lightlyi like where your going with this idea but dont go overboardalso not every corp has a tax rate o 
another fine example of a people dont play this game the way i want them to ccp fix pls kind of ideaan idea like this will end 1 of 2 ways  mission runners happily eating a small tax or forming a 1 man corp to dodge restrictions if theyre any stricter than that yes this makes them technically vulnerable but i cant imagine a 1 man corp is terribly appealing to any corp looking to wardec especially when the 1 target is going to do what they can to avoid fighting still i guess its a nice way to screw newbies over until they get into a corp of their own
screwing noobs is never a prospect i want to see in any game at any time unless its someone who refuses to learn
and thats the attitude that leads to these stupid suggestions  this idea that people have to play the game a certain way if some random wants to stay in highsec and run missions or mine scordite all day whats the harmmind you theres definitely a problem with missions in empire the riskreward ratio is completely screwed up but players in npc corps are just a small symptom of that problem changing this will fix approximately nothing
and what is my reward exactly being serious or not as nothing to do with a corp taxe and if those casual player feel this is an unfair advantage all they have to do is join a npc corp just like i did but noi have to change to way i play the game to meet there need right i believe that would be the perfect time for ccp to answer this simple question i m not holding my breath on this i know they wont answer but that would take care of the issue regarding the npc corper and the level 4 missionedit and obviously not supported
it has nothing to do with random guy x running missions in empire and everything to do with 00lowsec players shielding their isk making and logistics with npc corps
im not sure what you mean by your statement of attitudebut ill make myself clear on the matternoobs in my day where people brand new to the gamepeople who have no idea whats going on let alone how to get from point a to bim not going to allow myself or any of my corp members to go out of there way and torture themand even if i have to blow one up for can tipping or something i would at least take the time to explain to them why and offer to assist them in getting back on there feetso the next time they decide to do something they wouldnt be so noob about itnoob today usually means idiotmorondumband so forthso when i said noobi meant the traditional versionhence the qualifier unless they refuse to learnpeople who refuse to learnare people who need to be considered for darwin awardsthey ruin the game and should be removedi dont want eve to become a game of zombiesnnhhhhhhgkilllllllllsnhhhhhgggg
erm sorry guys it seems you get this thing completely wrong deadedwhat has my proposal to do with the way i play this game i have no benefit of thisagain while recruiting players refused cause they pay no taxes in npc corpagain this is about fairness and balancing not nerfing not newb bashing not forcing players to play the game like i do miukiyou reward is that you can farm all day in high sec immune to any loses and dont pay any taxes while all other players do thats unfair and i cant see any reason why players in npc corp should not pay taxes please enlighten me why shouldnt they does state war academy not pay office rents ect
thats all fine and good but this idea doesnt even begin to fix that and never will all this does is punish anyone who doesnt want to join a player corp for whatever the reasonif people dont join your corp simply because of tax then ask yourself two things1 does your corp suck2 do you really want someone that obsessed with their own walletits not fairness and balancing at all corps charge tax to pay for whatever corp functions and benefits they may have npc corps dont offer anything but protection which they do at the price of never really being able to do much of anything outside of highsec its clear where the support of this idea comes from  it stems from the issue of lowsec being completely worthless and pirates having fewer and fewer targets because of it thats a big problem and its what needs to be solved players in npc corps have next to nothing to do with it transaction taxes on all market transactions done within a station  cuts of refines  office rent from player corps renting in npc owned stations thats how they make their money in a rp sense
the issue is they dont like people camping out in high sec they think it removes the fun from lowsec and 00 spacefewer targets to gankfewer prey smaller profitsand to some degree i have to concur but only on one little pointcauses an endless cycle of said actions to take place in high sec spacewhich means trafficlagand greifingthere is no easy solution to this conundrumi personally dont see a problem with players of npc corps playing a small tax for benefitsbut to what end will it achieve anythingnothing really isk is easy to come bythis also segways into the mindset of lets torture the noobs and force them to come out and playsorry for the derailment in light of that
i do fully support this idea there is no reason why players in npc corp shouldnt pay taxes

gtcs have gone up by 25 in the last month from 400mill for a 60 day gtc which was already overpriced to 500millin part is sellers themselves creating fake buy orders for hilarious prices just to raise the bar and because players need gtcs nomatter what and with 70 of them having no idea about economys theory of supplydemand sellers are getting away with itim aware that ccp makes money from this high prices but this has now become ridiculous gtcs have become eves oilit is time ccp puts regulation concerning the pricing of gtcs or bring back 30day  90day gtcsregulations concerning pricing of gtcs should become ccps and the councils main concern simply put who cares if the game is bugged if 50 of the player base stops playing because they cant afford itas many others i will slowly start seeing myself playing just to pay for gtcs and not to actually to enjoy the game and with 4 accounts this is turning more into a job than a hobbyi encourage everyone to give out seriously thought ideas and support this if prices do not go back to what they were i will most probably cancel my subscriptions like many until ccp does something about this or pricing go back to reasonable levels
supporting my topic
how exactly do they make money the gtc is a fixed price to whoever youre buying it from regardless of whether they sell it on to you for 10 isk or 10 billion iskedit  i learned how to spell and do grammar a bit better
i agree that they should bring back the 30 and 90 day gtcsbut i cant support fixed pricesits all supply and demand the supply has simply gone down thus price increase cant blame that nor fix it
vistaim not in any way supporting fix pricing but ccp should realize it is time that they step in and set a limit much as governements intervene with certain commodities to make sure buyers dont overprice iti think we can all agree that if buyers got together the prices of gtcs could easily be 600mill and although most would say that wouldnt happen that is what they said about oil pricing at the pump nomatter how high the prices are theres always s willing to buy it because they just dont know any betterand if ccp doesnt intervene and put a stop to this insane inflation those kind of prices will soon be a reality and anyone may quote me saying it once it does
wont they make less from high prices people buy gtcs with in game isk so they can afford to have their account or in most cases multiple accounts 35 accounts cost 45 to 75 us dollars per month now in my case i used to buy 90 day gtcs for around 300m and could keep 5 accounts running every month now i have had to cut down to 3 accounts because 75 a month is rediculous and not worth it and i refuse to pay more than 350m isk for a 60 day when i used to get 90 days for lessso in reality they are losing accounts because people cant afford or refuse to pay so much with rl or ingame money ccp can either control ingame prices for gtcs and make them resonable or bring back 90 day gtcs or lastly continue to lose accounts
imo some regulation should be done dunno about max price but 30 and 90 day gts could fix problem back 
price limits are a sign of economics gone slightly mad and i can show with only minimal difficulty that theyre a foolish idea that hurt those that theyre supposed to help in virtually all cases also the whole point of the law of supply and demand is that you dont have to know bugger all about how it works for it to work people produce more of something when its more valuable and consume more of it when its less valuable if gtcs are getting too expensive for you buy fewer of them  set long skills on 23 of your accounts and let them lie fallow for a month or let them lapse entirely or even sell one of the charactyers to finance the other three but dont tell people willing to pay for a gtc that theyre not allowed to because theres a ccpimposed shortage
this is a joke right you cant begin to tell me that its ethical to price fix something that is a commidity just because you chose to use it as your only means of paying for your game time that is just a giant comedy its the only autherized rmt if you cant afford imaginary dollars to pay for real objects get a new hobby
why should you encourage the stationary shooting of objects for people who have not tended to their mess why have a simple anchoring function not work both ways why allow people to drop assets anywhere they feel like it where they know that only boredom can save them from being destroyed not pvp prowess not combat effectiveness but boredomi am sorry but this attitude of the most vile and useless carebear lot in this game needs to be cut out like stink rot from flesh for too long the sick carebear has been allowed to clog up the gang with mechanics that favor boredem as the only defense tool you should be required to defend you assets not let some stupid game mechanic come to your aid
a tax back in rl is dumb too thats why i usually end up paying the man about 600 every year around tax time of course it doesnt hurt that i typically make 200300 the best ive made is 700 in interest by investing monthly what the govt would have taken as a free loan and then graciously given back to me in the form of a tax back well this coming year i wont be seeing that much more like 50if i could id take 100 of my monthly tax and put it in bonds for the year and let the government pay me 46 instead and cash them all in at tax time unfortunately they wont let you do thateven with the market crash fifty bucks is fifty bucks and all you have to do is check a box to change your deductions itll get you a case of decent beer and a large pizza sorry for those of you who live in the ukeu itll only get you a pizza and maybe a pinttax backtax refunds whatever you want to call them are a rippoff of the citizens and the various governments know it

you may think that but if youve not looked into the science and logistics of such a task youd see my pointeach time you tack a clock on to an objectyoud have send that information to a number of placesthat same information is also going to be broadcasted to your corp mates for exampleso what you have is an exponential rise in information compounded with the unknown and yet astronomical number of wrecks created in the world of eve both ncp and playerand the number of cargo cansif a dev would be kind enough to post the statistical data of any one given number of cans and wrecks youd find out thats a very large daunting taskoh sure the datas there its one thing to store itits an another to broadcast it and put it on displaymethods are always easy but implementation is a whole different ballgamenow if they already have the structure for said function more power to im
fair enough perhaps any particular player can turn the clocks on the display off so that that information isnt sent to them it would be useful information in a mission setting but probably less so in a fleet battle where lag is a serious problem by default it could be left offif its really unworkable then ccp will say so right now it seems like theres still enough room for compromise that we can have a discussion the merits of the idea and let ccp work out how best to implement it if it makes it that farstill supporting
this is what i do drop a container at the start of your mission and give it a name corresponding to the time you dropped it  and maybe bookmark it for when youre in another room you can always see how much time leftno need for timers if you can solve it yourself easily id say
ive noticed that granted it means more work but you got an answer there for your needs of tracking timewrecks however should be dropped entirely from the proposalthere are likely to be millions of wrecks at any one time thats going to be obscenely hard to trackif everyone knew the time limit for any one wreck it would at least give you a rough idea of how much time you have before they expire
so pretty much there would be no issue with huge secure cans as long as they can be broken into some how ok that is reasonable the question is how long would it take to break into the can and under what conditions after all cant have them pop open with no effort at all i mean it is secure after all not safe but has to put up some kind of resistance to the efforts to break inthat would be the interesting problem really how long to be fair to all sides
the intended cans are 4 years behind the times they were created when bs mining was the top of the mining activity so they were never intended for use with the mining barges the rule that block can for being at less that 5 km from each other or any astral body is acceptable for cruiser and even bs mining not for barges that can fill a secure can in one go
you forgot a word before idea stupid you dont even know what you are speaking of afk mining cant be done using a jetcan or secure can as you need to drag and drop the ore for afk mining you need an oversized cargo hold not a external container
mineral stealing has become less common for 2 reasons minerals have a low value hulk have a good cargo size so docking every time they are full dont cut so much on the mineral productionthe hacking idea was suggested several times and it is reasonable even giving the chance to the ore thief to remove the can after opening it would be reasonable as things are today ore theft is more a form of harassing hoping for a fight than a system to get isk those that are interested in isk do ninja salvaging better return per hour and almost 0 risk
not supported oh and high sec is already being made safer due to concord buff and now you want secure mining cans with huge amounts of space seriously eve is a harsh place that is its appeal and it should stay that wayin ending having such secure cans would make eve one step closer to wow online i apologize for saying the w word as i know it can cause severe ear strain to many of my fellow hardcore eve players ds
i take particular offense to you calling anyone stupid thank you very muchfor the record if youre saying that the word stupid should appear before the word idea then perhaps youd like to reexamine your grammar secondly if you are redirecting your next comment to farrqua you should have addressed him as it would also seem that you are saying im not abreast of the conversation at handyes i know exactly what you were trying to say and am calling you out for not knowing how to address the issue properly
i take issue with this because of how it was stated as you may have read i was considering alternate methods also that equalize gain vs risksecond the concord buff was only to prevent the suicide gank and to make malcontents face a better punishment for their efforts obviously you count as one of said malcontents due to your own comments admit it the concord buff though would have not relevance on this due to the fact that the pirate would need to attack the canif hacking was used to break open the can i do not see that as an attack more of a subversion of the cans processes if you still feel like suiside gankinggoto where it belongs so has spoken ccp other wise find another way to have your fun and get your gank onedited for insulting commentssorry i have to remember to be a good boy
first off while everyone here is slugging out there ideas and thoughts with proposals and counter proposals and arguments and counter arguments you need to keep a few things in mind1 minieral theft is very much alive thank you very muchjust ask any of my corp members and they will tell you there are plenty of can tippersi hear it all the time and ive been victim of it myselfand dont get distracted by the fact that its called mineral theft the whole point of it today is hardly the minerals that are stolen its to gank your shipthey come up and steal what would be considered wholly worthless and then while you may assume the ship they are flying is hardly considered buff they kick your butt to kingdom come im quite certain this has happened to every miner at least oncethe point here is they can tip you because they are bored and want to grief you they dont care about anything else and are nothing but a bunch of spineless cowards who have no sense of honor they could make an obscene amount of money if they did some missions or went out to low sec space but have no courage or care or concern to do so they just wish to make your life a living hell2 your proposal for a larger secure cargo can is something im keen on seeing but you got a couple of problems the afk miner could just as easily script his ship to dump cargo in any number of very large cans the mining barges and there brothers the exhumers have extremely long range turrets it would be a walk in the park for them to park near a bunch of cans and just mine away the other issue is your bunch of moaning and whiny can tippers who yell and rant and rave claiming your ruining the game when in fact its hardly the case there was nothing relevant about can tipping to begin with its entirely a greifing systemif they wantted to steal minerals in the first place they would do it with a ship capable of hauling a ton of rocki mean seriously so you steal a 1000 units of  you honestly going to tell me you can make a good pile of isk off of thathence the comment made by someone pulling in with a hualer you have to put alot on the line to do that and its a waste of resources and timewhich is why i have such a negative view point of such a tactici mean id rather encourage a bunch of pirates attacking a mining barge at that rate at least your getting a bigger bang for your buck oh wait cant do that concordoken would be the last thing you wantso they find underhanded ways to get around the systemif your going to push this idea you need to put in a balance to qwell both partiesas this will be an never ending gripe festalready its been suggested that the can should be hackable good thats ok by memeans you need skillsbut i think we should spice it upgrant kill rights to the victimnot this 1 to 2 hours crud full blown 24 hours or whatever the standard rate isat least this way you can can tip all you wantjust be prepared to face down the victims whole bloody corp when they come ahknockinand that point everyones happyand balance is restoredps im not attacking anyone in particular but being the victim of such griefing the logic behind it tends to annoy the heck outa meso give me some room because i gave you filthy brigands a way to enjoy your little sport but at least this time you have the very strong possibility of getting your but whupped or maybe not as opposed to no consequences period
i agree completely that is why i have not been fighting the pirates they do have something to loose though not as much as the miners do any game mechanic must be balanced to achieve the purposes of all that may use itso i have no issue with can hacking and really the retaliation for it should be fairly long i think this then comes down to1 how long should it take to hack a cani say this because it should be a descent amount of time to do short enough to not be a dead mechanic but long enough to deter can flipping2 should there be conditions to that timeso if a can has not been used in a certain time frame it is easier to hack then if it has been used in say the last 30 mins to an hour3 repercussionsbounties security hits kill rights what is fair for the crime this is touchy though as either we have the thief on one side or the miner looking to protect hisher living on the otherhurm forgot something as for the hated macro miners i doubt anything would really deter them from doing there thing so really anything you do will just enable them to do it better so really there is no point as using that as a for or against they will still do it no mater what you do
what i think might be cool is to make the time of hacking a can dependent on the strength of the passwordso something like thisno password 5 secondsweak password 3x 15 secondsmedium password 9x 45 secondsstrong password 12x 60 secondsuber password 30x 150 secondstimes could be tweaked but i think i like them where they are atmit keeps cans at poses pretty safe since youve be destroyed before cracking it
make the cans take a full minute to hack and the attacker start flashing red on my overview that gives me time to respond and do something about it any more than a minute and the afk miner gets too easyalso using a macro or script is bannable anyway so it is kind of pointless to try to defend against it this much
nice ideabut i still say instead of flashing red kill rights should be given with the flashing red part1 hour isnt enough to round up a possetheft shouldnt be given a free ride in high sec spacethats an invitation to trouble there

meh would rather see more learning skills to train up which i hear is in the works 
you forgot one disadvantage defies any form of logic or coherent realityas a game mechanic skillpoints may be a arbitrary measure of knowledge but in reality knowledge cant be converted from one piece to information to another unlearning knowledge will not gain you any new information its like burning books to have magically appear new ones in your bookshelf it does not work
nonsense at a rate of 2 for 1 or even 151 its not going to get abused on a regular basis 8 million sp moved around would turn into 4m or 6m sp in the new skill do it again and youd only get 2m sp or 4m sp do it again and youd only get 1m sp etcit would not discourage specialization but rather encourage it players who skilled up randomly while learning the game could refocus their abilities but at a steep cost
the minutes should be compiled and provided via a stickied locked thread right here on this forum or at least linked from a locked sticky at the top of the subforum by ccp within 14 days of the meetings closepdf downloads of the minutes should be available but the minutes should not be pdf by default as the current minutes are
with the gallente federation i have noticed that if they pay us a visit  or say we send a expeditionary blob into caldari space  there is always confrontationi have moved on to setting my standings with the gallente federation as positive however this dose not stop myself from being hit what i suggest is that a blue star symbol is put up in the same way that fellow minmatar militiamen have either a purple or green onei have also posted this on  wwwminmatarmilitiaorg  in the formum to find out what other people think on this topici am sure that caldariammar relations have just the same issues but the more of them that get popped the merrier is my view on that topic
this there is nothing that makes a burden on the attacker  actualy the declaring corp should pay the war fee only basicaly it needs to work on an economy basis  you either manage to get your itemmoney from the deced corp or you loose the fees to them if the corp disbands or more than 30  players leave the corp while the war is active this condition does not apply and you basicaly get a free war but with no gain in the end 
its amazing that a csm responded to this rather wacky idea albeit a sound concept using the escrow interface already existant in the game yet not make any mention concerning more pressing issues
what was that i couldnt hear you with your grunting and club bangingwar decs should be a 2 way streeti believe that if your going to maintain this supposed system and keep your little sandbox world you should also have the ability to kick the  of any one bullyso before you grunt again you might want to try reading first before you respondi dont have a problem with war decing i have a problem with the way people exploit its ability to commit acts of extortion and refuse to allow new opponents and new challenges to rise up to make things changepeople these days dont like changethey want to keep there little comfy worldsthat would be rather boringalso note that i said the cool down period should be relatively short not 6 monthstry 1 week at most
two way street hmm so what you are saying is that if i war dec you you would have to be agreeable to it then is this what you are sayingclub banging nice yep i like to swing the club and i do my far bit of grunting but i prefer that than listening to your whiny high pitched shrills because your frilly things are in a bunchnow i have an opposing view and i did not in any way shape or form insult you if you want to debate then fine but if you want to continue with this eye poking i am game
i think by 2way street he means that the declared party should have the opportunity to fulfill the yulai terms set out in the war declaration or respond to it with a countercondition of their ownthe only party that pays the declaration fee is the declaring party there are no mutual wars someone must pay the yulai charterthe yulai charter would be modifiable throughout the duration of the war so that amicable terms can be set and agreed upon if that is the desire of both partiesperhaps there might be a function within the charter system where the declaring party can have the war rendered nul before it even begins a method that is nothing more than a big isk sink for both parties the declared party fulfills the concord nul terms they are out the isk and the declaring party is also out their declaration isk this could be an acceptable way to limit not prevent extortion to some degreealso if the yulai terms are met by the declared party the declaring party cannot declare on them for 8 war cycles weeks if the concord nul is enacted the declaring party can immediately redeclare but the 24 hour timer resetsif either party accepts the yulai terms or the declaring party terminates the war escrow and eats the declaration costs the war ends in 30 minutes if neither party accepts the terms reaches its close and there is the normal 24 hour closeofwar timer the declaring party can reinitiate within that 24 hour window and immediately resume the war otherwise they cannot redeclare for 1 war cycle week
not true yes combat tends to be carried out for the purpose of killing destroying or otherwise defeating your enemy but that doesnt stop there from being honor in war  be it treating pows humanely following through when you say youll end the war for 100 mil or graciousness in victory or defeat honor can be maintained despite bloodshed its not all about lining up in huge obvious straight lines wearing bright red uniforms   actually this is a bad example because that tactic was actually a quite good one given the technology of the era but still theres nothing else so stereotypically dumb to illustrate honor in war whether the stereotype is accurate or not
close enoughoh and mister xerox me thumbs upjust about sums it upquite eloquentlyfarqquawhat does agreeing to a wardec have to do with the price of quafe in jitathat has nothing to do with this entire discussioncare to try again i suggest you reread what i said then attempt to make sense of what i saiddont make assumptions it helps
herscheli do want to debate the actual aspects of war especially in a controlled make believe environment setting we all log into just for sake of arguemnt honor and bravado goes out the window when the first shot is fired and you  you first pair of shorts actually what is spouted with in the game is the fair fight as being honorable combat to sides willing to fight each other with conditions of victory flagging if you will its too restrictive a far as surrendering conditionsthat leaves out the option of non coditional surrender if you had done something to warrant all out war on your corp i should have the option to grind you into the dirt so you will never ever cross me againoff topicand as far as the lining up in straight lines wearing red uniforms british red coats if you willwas actually a bad tactic it was from the old out dated ways before the invent of the fire arm wellington realized this when he had his troops laying down and suck napoleons crack troops into a faint which came about as a slaughter as far as the treatment of pows the geneva convention was only observed by governments willing to observe them and it was normally ignored for the most part until we are allowed to have keep pows in this game that one is out of the window alsothe notion of the honorable duty bound bravado are usually found on recruitment posters and john wayne flicks and guys that sit with gear in the rear
is it possible to have the ability to keep a limited number of mp3s of your own mixbatch for the gamei mean its not like its getting anywhere its just the local machinelately ive gotten tired of the music and i just mute it and kick in my resident mp3 app but it kinda consumes resources o 
really really simple ccp gets a full month of players paying without any drag on their systems from players actually playing unfortunately this also drives off many potential new players i have introduced several friends to this game even with me providing a lot of stuff at the beginning for free they indicated they were exceedingly frustrated with the amount of time they had to wait before being able to actually use their characterto clarify they have no problem waiting for bigger ships they have a problem with having nothing for them to do for a week to a month in the gamegive everyone all the learning skills trained to 5 most people have lvl 4 on their advanced skills so i for one wouldnt be bothered by the loss of a month of training to skilling up the initial learning skills it would be like a badge for old players  yup i remember when you had to do the learning skills didnt that suckget rid of them give everyone the attributes of fullytrained learning skills put it to a vote
if you want newbs to learn the game improve the actual tutorial newbs first experience with pvp is wandering blindly into a gank instapop style half the time they dont even know what happened until it happens to them again that was what happened to me i have since learned about smartbombs provide newbs with a pvp arena they have to die at least once let them experiment with the different fittings the vast majority of this game revolves around pvp provide an arena for 1v1 and 3v3 combat for players based on their total sp dont shy away from it show people this is the fun part of the game whether it be successfully avoiding pvp or blowing up someone elses ship this is what eveonline is all about
had to had towere they so into minmaxing their character that they werent prepared to train for the couple of extra hours it would take to geta basic piloting skills to allow them to do things in the game and thenb make a start on learning skillsyou are advising these new players wrongly instead of saying this is a cool game but before you can play you have to put in a month of doing really boring stuff try saying instead this is a really cool game heres a little frigate train skill a and skill b for a couple of hours and go have some fun shooting thingsseriouslyyou dont need to get every sp you can out of your character from minute 1 training skills are for the long term if someone wants to have some short term fun when they first start the game for crying out loud let them have it when they get into eve enough to want to squeeze those sps then introduce the things you never know they might even be happy to learn that they can speed up their training times and be happy to do them
u fail
one mans raunchy joke is what another man perceives as bigotry i do not condone it in any way but implementing a server wide filter would just not be rightthose matters are taken care of on individual basis by ccp making you as a person the one responsible to take action toward what you perceive as offensive andor bigotrythe thing is where to draw the line if this would be implemented should we not ban all jokes about blondes small people the handicapped and so on and so forth

i dont think there is anything wrong to give an incentive to join a player corp as an individual player keep in mind a new player isnt going to care about being able to anchor poss or research using poss or conquer space however a corp can help a new player along much better than the help channel ever will in addition it facilitates friendships that gives an incentive for someone to stay i would say that people who play with a group of other people are far more likely to stay with the game over the long term than someone who just plays solo so i want ccp to adopt policies to make joining player corps attractive a tax is one way to do that this tax shouldnt ever be prohibitive but it should even the field from the players standpoint between player run corps and npc corps keep in mind that bounties that are too low are not taxed that is any ship a newbie will be able to kill solo in his first week will likely have 0 tax anyway due to that minimum rule increased players in corps will likely mean more corps this means it is much less likely for an individual corp to be wardecd i also think the wardec system needs to be modified but that is another issue
i dont see how this benefits anythingwill this encourage people away from npc corps probably but only into 1 man corps to avoid tax theyll still be in high sec doing missions frankly the entire idea is simply trying to force people to play the right way since right is purely objective i have to say two thumbs down on this people that want to be carebears should be carebears if i want to hide behind concord until you turn your back then shank you well thats life 
i like the idea although i would drop a 2025 npc corp tax id give new players a 90day exemption on the tax fw corps have 0 tax this would give a nice incentive for people to join player corps most corps have 1015 tax rate and they give their members servicesbenefitspeople are right this may not do anything but that is the point people always say that the stick is bad and people need encouragement to go out and explore eve the encouragement is now a lower tax rate in a player corp npc corps kicking out players over 6 months old would be forcing people a simple tax rate is hardly forcing anyone
youre getting a service its called uninterrupted pve combat
as much as i agree that changing constelation to immediate and locl to delayed would work there is a problem that needs to be considered with this if we take busy regions such as the forge which can see 200 players in 1 system if we then use constelation chat in immediate mode instead of local we would end up probably seeing this chat channel with 1000s of players all chatting away and updating constantly as players jump in and out of the consteallation from considerably more gates that local has to update with i know this is a social game however this would franky be a little bit annoying while at the same time i dont think it would help lag to muchi know this link is my own idea but i think it would work betterlinky

personally i think the way that local can be so abused as an intel device in this game is ridiculousthe only channels that should be able to be set autoupdate should be corpalliance channels or possibly moderated playermade channelsno more easymode intel learn to use the goddamn scanner oh and before anyone whines about but dah ebil piwats will getz me remember  you wont show up on local either
if youre gonna go at this from a fully rpangle then this is craplocal in eve works via a quantumentagled router system managed by concord i think maybe some other big corp lai dai radar or signals have nothing to do with ityour only radar is your scanner and remember kids if im in scan range youre in scan range
awsome  i support this topic
up
any new developments here i also dont understand the people supporting this topic  what are you supporting youre supporting that the csm is discussing bomb suckage with ccp i dont think they need support there theyre already doing itid assumed threads like this were just call outs for suggestions not support polls
yeah news more of them please make them easier to deploy and maybe add some against specific targets like one type of bomb against drones and fighters one with a damage bonus against capitals one to pop pos turrets andor shields stuff like that

i might be able to agree with the notion of bringing back 30 and 90 gtchowever placing a price ceiling on the prices is a terrible idea as artificial restrictions would mess up the supply of gtc and if i apply rl economic concepts there would likely be a shortage of gtc available to meet demand ceteris paribus secondly such restrictions would go against the free marketno regulated environment that make eve interesting in the first place
completely nonsense sorry pal but how can you say 500m is overpriced i sped 35  for it spend it on a single navy raven and loose it the next day and how fast do 00 players earn that 500m a 3 days work if you ask me 500m is still underpriced not overpriced you see its all relative therefore no to fixed prices things are just fine as they are 30 and 90 days gtc would be fine but thats a decicion of ccp only
fixed prices you joking right what is this communism i agree on 30 day and 90 day i wish they were back oh and i do buy gtc to support my eve habit and i do pay the ridiculous prices
its a good thing im all nuclear then dont care for the gtcoil issue at all its not even remotely important since none of our members are paupers
leave it aloneintroduce 30day90day increase anti isk seller activity all ok in my book but setting a fixed price is stupid and should never be done
mabe you never noticed but the prices went up with 33 for a 60 day gtc no wonder people want more isk there is nothing fake about buying or selling gtc if youd ont want to pay for the gtc then buy your own game time your playing for ingame isk and are still complaining  like this es meh off
this is my 4th mmorpg and it its the first time i have ever seen it possible to pay for an mmorpg with game moneyif you cant pay for the game with rl money dont play mmorpg and tbh this issue shouldnt even be consuming neither csm or ccps time you should be playing guildwars
bring back 30 and 90 day and the problem would fix itselfthe problem is the per month cost in real money went up on the gtc so guess what people are going to ask the same amount or more of isk that they always did per unit of real life money meaning the cost going up in isk is largely an illusion paying for the game with gtc is now the most expensive way to play per month in many countries including the us if you play with gtc your going to pay for it either in rl money or in isk period ccp obviously wanted it this wayimho ccp should not have gone with this move at all but they have never once in over five and a half years listened to me so i doubt they are going to start nowbottom line we the community are going to loose accounts over this there is no question and ccp doesnt care or they wouldnt have done it so if they dont care if they loose accounts over this why would they care enough to fix prices to protect your isk my point that this thread has no point bring it up with the csm if you want to but its a waste of time ccp isnt going to do anything about it
ccp already spoke they said that eve was worth it
when is ccp going to start locking mission gates to keep invaders out the area around matsu and dodixie is overun with ninja salvage corpsits intolerable and easy to fix if its not your mission or your not in fleet with the mission runner the gate wont activate
not going to happen ever the most that could ever possibly happen and i heavily doubt even this will happen is that salvaging will flag you to the owner of the wreckseven if that does happen which it wont all it will do is get your missionship gankedsee you in your next mission
heres a thought  if your mission hub is overrun with undesirables get a new mission hub theres more than enough highquality l4 agents to go around assuming you get out of the navies are the only corps mindset
hopefully never or do you suppose that mission runners schould be invulnerable to wardec low and nullsec ect once they warp trough a gate really if this is disturbing your game experience move somewhere else or join a corp and fly missions together
i sympathize entirely with the sentiment since i enjoy missioning and get annoyed with ninja salvagers myself but i also think that ninja salvaging is a legitimate operation as others have said if ninja salvagers are a problem just move elsewhere im in the far fringes of minmatar space and can find plenty of missions in lesstraveled areas if mission runners voluntarily unclumped themselves ninja salvage corps would have a hard time finding enough work and would fold out of boredomapologies no support
oh wow thats how we got can flipping and the whin session after that could you even imagine slavage ninjas and the dramabombs that would ensure you sir a re tarded
some say its the newest thing next to threadspammingi think its something only noobie corps do ninja salvaginggo get a lifeseriously i dont get it whats fun about it you risk of getting your corp decked or get a bad name offc totally depends if youre allready into such sort off a corpccp should lock up missions only fleet mates should be able to get into thoseor just make salvaging wrecks of other players also a criminal fact so the owner make attack if he desires without getting concordedi know people will say stfu get a life but this is just my own point of view on ninja salvaging
i support making wrecks nonsalvagable in highsec youre desecrating a war grave just for petty profit come onwrecks should only be salvagable in lowsec and doing so should give a gcc
if you dont like having your wreaks salvaged in one system just move to another salvaging is legit and in all honesty it should be encouraged though not taking someones mission wreaks is pure curtosy salvagers keep our space clean and reduces the lag fromt he hundreds of mission runners who just leave there wreaks in space and not bother to salvage if your not using them why not somone else but if its really that much of a problem why dont you salvage the wreaks yourself in mission not that hard to fit a salvager on your ship insted of an extra gun
50 reduction in jump clone time delay at skill lvl 5 would be nice
it limits the worth of your intel and the degree of consequences for the enemyif you find out someone is zipping about in snakes and gear up to kill them and they all come out in something different entirely sure it can still happen but shorter cooldown just further facilitate the between act dress changes also if you pick a fight someplace by jumping in there you should be somewhat committed to it so you argue even 6 hours is committed enough possibly so if youre there all the time but if you have several accounts zipping in and out in hostile territory wrecking havoc and then leave the defenders there staring at your afk ass while you go and do the same till you can zip back out again i really dont see how this could promote gameplay of any consequenceif the jumpclones get a shorter timer and we can file up even more of them then we may as well just sign up to queue for some battlegrounds and be done with it
it really should be about a 20h reset timer so that you can jump clone at the end of your gaming sessions and then jump clone back at the start of your next day gaming session
ok a few suggestions make a sound effects volume control currently it is impossible to turn the gate jump sound off and the skill training completed voice on unless you are running evemon on background  some sounds are really annoying in eve the gate sounds and even the turret  explosion sounds these sounds have something in common their spectrum highfrequencies are at high volume and low frequencies need a boost if you have a nice hometheater system at home you will understand what i mean when you do not hear your subwoofer working as intended while playing evegraphics were upgraded in eve what about sound upgrade too
i understand that grav sites always spawn the next better roid fields in high sec you always get omber kernite or jaspet right if this is right its stupid i already have 9m isogen and i dont need anymore i need zydrine megacyte morphite  seriously i dont do grav sites anymore imho it would make much more sense to have it more chance based something like that50 chance of low end field veld scordite pyro still nice if you find a large field25 chance of plagio omber kernite15 chance of jaspet hemorphite hedbergite and gneiss10 dark spodu crokite bistot arkonor5 mercoxitof course multiplied with system sec status like the above rating would be for a 05 system whereas a 10 sys would have 85 chance of low end and so forth not to forget the different size of the fieldroidsthis way scanning for grav sites would be much more useful and enjoyable and no it wouldnt influence the market in any way with those few spawns of good ore
3 jbs per system please at a minimummax 2 jbs per system is rather restrictive and leads to all kinds of annoying compromiseswith max 2 jbs per system you end up with rings of jbs anyone who has dabbled in planning jb networks rings will know what i mean which ends up being pretty frustrating as theres no way to connect two rings wihtout well making it into one big ring which often is not desired as it ruins the connectionswith just 3 jbs per system this would be solved to a very large degreemore is ofc better but id definatly settle for getting the 3 jbs per systemwould allow to actually create a network and not the endless ringsjust 3 jbs per system would allow for more efficent setup of the network decreasing the jumps needed to go to wherever it is you want to goaka need for less fuel  and 00 logistic is tiresome enough as it iswith the current ring structure you often have to jump through 234 unnecesary systems and thus have unnecessary fuel usage to get to your destination due to the logistics of the ring setup of jbs today
you could always learn how to plan out your logistical jump bridge plan we probably have the largest jump bridge chain in eve and 2 seems to work fine
why dont you read what i wrote insteadi have no problems planning itim simply pointing out it could be more efficient  on several frontsone being  less jumping around  less db load probably a minor influence but none the lesswith such a small change as allowing one more jb per system
id wager that this is intentional  jbs are supposed to supplement gates not replace them that said i dont know that this is the case and id like to see it brought up to see what the devs have to say since theyd know a lot better than my intuition
o
bumping to ensure the topic stays alive until its followed through on by ccpi fully support my erstwhile foes proposal to allow corps to join fw while remaining in alliances some assorted thoughts obviously such corps should at least be required to meet the same requirements that independent corps must meet ie faction standings id even support making the threshold a bit higher frankly i think the standard threshold is far too low while im not opposed to being asked to sacrifice sovereignty rights for ability to join the militia i think this would give my side too strong an advantage uk em and others could join cva could not i dont particularly feel theres a need to make mechanisms to prevent corps from joining opposing factions this should be easily handled by the alliance leadership if necessary if such limits are found necessary then all that is needed is for each alliance to have a radio selector to allow the alliance to show support for one side or the other corps in the alliance can only join a faction that their alliance supports though standings restrictions would still apply further this selection cannot be changed so long as any member corp is enlisted in a militia note that if this is done support should be visible uk will want to know about all alliances supporting the amarrian faction
what will be the downside of being able to keep the logistics wing out of the militia standings going to  across the alliance for affiliation with the warring faction
i recently received this in a petitionthe petition system is the primary means by which players make their in game concerns known requests made  etc therefore the petition system is an excellent indicator of what type of things should be fixed  where the bugs lay etchow is it that the petition system and the developer have absolutely no ties is anyone else finding this a tad hard to believecan i suggest that some mechanism be made which tracks the most frequently reported or requested items in the petition system that feeds into at least the qa side of development this might result in development being done that more directly addresses frequently recurring player issues
linkagei am not sure if this helps but thats all can come up with
isnt this what the csm is for why have a dog and bark yourself
wow you are telling the gms that they are wrongthe petition system is not so players can have interaction with the developers it is so that players that need support with the game can get help billing issues stuck reimbursement etc etcif you have a issue then there is ideas forums and other sections for whatever you would like to bring up with the communitywhile a direct pipeline from consumer to developer would be awesome it is wholly impossible due to the vast number of consumers and miniscule number of developers
then lets see here are my thoughtsbreaking into a secure can has three parts1 time secure cans have a 5 minute hack time for every rank past the first in hacking reduce that time by one minute2 hacking a can makes the hacker blink red to the owner of the can player corp or alliance3 the players being hacked get kill rights for a term of eight hours not to heavy handed and the thief can escape please note that i believe that being offline should stop or slow that clock so that they can not just escape
sounds fair enough
i can support that if they train to hack my secure can they can even put it in their cargo
i might not go that far but gaining access to the ore would be good the other benefit that i found was that if a lowsec or 00 mining op is taken out then the aggressors can get an extra prizeinstead of having to blast away at the can for hours on end they can hack the can and grab the goods this means there may be more incentive for disrupting operations or for people to set traps for the potential attackers 
not only that it is not arqueable in rp content to unlearn skills its imho also way too much work for little benefit
the arguement that this does not make sense in roleplay terms is completely irrelevant our characters live in a universe where their consciousness can be teleported hundreds of light years away instantly with no damage to the host or destination clonesin this case the neural network in the brain as it is so well mapped out could be scrambled in certain areas to make way for new neural pathways since these neurons already have some charge the relearning process could easily achieve the 50 marker i described while a new skill is learneddoing this would make character buying more palatable as you could unlearn a few skills you didnt want in order to boost your learning in other skills you want more im not saying that it wouldnt take some effort but given the skill system as it is these minor tweaks shouldnt take too much programming effort
i support the idea of a skill capacitor of 12 days
no i dont want them to leave lowsec i want some way to tackle them  any way we could get a second module for a hic that would throw up a weaker bubble that could be used in lowsec but that would only effect things the size of a mom or bigger likewise a new kind of probe for regular dictorsif people are going to use these things in lowsec there should be some risk to it yes i know one or two have been killed in lowsec but stupidity shouldnt be the only reason one ever dies
maybe we could make a some sort of script for the hic bubble so it only points a single ship overriding supercapitals ewar immunity and can be used in lowsec
thatd work too i dont know if introducing a new script would be easier for the devs or not if so its probably a better solution since you wouldnt have to have two mods for your hic i just think there should be some way of tackling these if theyre going to be used in lowsec
you can already scramble supercaps in lowsec by using the focus scripts for the hic
aw sweet didnt know that thanks ill pass it along
hmmm i thought it was a good idea as well so i just msned my dev friends and they posted a new devblog expect to see the script on the market very soon indeed cool eh
well the sad part is that i build and sell the damn things never really looked at flying one
i wrote this up on another forum and was asked to provide it here regarding more indepth tutorials yes i agree with that particular aspect to a point far more information is obtained via metagaming out of game tutorials older players etc than the tutorial provides a basic x tanks y way guide would do wondersthere should be a sort of guidance in the game that allows for a player to see the light ahead so to speak rather than just try an aim for iti like the sandbox idea where no one is shoehorned into any specific role but i think it is somewhat detrimental to just dump the new player into the gameworld without some sort of endview sounds odd but ill give you an example of what i think would be a great boost to the new player experiencesimulators yes simulators as in expand out the tutorial agents and have the players earn loyalty points with them that they can then spend on specific one time use datacards that provide the pilot a what could be for specific ships ie pilot gets moved to a controlled nogate system provided a mission that addresses the capabilities of a ship and provided said ship a liberal use of a system similar to jump cloning would work best to provide time limits on players and all thatthen diversify the cards out amongst different ship roles and develop missions in line with them to give new pilots a taste of a potential futurefor instance logistics ships interceptors stealth bombers etc etc dont allow them to impact the game but give them a chance to see what they may want to do in the futurethat sort of stuff is what gives players long term goalsregarding mission money making money making in eve should be skill point oriented not money invested oriented ie if i spend x time to get into a drake to chain lvl 3s or i spend x time to get into an interceptor there should be a relative payoff line that is more or less equal to the amount of training involved ie l3 fast pickup missions where the objective is to dodge getting obliterated by the enemy haul ass to an objective pick it up and deliver it in x timedunno how hard that would be to balance but yeah surging up to ravens to squirrel back down the pipe to get a ship of choice just feels like a clunky mechanicapolluon
i have posted a thread over on jita park for discussion and solutions to some issues that have become apparent over the past 4 months please take some time to have a read and if you have constructive thoughts or ideas or think ive missed something add to the discussion
sincerely i dont want any metagaming information in eve local chats and the buddy list which tells you who is onlineoffline specially your enemies are metagaming and these features must be removed from game asapthis would give us a sensation of playing in a more empty system although this is not true people are concerning that eve is getting crowded maybe the local chat is inducing people to that opinionit should also be renamed to system chat or something like that to get in line with constellation chatprobing would have to be revisited since it would become much more useful
well i just got feedback from our dear csm adminit would appear that they simply havent received all the minutes so either they simply havent been sent or theres a misunderstanding in how the minutes are handledeither way i have pushed for all minutes to be collected and zipped over to ccp we have also got green light to publish all chatlogs there so i will be collecting all the chat logs possible and they will be included for publishing on the websitethanks for making us aware of this bummer hopefully it will be corrected shortly
something apparantly went wrong in the communication as i did send off the minutes ill have them resent asap so expect them online in the next few days
youd think ccp would have yelled at somebody by now if they werent getting minutes oh well as long as it gets rectified
i agree with the last few replies aiding a war target should flag you being in an fw complex shouldnt though if they are sitting in an fw complex i think theres good odds that they will be flagged to you soonon the other hand i think it would be reasonable if attacking the npcs in a complex counted as aggression toward the allied militiaback to the first part  doesnt remote repping a wt or pirate flag the repper if not this sounds like a bug
signedi hate learning skills but im not stupid to stop training theman ideafirst set all old players learning skills to lvl 5 new players start with all learning skills set to 5second for those players who already trained learning skills give them some kind of sp wild cards which can be partiallytotally consumed to finish the training of hisher next skills this would also be a useful functionality for skill training time reimbursement petitionsthe amount of sp wild cards received depends on how much learning skill points were trained i dont have a good idea for a formula yet because when you start learning the learning skills you do it very slowly since your attributes are very low i ask for suggestions on how to calculate these sp wild cards any ideaps the objective is to remove the learning skills but make it fair to those who spent game time training something that didnt make them shoot faster or earn money quicker for lots of days the training of learning skills realy sux a lot no matter what one will say their existence is a terrible mistake and i do think more ppl would play eve if they dont have to train these skills to have a good character no one wants to compromise itself training these skills specially the advanced ones to lvl 5 you never know if youre gonna have to quit eve for some reallife problem you just want to have fun and learning skills are definitely no fun at all

good topic of discussion maybe the problem is not the pos warfare itself but the aliances size thousands of players in a single alliance means hundreds of capital ships fighting for sov what if alliances size were limited to a lower number of members i dont know maybe some problems happen just because there are too many players in a single alliance and so many players in eve dont like this and they still want to have the sensation of owning some space in 00 together with their friendssmall alliance mates
the purpose of this discussion is to come up with ideas or ideals that we would like to see from a csm the current interaction by csm members with players ranges from good to downright nonexistent i see a number of issues which ill try and state1 i think an ideal for the csm is for all members to represent and interact with all players and discuss issues brought forth on the merits of the issue this is via the forums in meetings and with other csm members outside of meetings via ingame channel mailing listprivate forum etccurrently from posting histories this area has been poor for many members discussion of issues outside of meetings has been limited with some members seemingly just showing for meetings when requiredplayers may try to justify this behavior as beyond the control of the csm blaming tools available we have all heard the poor forum arguments etc i dont buy these excuses really some members and alternates and interested players have excellent thread discussions and interaction you make imo the best possible use of the resources available till better comes along2 as expected some csm members have personal or alliance agendas which may be just to occupy a spot to stop others doing so and cant look beyond these to serve the best interests of the majority of players to a degree voters are to blame for this however different viewpoints are essential to meaningful discussion so this should enrich the ideas and solutions that the csm puts forward by this i mean solutions will take account of different facets of play and play style so that the best interests of the majority are met good issues and ideas would stem forth from meaningful dialogue bad ideas and issues might not make it to the agenda at least discussion prior to meetings would give an issue proposer a good idea of where csm members stood and could adjust the solution to take account of other perspectives it would also probably make meetings run a little faster and smoothera solution to involvement of csm members in discussions is holding regular discussion meetings with major issues or topics on a list for discussion these meetings would help clarify a particular problem many issues that make it onto current agendas have poorly defined problems or are too broad hence fail to be escalated proposed solutions or new ideas could also be developed in these meetings3 meetings especially of late seem to have been a little infrequent hence make held meetings longer this may be a product of some csm members bringing poor issues to the agenda pursuing their own agendas and disregarding the wider player issues for the sake of their own bugs tweaks and ship rebalancing issues also fill the agenda this makes for long meetings tests endurance and generally sees many issues fail to get escalated cntd
id propose that the next csm holds weekly meetings with at least one being a discussion meeting per month the dates and times of course all published at the start of a csm tenure 4 how does the csm interact and reach out to the majority of players that dont use the forumsi come across these players every day many dont even know the forums exist some are 3 yr old characters now a good chunk of the eve players just dont care about the csm or forums they just play the game however i cant for one minute entertain the idea that those that care or could care all visit the forumswhat other methods can a csm use to reach these playersanyway post away try and be constructive your ideas and suggestions to improve these areas if ive missed something please be sure to add it i firmly believe that the csm can be an effective voice for the players and its not just a publicity stunt by ccpi also firmly believe that being a member of the csm is a privilege and carries with it a responsibility to serve the players not just the voters that elected a member if you run and dont really participate you miss an opportunity to make a difference if you dont believe that then i believe you shouldnt be on the csmtake carearithron bruce hansen
i agree
much as it may occasionally seem otherwise this is not a kafkaesque bureaucracy that likes to make a secret of the fact that something is secret the nda is publicly known and discussions around it are not privileged to the best of my knowledge this might not be the most effective medium to ask the question but its not as immoral an act as you seem to be suggesting and the idea that hes asking this question as part of a reelection bid is just silly  who makes a point of voting for someone robust in the public defence of the nda its probably a good thing that he does it but i cant see it swinging even one vote
even by your standards this post was poorly thought out and completely out of hand guess the glimmers gone that would explain why eva had to step up and assume your role for you its cool dude we all get tired of our toys at some point and look for new ones
oh the ironyis it not you who has taken any chance possible to make me look bad over the last month or so talk about crusadethe csm is supposed to be as transparent as possible limiting the actual use of the mailing list is only positive as i see itwhy would i be fuzzed about the alts turning up or not i would like to see as many people as possible turn up but i got confused from the op post and asked the question rather than somebody getting in trouble because somebody made a mistake
your delusional if you think anything you put on the internet is private
jade lavista you both got my vote if i had one request of you it would be that you try not to make my choice look like a mistake
any idea when ccp will post their responses for meeting 2
again as many years back in suggestion forum i support thisposs needs more work
i prefer to call mine racial commenthuggeralso i agree with both the nano nerf and that minmatar ships in general need a review espeically artillery
what are the strengths of all the other minmatar ships speed speed and a little more speed what bonuses do their carriers get shield transfer how about some speed bonuses on fighterswhat bonuses do their dreads get a split weapons system that requires more training than any other race because the minmatar ships not only have to be kept together with duct tape but they also have to have a clumsy multiple weapon type setup bonuses only for projectiles are in order
is there a csm or someone that can let us know if anything is going on about this at least a update there are many post about this date and that date we will know everyday i come on and look and nothing i have a minny dread and it is all battle ready but the torps i would like to know if i need to train them or not thank you for your help
please
nice ideaperhaps a way for corporations to help there mebers set up there overviews for fleet combat
im for the nano nerf but it should be a lot bigger i want to wtfbbq solo everything in my raven with cruise missiles
speed is fine infact its more fun using skill to fly your ship instead of just stting there to see who can last the longiest but that can be fun to
just an additional ideawhen will the train time of the skill be indepandant of your jclone you are currently in i think the medical clone has to be leading most players have their finest and most expensive implantsetc plugged into their medical when jcloning into a nonimplant clone i think the training time must be based on the med clone unless the jclone has better implants just an idea 
1skilldeep queuethats it no minigames no complex rules almost no programming no beta testing no need to figure the mechanics behind it no long talksimplement it already
i would prefer to see a cooldown period aplied to each clone so that you can only jump to a clone if it has not been jumped to in the last 24 hours so if you had 3 clones you can jump from clone 1 to clone 2 then you can jump to clone 3 but not back to number 1 until the 24 hour cooldown period has expired but other than that a skill to reduce time would be nice
i would love that skill if it allowed multiple jumps within 24 hours wouldnt use it if it just decreased the wait time i probably would use my jump clones a lot more than i currently do not sure if that is a good thing or not

how often does a 1 man corp get wardeccedunless your a very well known mission runner or your really ed someone off youll still have uninterrupted pve combat
i agree that some people will be forced out of npc corps due to tax increases but the flame wars would be insane if this went through that and it wouldnt affect most members macroers dont pay taxes nor do lowsec pvpersi remain in npc corps to help new players out and i should be penalized for that yes i do run missions only because killing bits of data relieves stress after a hard day of workother penalties could easily be applied such as skill or ship limitations but even those would be incendiary if its not broken dont fix it
oh really so being in a npc corp will protect you from ninja salvagers loot thieves and suicide ganking
if you are a high sec player there is very little reason to join a player corp currently increased risk can be wardecddecreased profit if corp has taxand you still cant shoot salvagers stealin your loot and thanks to concord changes you are far less likely to get ganked although being in a player corp or npc corp has no effect on the probability of you getting suicide ganked npc corps are broken is because they break the risk reward model of eve that should be followed people making 1 man corps to get around this is fine you can still play solo and get around the tax but if someone thinks you are a farmer they can wardec you and go after you keep in mind if you are in highsec it is extremely unlikely you will use a pos and sure corp wallet and hangers are a handy tool but are hardly worth the added risk for highsec play essentially i think veteran players in npc corps should have to pay more for the additional protection they recieve from wardec mechanics
tax is only one weapon that npc corps could be nerfed with others includelimited flyable shipsno freighters or bslimited markettradecontractual transaction typessizeslimited duration of stayplayers older than x months kicked to fwagent access restricted
both from an rp and balance view npc corps should be taxing people something i saw several people ask what are my rewards really really obvious it is the very reason you dont want to be in a player corp you cant be war decd
you want the reason why a lot of people dont want to enter players corporationsyou and the people like you trying to impose your view of the game to all the others people
it is not imposing numnuts just because you lose 10 of your profits you omg have just have to leave an npc corp you arent supposed to stay in an npc corp forever god forbid we want peopl eto work together in an mmorpg yeah i also hate the people who tell others to shoot people in bf2142 those jerks are just imposing their will on mehere is proofnpc corporations are not meant for human players the only time you are allowed or intended to be part of an npc corporation is when you leave a player corp in which case the npc corporation acts as a placeholder until you find a new one no requests for positions in npc corporations are accepted and you should thus focus your efforts on finding a player corporation instead
as a member of a roleplaying alliance i am continually frustrated that we are completely excluded from joining in with fw when you right down to it this war is the reason why the ushrakhan exists and we waited years for it to come aboutwhile i appreciate that pretty much noone wants to see bobgoonswhomever storming in with hundreds of pilots just for the lulz of ganking everything that moves on a free war dec there are many long standing rp based alliances that should be able to participateat present there are only three options available to alliances that want to take part1 war dec fw corps this is expensive restrictive and alliance members still cannot help to secure territory as most fw corps have smallmid sized member counts so the number of targets tends to be limited and the target probably feels griefed as well it is also not very good from an rp point of view why can i shoot this corp but none of the others who are guilty of the same crimes against my racewe ran a two week campaign doing this and found it highly costly and after the first week frustratingly limited you are unable to assist outside of your alliance effectively and run a high risk of getting concorded while trying to help2 rotate corps out to fw we have had a few corps rotate out of the alliance to fight in fw while everyone else pursued other goals those that left began to feel distanced from the alliance while the main body is impacted by the loss of man power while corps can move between the two theatres of operation it leads to disjointed game play and is disruptive to the community3 disband the alliance this simply is not acceptable a good alliance is more than a mere chat channel it is an identity which becomes an identifiable entity with a personality reputation and history disbanding to join fw simply means that you are left with a bunch of corps you lose the cohesion and cease to be something more you are simply one of many corpsa good alliance is more than the sum of its member corps corporations can come and go but the alliance persists and retains community that community is more valuable than a game mechanic and that is why rp alliances have not disbanded and do not want to disband it is the community that has kept my interest in eve for over 4 years now it is the people around me that make the game fun over such a time span but we are an rp alliance and we want the option to do what we were created to do to fight for our factioni think that there is quite a simple solution to this and it should allow for rp groups to get in while keeping out most of the groups who are not interested in the rp behind fw introduce and alliance standing for factions based on an average of all member corps faction standings set a minimum faction standing required for the alliance to enter fw set it high set it high enough that the vast majority of alliances simply wont hit it make it high enough that in order for an alliance to get in they will have to show a tight focus on supporting that faction most alliances will have members from all over the place diluting their averages if it is hard enough to maintain this high level then most groups simply wont bother grinding out the missions unless they are seriously committed to achieving it allow the alliance executor to select which faction their alliance shall support and only then may the corps within the alliance opt to join fw but only allow corps within an alliance to join that one faction and then we will not see an alliance with corps on both sides of the conflicti first proposed the concept herethere has already been some discussion on it so we have some additional insights worth consideringcont
disparity of rp alliancesit was pointed out that there is not an even spread of rp alliances across the factions the minmataramarr factions have several each while the caldari has no well known rp alliance i would argue that in the current form of fw we are unlikely to ever see new rp alliances forming if anything we will see their declinewe are now in a time where the rp support from ccp and the direction of the rp conflict is dominated by fw that is where the war is by definition of prime fiction anything else is ultimately a side show in truth there is little slave trade in 00 for the ushrakhan to fight amarrian reclaiming is dominated by the upstart slave population of the republic conquered caldari prime is in high sec and the provists march there why would any rp group knowingly form an alliance that excludes them from the meat of the rp they wouldnt so they wont we may see some rpbased industrial alliances form but they wont be joining fw directly anyway they will be about building not fighting but if it is possible for fw corps to organise themselves and to share an identity without losing the right to support their faction then i think we may yet see a caldari rp alliance rise from the masses and forge a community and it is community that is the life blood of eve and then then there will be competitionhow high a standing is highi initially proposed a stupidly high number of 50 standing average of all corps within the alliance as bar to entry this was ofc picked out of thin air to illustrate the point  that the figure must be high and must be hard to achieve what is moree it must stay high in order to prevent the doomsday scenario of a thousand bored 00 vets pouring into fw and breaking the whole damn thing  just because they canlet us look at some figures i have picked four alliances and worked out what their averages would be towards their closest faction of the four empires currently in fw i only totalled up the one faction for ushra and cva as rp alliances they are only ever going to back the one the ushrakhanmember corps 11total member count 384average members per corp 349best standing average  115 republiccvamember corps 20total member count 943average members per corp 346best standing average  294against all authoritiesmember corps 13total member count 1945average members per corp 1295best standing average  103 caldarigoonswarmmember corps first 18 counted my soul died trying to count them all 87total member count 6329 851 in countaverage members per corp 773best standing average  036 caldariso the best result returned is for the cva where all corps have a positive amarrian standing all but one being above 15 even then the average is only 294 our sample 00 heavy weights result with standings heavily dispersed across their member basehow to screw with the systemthe ushrakhan results bear further analysis and arguably indicate the best method to screw with this system we have one corp in the alliance with just 2 members and a horrid minmatar standing of 533 if this corp were removed our standing rises from 115 to 163 that suggests that the way to game this mechanic is to form a bunch of 1 man corps each containing a single mission runner with high standings you can then artificially bump your average standingssomething else to consider in the ushrakhan standings is that our corps which are currently outside of the alliance on fw duty would come home so our revised averages would look like this without removing our 2 man caldari corpthe ushrakhanmember corps 13total member count 465average members per corp 422best standing average  169 republiccont
even this may surprise some as being rather low for an rp alliance well when you consider that we have been based in 00 for as long as we have then you might consider that there are surprisingly few republic agents in providence as most of our pilots live in 00 space they are not running many missions this will also bear true for most 00 alliances out there their standings remain what they were before their pilots moved out of empire and are not notably improving bob for example are not likely to stop all that warring for a month to go grind their standings are they the solutionthis could well be a bit contentious but i think the solution would be to exclude small corps from the standings average say any corp with fewer than 5 members while you could still attempt to game it the task becomes harder as you need to pool a significant number of high standings characters together into one corp the most likely source of characters to do this would be mission alts and how many people will want to place those alts into the main alliance like this they are usually kept apart in order to mission  in safety they would lose a degree of that by becoming embroiled in fwin summaryyou may be wondering why i am pointing out the achilles heel of the plan and suggesting minimum standings that are well above my alliances averages it is because i do not want to see fw laid waste by joy riding gankers i want it to be available to those who genuinely care about the roleplay element without unleashing massive imbalance and i want to find the flaws and solutions before it is too latei think that this system would be straightforward and only be used by the alliances that are genuinely behind one faction and interested in the storyline of eve and fw grinding standings to such a high level would simply not be worth while for anyone else and only the most dedicated of griefers would bother to try exploiting the system even then their numbers should be small as shifting the standings of large alliances is going to be impractical if the group is relatively small then their impact is much reduced anyway it would seem more realistic for these groups to just rock on up as individual corps and skip the grinding entirely in that case the present system allows for them to do that anywaythere will always be a flaw to any system the trick is to minimise it fw at present is not what it should be or all of what it can be there is a place for alliances in this system and it has been the greatest disappointment of all my time in eve as a committed rper to be so excluded from fw after waiting so long for it to come aboutthe roleplay community has had a raw deal for a long time there is no event program any more and even fw has been denied to many of us the future of rp is locked into fw and we are locked out there are solutions but the present reality is far from it please give this concept some consideration and thank you for taking the time to read all that 
i ofc meant to put a link in there the original suggestion was posted hereideas forum
believe me ugleb i have strongly argued for this from almost day one of my csm term i argued it across the table in iceland and ive managed to get two separate csm issues on the subject voted through the council and sent to ccp urging this to happen to my eyes its a clear and necessary change and i think its of the utmost importance to the success of fw and roleplay consequence in eve online that this happens sooner rather than later be assured ill be saying as much again in iceland at fanfest and am very much with you 100 on thismy only concern  is that by making it standings dependent rather than simply allowing alliance corps to join fw by clicking join is that it will involve additional programming and ensure this will not happen for 69 months rather than the by the next patch that could conceivably be accomplished just by removing the existing code switch barring alliance corps from affiliation
nice job ugleb pretty clear
while we all want it fixed quickly i do not see ccp simply flicking the fabled switch and risking opening the flood gates there are genuine concerns on the issue out there even if they are probably overstatedwhile my programming knowledge is based more on mythology than science i wouldnt have thought that this would be a complicated thing to implement so could be with us within a reasonable time frame ofc pigs might travel by jump drive for all i know
well said ugleb
your post is well thought out and presented and i respect how frustrating it is not to be able to participate in something that seems tailor made for rpi still have the same concerns about it that i did when you presented it in fiif you let these established 00 alliances in fw will immediately become a rp war between them everyone else will end up marginalized do we really want to see hotdrops fleets being bridged in and capital fights at the entrances to minor fw plexes if you do this everyone other than the major players might just as well pack up and go home because they will instantly be irrelevant to the outcome and they willonce again there is every rp reason to do it it makes perfect sense and yes it does suck for the established rp powers the only reason not to do it is that it will totally step on the notion that fw is entry level pvp for people get started with and learnive been flying with some fw fleets for a couple of weeks now yeah theyre very inexperienced from the fcs on down but many of the people flying in them never strapped a pvp fit on a ship before fw if they get marginalized and end up cannon fodder my concern is that theyll just go back to farming missions and forget about pvpthere needs to be something other than capital ship dominated bigblob warfare in the game fw has been that but it almost surely wont be if this goes through
i think that is where the fw concept started to go wrong tbh turning the rp scene into pvp with training wheels was and is an utter slap in the face to the players who have been behind the rp scene since day one moving on from that however i get your concern over capital ship blobs however we already have a star fraction titan based in black rise i have already seen several engagements containing multiple militia capitals in the field capital ships are firmly part of eve warfare and they are not the sole preserve of 00 alliances the ushrakhan is the largest prominmatar alliance in eve today and if you look again at our member count we will not be bringing capitals by the score to camp plexes cva have a whole lot more than us but given their member count being triple the size of ours they will find it difficult to get into fw under this system so would we and everyone else likely to come would be smaller than useven without us capital ships and more so blobs are a problem for the game designers to take on one they have recognised and militia activity levels are in decline globally i think the most likely impact of alliances is a more rapid response gang mustering and a resurgence in the systems vigour
this i agree with completely im sure that if the rp community got involved plexing and the actual goals of fw would get far more play rather than it just being random pvp there would be a lot more plexing and a lot more attackingdefending of plexes because flipping those systems would matter a lot from a rp point of view whereas the bulk of the players currently playing dont rp and dont really careif the devs intent is that fw is a mechanic to support rpers then by all means they should let rpers in and the rpers should dominate it with whatever means they can bring to bear i didnt get that though it looked like their intent was to provide lowercommitment easier access pvp to those who are either too inexperienced or not hard core enough to want to sign up for 00 warfare and its 5 hour or more pos defense opsso i guess thats the question ccp whats this mechanic for how they answer that should determine how they respond to this issue
im in agreement with the op
i disagree i do empathyze with your situation and it is regrettable but allowing alliances to pursue both 00 and lowsec ambitions easily would give an unfair and distinct advantage to a certain entity and honestly ruin the spirit of factional warfare just look at the latest news star fraction unleash erebus class titan in black rise case in point the reason i dont like the minimum standings idea you proposed is because it too is easily fudged make a corp in the alliance with one person who has fantastic standings have everyone who wants to participate in fw join that corp and tell them not to run missions and viola imagine cva being able to partake while simultaneously reaping the benefits of 00 a paltry four jumps away  all while giving up nothing and making no sacrifices it is just too easily exploitable at the moment factional warfare is relatively devoid of pos warfare cap warfare and hellish blobs it would really be a shame to see fw turn into a plaything for the rp alliances i really mean no offense to uk you guys have been around and doing your thing for as long as ive played eve i dont think you guys would ruin fw but its eve  you know someone would itd just be a matter of time before an entity like goonswarm would say hey im bored lets go do fw with 300 people for the weekend and who could blame them the tools and mechanics would be in place for them to do it
this is what fw began as years ago the realisation of the storyline and rp driven conflicts a bridging between safe haven high sec and ruthless null sec at some point in development that is what fw became branded as in fact i could probably dig out the dev blog where that became apparent and i started to get seriously worried the problem is they also locked the rp content into fw so we cant just walk away from it it was the reason we founded these communities in the first place
ok lets see if i can sway you and clarify a bit heremy concept is based on an alliance average of all corp standings within the alliance if you total them all up and fall short of the set threshold average then no corps in that alliance may enter fw at allso you cannot simply create one corp with artificially high standings that meets the minimum to get slip people in the entire alliance must be up to scratchi also mentioned the possibility of excluding very small corps from the average so that you cannot create dummy corps containing a few mission alts to bump the alliance average half a dozen 1 man corps each with a 9 standing character would quickly screw with the numbers so exclude corps of say 5 or less members out the counting i think that the required standings should be high enough to exclude almost everyone forcing an alliance to earn their way in by sucking a long hard mission grindyou would not see the goons day tripping 300 members over to screw with fw for the weekend as their entire 87 corp 6500 man alliance would need to drag its standings up to a very high level do you think that this is likely they would have to chain thousands of players to empire mission agents for weeks if not months to achieve this they could be doing something far more fun like suicide ganking miners instead they could form a secondary alliance but that involve pulling corps and pilots out of the main alliance and grinding that up to high standings in which case it would be much easier to just have corps use the existing system and cut out the pve grind it should be unpalatable to any but the most committed who have a real and valid reason to go through all thissfs titan is already in black rise and it becomes no more efficient by being in a militia it could be in a militia now if jericho fraction dropped from sf and joined the militia directly it can jump bridge anyone in the same gang as it and grant its bonus abilities regardless of militia loyalties this is true of any capital the only tactical difference to the ships use is whether or not a gate gun will shoot at it for engaging a militia pilot hardly decisiveto put your 00 resources point into some context the amarr militia has rather good access to providence as it is held by the cva who want to see the amarrian militia succeed you dont have to be a huge alliance to access these resources just a well organised corp  and those are already allowed in fw
i dont think theres much question that youd be including highly motivated rp alliances and keeping others out once those alliances are in though they would surely dominate fw theyre just plain bigger older and more motivated than the corps and individuals who are engaging in fw now fw would then essentially come down to a struggle between the established rp powers those in the npc militia corps and the smattering of other small corps that are currently engaged in fw would end up basically sidelined watching the rp powers duke it outyoud also be de facto creating a weak sister faction since there isnt really a caldari rp alliance with the size and strength of those that represent the other three factions whod want to play for the caldari faction at all with the rules you are proposing youre basically trying to claim fw as the rp communitys content your rules would make the existing rp alliances the power players while keeping the more powerful 00 alliances outif ccps intention was or is for fw to be rp content for rpers then i think its fine and it was a mistake for them to exclude you to begin with if their intent was for it to be a fun low commitment pvp content for pvp novices i think doing this would be a huge mistake it really comes down to what ccps intentions for fw are i guess youll find out soon enough as jade seems hell bent to promote this to them regardless of what the community feedback may be i fully support you having your day in court as it were lets see what ccp wants to do with it
i am of course 100 in support of any plan to give rp alliances access to fwif access is determined based on alliancelevel settings however i think that the mechanic needs to be that if the alliance chooses to align with a particular militia it should automatically force every corp in the alliance to be enlisted in the militia including industrylogistics specialists in a normal wardec those corps would be vulnerable to enemies and it should be similar hereas to concerns about gaming the standings the solution seems obvious to me instead of using an average of each corps standings simply use a weighted average a twoman corp with a 100 in an alliance with a thousandman corp with a 01 results in 1002  0110001002  012 simple alternatively just do a straight average of the standings of every alliance member
i suppose i did miss part of your standings plan and i do agree that that would sufficiently eliminate foul play there would still be workaround yes but it would be needlessly difficult still i think it sets a very dangerous precident by allowing entities to follow 00 aspirations lets face it having an alliance is practically required to live in 00 and fw simultaneously the current system is heavyhanded i agree but it doesnt totally eliminate the possibility of rp alliances tinkering in fw again star fraction are showing that they do as you pointed out have a titan in black rise and can jump bridge people around but since they are not in the militia their ability to communicate is hampered their ability to see potential targets is clouded and they have to either pay for wars or take sec hits they are paying the price both literally and figuratively for remaining an alliance who can  even though they dont  maintain 00 sovereignty and highvalue moons they could choose to leave their alliance and have a placeholder alliance keep it active but they havent and they havent done that for a reason i dont know precisely what that reason is but they obviously value it quite a loti guess my point is why would you risk breaking what exists when getting around it is easy in your case your member corps would be required to leave the uk alliance as you mentioned an alliance is far more than a chat channel  but its also far more than a name you apparently want to jump through hoops purely for semantics if you allow alliances into fw you open to door to these potential abuses im not saying you will abuse it or sf will abuse it or bob will abuse it what im saying is there will be the possibility for abuses needlessly
where to startccp makes the same amount regardless of how much isk you pay for a gtc the price in real currency is set by themim not sure that bringing back the other denominations would help anything at the end of the day it all comes down to how cheap does isk need to be in real currency before people are willing to buy iti doubt very seriously that anything like 50 of the player base is paying for their play time with isk have you seen that statistic somewhereif its starting to feel more like a job than a hobby maybe you dont need 4 accountsi dont want to sound like a cheerleader here but i think its really cool that ccp allows time rich cash poor players to pay for their play time with isk and time poor cash rich players to pay for isk with money in a way that doesnt break the eula if they tried to fix prices what youd find is that demand would go down and youd have trouble finding someone to sell you a gtc for isk at all the communists tried the price fixing thing it didnt work out so well lead to empty stores and long lines to buy toilet paperthere is a price at which those who sell gtcs will run into resistance and find no buyers the market will determine that price not much ccp can do about it other than make isk more scarce which would have serious ingame side effects
its ok with whats happening in real life eve might soon shutdown i mean ammercas major bank has gone bust all airports are going bust all prices are still increasing less and less jobs are happening so sooner or later the whole world will be affect buy this wich it will happen soon and then eve among other things will shutdown because no money so enjoy eve before there is no eve dbut yea it needs to be sorrted eve have made the worst decision ever on this
exactly this
i just checked 60 day gtc are at 650 million atmalthough this is expensive i think what the post was about is that it cost more to buy a 60 day gtc then it does to pay monthly since i last checkedbut i dont think ccp should make someone only get 400 million for a 60 gtc its supply and damand
in factional warfare there are systems to fight over for those who are not well acquainted with this heres how it goes down a pilot scans a system with the onboard scanner until a complex appears complexes are not always there and sometimes there are several and then you fly into the complex there are four different sized ones and there are npcs there if you are defending a system the npcs help if you are conquering a system the npcs attack you while there you have to be withing range of a button which starts a countdown timer for anywhere between 15minutes and an hour after capturing enough of these complexes the system becomes vulnerable and you attack a bunker and the system is yours i havent done the appropriate legwork but it seems like one needs to capture about 20 of these complexes mind you if someone from the opposing militia finds a complex and defends it its one more complex that you have capture as the attacker basically its a pain in the ass surely there must be some reward for this right wrong there is no reward not even a minor one i actually benefit by not running the complexes because they are shiplimiting arenas that people can fight in so my idea a militia member cannot dock in a system with hostile occupancy it would give a tangible benefit to occupancy and it wouldnt be entirely crippling or if that is too severe then replace cannot dock with cannot use services
cannot dock is right the faction should reward the capsuleer privateers for securing the system too in isk and war booty there should also be an endgame where after a faction secures a certain percentage of the contestable systems the other faction is forced to capitulate with antoher big payoff for the players in the winning faction and the whole thing resets starts againthis would make it fun and give it urgency and a sense of accomplishment im sure ccp is gunshy about doing it though because its exploitable and there are certain entities in the game who wouldnt be above exploiting it and are big enough to do itas it sits its just a license to pvp in low sec without having to pay for a wardec or take sec hits yawn
i endorse this idea because it is goodseriously lets get some kind of reward going for capturing systems npcs sitting in plexes shooting people that go in them is not a reward to be spoken of npcs sitting on the gates maybe better but still pretty lame and kinda defeats the purpose of lowsec a nonpatrolled area
this
235 hr would be enough too
i already promised i will be submitting an issue about thisill try and make it for this weeks meeting
dolby surround sound
eveonline is the only game i play with the sound turned off if you are going to have sound give me a reason for turning it on for most other games it gives you an audio prompt that something is about to go wrong ie you are about to be attacked something is happening in case you didnt see it if not changing the music to something more appropriate for a battle theres a bit of a disconnect when im in a massive battle and the music in the background sounds like something i should be meditating to
jbs already make it too easy to move around large areas of space we do not need more of them
what we need is less boring pos stuffsupporting everything which gives better chance of developing eve
how about0 per system
jbs increase blob warfare remove jbs from game
how abouttwo jb max in systemsconstellation capitals get an additional one to connect to another constellationonly constellation capitals can connect to another constellationthis would make the jb rings interconnected rings instead of complex webs
so i remember reading a thread about missioning loot and tech 1 market i just wanted to say the same goes for ratting i am a ratter but i also have a background from mining and simple production and i think the wast amount of loot dropped even though its nice for me now is making it really hard on people who want industrial career as miner or producersat the moment loot is also totally not logical you can get the strangest loot from npcs which does not reflect what they really had on their ship kinda like world of warcraftso here is what i suggest remove some or all of the loot and replace it with insert random new item used for some new industry or increase bounty for rats or make it so that you gain some sort of loyalty point with someone for every killnow ratting feels like mining because you get so much loot you can refine
just a friendly bumpi didnt expect to get a small dialogue going on here about this ideaif ccp can make aggro timers work for players then there should be a timer for cargo cans and wrecksright next to the name it seriously shouldnt be that hard to do
from jita parkall the cans already have a timer running on the server so if the retrieval of that information took more than a simple rollover it wouldnt be a lagfest perhaps the timer would be on the info screenyour computer already is making a call for the information attached to that can might as well pull the despawn time with it it wouldnt take much to then turn that into a countdown timer based on the difference between the current time and the despawn time so the lag would not be very different than the slight lag already associated with pulling up the info on the can
so noted but tracking wrecks is still not something that would be too helpful in that situationbut if such a thing is already implemented but just hidden then so be itmore power to yah guysyou got my vote
bad ju juffs we already have an alliance fielding a titan to try to control the outcome of a war thats mainly being fought by people who are new to the game or at least so new to pvp that they really have no clue how to fit a ship theres a whole big galaxy out there for endgame pvp fw was supposed to be entrylevel pvp ccp follow your initial instinct and keep 00 epeen out of it its clear that if you open this gate the folks out there just trying to fit an entry level cruiser and have some fun will be completely overshadowed by 00 politics and power playsi understand and respect that the established factional powers who rp out there in 00 feel like they are entitled to get in on the fw action but there really isnt any way to do that without them simply taking over and pushing the little guys out if that wasnt clear before we had an erebus out there providing logistical support for noob plexing gangs its damn sure clear now
its not all about experience level yeah some pvp corps from 00 signed up and played for a while they got tired of tooeasy ganks and leftthats a different kettle of fish from having cva and ushra and star fraction being able to sign up if that happens fw is going to become all about a war between those established players everyone else will end up marginalized especially those fighting for caldari for whom there is no sizable established rp alliancealliance doesnt necessarily mean big and powerful but once again we do have an erebus being fielded by one of the entities that is pushing this change hardest something tells me that when the established players show up they wont be showing up with cruisers and frigs there is every rp reason in the world why this change should happen the only reason it shouldnt happen is because fw was supposed to be about entrylevel pvp if it becomes 00 lite which it will if this goes through thats pretty much out the window a player just trying to learn to pvp will end up just as much cannon fodder in fw as they would by just moving to 00 jade et al will get to wave their epeen and be big fish in a little pond but thats not what fw was supposed to be for

to much power for the super alliancessuper alliances will have to much influance and it will end up with alliance v alliance instead of faction v faction and the smaller players will get overwelmed by blobs
first the existing version of fw has seen every ship up to motherships in use by corps in fw and im fairly sure that the only thing that has prevented titans from being prominant players is the perception true or not that they arent useful in lowsec combat further ive seen militia battles with significant numbers of capital ships on both sides as well this issue has nothing to due with alliance vs corp as a unit of entry into fwsecond the size limit for entry into complexes provides a natural limit to the usefulness of large ships whether they are capital ships or even battleshipsthird the lack of rewards provides a limit to the attractiveness of fw for the big powerhouse nullsec alliances or even smaller alliances that dont have an rp reason for involvementfourth look at the size number of members of say ushrakhan then look at the size of the minmatar militia if you are concerned that ushrakhan will somehow dominate a group of pilots ten times our number then i think thats more an indictment of the militia than of the concept of alliances entering fwlast regarding the concern that if alliances like cva and uk were to join then fw would become all about the war between them  youve got this exactly opposite of the truth ccp created in their backstory the war slavers and enslaved and uk has been fighting that war for years with no support from game mechanics that same war has been given mechanics now and ccp has written us out of the storyline its not that theres a risk of the militia being drawn into some proxy war its that ccp has evicted us from the rp war weve been fighting for years
get rid of bacon and others like it
signed
they need to just get rid of local and yeah anything that looks like local or works like local dont stop with this third party addon though get rid of it completely you have whole classes of ships in the game that are supposed to be stealthy but they arent because of they all powerful eye of local
 follow your logic a bit further what is one very common reason players need support things are broken perhaps or not working as intendedand if you have to post bugs and possible exploits to the forums that may have effected game play it doesnt make a whole log of sense  and if the development team does not receive input from the petition system where many problems with the game undoubtedly get noted  it doesnt make a lot of sense
bugs and exploits already have a good system there are bug reports you send to ccp and you can tell ccp of exploits via the petition systemim not sure how to explain this to you but for example if you feel that ninja salvaging is broken then that is your opinion it is ccps game and they make the rules if you feel it is broken then use the ah or any of the forum sections just because a lot of people petition something saying it is broken doesnt mean it should be changedthe forums are a great tool in which ccp uses to receive constructive feedback a petition system that people would just spam whines in would not be productive and would take resources away from people who are actually having critical gameplay issues preventing them from playing the game properly
we need new aggression mechanics for out side of stations to force pilots to commit to fighting and prevent docking gamesget ride of the 1 minute aggression timer that we have now as ships are stronger and can tank for alot longerwhat i propose while you are at a station you are under its protection and may dock at any time with in the boundarys of the session timer if you commit an act of aggression you are not allowed to dock simple as as the station wishies to keep the fight out side its docking bay does not matter if you are at war pirate or casual ganker the rule applies to allif you warp away from station it will forget who you are and when you return your be allowed to dock
for some reason the option to copy a linked url from chat was removed i found it very handy to copy a linked killboard url to have a look on the kill or other links posted by alliance mates it was a very nice feature i wrote a petition about the missing of the copy url option and got an answer that it was removed with the last patch no reason was specified i find this feature was useful and must be brought back since now it is a bit complicated u have first to delete the text from the copy to get the actual link bring back copy url otpion
already fixed internally going to be in one of the next patches read up on an issue before you throw it around for voting

dumb ideaunless of course i got the skillbook returned to me and automatically unlearned the skillthen it might actually be usefull when im brokeotherwise crap
while your getting your head in the clouds and flapping your gums did it occur to you that when you unlearn a skill that the said skill could cause a chain reaciton and invalidate a skill you learned down the line oops guess you didnt think about that one did youthats just the tip of the icebergdont make assumptions or begin to guess at what kind of trouble this would cause in the programming field i seriously doubt your even capable of comprehending logistical structure let alone algorithmic methodologyas ive said many times in my field its one thing to come up with an idea its a whole different matter to implement that ideawhat you are asking for is a can of worms that im very sure ccp is not interested in getting intoyour asking for fluff and its going to end up suggestionidea number 10000sorry but there are far more important things to look intoall i see here is a poor excuse to speed up training and you obviously took a wrong routepatheven if you came up with a good way of implementing the solution you have to deal with the glitches and chain reactions of said actions that could really cause hell on the developershence why its getting ignored for now anywayas i cant pretend to understand how the system runsbut i do know this much its never as simple as people love to pretend it is
this must have been proposed before but seeing as i cant find it here goeschange the local chat settings to have the option to remove portraits and just have the name of the characterthis would have the benefit of increasing the amount of viewable players in local without having to scroll updown all the time
was suggested for the first meeting indeed
one of the best few ideas in last month
wellheh
an interesting idea but the natural way to implement this is via making singularity skills be editable by players as many have suggested in past
at the risk of offering kind of odd advice why dont groups like suddenly ninjas simply establish a policy of courtesy and work in tandem with mission runnersif theyre jerks you can still do the ninja thing if theyre courteous then you can work out an equitable business arrangement going in and starting work without even the courtesy of a convo is going to frequently get someones back up even if theyre ordinarily a nice person it would mine but if someone came in and asked politely if they could do the salvaging for a reasonable cut say 50 or something i might very well not only let them do it but let them know when im running the next mission and gang them so they can come alongloot and salvage is boring and a lot of mission runners would love to have that service as long as they were still getting a cut of what they see as theirs regardless of ccps designationa few such equitable arrangements and everyone runner and salvage crew alike will both benefit and make even more isk as well as probably enjoying the game more and making some friendsradical concept i know but i thought id throw it out there
x the ninja salvager should be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because the mission runner owns the wrecks and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamic  the ninja salvager should not be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because i support ccps current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecksif they can take something you worked to get you should at least be able to shoot at them why can they salvage and not loot if anything this becomes the same as ore thievery which is to say im going to  you off so you attack me then i will get my big ship and friends to gank you benefits everyone
i didnt tell them what to train i simply gave them a better frigate some weapons and let them go after a few days the inevitable question arises how do i train faster i then explain the learning skills evemon and implants and things go downhill from there
this morning my itunes started downloading a new ted video its an awesome place for finding interesting talksthis morning i received a speech about the moral mind i was watching it on the train on my way to school and i thought i had to share thisyou can find it here watch it right awayi found that it was extremely interesting from the perspective of csm it describes the exact problem which the csm has  lack of cooperationtheres 2 parts to this speech which you should take note of1 moral purity  the battle against good and evil he talks about stepping out of the moral matrix which i think fits quite well theres no right and wrong 2 cooperation  making the csm cooperate for making the world a better place he shows an interesting concept of how punishment increases cooperation theres a nice slide around 1100 into the video please note that im not justifying punishment in the csmyou can easily identify certain people from the csm in this speechthe opposite of offense intended it just goes to show that the csm is no different from the real world so we arent doomed at allnow that you have watched the video i will let you make up your own mind but i will make these points which i think we should discuss1 csm members should be pushed by the community to represent them while contributing with their own experience2 by giving the csm incentive to work together the csm can be taken to the next level is this so you think can we achieve progress in the concept of csm by stepping out of the moral matrixes and be encouraged to cooperate
puff puff give
ted is great and all  bert rutans speech from 2006 is one of my favourites in a long time  but im not wholly sure of the applicability of this one assuming you dont intend to poll csm members on their political inclinations about the only piece of actionable information is that punishment for antisociability yields more sociable behaviour and unless you intend to declare war on the goons to punish darius for not posting on the forums more often thats not especially practical and the one member whom indirect punishment has been tried on  jade  has proven wholly impervious to that pressure with no sign that he viewed it as anything other than half joke and half dark goonish conspiracy also the bit about there is no right and wrong is absolute nonsense aside from the blatant contradictiona statement that if accurate destroys the entire concept of accuracy it is also a direct attack on the entire structure of human thought i can buy the talks implication that most societal debates should be treated as less of a shrill moral imperative than it is currently and that stepping back and analyzing issues dispassionately is a good thing but abandoning the entire concept of right and wrong turns your brain into oatmeal

you will always lose members to apathy and attrition  its virtually unavoidable either they find the job to be harder than predicted and thus find themselves unableor unwilling to make time for it or they just wanted it to pad their resume in the first place theres nothing you can do about this except to elect better people next time regarding meetings the current lack of them is ridiculous and i shudder at the thought of your next agenda and at the thought of how many good ideas that would normally have gotten advanced are going to be ignored because theyre now a month old and on page 15 regarding reaching players who dont use the forums i think ccps ingame advertisement of the elections are your best path here the current csm should ensure that the next such announcement includes links to jpsc and to the past accomplishments of the first csmand i mean things actually implemented or about to be not just talk as well as other info that would be good at reaching out to nonforumers and getting them involved that said dont expect miracles here  most people just arent going to care no matter what you do and if we ever see even a 20 voter turnout id be surprised just make sure were here to implement good ideas and weed out bad ones and to listen to people who raise concerns whether its their first post or 10000th
its utopia to think that we can interact with all players despite how awesome it would be i would love more interaction indeed but the current structure of how things work does not promote discussion in any shape way or form the assembly hall threads gets filled with signed making it impossible to discuss anythingbut yes it can always improve if the members of the council wants to just a bloody shame really you cant fix this its democracy we might find that some things are just better done by the developers rather than people with personal interestbut i do think we represent a wide area of people i cant think of any which isnt represented i agree too much discussion happening which should have been done before the meeting lets put the blame on lack of a good place to discuss issues before a meetingi also discussed about streamlining the process and putting the issues into catergories you note the bug tweaks and rebalancing filling the agenda which i agree on it needs to be sortedi would put people into 3 boxes1 the people who dont know about csm but who is interested2 people who do not care about it3 people who are already interacting with it to some capacitythe problem is that you want to reach the 2 first groups of people of course it goes without saying that some people who arent aware of the forums simply do not care about it we can blame this on the poor quality of the forums and posts on itbut some people we simply wont reach without help from ccp our only option is getting in touch with corporations and people in random local areas while im considering that to be an option its a very time consuming process for little reward on the large scalei think the idea of a discussion meeting is ok but the text format is really poor just look at all the chatlogs so far it would have to be done over tsvt or it should be done on the forum during the week the csm is not supposed to be busy only on weekends when theres meetingsim personally in favor of the forum discussions during the whole week its a lot more transparent as well and it doesnt turn into a pig with lipstick on hunting for its own god damn tail
hey man anybody can talk to me any time they want so get off my case
simple question requires a simple answeredit where does one announce their candidacy for the next election is it here or another forum as i recall prior to this forums creation it was in gd but i am uncertain where andor when to postim under the impression that a candidacy lasts six months the last lot were what aprilish that places october as the next elections when do candidates start recampaigning
i know announcements and candidate threads are properly located here though a lot will cross over into eve general for added readership as for dates id like to know as well
i like the concept of a big gun i was thinking more along the lines of guns similar to pos guns but capable of hitting targets surrounding the planet something expensive large and takes a while to onlineoffline a planetary defense system shouldnt be something easy to toss up it would slowly start pounding away at the red poss and could hit ships coming in to defendtake them outthough i assume this isnt possible due to grids
where in the hell are you flying at a belt in 7 sec or lowerobviously this could be tweakd so that it doesnt affect anchored cans
all the cans already have a timer running on the server so if the retrieval of that information took more than a simple rollover it wouldnt be a lagfest perhaps the timer would be on the info screen your computer already is making a call for the information attached to that can might as well pull the despawn time with it it wouldnt take much to then turn that into a countdown timer based on the difference between the current time and the despawn time so the lag would not be very different than the slight lag already associated with pulling up the info on the can
the 00 threads have quieted down quite a bit going to start tossing around some ideas on this for a while and try make a proposal out of itsomebody who likes all that mining  please clean this basic idea up a bit  in essence more autonomy for 00 empires is desirablealso considering a selfmanufacturing mechanic the system constructs itself out of early production materials can be sped up by feeding raw minerals production takes about two weeks or so to hit maximum something like thatya know but more specificsecond ideal goal is that it does produce useful things but will produce much more when fed mineralsice that come from regular economics allowing production power to keep its place in 00 keep basic theme of using minerals to make more minerals rp reason is that planet materials must be combined with asteroid materials in the extractionrefining processutopian design goals1 increases economic power of 00 empires and drives the game towards less grinding and more pewpewing in expensive gear2 forms the midsize gang target in the measured loss of production model3 production strong alliances will gain yet more production4 in no way promotes grinding no weird mechanics to control the population we have dreadnoughts for that
ok csm is has been 8 days since we heard we will check on possible nda issue what is the ccps answer to this ongoing issue
bumpin this
i wouldnt hold your breath like most of the other pvpfocused balance issues eg black ops battleships theres very little incentive on the part of ccp to do anything about the naglfarnidhoggur the number of players who can fly the ships and who consider them unbalanced is small and moreover have enough timeskillpoints sunk to not quit out of hand about it
i support this i like matari ships but they need to be brought up to balance with the others
im not at liberty to say any kind of update one way or another
best i dea i have heard is to make the 625 damage bonus also effect the missle hpin addition remove the 925 explosion velocity from the siege mode they are slow as dirt anyway and cant catch fast target to begin with and any smaller ships are already getting resist vs the missle and size vs the missle even a speed bonus vs the missle without the explosion velocity being gimped from siege a rocket fired from a siege mode dread wouldnt have the explosion velocity to do full damage to a bs with a after burner let alone the slowest of all the missles
i dont see where there is anything in the patch notes in testing in development or on the drawingboard for black ops amazing but they will address it soon tmslow as smoke offa cold signed as far as previous suggestions
slow slow you say it aint moving its frozen solidguess that is the problem to be based on iceland 
you know honestly the only thing black ops really need is to be able to fit a covert ops cloak that would be a huge boost just in and of itself t2 resists would be nice but arent needed we really do need a fuel bay too their cargo bay size limits them to about 45 jumps before refueling and maybe 34 jump bridges as well and that only leaves you with enough space for about a day or 2 of pvp ammo i have about 3500 various missiles enough fuel for 5 jumps and 3 jump portalsaside from that they are pretty good ships stat wisemy skillsmy configalso making covert jump portalscynos work in cynojammed systems sounds like a good idea but its kind of pointless really since you need to get a covert op in the system in the first place to make the covert cyno whats the point besides making a warp to spot for your fleet which you an already do now anyway i see no real point in this honestly i dont really see any point in covert jump portals except if you had an entire gang of only covertsforce recons maybe if they added the ew frigies to this too it would be alright or maybe just all frigates and force recons and logistics i dunno but something needs to be done about covert jump portals to make them actually useful

some of your nice group of you shall play as i want group suggestion tax 10 20 50 for npc corps not allowed bs or larger ships bargers freighters limit what npc corp members can buysell in market and contracts tax npc corp members more in market noo you dont want to impose your playstile vall next time try at least to be honest about the piece you cited it mean that npc corp are not mean for control by human players the whole set of relates articles in the knowledge base is about sovereignty players corp functions and so on that piece was put there to explain that you cant do the same in a npc corp note this phraseno requests for positions in npc corporations are acceptedthat is the key point of the piece it was badly written sure but when ccp has printed clear pieces about game functionalityif your interpretation was right ccp would have implemented systems to force players out of npc corps instead the only people trying to do that are the guys and gals like you
not a good ideawhy tax someone for virtually nothing they get nothing from their corp so they should not be taxedif you dont like the idea that they can not be wardeced propose that npc corps can be wardecedand watch how that turns into 1dayplayer massacre hence no can doand why should they not be allowed to stay in an npc corp for more than x ammount of time does anyone force you to switch player corps every once in a whileits clever use of the rules not an exploit of the rules
actually there is nothing clever about it it is a nobrainer default exploit of invulnerability especially now suicide ganking is so nerfed i am pretty sure devs once said nowhere is completely safe once you undock well currently and undocked npc corp member is pretty damn safe id say

nice post ugleb i support your idea wholeheartedlywith regards to capital blobs the minmatar militia engaged an amarr militia pos a week or so ago this engagement saw cva and 0utbreak caps fielded regardless of fw mechanics rumor has it that the amarr militia make use of cva quite often although i cannot offer any evidence to back that up so the risk of 00 alliances and corps intervening is already a reality while limited in their scope of course 00 aliances can already hotdrop capitals with the current mechanics all that is at risk is their security status which is easily fixed with a few days ratting in their sovereign spaceintroducing the mechanic that ugleb suggests wouldnt change the probability of this happening in my opinion but it would allow the serious rp aliances to join in with the major rp storylines taking place in eve todaybravo ugleb bravomatt
i agree that the current system is suboptimal and would agree that it ought ot be changed speaking for myself when fw hit it was agreed that we would mothball our 13 day old alliance and form a specific fw corp which wasnt the perfect solution as people can come to the most obtuse of conclusions when they see thatthat said youve posted an idea that has clearly been well thought out however i am still undecided as to what the best solution is personally as there are so many factors to think about ill support i suppose though my support is irrelevant as this will inevitably be brought upid like to comment herei would suggest that not only should the alliances overall standing reach a certain standings mark but there should also be a threshold for every single corp in the alliance to meet ie none of the alliance member corps can have unsatisfactory standings that said i still think a lot more discussion is needed p
has my total support keep pushing for a result guys dont let this slip off the radar
no supportas much as the subject seems controvertial i cant see any positive outcomes of allowing alliances into fw so far the only institution that could get profit from it is ushrakhan and i believe that it justifies the ops threadill put this perspective in detailsfw is currentely a side feature of the game where corporations of medium and small size are able to participate in a positive and significant way in eve actually the only feature where such corporations have this chancethe introduction of alliances inside would make this dissapear it wouldnt take a weeks time to see alliances completely dominating statistics and battlefields underscoring the mere reason of fw to exist at first placeanother point besides ushrakhan i see no other entity of similar impact that would benefit of joining fw i doubt that cva would be interested on leaving providence just to enter fw because they would feel almost as an obligation to do so caldari doesnt have any hardcore rp firm alliance the same stands for gallente and even small associated alliances with both factions wouldnt benefit leaving their 00 business for itincase the main alliances would be allowed and decided to join lets say uk x cva we would simply be turning fw in an yet another copy of the same conflicts and theater we have been watching for the past years here including these both factions for example why would we want to do that and why ccp would make fw for this i dont see the pointexploit by other alliances will happen as soon as the system opens standings are too easy a fact to manipuate in 24 hours time dissolving and joining the right characters for it i believe many would take the easy wayto resume i see the cost risk x benefit far too great to become a point to be considered i respect and understand ushrakhanUFFFDs feelings on the matter but changing a full game mechanism to this extend just because of it seems unwise to me
the amarr all ready rely heavily on their respective alliances it wont change a damn thing except maybe the minny militia will finally get some help from ushra
tell me dear one what evidence do you have that makes this true perhaps 10 of amarr achievements can be attributed to the influence of the amarrrp alliances no thats far to optimistic more like 1
um station sim extraordinairehow about allowing for compression of minerals in station however apply production costs like heavy water to run the production line or some other fuel still require the industrial reconfiguration skill as with the industrial core but allow for it to be done in station
90 of 00 have ore like empire imbalance  fix empire ore to be veld only and remove refining from empire missions
my concern with this is that itll just accelerate the capships arms race thats going oncapital ships should be hard to build and take a lot of logistics given the massive wealth of the top tier alliances right now if you remove most of the logistical challenges to popping them out like frigs its just going to lead to even more server busting fleets than we have currentlyif the servers better supported these massive capital fleets id be all for it given the current state of the servers though being able to casually field hundreds of caps doesnt make much sense
the issue of capship accumulation i dont think is tied to economics instead consider these two known issues1 entropy isnt working on capitals because carriers effectively support more carriers and are impossible to attack without obscene dps on the field another broken ship is the ddd nanotitan when used in a cynocamping role2 there is no accumulation of other ships because the more that fly the more that die entropy favors wrecks over ships only caps are seen as exceptions and only in certain caseseconomics arent what create capital creep imbalances in eve entropy do provide a capital sink and the entropy will go away such that capital production will balance capital consumption to a more healthy extent at that point 00 wealth can be raised without too much concern over creating a power imbalance between empire and 00 empiresop is cool with me creating logistics nightmares doesnt make the game fun or fare let us move tons and tons of stuff and build and fly and get blown up as many times as we can stand grinding is not a fundamental principle of mmos
bump
love it got my support
well while not an expert on this subject i honestly not heard of many miners having kbs for veldspar nor misisoners for the npc rats and definately not seen any traders have a killboard for their killer deals though perhaps they should as trading is probably the most hardcore pvp in eve so while their piwate or pvp alts maybe i am saying they carebear charactors arent kb s   thought if you could the little cool face for no reason i could as well 
dont try to fight it just do what we do typically the ninjas will jump in after the fight is well under way though we had one that was waiting for us at the gate before we even get started so there are plenty of hostile npcs left cap and armor tend to be running a little low and if you are smart your cargo should already be pretty full of stuff along comes the ninjas so we jump out if he wants the salvage pretty bad hes gong to have to fight the npcs to get it ive never had more than 23 wrecks looted using this tactic
well i dont do exploration im just a prospector but i also decline when i get offered to mine a grav site causei make the same or even more isk by mining plagioclase pyro or veld and dont need lots of isogen for production as well so yes fully supported
i dont find this proposal better than what already exists
if anything it decrease blob warfarebutand removing jb for easy traveling wouldnt solve any problems hai2u big blobs  titan
says the cva blob member thats quite funny you guys have got to be the most effective at using the jump bridges to get blobs from point a to point b
so why is it small gangs get out blobed by alliances due to the fact they can get there fleets to zoom accross the map via jbs how does this decrease blob warfare please explaine
thank god you said jump bridge i not have a clue what he ment  cause you said no then i will just for that reason
dreadful ideatheyre supposed to be worse than gates otherwise eves stellar cartography essentially means nothing deadend pipe not so if its linked to 10 other constellationsjbs are ruining roaming and small gang warfare with blobs essentially materialising out of nowhere for little cost increasing that tactical flexibilty tenfold by adding more jbs is a horrible plan
jump bridges dont ruin anything they are a nice advantage for taking and holding space if you cant deal the go live in npc space
yeah i already did cheers you are entirely wrong of course but note im not saying remove them just hell no dont make them vastly more powerful by having crosslinked networks putting blobs everywhere
you would never believe how long i looked for this thread
rollship does a barrel roll and becomes invulnerable to incoming fire for a brief period
i hope that i am a noob and there is already such a feature but i never noticed onei am producing alot of stuff and it annoys me that i have to watch my supply manually calculating my needs of materials costs me too much time  cant we get an export to file feature for assets in the current station with this file it would be possible to make production sheets or applications and i could finally do my homework dishes etc and please my wife thx in advance for your support
the feature mostly consists of getting a thirdparty program and plugging in your full api datanot the one you use for evemon the other one the one i use for what little i do industrially is evemeep but there are probably others that i dont know about
thx alot herschel that seems exactly what i was looking for 
nice
it has everything to do with it the entities that would be allowed in if this is approved have vastly greater resources than those who are participating now there is little doubt that if this is acted upon by ccp as it is proposed the rp alliances will determine the outcome of fw fw will become the domain of those aliances everyone else will be alsorans who have little to no impactif that is ccps intent cool but they just need to understand that if this goes through they can pretty much forget the notion that fw is going to be attractive to empire dwelling novice pvpers uhhhh ever heard the saying never bring a knife to a gun fight yeah you cant get a carriers into a minor plex but you can sure cover the entrance to one with them i cover the gate with cruisers you bring battleships i bring battleships you bring carriers i bring dreds to kill your carriers you bring dreds to kill my dreds not long until we have cap ship battles over minor plexes please i think you could say the same about providence yes i understand that nobody but the rp alliances will care except maybe goon since theyd like to make you cry yes i understand that youd like the rp alliances to own fw lets see if ccp would like that too uhhh youre joking right most of those folks are marginally active at best since outbreak and some others left the militias are lucky to raise fleets of 3040 during the week maybe 100 on the weekend and those fleets are comprised of mostly novice pvpers and fcs yeah i think youll dominate it easily if you join it will become all about you and star against cva the caldari faction will be a weak sister whose players will probably stick close to the cva amar fleets so they dont get steamrolled controlling the entrance to plexes will become capship affairs in short itll become 00 lite with better mechanics for the rp power players the npc militia corps will become irrelevent they wont get invited to your fleets theyll just wander around getting ganked until they empty im not saying thats a bad thing necessarily but lets not have any illusions about what making this change would mean
no support for several reasons already presented hereto resume alliances in eve already have their space and eve machanisms to explore and play against each other leave fw for the small and medium size corps to play with now allowing all corps inside alliance to enter is the same as allowing the alliance itselfallowing 1 corp inside an alliance to enter could be exploited as they could change members between one corp to another not speaking about the mess that previous alliances war decs and sorts could bring along inside a gang militiai dont see why fw should be yet another feature to see wars of the past repeating itself inside yet another theater for cva x uk and megablobs at space making the corporations and militia itself nule in terms of play and influence
so to summarize you are concerned that if such a change is made that an alliance like cva will abandon their nullsec holdings so that they can park a carrier in front of each and every minor installation and gank noobs in t1 frigs even if they did that theyd also have to park an interceptor with each carrier then of course the pair of t1 frigates with a stab each laugh at them as they go in and cap the plex in perfect safety less than a million isk just pwned over a billion isk where else in eve can such a thing occur you mention the knife in a gunfight analogy but a more accurate analogy would be a knife vs a halbard  in a dense jungle whos gonna win that fightin any case you word these sorts of things as fears that might come to pass should the big bad alliances get their way but the fact is that such ships are already being deployed in fw without the involvement of alliances with just as little effect to my view ive seen the amarrians play station games in a small handfuls of carriers but the only damage they did was to bored pilots who didnt feel like  i dunno just not warping to that particular station then there was a pos battle where an unknown to me but over a dozen capital ships where involved but none were lost on either side early on i think it was ra who tried muscling in on state turf and lost 23 carriers to a bunch of noobs in t1 frigs and cruisersyup theres clearly a danger hereregarding providence i think theres a great parallel to be drawn there with a few brief exceptions the only people that ever fight over it are cva uk and their allies why because its worthless beyond its rp value any large alliance could walk in and grab it at any time if they set their minds to it dont get me wrong it wouldnt be easy cva is well entrenched but it would just be a matter of how many lost ships it would take to dislodge themi think that fw would be treated similarly if the bbas wanted to screw with fw they already can the goons could drop a 50man blob in every fw system today if they had the motivation sure they wouldnt have any wts but thats never stopped them in the past sure theyd have gate guns firing but do you think that would really matter to the capital blobs youre so fond of pointing out the only thing they gain from joining the militia is the one thing they could care less about the ability to cap plexes not having access doesnt stop them from interfering with fw apathy does theres just no reason to do it especially since theyd have to spend weeks or months grinding standings first and by joining would give up half of the potential targets theyd otherwise haverp alliances like uk want to be in this fight because weve always been in this fight until we were evicted by ccp would we dominate fw well id like to think that wed have some impact otherwise what would be the point for anyone to join fw perhaps our more experienced pilots and fcs would pass on some of their experience for example but as far as taking over is concerned the worst thing we could do to those unwilling to bow before the awesome intellect of our benevolent dictatorial rule would be  well i suppose we could not invite them to gangs we organized which would leave them  uh  right where they are nowso basically your biggest fear is that the hordes of novice pvpers in fw might learn somethingbesides the bulk of the fw playerbase is pirates and alts of bba members anyway why not let in some people who actually give a damn about the storyline to give a hand to the novices who might actually learn to enjoy the storyline
if ccp wanted it to be that easy theyd have made it that easy

my opinion is of no value please move on hey ill give it anyway the csm members were elected to work together csm issues surrounding working together are much harder to resolve if spotlights are shed upon them in the public eye one of the important rules of diplomacy is to not make your opponent lose face this mistake can be made if one takes the public approach in resolving personalother issues between csm members lastly i call shenanigans
have to agree absolutely nothing can be resolved with public discussions between csm delegates when many are obligated to play up to the reputation and leadership roles they have elsewhere in the community nobody wants to admit they are wrong mistaken or that the other side has a point hell even the nonleadership experienced delegates got elected in the first place by having robust argumentative attributes and ego combined and its a bit ridiculous to expect any of them to check in that ego at the door when debating passionate issues on the eve forumsmaking a public challenge or attack on another committee member invariably leads to the spectator sport of baiting and trolling and further reduces to ability to actually get anything donethere is a reason smokefilled rooms are the places where things get done
quoting the exact opposite of how any democratic system should function smoke filled rooms are where roaches hide sunshine is the best disinfectantpot calling kettle black is another one ill edit this if i can come up with some more old sayings that apply to the quoted postedit goes out of his way to insult degrade and berate other council members in any venue he can accessposts lamenting how everyone else just cant get along
thanks for illustrating my point so perfectly
your point was we should do everything in secret i disagree dont like people not agreeing join a council made up of only yourself ive just as much a right to express my opinion to the contrary as you did to agree maybe you should go back and read the mailing list shc your irc logs and anywhere else you posted where you became the only person on the council guilty of what youre posting against here and likely the very topic of this thread and postsorry if you feel you should be able to say whatever you want until it comes back to you then claim some moral highground as if youre above it all when in actuality youre the first one to sling mud and sling it dirty that world just doesnt exist so get over it
no my point was that you cant discuss anything civilly in public because you are acting as a cheerleader for 5000 goons
i am a cheerleader for 5000 goons a base a few thousand larger than your voterbase fyi you on the other hand are a hypocrite who likes to throw stones then feign moral outrage when they come back in your direction the difference between us is im not pretending im something im not
ah well not a very productive discussion really end of the day people disagree with each other  not altogether a surprise
personally i find that this level of discourse is beneath the decorum of the csm and i shall retire from further conversations until such personal attacks cease to pollute it
hey saint you missed the ban button ill give you a hint its the one you pressed on darius for the same reason ill give you a second hint you were wrong on both counts

such as btwthread is awesomewould read againeditalsotransparencyremembereditop no ty corporate buzzwords probably wont translate well here given that they only make sense to those driven by synergistic leverage of existing paradigms and left to rot as roadkill on the information superhighwayhuh
as pointed out in the thread in public people are too conscious of their reputations and notoriety and pride nobody will give an inch on these public forums while their alliance mates and audience are measuring each word and nuance and cheerleaders are performing rapposse chorus lines to whip up the crowds whereas in a private smokefilled room deals get done take the uk house of parliament as example no deals happen during pms questions the real politicking occurs out of the public view because thats where politicians can actually meet in the middle and engage in horsetrading outside of the sight of the partisan masses hurling abuse at each other
youre confusing the uk with a true democracy online space games dont need some fancy private lounge and thats counterproductive ccp employees already have that we dont need a council that mimics the opaqueness of ccp if you cant handle having your actions and their results scrutinized in public then dont make them
quite obviously you are mistaken  since this csm has run into the problem where csm delegates are incapable of having a respectful and civil discussion on the public forums because one side feels the need to play up to its member base and bully and verbally harangue the others this csm has been crippled by the mutual animosity of members and that has only been made worse by the involvement of 3rd party partisan flamers and trolls through the process these forums have not been a decent setting for debate since the election and your alliance goonswarm has to bear a lot of responsibility for that
maybe if they are egotistical asterisks this is internet spaceships if you are taking it that seriously you have mental problems
so where do you get off alleging mental problems exactlyyou dont know anything about me why cant you have a discussion without getting personalwhy is it neccessary that virtually every single discussion i have with a goonswarm poster on these forums ends up with flames and personal attacks can you answer me that
because your a bad posterbecause your a trollbecause your role play a girlbecause you write wordstheres probably lots more thou
sigh ah well nobody can say i dont try to talk to you people
please be respectful of others at all timesapplebabe
generic you not personal you honestly what you get up to in your personal life is of absolutely no interest to me as to the rest if you post sideswipes at a bunch of people more often than not theres no point getting your knickers in a twist if that bunch of people throws a few swipes back
show some class when posting somebody throws an accusation at you let it slide dont insult or accuse right back if a fellow csm has a different stance on something dont bicker with them on the forums do it privately away from the public eye youre a team act like one your personal stances should stay off the forums be more diplomatic and neutral in discussion showing pros and cons to an idea instead of clearly sidingas far as im concerned the whole csm idea was a bad idea in the first placeatleast try and make the best of your existence and act accordinglyyoure embarassing yourselves and the community the above wall of text is my opinion take it or dont its there 
thank you for expressing the communitys opinion
for what its worth i dont think the csm idea was bad but the reality is we did get people elected who loathe one other and cannot remain civil let alone cooperate  and given eves political climate its hardly surprising that happens since the game is built around grudges and vendettas and dark brutality whatever happens in the future the reality is some of those people will keep getting reelected due to alliance voting blocks so yes its a problem and im honestly not sure how you deal with it you can certainly make sure you pick candidates you believe are capable of turning the other cheek  but you cant stop other players electing their own choice of knifewielding dramamerchants if it pleases them

anyways ill get back to this thread after i take care of a few things im at work so my responses will be delayed
i think you cite a very idealistic proposition there and if people truly did vote only for people they expected to be able to remain calm and respectful at all times then the csm might be interesting  but you do have the problem that however you vote you are always going to get a couple of alliance block candidates in the mix who cannot help themselves but be unpleasant and get stuck into the other delegates still its been an interesting process  ive learned of myself that im not cut out for politics because i simply cant stand certain people and cant really hide my disgust for shortsighted partisan issueblocking against the interests of the game at large
personal attacks and trolling is not permitted on the forums saint
if i appear to be ignoring parts well okay most of your posts darius thats because i am nothing you say ever really amounts to more than an extended personal attack and as a rule its pointless to respond in detail still continue bellowing as you will freedom of speech and all that
i think im pretty civil just imho just throwing it out there
cleaned continuation of discussion of moderation will result in warningsbans please post with respect to fellow players and continue discussions without attacking each other if you truly feel the need to continue please take it in game and hunt each other down with massive amounts of pew pew and ohh noesss
qft  excellent advise
thanks for the tidy up
well jade i agree there will always be somebody elected who shouldnt have been as they do not meet the criteria of a well rounded csm but csms are still subject to the forum rules as you can see from this thread if the csm cant act accordingly he will get his post removed like everyone elsecsms should imo be subject to harsher penalities when it comes to having their post removed given their position in the community if a csm has thier posts removed x amount of times they should be removed from csm period lets say first time a warning second a gag for x amount of time third time removed as a csmthey should act accordingly with their added responsibility if they are unable to act in accordance to their position they should not be therethats how i feel about it anyway
man you just dont get it do you please be respectful of others all the timeapplebabe
well i dont want to get involved in the specific discussion of moderation in this thread  but i think this jita parkassembly hall pair of forum sections has been a problem for forum management since the outset there has been a lot of flaming and bad behaviour perpetrated here  and part of that is responsible for the death of actual debate between csms and the community in these forum sections i can understand why it happened and why it was felt these sections should be hands off so as to not interfere with the democratic opinions and discussions that were meant to happen here  but with virtual mudslinging so thick that you cant see opinions and debate for the actual mud its all a bit sillyi certainly feel strongly that i literally cannot post anything here without being abused insulted flamed and trolled at the moment and thats a ridiculous situation for a player let alone a csm rep let alone csm chair to be in we were promised some private forums to conduct csm business in but circumstances have gotten in the way of that and its nobodies fault end of the day but the fact we need private forums is a bad reflection on the climate of the forums in and of themselves the community does have some responsibility in not exercising appropriate peer pressure on individuals and organizations that promote flaming as an ordinary style of discourse problem is that any moderation system can be gamed to a degree and you dont want lawfully elected csms getting removed due to some underground mob report flood its a very difficult thing to measure i think ultrastrict moderation is not the answer i think community peer pressure is
you get your voice and your vote every election cycle thats your opportunity to speak and be heard you continue to have that opportunity to express your opinion here on these forums however to suggest that elected representatives opinions should be controlled by ccp is hilariously offbase when discussing a council whose very creation stems from ccps negative actionsallowing ccp to sway the discourse of the csm in any way whatsoever including via moderation is a ridiculous and dangerous prospect and sets an awful precedent
when you flame attack and abuse others you should expect nothing but the same in return playing the victim doesnt excuse your own actions nor even deflect from them very welledit im glad to see youve changed your tune on the moderation angle to one of community policing i do seem to remember you mentioning wanting community members to be able to ban people in some form as well a concept which seemed to gloss over the fact that in this world you also wouldnt be able to post
oh i still want that i think it would be a great idea for the leaders of organizations to have collective responsibility for the posting standards of their members i think eventually an organization that seems to promote pointless flaming as a default posting standard for its membership on eve online forums  should probably face tempbanning at the organizational level and be expected to improve
heh jade talking about posting standards really i guess you dont need to be here anymore
well yes i will talk about posting standards case in point  you know that igs forum here  the one tagged roleplay discussions when i post there i do so in an ic voice and respect the incharacter nature of that forum and the characters posting there this afternoon weve seen a lot of ooc smacktalk from the goons posting there i think thats simply bad and your leadership should ensure that your members are taught better standards not encouraged to break the specific forum posting rules and spoil the forum experience for other players who want to roleplay their characters and organizations i dont care that goons think roleplay is laughable i do care that you dont respect the posting rules for specific sections hence i think it would be good if there was some kind of collective responsibility for an organization that seems collectively incapable of maintaining decent and responsible standards
so it wouldnt have anything to do with the content of your posts then
im glad you support a proposition whereby the weight of numbers would free us all from your posting forever
newsflash  your standards are not everyones standards get over it
ill have you know that the smack talk is in character for goons as we are role playing the s of eve
i never stated their opinions should be controled in any way shape or formive clearly state that their opinions should be delivered in an appropriate manner suitable to the postion of of a csm if the csm is unable to deliver his message in a respectful manner his post should be removed as any other poster but face harsher penalitiesill ask you to reread my posts from the begining it should help you get a clearer picture of what i am saying
in that case ill ask you to take your role play to the role playing forum
i did read your posts and responded directly to them unless a csm violates the eula they are within their rights to act however they wish your opinion on what is acceptable and what isnt is irrelevant people are different and neither you nor anyone else is the arbiter of morality or post quality
see this is where i think you are wrong the eve community needs involved in some way as arbiter of post quality even if simply through the aegis of peer pressure  because the community here is something worth preserving and we have seen a terrible reduction in post quality on these forums and something does need doing about it its simply not acceptable to see these eve forums turned into sa forums mk2 it has to stop
or you could take things that work from sa pertinent to this how about an ignore list dont like the user add them to your ignore list and you never have to read their twaddle again pretty straight forward and egalitarian
so in your view a csm should not have to be respectful diplomatic mature
well i can see some problems when i end up adding goonswarm as an organization to my ignore list and cant see issues that darius or bane want adding to agendas but aside from that  there is the role these forums play as a shopfront and advertising venue for the game of eve online if it devolves to flamers flaming flamers but protecting themselves with selective ignores how does that look to joe public taking a quit peer at the forums and is it fair to put the burden on administration on the ordinary player that just wants to see a decent standard of debate and discussion on these forums
should is a nice word the world should be buttercups and puppies however it seems to be economic meltdown and posturing at the moment the csm should be able to comprehend proposed game balancing and changing for the betterment of the game however it seems that some csm members have little to no ability to understand how the game workswe can maybe fix the game but fixing people
respectfulness maturity and diplomacy are all subjective concepts and arent an enforceable requirement of the eula if theyre listed there as requirements that things a bigger piece of garbage than i thought
your choice your problemthey look like a bunch of angry weird nerds getting really angry about internet spaceships plus who the hell looks at the forums for a game about blowing things up in space watch the promo vids dl client and get 2 weeks freepressing one button is a burden wow the poor players actively deciding for themselves we can set up helplines and stuff
it most certainly is notim saying a csm should be those things
dont sweat it champ thats already been rectified by ccp via report button
your completely subjective and unenforceable opinion can and should be noted however your calls for administrative sanction based on that are what i take umbrage with
rep system for the eve community thats fine im simply letting you know that what youre asking for is a world youll be excluded from what you do or dont find acceptable is irrelevant these arent your forums
until you reword your postposts in a more respectful manner i will not debate or reply to you if you do not wish to be respectful ill ask you to leave this discussion
that was a direct response to what you said and there is nothing remotely disrespectful in there until you can accept a meaningful discussion whereby you debate your points without crying offense when someone disagrees with you in a completely respectful manner ill ask you to leave this forum
odet santaria is correct opinions are subjective you may or may not agree with how they are expressed but that is up to you are you telling me that you never heard anyone say something you thought was absolute hogwash and expressed as such to thempersonally if i think someone is talking  i tell them they are talking  i get hit a lot less often than you might think somewhat bafflingly
i agree opinions are subjectivethe thread is not about your actions or my actions or how you or i express themit is about how the csms act and express themselvesyes i have heard certain peoples opinions that i do not agree with and i personally myself would tell them they were full of itbut if i were in the position of a csm i would show restraint and not let my personal emotions or opinions get in the way of a debate since that is what were discussing is the csms
then were you a csm you could be a shining beacon for all that is good and right with the csm personally i dont feel the csm should be held to any higher ethical code than anyone else and anyone insinuating that it should or ever will be otherwise is living in a fantasy
perhaps a luxury you wouldnt afford others wherever you were to have the power to do so
youre a walking drama bomb with paperthin skin of course you feel picked on  you start fights and then feel put out when people fight back the problem isnt people picking on you unfairly  you get made fun of when you say stupid things the same as everybody else god knows ive had my share of it on forums over the years the problem is that youre delusional about what normal interpersonal interaction looks like you set out to make an enemy of two of the people on your council and then youre surprised when one of them fights back what precisely did you expect darius is not a particularly subtle or courteous man but hes supposed to take your limitless abuse without saying anything in response what fantasy world do you live in that that possibility is even worthy of consideration seriously quit playing the oh woe is me game you are the single most powerful eve player in the game  youre one of nine who gets direct access to ccp and the head one at that so what if people pick on you on the forums is your ego really so fragile that you cant take it what does it matter to you if some avatar on the forums who youll never meet or even know the real name of says unpleasant things about you you should have known going in that youd face abuse  politicians are routinely subjected to public inquisitions into the personal lives of family members accusations of every criminal act that an opposition member think has the slightest chance of sticking abusive lawsuits by the dozen and the odd assassination to cap it all off youre nowhere near so big or important as a president or prime minister but you preside over the eve forums not a civilized nation the only surprise thus far has been how little abuse you have received  you are being held accountable for some very shady actions by ten thousand anonymous angry individualswith far aboveaverage numbers of guys and youth for added selfrestraint and theres only been half a dozen threads that compare you unfavourably to jack the ripper you should be glad and instead youre acting like a whiny little emo kid complaining that nobody knows how hard it is to lead exactly the same life as everybody else congratulations you get abused on the eve forums you want a cookie
i brainstormed a quick draft for a founding ideology of a set of proposals that will be aimed at the issues of boring pos warfare boring pos management and lack of significance to 00 sovereigns compared to the empiresand there were mmosgrinding is a way of life all shiny gear bling and toys will require xyz amount of time to acquire balance will dictate that things you actually want will require masochistic devotion let us emulate the ideal of a never dull openended game through placing pots of gold at ever farther rainbows and hope nobody noticesand then there was evegrinding no skills will advance steadily with diminishing returns new players and old players will be separated by mere 5 increments isk will flow like a river instead of the carrotsticking fear of player enjoyment eve will be recycled as many times as tritanium can be reprocessed from the wrecked hulls of our opponentsand then the devs fd uplet there be poss to control their spam and limit the infinite empire we will infuse them with the timehonored mmo mechanic of grinding masochism will be a metric of alliance contribution ded hate mail will let no player escape the mmo rite of insanitywhat went wrongpositive game control mechanics rely on the natural influence of the existence of opponents to act as limiting factors that will keep the game fresh and challenging you can get that shiny t2 gear but ownership is transient in a pvp rich worldnegative game control mechanics rely on making the road to level 70 long and arduous out of the tacit understanding that creep would outpace development of new content if that content carrot wasnt kept out of reach with a long enough stick these mechanics are only necessary where assets accumulate because of a lack of entropyeve devs afraid of scope creep and imbalance of 00 against empire instead of implementing the proper positive mechanics via player driven interaction decided to make the game do it for us via the negative mechanics of pos grinding such as fuel this is also why cargo is limited this is also why asteroids are tinygive eve back to usmore independence of 00 empires why limit cool 00 entities like sanshas nation to game fiction why are robotics parts so hard to producemore production in 00 with additional balance via pvp mechanics more ships and more pewpew this is where im going with that planetary production platform ideano stupidass reasons to go to jita region specific isotopes moon mineral distribution these were dreamed up as mechanics of limiting the strength of 00 entities and creating more markets all it does is require yet more grinding to maintain whiney towers and makes the deepnullsec life a pain our opponents can do that in far more interesting wayswhacha think on target with where poss went south can scope creep really selfmanage itself via entropy ships blowing each other up and the natural progression towards ships becoming wreckswhat does ccp think about this analysis
just two notes from breezing over this list imopassive income streams are already capable of being disrupted theres nothing to change here perhaps there could be more variety or dynamism in how those streams occur no details as its deep but suggesting that passive income streams cant be disrupted today is an outright fallacythe solution to 00 being boring is not to increase the logistical payload and thus make it more boring it takes 8 hours to online a deathstar thats just ridiculous ccps first attempt at minimizing the scale of empires was to increase logistical burden and all this will accomplish is even more of a degree of difference between the haves and havenots as well as making more people hate eve and burn outjump bridges and such are already vulnerable to nonsov threats hell you dont even need a capfleet so perhaps im not understanding what youre hinting at therei agree implicitly with the statement regarding making sov meaningful and have been working on an entire proposal surrounding that as i believe it to be a core problem ill have it done soon tm skipping back to the top i dont get this insinuation that smallmedium gang warfare doesnt occur in 00 and has no objective its an outright fallacy that keeps being repeated ask unnat whether small gang warfare or income disruption happens ask exrise ask bruce it is possible and we do it all the time the game cant play itself for youre the last bit artificial barriers on fleets will never work the guy with more ships will always have an advantage creating make believe objectives for small groups to accomplish is factional warfare you have that now go play it
a relevant question is it not true that the passive income gained by datacore farming cannot be disruptedperhaps it ought to be changed to demand player involvement for their production edit read continuous player involvement
this is about 00 there are no agents in 00 and therefore no datacore farming i will agree with you that empire is a joke and that things such as datacore farming could be disruptable but it would be completely offtarget
dariussome of the proposal points at the top are pretty out of date we can take the phrase small gang out of discussion from here on that discussion is going anywhere i agree with all your points im after something a little different at this stage
just thought of a very quick and accurate analogy for describing the difference between positive mechanics and negative mechanics skip to the end or read my thought process for kicksnegative mechanics are where players race to throw time and money into a giant rabbit holepositive mechanics are where players race to build mountains of shiny thingswhile both allow a comparison of relative uberness you have nothing left from the rabbit hole but have the entire stack of shiny things at the end of the daythe paradox for devs of all mmos is that people will stop playing if they win negative mechanics try to delay the onset of winning positive mechanics paradoxically would operate such that players can do nothing but winentropy is the solution with pvp entropy there is a sink that operates through mechanisms of fun to keep the game recycling its own contentresultant analogynegative mechanics keep the game fresh by using an appropriately long stick and a heralded carrot all players race each other on a treadmill to nowhere and the only allusion to success is when ones treadmill is set to a higher speed but still going nowherepositive mechanics keep the game fresh by giving the players lots of carrots players eat the carrots and are happy but then must obtain more carrots some will have lots of carrots from time to time but other players will come and eat their carrots nowhere in this mechanic do you find a fg treadmill
mmos are a form of mind control semiserious
on this i disagree with you in a number of ways there is a great deal of imbalance regarding wealth between empire and 00 but thats because the risk vs reward equation is tilted and continues to be greater skewed towards the empire side i would posit that the reason for so little variety in 00 is that the rewards arent there theres simply barely enough money to be made to continue funding conquest and nothing more at the end of that youre left with a merit badge a space on a map that can only serve to feed itselfsure you can get officer spawns but you cant run missions your playstyle choices are actually less than those of an empire dweller and the profits are higher only when comparing apples to apples its actually in the long term more profitable to run missions in highsec with absolutely 0 riskthere shouldnt be balance whats more difficult and riskier should produce a higher return and it should be higher on a scale that makes it worth doing i believe this is why 00 is so sparsely populated
agreed i think were on the same page more than you think but that im at too much of a conceptual stage for it to be obviousbig general for instanceselfassembling structures for 00 that are raw material generators fueled by materials from those selfassembling production facilities with capability to build npc fuel etc and other crap that was before only available through empire using components built by those and shipped to selfassembling research structures advanced final products can be builtgo with the kind of modular stuff proposed in the pos flogging the hoarse thread have lots of really customized installations developing favorite modules and ships sprinkle billboards and such at stargates with alliance driven content granted the alliance logo submission process is a horrible indicator of how good something like this would go but yeah player styled space would be a nice touchbrainstorming up some stuff ill post up later
preemtive eti i know this may be early  however people were campaigning for csm positions long before the official voting began last time this csm is up within two months and voting will commence before thenboy im not sure where to begin here so please bear with me over this long posti started playing eve over three years ago my first character roczenjka who has since been biomassed to make room for alts was a gallente when i created him i clearly didnt have a clue what i was doingi came into this game after playing freelancer i enjoyed that game i was one of the first to buy it  i had it on preorder in fact i played a similar game when i was younger wing commander privateer had to edit there i wrote privater  silly 83 dos file names which itself was based upon eliteelite was the first computer game that i bought  or rather its more appropriate to say my parents bought me back in 1986 i was four years old at the time and the highest rating i ever got on that game was deadly  but then we sold the bbc micro on which i played elite looking back i wish id kept the game for posterity  i had the original box the poster the instruction and the novella which i have to admit id never read being four to six it was a little involvedso fast forward to freelancer in roughly 19992000 the game had multiplayer servers which originally could take up to i believe either 64 or 128 players at any one time  this was a big deal  counterstrike could only comfortably support 32 players at any one time due to most of us being on 336 or 562k modemsit was fun i played on the jolt servers and for several years flew around with random characters and such  joining clans and fighting against other playersat some point in 20045 i was typing away in the system chat to someone i was fighting i lost and i was commenting upon how i liked freelancer but the one thing that annoyed me was that no matter what you accomplished in game it had no affect on well the game i could for example lay siege to a system and with the help of several other pilots we could blockade entire areas of the universe from players entering but it didnt accomplish anything diamonds in cambridge were always the same price even if we cut off the supply from leeds  it was a static market and a static universe think of eves high sec systems where soverignty cant be changed but with a static market  prices always frozen
so im lamenting away in chat and someone mentioned eve online id heard of it only through lancers reactor a freelancer website and id noticed the adverts so i looked it up by now i had broadband so the 550mb ish client download wasnt that much and heck there was a free trial sign me upso i joined and within two days id paid for the first month  looking back that was silly because i lost the remaining 12 days of free time but no matteri browsed through the races i didnt like the sound of the amarr very much i have nothing against religion or anything but seriously religious fanatics who kept slaves meh there was the caldari extreme capitalists and militaristic in nature i liked the blue colour scheme but it wasnt my favourite colour there was the minmitar but they looked more like klingons to me than anything elsethen there was the gallente hey a democracy they seemed to fit more than any race available at least my views in real life this is a role playing game afterall so i signed up for them sure ok theyre french im from the uk but it did say that it was in the distant past besides they were the most attractive so greatso ive got my gallente character and i now have to pick the stats ill admit i did no research so i read through the descriptions charisma seemed important because it looked like a skill that would help me work with others this is a massively multiplayer game  social skills must be important here so i picked a base of i think 13 or 14 there was perception as well  i can be perceptive so lets put that high too i cant remember the base stat but i do know that by the time id finished and trained some of the learning skills to level 34 i had perception of 19 charisma of 18 or 19  willpower and intelligence i cant remember but i do know that after training instant recall to level 4 i had a memory stat of  8boy was that a mistakebut i didnt know so i undock and zomg wow this station was huge oh aura was talking in the background back then the tutorial was nothing like it is now i had 30000 skill points a shiny ship looked a bit odd though the velators wing was unbalanced and the entire universe in front of meand wow that station was bigthere i am floating in space listening to aura and she said something to me something like but do not fire on another pilot as there will be consequencesso naturally the first thing i do is open fire on another player and im dead what huh i redock and get a new velator and undock and im deadthis repeated for about 2 or 3 minutes and i got bored and quit i came back about an hour later and i was able to undock without dying shrug so i go off and finish the tutorial kill the drone in dead space whatever that was and mine 100 units of veldspari cant remember everything from back then but i joined a corporation beasts of burdon i think which were  an alliance corp i wasnt sure but i mined away and helped out on either a mission or complex  i couldnt understand why they kept telling me not to fire on all the rats  i didnt want to listen  i wanted to blow things up now of course i understand the importance of not getting full stage aggression when youre doing a 710 complex
but anyway this corporation wasnt for me but i had a friend whod joined colossus technologies  the oldest corp in the game kewlso i went to 00 and ratted away mined a lot they are  were a mining corporation the people were friendly enough but they didnt like combat i have no idea if this is still true youd have to ask them eventually myself and another player got kicked out of ctec due to our wanton disregard for the corporations rules of no piracy i didnt really understand what piracy was and to be honest we werent being pirates we were just pvping but hey ho  it didnt fit with the corps ethos and that was that by now id realised that my original characters attributes were to be honest terrible so i rerolled and created an achura character 1010883so i formed a corporation with my friend and went off into the unknown didnt have much success but eventually he went off to join iron and i joined oxide part of the north and if we put this story onto x64 speed he joined triumvirate i did a while later i left went back to empire to do some missions went back to triumvirate tri split we stayed with my corp left for a bit for faction warfare and other interests and then came back 3why do you want to know this well id like to give some background as to what ive done in eve ive been a miner a trader a pirate a pvper a 00 citizen a suicide ganker a scammer a trader ive been a corp thief ive built and produced ships ive moon mined and my god complex reactions in a pos never again and ive run a corp ive been corprobbed ive had a spy enter my own corp with the intent on taking me down revenge for my previous corp theft  and successfully  i lost a very expensive deadspace raven to that ive been in 200 vs 200 fleet fights with titans motherships and carriers ive taken part in faction warfare ive done roaming gangs nano gangs reconsb gangs and ive soloed ive done exploration ive missioned for empire races and pirate npcs alike ive done complexes both as firepower and tankat this point in the game ive done just about everything i can think of except pilot a capitol ship and thats coming along on my alt at some point in the next couple of monthsand if theres one thing ive noticed in this game its buggy as hell it can be very confusing and there is almost no documentation on how to do well anythingfor example when i was doing moon mining and complex reactions do you know what i had to do i had to work out by myself well this
hi my name is matthew newton and im 25 years old i live in nottingham uk by day i am a network and it technician for a top 10 accountancy firm my role is to keep our companys network operational anything from single computers to multiple thousands of pcs laptops wireless devices and more i help run our firms ip phone system and generally spend a lot of time doing very technical stuff bug hunting in our propriety software writing some code here and there and dealing with end users who need x sorting out because y wont function hint turn it onnow a lot of the csm for the current council came forward with specific issues and goals some wanted to change how certain aspects of 00 warfare work some wanted to look at high sec space and how it functions and some wanted to look at balance between either different ships races or play styles id like to concentrate my campaign on something which i think is different the technical aspects of the gamei dont stand for any particular cause or play style  im more or less of the mind each to their own sure i have an opinion on whether level 4 missions in high sec need changing or whether nanoships needed a nerf no d  but i dont think theres anyone so far who has wanted to look at the bugs in the game as their main aspect of their campaignfor example id be looking at why certain skills dont always function properly id be looking at issues with the forums and website id be looking at how come when you do x y happens when it shouldntid also be looking at the documentation and implementation of new player experiencesnow i just want to raise my hands here i am not looking to dumb down the game in any way i like that eve is complicated i like that eve has its  um  little ways and features but these are things that ive picked up over time through trial and error not because the manual told meill give you a good example when im in the fitting screen sometimes im dragging a module across and it sort of freezes on the screen  it ghosts the image of the module in the middle of the screen and it wont move  even undocking or changing sessions wont change this how do you get rid of it move another module or an item in your cargo bay that removes the remnantanother example sometimes a ship will stick on my overview i can change sessions jump systems and so forth but therell be a ship and pilots name at say perhaps 9370km away from me all the time the ship isnt there its just that the overview hasnt updated itself how do you fix it double click on the overview title to make it truncate and then double click to expand it again and voilawhy does it do thisi dont knowbut i want to find out and i want to fix it all those annoying little bugs that dont really affect the game i mean sure having that ship there wont alter anything but its annoyingya knowand thats what i want fixed thats what i want to pursue i want to investigate issues such as thisi want to know why when i refresh an items market details my sell order or buy order screen gets pushed behind that window so i cant click on iti want to know why my drones dont behave properly or do as i tell themi want to know why on some missions releasing drones is fine but on others i get full stage aggression
id like to know why the text layer overview the drones x symbol general text on the screen causes graphical lag on the client and a big drop in fpswhy hasnt the sound effects been updated much why do my heavy drones which fire neutron blasters have the same sound effect as my small drones which fire electron blasters and so forththats what i want fixed and since after what 6 years almost they havent been fixed i want to be the person to stand up and say no moredont get me wrong i am also for new content i do not wish that new content be delayed or not implemented in order to fix these bugs  expansion and new content is what drives this game and any mmorpg without it people will get bored and leave but at the same time i think issues like the ones above need to be addressed they need to be brought to the front of the queue and they need to be looked at can they always be fixed perhaps not but id like to know why id like to be able to speak to the programmers and database maintainers and find out exactly what causes these issuessome of them cannot be fixed i dont doubt ccp has people looking at these issues but i firmly believe that they can be complacent i think over the years theyve been caught up in adding new content or spending time looking at some things whilst ignoring other things small things  they arent game breaking by any means but theyre there at the back of my mindnow after all of that text heres a tldri want to fix the bugs and i want to make it not necessarily easier but more accessible to new and old players alikemaybe im wrong perhaps i place too much emphasis on it perhaps these issues do not bother you if thats so then obviously dont vote for me but if they do bother you if you do have an issue with something  even if youve bug reported it perhaps it hasnt been fixed or youve not had an answer to your satisfaction id like to know about iteven if i dont get elected to the csm im going to start a database of these errors submitted by the players and im going to be sending this information to ccp im going to do what i can to get the gears moving regardless of whether i get my free holiday to ic err i mean join the council or not these issues have been if youll excuse the pun bugging me for a while now and i cannot think of a better way to look into them than being right there in iceland to take a look and the big picturei apologise for the lengthy introduction as well i do have a tendency to talk a lot  but i felt it was important to give you some background on my experience how ive joined this community and what i have to offerif you have any questions by all means please contact me or reply in this thread id greatly appreciate any feedback you can provide

npc corp chat works wonders as you get a nice selection of random peoplei had quite a few discussions in the aliastra channel in the past and now i just approach random people in local or the militia channels and try to get them involvedi used to have a blog but that got hacked and spammed to hell still need to fix that if i have the time for that some day but at least well work on a wiki soon i think that benefits the csm more than individual pagesjust waiting for people to come to you doesnt work very well you actively need to approach people
the current csm will still be in place at fanfest but around that time the election will be held too so i would expect some time late novembersadly i dont have the exact dates
call early elections forget about the polls
thanks 
agreed though if they were given larger cargo baylarger drone bay instead of seperate fuel bay i think it would be more interesting forcing a degree of compromise on fuelammocap boosters ie more uninjected setups that are only good in combat for a minute or so before they have to bug out and recharge due to having more fuelammo instead  these ships are supposedly given espionage role description meant to stay behind enemy lines for a while so they need space for spare ammospare dronesfuel the covops cloak is needed because burning fuel to get about as the only way to remain off scanner till engagement is ridiculous
eccm is underpowered even if you fit two eccm mods to a battleship and gimp its midslots a fully fledged falcon still has around a 50 chance of jamming you every 20 seconds and not to mention it has about the same on two cruiser class ship with low sensor strengths so even if you fit to counter these ships it doesnt really work majority of the time unless you get extremely lucky drawing me to conclusion that this method of counterattack is not viable  you may aswell not forsake your midslots to use these modules
mate ecm is only viable on ships like the falcon and scorp specificaly because they get bonuseswithout those bonuses ecm is completely pointless and uselesspointmost battleships have a sensor strength of 22 plus pointstry to fit the equivalent of 22 points ecm on any other ship than a falcon or scorp or kitsune and you failez answer and quite effective is of course dronesive seen plenty of falcon pilots fall due to drone aggro
unoriginal whinetroll is unoriginal
did it occur to you that the guy you where up against had high skills in that area and that his ship had super bonuses on itme thumbs down
i have no problem with looking ata slight buff to eccm but ecm has already been seriously nerfed to the point that its only feasible to use on very specialized ships so thumbs in the middle
one falcon with allv skills faction jammers 3x sda ii and a t2 jam strength rig gets 653 jam chance against a hyperion and an 864 jam chance against even a kronos assuming both have 2 overheated eccm assuming you mean t1 battleships and your guess of 2 minutes is accurate you just wound up on the wrong side of a 08 chance  it happens about 1 time in 130 if you mean to suggest that this is the case reliably i might suggest that you fit the correct kind of eccm in future
having an alliance is practically required to live in nullsec  but alliances need not live in nullsec take electus matari as a prime example to my knowledge they still have no nullsec aspirations beyond specific campaigns theyre stated reason for existence is homeland defense of the republic they are very different in focus to uk and both are nothing at all like the nullsec alliances that you have in mind we are both very small alliances broght together by mutual interest in rp  the same rp that we are now being excluded fromwhy does everyone keep bringing up sf in these discussions frankly it doesnt seem likely they would enlist in the militia if they could their stated policy is that all militias are considered red regardless of factionthe reason is that they like uk couldnt care less about sovereignty in fact they moreso than uk as they are opposed to concepts such as regional sovereigntybut you raise an interesting point consider that goonfleet could if they chose seperate from goonswarm leave the alliance with alts in charge and join fw they are a corp with well over 3000 members and quite a good many capitals and titans plural to an unknown degree yet the mechanics would allow them to join fw but not uk does this make senseyes its an identity a family as such if you were travelling with your family would you stay at a hotel where each family member was assigned a seperate room even the babies and could only talk with each other by phone if the united nations ruled that all countries would have to break up into city states in order to be un members would such a demand be considered a matter of semantics if ccp said that even corps had too much power and that to be in fw everyone had to join the npc militia corp would this be a minor change mere semanticssome alliances are just a name and a set of blues but rp alliances in particular are a bit more than that asking us to just discard our history and our identity in order to rejoin the war the alliance was created to fight is punative the big nullsec powerhouses dont care about capturing complexes and they already have access to everything else fw has to offer they can already cyno in their capital fleets and camp the fw territories all they want without joining fw why dont they do so because theres no motivation for them to do so theyre endgame is territory control and fw doesnt offer it our endgame is participation in the storyline and weve been evicted from the story

im sorry i just dont want big 00 alliances in my fw i feel the requirements you posted are insanely easy to meet and you even tailor them so you specifically can join into fwif alliances are allowed to enter fw at all which i hope they never do i hope you receive some severe penalties
i think you are missing something here and it is importanti have given statistical analysis of our current standings average and compared it to some other alliances one is considered an rp group the other 2 are very firmly not rp groupsof the 4 the ushrakhan is the smallest and a very large margin we are one third the size of the cva and they in turn are smaller than the other two feel free to look at groups you consider likely to join fw i think you will find that they have similarly diluted averagesi have stressed that whatever the threshold average standing should be that it should be very high you and i think someoneone else have both implied that the system i propose makes it easy for the ushrakhan specifically to access fwi return your attention to our current minmatar faction standing average 115 this is not at all high this would not satisfy my own criteria to allow alliances in we could not get in without forcing our own members to grind away at missions all day for a significant period of time i think it would take us months to reach the sort of level that i think should be required to access fwnow consider this every time we want to recruit a new corp that corp will need to have high republic standings if they do not then our average is pulled down if we want to recruit new members then they will need good standings else our corp average is pulled downthis system becomes increasingly difficult to achieve the larger the alliance gets even for an alliance of our size and we are not at all large fulfilling the criteria set here would be a herculean taski have even identified a method of tricking the standings and suggested a method of blocking it if i were trying to bias the system in our favour then i shot us in the foot right there i could have simply not pointed it out and used it to get us infor the ushrakhan to get into fw under this system all of its members would have to drag themselves over the equivalent of broken glass for a long time our membership is pvp based they are not big on mission grinding at allso im going to lay my cards on the table for you with an unpleasant truth i have real doubts that the ushrakhan would fulfill the criteria i am laying out here so you may ask why have i proposed such a systembecause the current system is unfair the current system forbids us from doing what we and all of those other rp groups out there set out to do all those years ago i ask that it should be possible for us to earn our right to do this there should be an opportunitybut if we fall short then that is our problem
i would point out that the fourth district  a caldari rp alliance setup in the january time frame  did actually dissolve holding corporation in place to participate directly in factional warfare the intention of the alliance was specifically for factional warfare organization and traininganyone who wants to argue that capitals and pos should be kept out of fw did not pay attention during the 2nd month of the conflict in black rise foom a 200 man gallente militia corp established a death star pos with capital fleet in black rise foom had previously been a major component of a 00 alliance from my understanding keeping alliances out does not keep capitals and poss out of fw
ccp tries to take this game way too seriouslynot letting them go on space whales wont stop pushing for this until whales are recognized as the only intelligent life in eve
no macross 7 was the gayest incarnation of macross ever1elevenon that note im all for macross plus macross zero sdf macross and macross frontier missing any especially plus plus was the best i think they actually took a swipe at macross 7 being U8D85U306EU8A71 or ancient history or something like that in macross frontier if i were asked to comment on macross 7 by someone interested in macross id tell them macross fans do not speak of this disaster it is a dark moment that will slide into forgotten memory

oh yes lets make it easier to drop big gangs unexpectedly out of thin air that will make eve better wont itthe current system benefits spaceholding alliances for all the hassle they go through to set up stuff without unduly punishing those that dontno change is needed
these forums are terrible can i suggest an ignore posts by user button as well
hell yes
its not that itll make things easier for macros but for new people to use macros some people are to lazy to learn macro languages or macro logic your making it easier for these people to macro which just brings even more macros into the gameyes other games fight macros but eves ui makes it difficult for these things already and ccp already has a lax policy on macros im sure that eve in comparison to wow has less bots why add more to ccps workload just for a few  commands
notsignedsorry but this would give macros way too much opportunity every five year old and his mama could take data mining and abuse to a whole new level with this
i dont know if its been asked of or not feel free to linky iti was thinking it would be great if i could sort contracts shipping type by cargo distance price tag destiationlocationetcetcseems like a mess and have to break it down by systemany suggesitonscomments
yepp more sort functions would be fine  ammount highlow sec t1t2faction itemsshipsto name a few which would make life a lot more easier when dealing with contracts
me supports own idea
so signedits quite cumbersome and slow
i think this would be a major buff to the courier professioni will bookmark this and in 1 week assuming that theres a wide consensus that this is a good idea it will be brought to the csm
yes
yes sorting functions in this game need a buff while were at it can we please please allow prioritized sorting in the market like any other table in existence doesie i sort by price and then jumps and it returns items in system in order of price followed by a pricelisted group 1 jump away etc instead of putting the prices in random order
this is an excellent idea well thought out and documented increasing the bonus from the marginal rigs and introducing new clever rigs drone bay increase please is a fantastic idea ten thumbs up
well with the discussion of balancing blob warfare and returning to smaller scale combat in recent months i felt that maybe the addition of a new cruiser the hvy bomber might go a long way to addressing this problempicture if you will a cruiser able to fit 2 bomb launchers or 4 cruise missile launchers instead of explosion radius bonus rather a rate of fire bonusof course since you could use the cruise missiles in high sec then this cruiser has utility there as well as in null secthis platform would probably be best modeled after the recon class of course
proposalinstead of all these complicated multivectored approaches to stopping nano i have a simple proposalkill agilityi like the mwd it should make you go fast but prevent you from turning well think about when you miniwarp currently the mwd increases mass and thats fine and good what im talking about is slashing agility 90 or more on activation this would allow using a mwd to get in range or escape but prettymuch only in a straight line if a pilot bothers fitting inertia stabs it would be possible to orbit but they would lack the slots to complete the nano preventing the ship from reaching ccps ludicrous speeds more likely than not pilots would end up using afterburners for orbiting and mwds for closing
there should be a way to deal if someone have many factions as negative where its impossible to be able to fly in all empire spaces without problemslong time ago ccp have an idea with interbus faction that faction have all four basic faction as positive so doing storyline missions for them could rise all of it but there is no interbus storyline agents afair it could be a good idea to give back storyline agents at least lvl1 so people with bad empire faction standings could rise it a bitstoryline missions for concord assembly could be very usefull too because security status got boost each time something like 10

one idea that i quite liked was have rats drop bpcs for meta 2 items in place of t1 lootthat would simultaneously stop the free drops pricing t1 industrialists out of the market and provide a large source of demand for those same t1 itemshowever the biggest reason to refine 00 bounty rat loot is to provide low end minerals a reduction in the tritanium supply coupled with an increase in demand would make veldspar even more profitable that it is at the moment
rats should only drop poor reprocessing value named items

810 excelent troll post
now now im sure star fraction would understand if you laid offrhetorical excess if you think a phrase like if you think that then you have mental problems is meant literally you need to visit the internet sometime you throw words at them sure but actual discussion no way
transparencytransparencytransparencywhich of course is fully defeated by your desire to be able to giggle and whisper in privateand the folks you represent im sure appreciate being referred to as partisan massesand of course comparing the csm and by extensionyourself to the british government is a pretty good fantasy ohand transparency save the groping in smokefilled rooms for your rp matesediteagerly awaiting lavista slagging you off in true januslike fashion 
so i take it you simply dont agree with the point that people play up to an audience of their mates in public and are generally more reasonable and open to negotiation when they are in a private conference with other delegates thenput it this way in iceland we had zero histrionics  zero personal attacks  zero trolling and flaming across the conference table in the formal meetings sure part of that is that face to face people are far less outrageously insulting than they tend to be on the internet  but also because they are removed from the gaze and urgings of their mates they are able to function in a less combatant rolethis isnt alien technology and bizarre philosophical pipedream theory im telling you here this is how human beings function its how groups interact with groups go and talk to a group of beeredup arsenal fans on saturday night about the failings of their midfield game youll get laughed at youll see group dynamics hostility hell if it was millwall fans you might get a serious kicking especially if you were wearing some other teams shirt but meet one of those guys on monday at work round the coffee machine youd get an entirely different attitude and might even have a decent discussionpeople play up to their mates in eve you have a situation where that group of mates can be 5000 strong and you simply arent going to get any kind of decent discussion with people playing up to 5000 partisan supporters against ingame enemies and hated rivals
1in iceland you all were there on an allexpense paid boondoggle with ccps stars in your eyes of course you will be happy little friendly bunnies with ccp footing the beer bill giving you tours nodding sagely at your sugestions and telling you you really matter and will make a differenceon return from icelandhello reality of not mattering nto to mention the outcome of certain discussions votes and statements made by yourself and others on the csm2the crap you run on about and the corporate hogwash our schoolboy lv has recently discovered is exactly why engineers technicians cops firefighters nurses bricklayers hod carriers farmers et all will always be more relevant and useful than you annoying doublespeaking nonproductive cerebral types otherwise known as marketing and communication typesa hod carrier can turn around at any time and point to the building site rising out of nowhere from his hard work all you corporate advisors marketers and related rubbish types are capable of is filling rooms with hot air killing trees due to reams of analysis leading to coffee stains as corporate logos and hogging bandwidth on forums in some effort to make yourself appear relevant and importanttldrhod carriersyouand your inability to get along with others on the csm is your failurenot the fault of noncsm outsiders alsoin case you missed ittransparencytransparencytransparencywhich was the supposed original intent of the csm trying to do deals without full view of the folks who playand pay forthis game is utter bull and smacks of elitism yeah editdarius is right btwread this again in case you missed itsmoke filled rooms are where roaches hide sunshine is the best disinfectantword
then well agree to disagree end of story and pointless to continue debating it
thered be no need to do deals if the issues were discussed before getting to a voting meeting actually thered be no need for discussion unless the ideasissues were actually decent and well thought through firsta lack of informed discussion has resulted in the current situation in the csm darius and bane have had good opinions and input maybe not often enough for some see below despite being accused of a multitude of sins personal issues with csm members need to be put aside and respect shown im a believer in respect gaining respect to other opinionsim all for transparency in all csm dealings ive stated in other areas that the current tools work if you want them to work open discussion with players which would inevitably involve some compromise or at least acknowledgment of opposing opinions on issues would naturally seem a good idea if the csm wants to be seen as working on behalf of all players thinking through issues and discussing their ramifications outside of voting meetings would also be seen as a positive thing to do as issues reaching voting would be more refined and stand a better chance of successful escalationpersonally id work with anyone if voted onto the csm simply because wed all be there to try and get player voices heard and we might just all want to also see the game we love playing develop if current csm factions arent participating its prolly due to a lack of respect shown or a lack of invitation to join in disregarding others simply because they have opposing or different viewpoints and opinions is just plain childishexpecting cooperation and all csm members actively participating might be idealistic but thats at least something to strive fortake carebruce hansen arithron
roflbecause you would prefer the csm to morph into your own private little club where you can scheme away and then present the outcomes as a fait accompli to the rest of us only further proves darius rightperhaps pointless to youbut transparency in your csm dealings is not pointless to the rest of us 
hi i currently work  but sadly unpaid  in the area of creative stuff that you cant exactly point to i have been in a room with people who come across like jade comes across in these forums there was no moderationwhy do you waste energy on a fruitless endeavour jade is never going to change the way jade acts ignore the personal attacks thats just how jade is pay attention to the message not the messenger and respond accordingly
fixed that for you
well done sir
sure molle and johnsonand a few dozen others are more powerful ingame but in terms of ability to actually affect the game itself i stand by the original devs and their girlfriends excepted of course
anyone can make suggestions to ccp the only difference is they actually have to sit down and listen to the csm sorry ccp devsjade has absolutely no ability to effect the game itself only an easire way of persuading the devs
which is still ahead of anybody else
no point whatsoever me addressing the specific bias and personal attacks herschel yamamoto all i suggest is that you run next time and put yourself in the spotlightbut i will repeat my point the absolute worst thing about this csm experience is the interaction on these forums there are some players who have tried to interact decently with the delegates and bring good issues to the forefront  but many many others that simply see it as an excuse to flame people without moderation and feel entitled to treat delegates like circus freaks for their amusementnothing i say to you will put a fault line into your sense of entitlement herschel therefore next time around its for you to demonstrate you can take it as well as you give it
bias are you seriously trying to accuse me of bias i voted for you i supported you on these forums against unwarranted attacks for months and for that matter i still do whenever i feel them to be unfair i never claimed you were the only problem on the csm and in fact i have explicitly stated the opposite repeatedly ive just gotten sick and tired of your oh woe is me facade your paranoid conspiracy theories and your constant picking of fights with those youre supposed to be working with your policy is often great but your personality is toxic
its a very easy claim to make and you are not the only one to make it ive lost count of how many weird sounding alts claimed to have voted for me then suddenly decided what a bad idea it was the first time i ended up disagreeing with any of their personal issue threads spooky ive seen nothing but bias and general attacks from you since meeting 3 and that was a long long long time ago but its fine you have a right to an opinion as do i  and that opinion is that i hope youll run next time and put yourself into the firing line and i hope you will demonstrate what a paragon of humankind you are able to be under fire from a host of people on these forums ultimately its easy to scapegoat its easy to play to the chorus not so easy to retain a sense of integrity and do what you promised to attempt in an election manifesto and ive gotten tired of your continual snipes and bias what you consider toxic is doubtless the fact that youve reached the limits of my patience for dealing equitably with personal attack and trolling as i said earlier  you seem to believe you are entitled to behave poorly in respect to csm delegates elected to this institution i dont recognize that entitlement nothing i can about that though save consider your comments in that light and resolve not to vote for you if you decide to stand next time but rest assured im not exactly wounded to the quick by your assessment of my personality im not crushed by goonswarm valuejudgments either end of the day ill live ill flourish and keep on enjoying the game of eve online i hope you find a way of enjoying it too the environment is big enough for us both  and perhaps once you no longer feel entitled to flame and troll me at will then ill stop considering you in such a negative light as a consequence
please note jade is speaking very much for himself there and he has made his feelings very clear he does not speak for me nor so far as i am aware anyone else in thisiz
actually you missed the important word should have beenshow respect when posting and interacting with fellow playersrespect is what is sadly missingtake carearithron
it occurs to me at this point to ask a question of you jade now my understanding is that you are not seeking reelection in the next round it thus follows that i wonder as to your demeanour after stepping downare you going to accept the decisions of the csm or are you going to refer to your days as chairman and make with the well what i would do and all that lark
i can show you messages of support in your campaign thread chatlogs where i tried to get corpies to vote for you and repeated messages of support between the time i read your manifesto and the time you decided muting was fun even then i limited my criticism to the act at hand  i stated that i didnt regret my vote and that i wanted you to stay on as a csm member when many were saying otherwise my public record is clear and whether you choose to believe me or not is utterly immaterial to me who said im a paragon of humanity im a total jerk the difference is im a jerk towards peoples ideas youre a jerk towards people ive had plenty of lowlevel wars in committees ive sat on in the pastand i dont mean forum sniping i mean facetoface and in one rather bizarre case a fistfight between two friends of mine but at the end of the day i could go out and have a beer with anyone and everyone involved in those fights as for me running youll find out one way or the other by the nomination deadline and thats all ill say about that for now here is a selection of quotes from your candidacy thread all from april or may as well theres a rather nice quote of yours from earlier in this thread that the mods deleted and thus that i wont quote directly that basically admitted that you had an antigoon bias from the beginning  see here for what i mean specifically post 7 considering that that was precisely my complaint about your personality  your simultaneous desires to pick fights and stay aloof from the consequences of them  i feel justified in my accusations you are entitled to your opinions i am entitled to call you on them and viceversa were both adults we both live in free countrieswell mostly and we both have our right to freedom of speechwell mostly  were entitled to be mean to each other whatever our positions
i remember a guy i went to highschool with who fervently maintained that there is honor in counterstrikehmmmhate to play breakdancers advocate U7B11 but its hard to imagine owning 00 ever becoming rewarding in any real since considering its all a damned video game i cant seem to figure out a way to do it any implementation would require not only the suspension of disbelief but a souldriven assertion that there is significance in what is accomplished in eve as breakdancer i know such assertions can only exist where rather than a derived impetus the choice is a spontaneous function of natural senses attempting to force the connection in eve would probably lead one instead to observe no reward and keep coming back to the game over and over with the aim of willing such meaning into existence for the real world this works pretty effectively but its doubtful such a phenomenon can occur in a video game00 is wrong place to search for meaning as a natural consequence of nondeterministic volition the only value in eve is derived from playing and having fun there lies the basis for what can be sold through ccps universe

i believe the csm is an excellent idea gone awry the basic discussion format of proposed changes seems to me to be mostly underutilised in addition we have had an expansion from ccp that seemed to ignore a lot of the hot topics the csm are trying to bring forwardnow the basic founding principle of the csm  to me  was accountability of ccp to the players ie what the hell are you guys doing additionally a core principle of the csm should be transparency ie this is what we are doing when we are doing it and whynow speaking as a 00 dweller i feel a shade ignored most of the press for this game focuses on 00 and its shenanigans nevertheless i see a lot of empire fixes so to speak i realise that the vast swathes of players occupy empire  along with 00 alts  so catering to your extant playerbase is a nobraineron the other hand exactly how many empire dwellers love running missions and such how many have enjoyed faction wars how many of those have developed a taste for trying their luck out in 00it seems to me that the simplest way to learn about what people want for the csm and ccp to come up with a questionnaire and advertise it when we boot up the client  what do you want from eve leave it up for a month and then collateas regards the inner mechanisms of the csm well people will be people even in internet space much like in real life toleration of idiocy laziness and downright rudeness will get you more of the same it is up to the csm as people to deal with it
someone from csm needs to come over here again and actually tell us what they heard from ccp on this issue this is day 9 since you guys heard something from ccp 9 days is more than enough to pass along the information or are we screwing around again and the issues miraculously slipped through the cracks againcome on guys dont make me bump this thread over and over and over over and over again
no not at allbut right now theres some issues with planning a meeitng with ccp for discussing these issues thus we cant do a whole lot right nowuntil then im afraid i cant say anymorealso i swear i posted here 3 days ago
okay lets rotate this back to the front of the que to be ignored again by the csms

i support this idea
fitting 2 eccm pretty much gimps every setup it needs to hard counter ecm in a less worthless waytheres no need to nerf ecm again though
this totally agree and do not want to see a nerf to ecm or boost to anything else also i dont think anything needs nerfing at the moment so why fix stuff that aint broken
im really confused what a lot of the proposed changes on this thread will do to the no barge comment  you do know you never really need to dock and a corp can be disbanded whilist you are out in space right on overall taxes a 0 tax for 3 months increased by 5 a month to 15 max sounds about right on restriction of buysell orders  are you serious anyone can have a buysell alt in jita that never undocks and can make a oneman corp that really cant be fixedfreighters  that i can kinda see why but at the same time dropping the freighter pilot into a oneman corp would work just as well so as long as you just made one for the purpose of a run and then closed it i cant see the deterrent there sorry just poking holes into good ideas where i can so they can becomebetter
you cant force people too leave npc corps there are people who dont likewant too join a player corp and be vunarable too pvp
as a new player i think the npc starter corps are a great idea they allow you to find you feet in a hostile universe without the worries of war decs and player corp politicstaxing in npc corps might sound harsh but i think its fair considering the protection they providethis subject does raise horrible issue of should seasoned players remain in npc corps staying in an npc corp does allow a player to isolate themselves which really isnt in keeping with the spirit of the game its also a ideal habitat for isk farmers and macro miners however making people leave npc corps does seem wrong when you are a active member of the community
ok i admit it i want players to be encouraged to play with other people in a freakin mmorpg mmorpg are not solo player games and eve which is built around confict and player interaction should certainly be different from the wows of the world read it again dude read what i linked again and again and again claiming that you know what ccp really intends is bull you arent ccp you are not psychic you dont know what they intend i read what they wrote and npc corporations are for the followingnew playersplayers who left a corp and looking for a new onei dont care if you play the game on a small casual soloplayer level that is completely supported but you should not have benefits in doing so you should have some restrictions no one wants people forced out of npc corps and shoved into 00 entry systems but a small penalty for remaining in a npc corp longer than you probably should is certainly reasonablei want new players to be encouraged to go out and make friends make enemies make havoc or make empires or do whatever but for thousands of players to sit in one system and grind for hours upon end and receive no encouragement to venture outside is just bad eve is a wonderful universe and a lot of people are missing out and quit after a few months due to boredom they need to be shown the path of awesomeness that is eve not herded in high sec and given no reason to ever go outside
will have to agree with this idea progresive tax is the way to go imoeve should never be 100 risk free like it is for some ppl
progressive taxing over time is but one step to limit npc corp campersnot being able to close the spammedtodeath npc corp channel cant minimize it only shrink it to a fixed size like your cargo windowlimit the agents that a npc corper can use and their quality for nuub schools and npc schoolslimit the hull classes that can be usedwhat is the rp rationalle simple nuub schools cannot afford to support pilots in larger ships and their schools are inadequite to the enhanced training needed for higher tier skills npc corps likewise cannot support the advanced technologies used by the member and have to tax heavily to support their numerous stationsplanetspolice ect
thisand on the matariamarr front ive heard of several capital battles including one with at least 10 and as many as 30 capitals i think though im not sure the exact numbers and if they wanted to the nullsec powerhouses could throw capitals into the fw regions without being in the militia any time so long as they dont care about having to rat their sec status back up and assuming they care about sec status at all that they havent tells me their interest levelon the matari side nmtz did the same thing you did by the way im not really sure they even exist any more thanks to that i could be wrong though
i strongly support this thanks for raising it ugleban alliance so long as it meets a strict standings requirement should be allowed into faction warfare
as i help a lot of people out on missions i think it would be good to be able to do the followingif youre in a mission as part of a fleet and someone comes in to grief  pirate someone then all members of the mission runners fleet should be able to fight against the intruder as assistance this is how things would work in the real world in theory not just having to sit around watching your mate getting attackedthis would also enable a mission runner a chance to get some assistance if he was being held to ransome by asking in his local or other channels for help getting a fleet up and running and having backup coming ini think this would make missioning more safer and fun and increase the options available for people who arent in ships suitable for fighting a pvp ganking ship
mission piracy are you in highsec when this is happening how are they fighting  suicide gank
yep been cases where griefers come in and demand ransoms etc and things like thatit could also be used for when people steal miners ore etc
a fleet can engage the hostile but they have to flag themselves hostile to him first generally this is accomplished by remotereppingsupporting the targetthe aggressor will eather enjoy the increased target pool or get frustrated that he cant break the target and exit the mission

im all for it just get rid of insta capshield recharge on dock sit your butt ouside like the rest of us or empty your wallet at joes ez repair shop in station
no the issue is you are trying to fly caldari ships like they are gallente or minmatar each caldari ship has a role it is up to you to determine the role
what an absurd idea can we please have all the beneits of a scram all the benefits of a disruptor and none of the drawback of using up a midmidslots are the most valuable slot type and you already have the most this is frankly obscene to ask for even more
regulate the gtc traders cos these prices are insane rl price still the same and isk price goes up to the border of insanity
i support 
alternatively please get a better job so you can afford to subscribebuy your own gtcs and not have to support isk inflation via real money trading isk inflation which ironically increases how much isk the gtcs are worth  and also contribute to the continuance of ccp by giving them money they can spend on development as someone who pays in game money for game time you are adding precisely nothing to the game except using bandwidth and increasing lag
someone suggested this earlier this weekmy stance is thats supply and demand a fixed prices would be worse for eve as a whole in my eyesa better option would be to remove gtcs completely but thats just a lesser evil really
try to live in hungarywhat i buy gtc on forums that bought from ccp in real money so i support the ccp in that way
just check the forums so many people buy gtc cos they cant pay in real moneyand if you remove that option lots of accounts will be closed and ccp lose more money
they are actually adding just as much to this game and to ccp as everyone elsedont understand why some ppl have such a hard time understanding thisand as for the fixed price issue thats a big no really its all about supply and demand just like everything else in eve
no no a thousand times no its pure supply and demand in an optional market if you dont want to pay you dont have to and if you do want to pay then the prices obviously arent too highwhat how do you figure removal of gtcs is a good idea gtcs for isk is one of the single best ideas ccp has had making this game
because gtc  isk is causing inflationisk for gtcs on the other hand is ok
no gtc  isk does not cause inflation at allwhat is cause inflation is the fact that farmers uses gtcs to pay for their macros due to the low barrier to entry which gtc trading causes the economical growth that comes from these farmers its bad for evebut my point that removing gtcs all together is not to say i want them removed but the point is that the applications for gtcs are limited i can only think of the people who cant afford for eve where its a solution the only reason the gtc system is there today is because you cant stop it so you have to regulate it
a lot of the price is market manipulation i can go and pretend to sell 10 gtcs to ten alts thus making everybody think the prices have went up i can also post lots of fake wtb gtc adds at certain prices to lock in the minimum value of other traders who will decide to compete with wtb prices insted of wts pricesyou could ask for 30 day gtcs etc so you get less and pay less for it perhaps this is what you want more easier to manage sums of isk rather than massive pill to swallow every 60 days
what ya complaining about if u dont want to pay the isk for it buy your on time card or use the normal ways how you should pay for this game
there is nothing to regulate  ccp gave you tools to securely buysell gtc and the means to make isk free market handles the rest so long as there is high demand with low supply  the gtc will be dear
well maybe its a good time to start banning macro users not only pasting same answer we will investigate it specialy if someone is sending petition after petition with same nicknames mining ice 237 for 30 days in montheverybody knows locations with tons of miners everybody knows that most of them are macro characters nicks ggfdvvwgtgh mining all time everyone except gms
if you dont like it dont pay it
these windows have tabs like quantity volume and so on but none is helpfull at least since they only sort opened asset tabs the items in the selected stationthe only option for all is the name sorting functionwhat we need are options that let you sort by jumps quantity volume or overall volume of the all asset hangers at onceso we can easily see what deliveries are close to my route what asset has the most oer less quantity of an item or which hangerdelivery is fully loaded for a freighter runthat would really help to run the supply chain for your corp or let pilots on travel easily see that they can pick up a small item on their waythx
i support the extra jb idea 3 would be a good ammount although not needed it would be nice
because you need bigger blobs in fact many larger blobs trying to providence runs from smaller cva blobs ofc jump portals is a great psy game making people unsure how many people are gonna show up in that systemjump bridge creates more action for sure but it also means that you need less blobing and the fact is that jump bridges are here so making able to have 3 in one system does only improve logistics and management it will not make it cheaper to have jump bridges it will marginally make it safer in the end the bigger gang will always be accused for blobbing and smaller gangs may if they intrude wrong regions get blobbed sometimes cva have maximum fleet size to not outnumber the enemy but understandably not every 00 holders have that and cva does not all the time either but blobbing has very little to do with allowing 3 jb in same system
we are effective in providence when running smaller fleets for sure we get a lot of training in that sometimes we outnumber our enemies sometimes they outnumber us thanks for the creds 
i think this would help a lot of people  including me but this rig would be dedicated to mining bargesexhumersindustrial ships rorqualtransport ships small freighters well depends how ccp will make the fitting settingst1  1 warp stenghtscan resolution bonus  100 max targeting range  100 t22 but can only fit one rigscan range bonus  75 max targeting range 75to be discussedi know ccp is all for pvp but its not really pvp when you get caught in one of these ships
stabs should never be effective on combat ships and now they are very limiting with the scanresrange limits but they should make noncombat ships very difficult to catch which is something they do not doalong with the drawbacks they should provide considerable maneuverability and mass benefits to make aligning and getting away a lot more swift this will enable ships fitted for getting way to well get away
the active warp drive speed is set at 3 au for a battleship an increase in the active speed would cut out dead time from the game i propose an increase of the speed from 3 au to 6 au or greater with along with an increase of the warp ships of other shipspro more time can be wasted on other subjectspro unlike most ideas the frame work is already put in place to change the value their is a warp drive speed for every shippro an increase would be equally beneficial to every player conhauling and hauling missions become easiercounter  hauling missions will adjust their price rewardspro  con the galaxy travel times will be even smaller making response time in 00 and low sec faster

sorry but i dont see any reason for a ship like this to be implemented heavy bomber in theory sounds good although in practice would not do anything great if we have a ship introduced then it should have a good purpose which this one doesnt
would be a pretty funny comedy ship running around blowing up your own gang mates like a clown in a mini full of explosives sounds good
lol lots of people didnt see the purpose of putting cruise missiles on a frigbut guesswhatit happened thumbs up
hmm well maybe better to give some much needed attention to the battlecruiserhow many cruiser classes do we need im thinking black ops bc or better yet marauder style bcsorry cant support this idea atm
i think a 3rd bc is favourablei dont see a need for a cruiser doing sb stuff
nano does not need to be fixed the weapons system doleave nanophaggotry as it is now but increase the explosion velocity and radius of missiles as many can indeed catch a speed ship but their pointlessly useless explosion radii  velocity means that they dont even scratch the energy field surrounding the ship ie shieldsmake drones capable of keeping up with the ship theyve overtaken and introduce small  medium web droneslower the bonuses of massreduction fittingsdont change webs dont make scrams turn off mwds increase the inertia modifier for mwdsswitch the bonus percentages between halo  snake setsproblem solved but speed is not dramatically impacted
how many times must you people repost the same crap over and over learning skills are not forced on people its a choice like implants it has benefits only if you invest time in it which applies to the whole of eve so if you cant see the beneift of time investment then this is not the game for you
eve is a world where might is right perhaps some of you are feeling that this is not right in real life sense but eve is a role play world where those that have more experience friends skill points and isk stomp on the weaker opponents to protect new and casual players ccp has given you the npc corporations which coincidentally also harbor tons of isk farmers so when you join an npc corporation you toggle the aggression off modei have a lot of respect for fellow eve players but once you are out of npc corporation for me you have toggled the aggression on mode if you would like to never concern about pvp you either stay in aggression off mode ie the npc corp or you make enough isk to hire someone to do the fighting for you
again please stop misleading other pilotsfrom what i have seen there is only the one member of the csm who is  completely incorrectly  bring igic issues into what should be an oocbenefitofallplayers environmentthe rest of us would like to get on with the task for which we were elected and represent all pilots in space weve not had meetings the last few weeks as you couldnt lead and this hiatus ended when ankh took the reins that you are unwilling to holdthe csm should be and can be a force for good in eve the attitude displayed here however is actively preventing that from happening work with everyone until the end of your term of office pleaseinanna zuni
yeah you condemingbelittling and attempting to isolate jade in full view of the public yet again does what to strengthern peoples perception of the csm do you even know how to communicate in private in a productive and civil manner
communicating in private from those you are representing is a privilege not a right the people you represent need to trust that youre going to make the right decisions behind closed doors and if they cant see that in public first where is that trust going to come from blind faith
i dont think wqeve had any truly terrible csm reps this time around although i do feel that some have performed their elected role better than others my opinion on their performance is below im not saying i can do the job better in fact i am sure i couldnt im just being an armchair analyst herenote  this is based on what ive read on the forums and chat logs but i know this is not the whole picture because i got bored after about chat log 5 and as an empire carebear tend to not bother reading posts about 00 mechanics or pvp1 jade  started out well but i feel has deteriorated under the pressure of being in so many crosshairs something he has admitted himself didnt help himself by his willingness to engage in forum wars2 darius  started out not too good i couldnt see much evidence of constructive discussion in the first few chat logs but i feel has gotten slightly better has been a little too keen to take shots at jade3 bane  not the best he seems to have some good ideas and clearly has knowledge of 00 mechanics but seemed unwilling to want to discuss them either in the meetings or on the forums posting record is sparse and sometimes aggressive4 lavista vista  has had good forum presence and has shown willingness to engage in debate one of the better performing csms5 hardin  i had trouble remembering the 9th member of the csm i dont know if hes just been active in the threads im not reading but i dont remember much input in the chat logs either69 serenity ankhesentapemkah innana deirdra  seem to have quietly gotten on with the job a little more forum interaction would have been nice thoughi have two accounts and already know who i will be voting for if they stand  one is a serving csm and the same one i voted for in the original elections who got in and the other is someone who every time they post i find myself agreeing with pretty much every wordi think people now have a much better idea of what the csm is for and what it is able to achieve  i do hope though that next time around we get as decent a crosssection of the playing public as we have had this time but hopefully with more individuals able to push their election platforms through while not being blinkered to the big picture i dont have a problem with issue bias  heck we all vote for csm members based on the issues they support  provided that they dont lose sight of what is good for the game as a whole
the fact you take any and all oppotunities to make sly remarksinnuendos against jade at anyevery oppotunity kinda makes your personal feelingsmaturity real clear jade constantine  i personally think you have gotton a bit of a raw deal for starters you have to deal with some of the most immature playersalliance and you have become the subject of many a witch hunt however its partially your own fault you always rise to the bait you never let it slide always gotta shove your point down peoples throats which just irritates and wind them upthe csm has failed in my eyes becuase there is no true accountability and lets face it you get what you paid for and in this case we got a bunch of unpaid bickering emotionally stunted net nerds invovled in what affects them soly who have clearly bitten more than they can chewi voted for that young lady with a long name starting with an a i think not seen much of her at all poor thing shes had to be sidelined whilst you children moanded and groanedif there was no free trip would anyone bother trying for the next council
i dont see why everyones so hung up on the trip a trip spent in committee rooms is hardly a trip worth fighting for i mean yes you get to go clubbing in a foreign country which is nifty i guessthough i imagine itll be a  to order drinks but to me the primary appeal is that its two days spent with people who i can talk about eve with without having to compare it to wow well that and having an opportunity to get an answer to what the heck the devs are thinking on some issues straight from the horses mouth but dont think that just because it resembles a vacation that it actually will be
ok thank you for an update i guess we will wait still i would like to know as to what difficulties you guys are having with ccp especially if it might affect this ongoing issue
it got my vote
sounds good
signed
awww yeah
supported
signed
i know i supported this but everytime i talk to my fellow goons about capitals and tell them im planning on training minmatar they just brow beat me about not training for a rev its not a hard change and there is a reason not many people fly this ship
i think the question was is this issue part of the csm agenda not what are the proposed ccp changes
never gunna give you up
if you look back a few pages youll see that this issue was approved by the csm many weeks ago
right the real question is whether ccp are actually doing anything about this or any other csmdebated topic i dont doubt that some form of discussion was had by you guys and maybe suggestions passed on to ccp but its the last step which has all the uncertainty you say you cant update us on that which i dont really understand but its presumably not your call so i guess were going to keep sporadically bumping this thread until ccp decide to tell us the score
please fix
i like this idea its a pain to log onto sisi and notice that your character is already behind on skills and the new modsships you want to try out you cant even get into since the skills you needed to fly the ship you cant even use
i highly support vistas idea and just for safety i wish to echo and point out what was being said earlier namely thisif skills are going to be trained in mere minutes to an hour or so at most then this is a very good precaution and a system that would probably work
the fact that people are roaming around systems apart from a fleet makes this really nice jumping between systems and sneaking around being unreported is pretty nice think covert for this its not to move fleets or anything but to move small groups of ships around undetected its not just for getting around gatecamps
cov ops cloak
ecm hasnt been nerfed what the hell you all talking about it was given a boost if anything and now is by far the most effective form of ewar everyone knows that it seems i have a bunch of whineass caldari frickin trolls responding to this i like flying solo from time to time and if i cant counter one ship effectively with any tactic other than bring in more people it effects this part of the game negatively as a test i fit eccm knowing i was up against it  i fully expected to die so its not a whine in that sense only that i couldnt take anyone down with me for using the right tactic it felt a bit lobsidedi have run the figures a fully fledged falcon pilot has between 4655 chance of jamming a battleship with two eccm which is basically only a dominix if you still want to tackle etc and yes i did fit the correct ones herschel youre doing great work here on the forums but lay off the trolling mate i have come to the conclusion that eccm needs a boost as opposed to the other and i am rewriting op to sound it off
if youre fitting two overheated eccm and you still get jammed reliably by a single falcon for several minutes at a time youre fitting the wrong eccm it will happen occasionally by chance but as i said the chances are very low being less than 1as for buffing eccm i dont especially have a problem with it  two overheated eccm is a massive investment in sensor strength and the fact that you still get jammed out 23 of the time with thatalbeit with a very specialized setup is kind of scary i made a post a while back about logistics ships designed for remote eccm and id love to see something like a sensor strength skill or even fourthough youd have to lower baseline sensor strengths a little to compensate so that you have to get the skill to 3 or so for parity i was criticizing your numbers not your objective
i have no idea where you pulling these figures from fella you should perhaps look into things a little more before spouting rubbish eft figures show a falcon is capable of jamming a bs fitted with two eccm 49 of the time every 20 seconds the other 10 seconds is spent trying to get a lock so you have 10 seconds lock time every 40 unless you get lucky if thats too hard for you to understand maybe you should try another game eccm is underpowered and useless ccp please fix this countermeasure

are you taking into account the overheat bonus
i just love constructive criticism
val you can say encouraged as much as you want buy your suggestion are about forcing people not encouragingwhat should encourage people to play in corporation is the people in the corporation and the support they give most corporations instead dont give support to the players but only demand things from them if you are so lousy as a ceo that arent capable of giving better support to a player than what he get in the npc corp you should not get a hand from ccp to recruit people corporations have all the instrument to attract players but they need to be good corporations lousy corporations give nothing edit btw speaking of coherence why you dont put the face of someone in player corporation here at the moment the person hiding in a npc corporation are you
in support of the op
im sorry but that is the worst rationalization ive ever read youre saying that if you leave your alliance your family unit will be magically parsed and destroyed how you came to this conclusion i cannot even guess you can leave the alliance create a chat channel and a mailing list called alliance replacement and tada  you have all communication back you have everything back if you dont hold 00 aspirations who cares if youre in a collection of corps with a unified goal and unified communication or if youre in an alliance you are not being excluded from fw you are excluding yourselves from fw an alliance especially in your case is just a name why not just shelve it do the 45 minutes of work to have every ceo set bluesreds and send out corp mails and be done with it you dont even have to talk to the militiamen if you dont want to just set blink off and do your own thing your ts doesnt change your killboard doesnt change your chat channels do change in name only and your bluesreds list takes a little bit longer to update you can even continue complaining that you think alliances should be able to join fw the only difference is that while youre moaning you can actually be doing something the point is if you actually feel strongly about it then you shouldnt care about the little bit of extra work that would go into it its sure as  a lot easier than getting every corp to jack their standings up which you all seem to be more than willing to do you are the only ones keeping yourselves from doing this  understand thatand when history looks back and wonders why for a few months your member corps were not in the uk alliance you can just tell them that you had to work around the game mechanics you know like when alliances didnt exist
your logic is fallacious keeping alliances out of fw doesnt necessarily keep capitals and poses out of fw that is correct however if you allow an alliance to maintain a 00 presence and an fw presence you increase the likelihood that the entity in question will drag more poses and capital ships into the equation why because they can afford to
and when ccp do not allow alliances in then the ushrakhan the identity the history all of that is done it no longer existsif there are no alliances waiting to be allowed in then there no longer exists the reason for the change and it wont happenthe alliance means far more to us than a chat channel or the conenvience of simplified standings management it is an entity that means more to many of us than our own corps i am now in my third corporation with the same alliance the previous two underwent mergers and each time we have improved on what went before but the alliance remains constant you may not have had the same experiences that i have had but for us the importance our alliance goes far beyond game mechanics
before alliances even mechanically existed in eve they were just a group of people who acted in unison and followed the same ideals maybe im wrong but ushrakhan still existed and fought against cva i remember a time when you two were sick and tired of having to pay war fees and pushed hard for a mutual war option guess what it happened but in the meantime you kept on paying the bills and fighting the good fightyou argue that if you arent in an alliance the history of your corp and all your accomplishments are gone that is a stupid argument and its wrong case in point pie they leave cva to pursue fw do you think anybody has forgotten everything theyve done are they now more anonymous than they were before i think not they look at them as a corp who wanted to fw so much that they left their allianceif you want to play this sad song that leaving the alliance destroys its history then youre free to  but if you want to convince people its true youre going to find that nobody is going to sing along with you
it is not griefing it is called piracy sillyit is for your protection as a decent pirate will whoop your ass even 5 to 1 andor still take all your ore etc but alas if you really want this to happen if you belong to something besides a npc corporation your corpmates can respond to acts of agression fyi
im a firm believer in any acts of theft or piracy should grant kill rights to the fleet for as long as your a member of that fleet and definitely the corpnot a bloody 15 minute timerthey have it waaaay to easy we want to fight back just as much as they want to piratei dont have a problem with someone attempting to gank or pirateso long as we get our chance for blood for more than a paltry 15 minuteshow about 24 hours o p

hey it is called piracy fight back or do something else
yes capital system should be able to set more than 2 jb id say 2 more this should make them more capital not just average system with

sounds good to me
yes the missing copy url function canis rather annoying
irc style ftw signed
you sir just gave me a rigid boner with this threadi happily support this idea and hope itll be an eventual success
link anythinginstead of typing selecting rightclickingit should still give you the menu it would save tons of time though
a worthy idea
so what youre saying is that lowfriction nozzle joints and inertial stabilizers have a role in this game any ship above an ibis has more than enough lowrig slots to fit both stabs and istabs you do not need to merge the two
so wait you want your miner ships to not be able to target anything so they cant mine nicealso this is lame blockade runners have 2 warp core strength and miners are weak its the way of the game
it actually ranges from 075 ausecfreighters to 135 ausecspeed interceptors and most of the problem comes with acceldecel times  for a 20 au warp even in a 3 ausec battleship you spend about 34 of your time at far less than 3 ausec its only really for capitals and freighters that warp speed really matters outside of the biggest systems
no the increase in interceptors warp speeds would be ed your doubling the warp speeds so your ok with inties warping at 27 auisnt eve small enough why shrink it moreim not sure why this is even an issue for you most systems short of a freighter are covered in 30 seconds or less30 seconds i know its a pain to have that much of your life sucked away but heres hoping you can deal with it
thank you for clarifying herschel yamamoto i was unaware that warp drives differed in speed honestly its not something i pay attention to i still would think that a fine tuning of eve warp drives might need to be addressedas for you your mastery of argument has one me over let me look at your wonderful augment again1 my idea is ed2 therefore i want to increase int warp speeds to twice the normal speeds which would mean that they would arrive a whole second less so therefore my idea is stupid3 its only 30 secondsway to argue cicero so i should waste 15 secs every time i warp for the next 3 years warping 25 times a day that is 45 minutes im wasting a week in eve thats 20 hours wasted if i played every other day of the year 10 of those hours could be saved if only ccp spends a few hours changing a few statistics to balance out the speedsand now i should worry that that interceptor is going to make the jump in 4 secs instead of 5 that the extra second could have some importance in a pvp skirmish that we should only care about the 1 out of every 1000 jumps are going to a pvp engagement yeah genius
i see no harm in increasing warp speeds
bad idea makes it nearly impossible to respond to raiding parties as they can get in and out too fast for a response force to gather better raiding groups can already get in and out too fast if this changed so everyone could do it they lose a hardearned advantage and soon nerf whines would be heardit also damages immersion by losing the sense of great distances travelled
if your going to find a way to kick in a higher warp drive speed id rather go for the mid level slot mod or somethingthat way you wont mess up the balancesat the price of a slot
id rather the accel time be dependent on the warp speed so freighters take a while to accel but ceptors get up to speed much more quickly than is currently done differentiate the ships more so that warp speed actually makes a big difference
oh yes i wouldnt mind seeing a similar filter system like the market either i never want to see contracts over 35000m3 i never want to see contracts in low sec according to my autopilot i never want to see contracts over 20 jumpscourier contracts should have their very own tab in the contracts screen a majority of contracts searches used for purchasing items is never going to fit couriersgive it a tab by itself have filter and search options
ive seen some members of the csm mention the lack of a private forum for them to discuss ideas and organise discussion assuming this still does not exist i would like to offer the csm a vbulletin forum free of charge for the exclusive use of its members i would also like to offer independent moderator services for the csm to ensure topic discussion is not clogged down with off topic poststhe forum itself would be 100 secure and all efforts to maintain security privacy confidentiality and most importantly impartiality measures would be taken to ensure piece of mind of the csm
thanks for the offerbut i believe ccp has something in the pipelines
i think this game would be alot kooler if it was more like wow with arenas and big bosses with uber items
maybe a dragon boss with 20 turret hardpoints and an assortment of lasers and missles
oh and it has a smartbomb on its tail that trashes about during the fight
and its claws have tractor beams that will pull you in
and when you defeat this massive beast it drops a golden cargo container
and inside is a tritanium crown and whoever wears it gets to be king of the solar system
theyre already looking into that

the perceivedasstrange cooperation in iceland youre referring to while alluding to people acting as different personalities was a direct result of you behaving had you behaved in iceland as you behave every other day i can guarantee darius at the least and probably would have treated you the exact same way you are treated right now when you behave that waythe theatrics are transparent and childish one cannot throw rocks and not expect to get some tossed back in return nobodys going to pity that
yeah becuase seeing the representatives continuously bicker back stab  moan and generally being rudecondesending to each other for the entire term to the point where csm function is overshadowed by it in full public view is a great way to enforce a sense of trust in there abilities and complishments
i like how you put representatives in quotes as if theyre not they are whether you like it or not you have the power to remove them in the next cycle but whether you like them and their actions or not they do indeed represent youas far as not liking how they act in public that is certainly your purview however i dont see how that has any bearing on their accomplishmentsits a forum if you dont like the posts dont read them if you dont like the candidates dont vote for them bickering about them repeatedly and waving your hands just turns into sour grapes after a whileill also note that lumping all the representatives in there is unfair and fallacious most of the csm seems to get on just fine most of the time
try all you like but you dont represent the majority of the people when only 5 or there abouts of the people in total actually voted if they put the same energy into actually looking at the real issues and not just what affects there gameplay style only on the same scale to which they have ed moaned backstabbed etc and tried to redefine the csm as a whole then perhaps fewer of the people who actually bothered to vote last time would not feel completely let down and never bother to vote for this nonesense again
they had their opportunity to participate and they chose not to therefore their representatives are not whom they may necessarily have chosen but like it or not they are indeed their representatives nothing you say or post will change that nor will any degree of bitter footstompingto the contrary i expect a much better voter turnout the next cycle and only time will prove me right or wrong also if you have a problem with your representative you should take it up with them nobodys going to pity you simply because your pet issue hasnt yet been coveredto be frank in your entire post all i see is sour grapes that has very little meat regarding the actual functioning of the csm the csm had to do some definition because it wasnt provided with any the next csm will do the same instead of crying id recommend you mobilize and do something about ensuring it lives up to your standards
i utterly despise this argument as long as you had the right to vote and the ability to do so practically a decision not to vote is an abdication of responsibility  you are accepting the results that the rest of the electorate chooses to give you there is truth in the old maxim of if you didnt vote you cant complain or if you prefer rush if you choose not to decide you still have made a choice

im pretty sure my sarcasm detector is making beeping noises at the moment so forgive me if it needs a mechanic individual bugs and small technical issues arent something that i think should be brought up in the meetings by that i mean if we had a discussion about every single one and theres hundreds the meetings would go on for hours and hours over what they shouldso no change there i guess no what i intend is to bring bugs and errors into the light and to make it transparent the known issues page for example has stuff on there dating back years  what my role would entail is communicating with the devs and programmers keeping a tab on some of the more sensible how to fix lag issues and bring suggestions forward to the devsbasically it would be like acting as a point of call and a go to person to discuss and present these issuesduring meetings items and concerns could be brought up and discussed however there isnt really anything on which to debate a bug is a bug  a graphical error doesnt need a vote or a discussion  its just that  an error that needs fixingwith that in mind i cant see how it would delay meetings any more than anything else does with the csm  its not an issue such as say nanoships where there was a debate on both sides giving forward their arguments and these were discussed at great lengthas for the csm being useful i think this could be an incredibly useful position or an angle from which to campaign who doesnt want the bugs fixing its about the only issue on which nearly every player is in agreement
good luck with your campaign and you are targeting the bugs which is one of the universal issues everyone deals with from time to time however if you would recall the result of the meeting with ccp it was considered niggling and not what they are looking for from the csm
this is also my understanding i dont think ccp is looking for the csm to report bugs to them they already have systems in place for thati do think the bugy nature of eve has been a huge issue for years now and needs to be seriously addressed i just dont think the csm is going to be able to do anything about ityou might want to do a little more research as to the nature of this council and what its role is
you are correct ccp does not want to hear about bugs as theres already a method for reporting them giving people the same information via 8 different directions is annoying the same goes for lag they know
now thats what i call a pos not that stick with some thingys around it and for implemantations just convert all the poss into the new form randomly but offcourse with the modules they put on to it
i support this now using an arazulachesis is almost laughable ecm was nerfed and specilased ships boosted why did this not happen with rsds
bump
this would be very nice
jump freighters should be able to cyno to high sec
sounds cool to me
yes please i would also like to see colony hubs become ministations the main thing they would have is a cargo hangar approach within 15 km of the service module and you can access your cargo hangar and deposit goods and take things out the hubs owners could setup buy orders at the hub for things the hub needs and sell orders for things the hub producescolonies should be able to be tailored a bit on what the produce as well in addition pos products they produce more of what they need but not everything so slotting in a marine training school to your colony would make it produce marines or having your colony be focused on farming to produce wheat for the rest of your colonies a simplifed version of civilizations cities might work well for a model
give some power to the aggressed any power whatsoever
actually it is 100 your fault its your fault for piling your corp full of unskilled new players who cant compete if a company irl did that then they would fall to a competitor that had good employees with a diversity in skills and abilities same as in eve the current wardec system does not need a rework if you do you are shifting the game away from an unrestricted capitalistic society
no the aggressed should have already been prepared for war hence they are on equal footing already if they arent they are weak and deserve to folddisband
simple you prepare for all possibilities you have a pvpcombat wing in your corp and dont focus 100 on mining and industry if you do focus entirely on industry then suffer the consequences its nonsense that you are defenceless you only need to recruit players who can fulfil a combat rolethe arrogance of some corps who want to compete in industry without being able to defend themselves is astounding

everyone thinks that black ops ships are fixed by a further jump capability or a fuel baydoes no one realize that they are only cloakable cynocapable versions of their t2 variants its completely stupid to buy one of these ships unless youre just going to haul meaningless crap through lowsec00 look at the sin is anyone actually going to use a 600mil ship with a  tank and bad dps as a bloody dominix with a nicer skin why doesnt it have a dampener or warp disruptorrelated bonus like the arazuthe widow damn that ship can jam but youre buying a ship that does the same damn job as a falcon and cant even warp cloaked none in their right minds would actually try and fight with a widow you can 8slot tank a scorpion and use it to jam a lot easier with insurance guarantee plus you can jump bridge falcons in to do the same job betterthe redeemer energy turret tracking youve gotta be kidding me give it a neutralizer and nos range bonus on top of its tracking bonusthe panther lmao lets buy a 600mil ship that is just a ed typhoon that goes 25 faster with max skillsi thought csms were supposed to listen to community suggestions having cynocapable deep space transports adds an awesome dimension to the game but it in no way fixes black ops ships these ships are less logical combat ships than even marauders because at least those pos ships do massive amounts of dps
have read the first page dont have time to read the other 3 still here is my idea sorry if its been mentionednew ship class  tankership would be same hull type as dst but less slots it would be modified to be able to jump along with the jump bridge and would have a large fuel bay it should be unable to jett fuel from its cargo but should be able to link with a black ops and by doing so fueling all jumps through that ships bridge via its own fuel bayhit points and agility should be similar to a dst but less pgcpu and less slots the reason i dont think they should be able to jett cans is to avoid them bringing a lot of these ships to haul ammopos mods into enemy space while still allowing it to loot it should be able to cloak but not have any bonus to it its cloaking ability should be just like a normal dstor you could just change the dst to be able to jump as many have suggested and allow it to link with a black ops
get this into your head these are not frontline ships  their dps and tank is second to their logistic abilities  otherqise you would create an overpowered cloaking ship that can jump long ranges

ill support any and all buffs to black opssimply speaking they cant get any worse then what they are atm
this is easy to demonstratetake some period of time the last 3 months for exampleget the logsdo a couple of searches to look how many people logged in changed skill and logged off in a period of less than 5 minutes vs people who logged in changed skill and stayed longer than 5 minutesgive us numbers prove your point with databecause from what i read and my own experience a lot of people just log in change skill and log off and a lot of people lose time because the skill training ends while at work or while sleeping or similar obnoxious situations a group of short skills are the hardest to train if you can only connect at a limited timeframeso if we are a minority and this is not a problem for most of the player at least some data to prove it would make the situation more bearable to us
so youre flying your uber bs towards the gate having bravely fended of hordes of attacking pirates then limping the final kilometer you make it just to jumping distancethen a tiny ship flying at 8000 ms bumps your kilometer long battleship out of range to jumpum excuse me wheres the significant but not deadly explosion as the interceptor crashes into your huge superstructure this game mechanic is not only a much abused tactic but is ridiculously unrealistic and yes i know this is an internet spaceship game and you can say oh its collision detection stuff onboard your ship but lets be honest the tactic is too powerful and much abusedi think the actual result should be the smaller ship bouncing off the larger ship i see that having actual collisions could be very difficult so this i feel is the sensible resultthe smaller ships collision detection bumps it away from the larger ship the larger ship is no affected simple the only difficulty may be when ships of the same size are bumpedor it could be that you are not bounced merely stopped at a distance from the ship you hit
bumping is stupid ccp really need to work on it
the ships must be equipped with repulsorlift coilsend star wars reference
end the need for bumping and you eliminate bumping currently there are so many mechanics in place to avoid pvp it all gets a little boring ie redocking reapproaching gate and jumping out about to get worse with web nerf
i think someone is compensating for the lack of bumper cars in their youth yes bumping is lame as all hell collision damage now and let the small ships worry about staying out of the way of the bigger onesit goes without saying that the docking game needs to get sorted its on the 5 year short order list
damn the torpedosramming speedfrigate smacks into destroyer killing both in a glory of explosive pwm4g3that would change alot of thingsbut before you go off on the bumping thingdid you bother to take into account undocking at a busy station with ships stacked on top of each otheroops didnt think about that did yahmight wana fix that firstand then somebefore you visit this problem
proposal for jita 44 also its been explained several times before you are not being bumped your ship is realigning itself to avoid collision this game mechanic is working as intended
if my ship can realign at that speed to avoid a collision why cant it align at the same speed for entering warp
no didnt think about the busy undocking thing but thats fine anyway they just stack up no one bounces about like a tom and jerry version of space combatim not saying do collision damage just get rid of the ability to bump ships around it is only a valid tactic because it has always been in the game if it wasnt then another tactic would be used maybe people would actually use tactics instead of dumb as hell game mechanicssorry but i just dont see how a little frigate could possibly make a battleshipdreadfreighter spin around and be bumped away by ramming itif it is supposed to be collision detection then the ramming ship should be the one stoppedmoved not the target of the ramming or like i said the bigger ship is unmoved so yes a big ship could ram a smaller ship aside but how many times do you see a bs fly at you at 14000 msit gets a little boring hearing people moan about unfairunrealistic tactics being removed from the gamethis is a game but in the scheme of things it is supposed to be quite realistic feeling environment and bumping is probably the single most unrealistic factor in eve and no ive never been ganked by being bumped so im not just moaning the only time ive ever had it done to me i was in an ares and just flew back to the gate and jumped anyway im addressing it purely because it dumb
bumping has already been nerfed so that smaller ships cant really bump bigger ships as well as in the past also there is warp to 0 so no need to slow boat to a gate so the scenario you offer is flawed unless you took the risk to ap through a hostile area in which you were given a popup asking if you want to proceed into said dangerous area so in the either case warping through or jumping into a dangerous place does require consequence  ds me hugs
emergencyonly uses youre totally arguing for something that is easily defended by role play reasons
bumping and the consequential realignment should simply take the mass of the bumping objects into consideration divide mass by the speed of it and you get the power of impact applied to the mass an interceptor bumping a battleship should go bouncing way off that way while the bss navigation system still calculates what caused its ten meters deviationsince it is the way it is now its also a valid tactics too no need to not think about improvements though supported
your tank is failing why cant it emergency reaign then maybe the ship blowing up isnt an emergencyyou cant say one thing but ignore the other role play reasons now i hate role playing but if you can get a bs to move at stupid speeds and say it oh you havnt been hit your just moving out the way and with that move take no damage nor use cap when why cant i under the same idea have my ship move at that speed for other emergency reasonsim not saying that your wrong im saying teh game mechanic is stupid and needs looking at
proposal let jump freighters jump back to high sec from low sec why does one have to risk a 4 billion isk ship that is not capable of fitting a tankoffcourse you can drag all your corp mates to the high sec border system for some defense so you can jump back to high sec using tha t gate i think jfs should be able to jump back to high sec using a jf cyno similar to the covert ops cyno gen or use the same one but then being able to create a cyno in high sec there are game mechanics and restrictions i know but still isnt this not something that could be taken into consideration
signed
agreed this needs to be done
id like this too
of course this would be very handy to havebut we have to consider if this isnt going to make it overpowered are you guys open to the thought of there being a considerable cost involved in this maybe even a standing requirement on behalf of the corporationpilot
that last part would be out of the question you should just be able to open the cyno for the jf no messing with standing requirements on behalf of corppilots out of the question
if you cant anchor a pos in highsec without standings then why should the empires even dare letting you open any kind of cyno in their areas of spacewhat about f there was a jumping delay you would be stuck for x minutesdecreased with skills before you arrive in highsec in which people can attack you and disrupt the jump processit should not be a riskfree thing to do
also no mate if a ship has no slots to fit something of a tank then you should just be able to jump withoutstanding requirementsjumping delayif you do want something of that then give jump freighters a 111 slot layout
but you are assuming now that a jf is not supposed to be having any kind of backup whenever its jumping aroundthat isnt right is it i mean it would benefit me hugely if i could just jump right into highsec but i doubt ccp agrees that it would be nice from a risk vs reward point of viewthere has to be some kind of compromise if this is to happen theres also a reason that a jf can use gates
i still say that in the low sec system where it will jump from to high sec will be mostly a system where your corp mates are based so a pos or hq over there this makes it allready a different situation in case of some other lownull sec system where you dont have a pos or hq you should bring corpmates to defend your jf as well so it can safely jump to high secyou are assuming ccp will decline this proposal without a hassle i mean we havent even heard an answer of ccp what they think of it but i agree with you there should be something of a compromiseotherwise i propose thisa pilot should jump in an instant to a high sec cynobut1 the jump from low to high sec demands more fuel to make it happen2 a jump freighter should not be able to make a jump to high sec from out of null sec only 01  04 sec systems something like this
we are getting much closer indeedhow about a consumption of empire charters as well just like it takes to run a pos in highsec that means theres a slightly higher barrier to entry in highsec but its less time consuming in the end
that would be agreed upona jf is allready a ship that requires to have some isk in your wallet by that i mean isotopes and creating cynos etcusing empire charters with liquid ozone to create a cyno in high sec would be a good combo also something good for the mission runners to buy the charters from the lp store if you agree to this we might have a great understanding mate
big no on this this would allow jfs to move about high sec using cynos this would make eve a terribly small place as goods can move freely between regions in an instant 00 space is very spread out that is why jump drives are needed most of high sec is packed into a small area at least ly wiseif you fly a jf correctly i dont see how you can possibly die jump to low sec  dockpos up then warp to high sec gate in high sec  scout gate then jump through and cyno away
i agree
as i read this you dont know you can jump from out of high sec to low sec ccp could build in a restriction of not being able to jump from high sec to high sec my point is to be able to jump from low into high sec nothing more period
great
and you dont know that under your idea you can jump from high sec  low sec  high sec which would be fairly similar to high sec high sec without too much trouble one more hopjfs are meant for lowsec and 00 sec transporting they are not meant to do any sort of moving in high sec space transport ships are meant to be slow making an instantaneous huge cargo space ship in high sec space would be very broken
ok you got a point on putting restrictions of highlowhigh jumps for example the high sec system after the low system should be the same as the first high sec system you left from and im pretty sure i didnt mention i was or was not happy with the current speed of freightersjump freighters
a very big nowhy in the world should a jump freighter be perfectly safe just cause it cost a lot of isk and cant fit a tankif those two things are such a big problem for ppl then the simple option for you is to not fly it
why not its the whole idea of creating an entire new concept within evei think that if such a ship is meant for lownull sec and is not able to fit a tank it should be compensatedbalanced
the issue is that youre asking for the elimination of the single biggest risk in flying a jump freighter all ships should have a counter i mean if my viator had infinite wcs instead of 1 its be great for me  i could fly it pretty much invulnerably anywhere fantastic also insanely overpowered and that can only more 3750m3 at once  your jump freighter can already cyno from pos to pos in virtually perfect safety carrying a vastly larger cargoits as if youre asking for battleships to be as agile as frigates great for battleships leaves no niche for frigatescan you provide any justification for your request for a very significant buff for your ship class other than that youd really like it
its like flying an unfitted bs into a lvl 4 mission pointlessjfsfreighters are also point of subject in high sec with gankers you should see when im flying my jf from jita the constant locking and cargo scanning p 10 torp ravens and its gone why not give a ship with no slots a little adventage
they already have an advantage they can jump to cynosif its as pointless as you say why use it why do ppl even bother flying such a shipyou have yet to come up with a single valid point for your idea the only thing you have made clear is that you want a ship that can never be killed
why did ccp even brought this ship in the game please answer this one
youre doing this wrong youre supposed to be giving reasons why this change would benefit eve not asking us to come up with reasons why that shouldnt happenand lets face it this is an utterly pathetic carebear idea violating current mechanics and removing the minimal risk involved in flying a jf it would be to the detriment of eve and its really little more than wah wah make my life easier youll be asking for a lowslot to fit a dc next
hey why not quadruple their hit points and give them rig slots as well this is a ridiculous idea im sorry and you should be ashamed for even mentioning itlets face it all youre saying here is that you dont want to risk you ship because it costs so much and youre just scared of losing it stupidlythis thread is now about evanga growing a pair or going to play hello kitty online thats the standard insult for people who want their hands held around here isnt it
you are on the wrong track here all im asking is to give the chance for jf pilots to cyno right back to high sec under certain conditions or to give this ship some sort of a tank so either cyno to high sec or to give this ship a slot layout of 11 or 1this is not a question to make my life easier just an idea what would ccp think about it and to take something similar into consideration so quit the yabbering of this is an utterly pathetic carebear idea  go back to your antinano nerf thread
with the nature of these ships being mainly to get things in and out of 00 a certain level of risk should be associated with itbeing able to jump from highsec and back to high sec removes too much of the riskif you can afford a 4bil ship and have enough people to control some 00 space then you should be able to secure a low sec system long enough to dock or jumpthrough a gate your jf out
the op makes no sense anyway the current risk is minimal  you dont need to secure the system or gate at all just cyno in next to a station then warp to the gate at zero and jump if youre not paying attention then you might drop out of warp in the gate and bump away than get tackled before you can jump or warp  but in that case you deserve everything you geti think the op really wants to jump between highsec systems thereby utterly removing any risk associated with suicideganking not that there is much with the new mechanics and wardecs likewise with npc corpsmind you if this really isnt anything to do with just making the ops life easier and safer with no drawbacks then im sure hed still support his current proposal if it was accompanied by a 90 cut in the jfs cargohold
you also could have just give a comment how you should fly that ship back to high sec instead of giving these retarted commentsnevermind this topic please for it could have been locked after the last comment of the csmso please do lock it
the op might have a carebear wish but its interesting to see where its goingcynoing into highsec is prohibited because of having caps in highsec isnt allowed by the main factions and you dont want to have moms camping highsec gates either although having them concordenned would be funnehfreighters and jump freighters can happily dwell in highsec besides they dont require the capital ships skill so even though they are capital ship size they arent real capital ships and they are not offensive because of lack of slotsif you have a jf cynoing into lowsec or 00 it still is risky because they might get ganked bumped etcso when a jf wants to travel back it still have to cyno to a lowsec system 1 jump from highsec and run a 2nd chance of getting gankedstill its impossible to light cynos in highsec because of the capital ships you then should either need a special cyno generator civilian or a pos module version that only allows jf the module doesnt have any disadvantages the pos module version requires a deccable corp with standing besides setting up a pos just for jumping requires some logistical planning you even could have a mini profession by setting up jf cyno possesthen my mind wanders off and starts wondering about jf cyno bridges all over highsec but that would be just plain wrong since it would allow entities to move large quantities of supplies to move through empire very fast so highsec to highsec cynoing is baaaadyet it still seems to be overpowered but who knows when everyone owns a jf the whining for this possibility makes ccp give in to these people and give them the option to cyno back to highsec
op is closely akin to i want my ship to be able to safely move even if i am solosorry but this is a resounding ing nostop with this my ship isnt safe 
not supported unless i can jump my dread into highsec oh and  and pillage poss with it
i have a jump freighter and i dont want this i have 9 caldari standing too so id still get to use it under compromise being floated here too and i still dont want itlogistics shouldnt be risk free and freighter logistics shouldnt be a solo activity you should need an escort and you should run a considerable risk if you dont have oneone of the reasons that we have the state of affairs in 00 that we do today with cap fleets in the hundreds and unplayable blob warfare is because logistics are too quick and easy and too invulnerable to attackif you cant afford to risk a 4b isk ship dont use one or at least dont try to use one solo its the same for flying any ship in the game the price tag on these ought to be a clue that they arent meant to be used and risked by individualsthis is an mmo folks not a single player game one of the things that ruins mmos as they age is constant demands that things be made easier to do solo that get listened to by the publisher not supported
im a firm beliver that rats should shoot you regardless they help ccp detect macro accounts besides for you non carebares out there rats are the only sort of excitment when it coems to mining lets not make mining more boring shall weediton a related note it would be awsome to buy standings from npc lp markets
i was going to start another thread but this one seems the logical place to talk about the issue i believe the base problem here is that falcons are running around totally permi jamming entire fleets iv been in a lot of fleet fights recently and no fitting iv been able to come up with has been effective at all even a scorp w 2 sens booster 2s 2 calderi eccm 2s and 2 backup arrays and rigs a huge gimp on fittng btw and still permi jammed by 1 falcon rediculas i propose the answer is to set the ecm modules the same as ecm burst modules in that u should be able to have 1 ecm module active at a time period permi jam with no hope at all is happening because falcons are doing max chance jamming by filling all the mid slots with ecms and then running them in sequence like 5 seconds apart this is totally a overpowered situation with chance based ecm that really isent taking into account relative sensor strengths and eccm backup arrays anti jam rigs fitted tbh i feel that the falcon as the force recon hull that also warps cloaked and everything else is kind of screwed up as well because something that has that kind of ability should not be getting the covert ops bonuss as well with that kind of sensor strength inherent to its hull a cov ops cloaking ship should have as minimum sensor strength as possable so it isent giving itself away with signal leakage seerindarkness lfa ceo
nope but i also didnt take into account eos link bonuses mindlinks or anything flowery just the base stats if you fit a countermeasure it should work thats the bottom line for me
and why cant you just all join the same corp and play fw you dont have any need for 00 or sov so whats the differencesorry if you answered a question like this already
i very much support the idea here wishing they would let alliances join in on the faction warfare cva pie uk em theres alot of us that wouldnt mind the chanceim not overly concerned about this leading to any sudden jumps in cap engagements for simple reasons a cap fleet is about as mobile as dog droppings and easy to dodge during my time in the militia there was constantly a few carriers hanging around a select few stations already and very rarely did they ever dare enter a fight cap fights are expensive and not something you like to risk on a daily basis for something as mundane as fw theres no profit in itsetting up a capcamp on a complex gate or anywhere is kind of moronic anyway as you can just say fine sit there and go capture another complex instead theres usually several of them about to pick and choose from besides how effective do you think a few caps really are in stopping a swarm of frigates diving into a minor with microwarps engaged you could be webbed and target painted to kingdom come  and a stupid punisher would still deal more damage than most capships
neither the ushrakhan nor cva were created for the purpose of sov holding in fact i cant thing of a single rp alliance which started out for that purpose we were all empire based and the alliances were founded to create a greater sense of community and were about sharing goals before alliances neither ushra nor cva existed it was a little before my time but as i recall the facts the amarrian rp scene was dominated by one uber corp pie they were the solid core of cva when they formed it as everyone else were dwarfed by pie for the minmatar there was a corp called oracle and a bunch of others amarr will eat itself for example but no big daddy corps like pie an alliance offered the minnies a way to build a stronger community and bring together the disparate groups i think that the lack of a group like this is why the gallente and caldari rp scenes have always been weaker and illdefinedyears later cva moved into providence to reclaim it for the empire back when they started to do this it was the only thing they could really do to affect the game world and carry out their rp fw was a mere pipe dream so there was quite literally nothing you could do in empire space to alter the world other than the occasional aurorarun event you could blow each other up forever but you couldnt hit at the empire or republic there was no end game the ushrakhan went to providence to oppose this amarrian expansion we also couldnt do anything to attack the empire directly and come for our people there so we pursued the slavers now an awful lot of history has unfolded with the rise and fall unity station in 00 but despite doing all of that it was not the reason why we became an alliance we did it for community not sovereigntyif you need another example take electus matari they have really never left empire so why be an alliance scagga mentioned earlier in this thread the ammatar rp alliance set up specifically for fw only to be canned when the mechanics excluded alliances if their goal was set on fw why be an alliance alliances are not just about holding chunks of 00 sometimes the community you forge within one is the reason you bring it into existence
if you think its even possible to manage standings the way you suggest its clear that you have no understanding of such matters we can start with the very simple fact that a corp has limits to numbers of standings far too low to duplicate those of the alliance and move on to the absolute impossibility of dealing with allied organizations who would now need to set ten standings instead of one youve never engaged in eve politics if you think this is even possible let alone easyand since ive actually tried it the way you described one of us knows what hes talking aboutalliances bring nothing to fw that isnt already there i find it particularly funny that you use the capital ship argument given that over 10 of your corps kills against the matari militia have been by your carriers the megaalliances have been free to apply their capital power against the miltias since day one and have largely chosen not to why they have no reason to want to and every reason not tothe only alliances that care are those who have been involved in rp since before the first mention of fw by ccp years ago and who have looked forward to having mechanics for the rp war they fight for just as long the mechanics dont make it possible to join fw without breaking up the alliance and the mechanics make it easy to allow allied corps into fw
bringing 00 blob warfare to empire no thankskeep it in 00 please
even when youre making up numbers you still fail at proving a point so the amarr use carriers 10 of the time this with being filled of corps with no 00 space to call their own and thus a seriously hampered income allowing alliances with more isk will do what now thats right increase the number of capital ships used from the fictitious 10 probably more like 1 if you cared to look to the point where capital ships could conceivably be dropped more often against people who a have fewer skills and cant even pilot a cap ship and b have much less isk to afford a cap ship bravoyour other point you say that it is damn near impossible to get people to set standings toward ten corps oh my ten in my altruism ill give you some advice i take it your alliance has a website on this website you can create a page this page will be viewable ingame and will have on it links to all the corporations in the alliance you can now send this out to you fellow corps who you are currently allied with and a director can simply click the corp click the standings tab and voila the alliances cannot do this of course but still it can be done in less than 2 minutes if someone doesnt like you enough to push 18 more buttons then do you really want them as an ally i really cant believe that youre arguing that this is impossible when what six months ago corps couldnt set standings towards alliance and they had to set standings to the individual corps anyways also its not like the gbc or the nc or even the goons have a ginormous standings list that they have to maintain no its impossiblebut what i find especially comical is the last line finally we agree lets quickly go over what an alliances is one more time a collection of allied corps with a common goal right im done here honestly feel free to argue ad nauseum about this and how hard it is for 10 corps to leave one alliance and join another one and how it would totally destroy your history im not buying it and when you get down to it you guys dont even seem to be buying it yourselvesmaybe one day ill see you in fw but much to your dismay i wont be holding my breath
how about a compromiseoutposts can be razed and left to ruin or rebuilt kind of a extension of the incapacitation but requiring a different more difficult way to repairif a outpost service was left incapacitated for more then some set time period then it would be considered razed razed services would be unable to be repaired by conventional means and be a semipermanent incapacitation of the outpost services enough of the services razed the outpost would eventually be lade to waste unless they were derazed until then the only thing one could do was dock in the station and access the marketservices could be derazed after the outpost has been taken over or the hostiles have been beaten back razed services would be unable to be repaired by anything less then a new platform designed to repair razed outpost services the new platform would cost and work like a service upgrade the cost of repairing multiple razed services and possible attempts to attack the egg holding the platform and or destroying it could prevent services from being derazedderelict modemaybe if all services were left razed for a period of time the outpost would turn derelict when the outpost goes derelict then the assets remaining in the outposts hangers and on the market could be looted all jump clones moved or destroyed
the only thing too hard about eliminating 00 alliances is the pos warfare associated with said action of removal 00 stations pose no imminent obstacle sorry jade
let me ammend my original post of two wordsthe need is for buffing logistics making it easier to move minerals from place a to place bthere is no need to change belt compositions just so that 00 corps can get trit easier on their own in an unbalanced way towards highsec same way as highsec needs the lowsec minerals same way lowsec should need the massive amounts of highsec minerals that are produced in highsecyou have a demand there is a supply tradethe bottleneck is at hauling all those minerals back and forth so address that issue directly
the bottleneck is that killing rats in 00 you get isk immediately from the drops you can recover some juicy faction stuff that can be moved easily to a marketmining ore you need to mine it refine it and then sell the minerals before you see any isk even if the rewards were at the same level most people would prefer the first option as it require less work
its not just for mission piracy dude its an issue with all fleet aggressions me and my corporation are all flashy 10sif were aggressed one at a time in lowsec by nonflashies basically all people trying to kill pirates we either have the choice of running or dying 1 by 1 theres absolutely no way we can help out our corpmatesits a problem thats impossible to fix for various balance reasons
i think its enough that your corp can help you out there is alot of scope for abuse here ie agreement that most people in mission hubs form fleet and kill the hell out of pirates pirates are enjoying the game how they want to just like everyone else and the core of this game is pvp
lol yea i think what you are referring to is called a war dec then you have all the time in the world to get your blood
what does war decing have to do with this discussionif i was talking about war decs id bring up war decsso either your on drugs or your trollingill just assume your on drugs
neither actually i was reffering to your post of wanting more time to get your blood however to the topic on handjust becareful what you ask for this by the way is the same way can flipping started miners wanted their blood and they got it
so what the op wants is flaggings to transfer in gangie people hiring mercs ateam style on the fly to help out before the flaggin ends
if you can list me a set of reasons why it would be bad to ask for such a thing that is lengthening the amount of aggression time someone has to retaliate say enough time to gather up a posse to go after the piratecan tipper while allowing said piratecan tipper to continue to do such actions without completely messing up the balance be my guestps its nothing personal i just think you tend to be a bit of a bully at times  o 
well drake if my opposition of your views is some kind of bullying well then so be it as for the op in the thread he is asking for immediate reaction to an aggressive act in which it includes his gang mates so its an immediate response not 24hrs to russell up some dudes to blob your target he is directing his proposal to gang mates not how long the aggression timer is he asking for kill rights to immediately transfer over to the rest of his mates so his entire gang can attack the aggressornow i do believe this can be bad and very abusive in terms of game play and the pirate in this case will not be on the short end of the stickwhat you are asking for is to get enough players together to hunt down the culprit way after the fact the act has happened which has little to do with what the op has proposed really
allright so instead of 24 hours 1 hour at most would be at least enough timeas for the pirate getting the short end of the stick the same coudl be said for the victim can it notits a 2 way street here and i always see people pushing one side harder than the otherif your going to be a pirate then one would suppose there is a consequence for said actionsi also pointed out that you have to be a member of the fleet to even get inif your not at the time you wont get anywhereadding others wouldnt help eitherif its a corp mate situation then they can get in within the 1 hour count down or something to that effect
i said the pirate will not be on the short of the stick the op is asking for members in local to come assist him and by joining his gang and having the rights transferred to the incoming help that was not even apart of the act and you are asking for the same thing a mob vigilante so to speak you want to get players together that was never involved in the first place you are asking for the ability to essentially war dec a single player by involving a bunch of people that has absolutely nothing in common except the fact they happen to be in local you want to transfer kill rights to someone that has no reason to participate short of you asking them to
no if you shield tank you are usually a dps powerhouse because dmage mods are lows if you armour tank you probably use more ewar stuff and less dpsjust have a good mixed fleet youll be okotherwise we will all just train caldari and have super gank solo ravens
bumpwe need something like thisanythingincentives other than killmails make pewpew fun
not supported ninja salvaging is a proffesionif thats what people like to do then its up to you to work a way around it this game needs to be kept as open to all proffesions as possibleno im not a ninja salvager
meh bored of hearing about all this non issue crap that can be avoided but instead of people avoiding it people whine about it
at the csmccp meetings in iceland this idea was bounced around ccp agreed to look into doing this i think they should have found out by now thus we need some feedbackbasically the idea was that if an item in a patch note was proposed by the csm it should be tagged as such this will make it more transparent how much influence the csm actually has
yes i think this is needed
an excellent idea this will help us see if the csm is affecting real change and see if there changes that we like or dislike
aye i would really liketo know which stuff was influenced y the csm
agreed
if they agreed to look into it why do we need to approve it for review god i dont think anyone including the csm reps understand what the csm is really for
positive
update
supported i cannot believe that ccp think this will increase server load because it will encourage people to reload more often at the moment i reload at any moment after i have fired a charge and think that there will be at least 10 seconds before a reengagement
devs and gms have reload all option in game
oh please god yes implement this
simply put the more traffic a system sees over a month the higher the transaction tax and brokers fee should scalenowhere and no one especially in a place such as eve where taking advantage of one another is the aim of the game would pass up the opportunity to make money out of the masses especially for instance the governor of jita who seeing the amount of traffic and traders going through his system daily would quickly impose a local sales tax brokers in jita would undoutadly increase their fees due to increased workloadin the real world do you really think those big named companies in the major malls pay as much for the floor space as does your local 711 in your 300 people village the ability to have the biggest window display accessable to the largest number of passing traffic costs and it costs bigin most systems nothing will change but in systems were traffic even if it dosnt stop at any of the stations in that system is heavy the tax should double and in systems where traffic is overwhelming taxes should quadruplewill this force players to leave jita for cheaper systems  no thats is not the desired effect jita is a testement to the success of a player run economy and to the success of the game design after all there is no reason for people to actually go to jita the jita trade hub is completely player driven but it is totally unrealistic even for a sandbox scifi game that there would be a level playing field through out the universe when one system above all others stands out someone would take advantage someone would want to be the next jitawill it help spread merchants out to the smaller trade hubs  hopefully and specifically the smaller merchants who run on smaller profit margins and who would want to protect those marginsin conclusion i would hope this would reduce traffic in the jita system as much as removeing agents from there whats more i hope it would enable the attitude that jita has become the low sec of economic pvp and that you have to be one of the big boys to go to jita and make the big profits
this would  alot of players offpooooor babies i saywhyit encourages the market to even outopens up opportune market shops in other systemsso yeah i like the ideaits got its own built in balance systemwould defiantly decrease the traffic for sure unless someone can point out a very troublesome setback to this other than omgwthcarebearkbaiill support itsigned
agreed
very simple problem it add at least 1 check and information logging to each market transaction i think it will add lag instead of reducing it when you stat to work on a large scaleif you read the devs comment in the thread about jita ship cap the market is on a different note than the system and ithe node is shared with several other markets so increasing the number of operations done on the market to decrease the number of people in system incur the risk of freeing maybe a bit the solar system while lagging even more the market editi did forgot the other big objection what tax rate and broker fee you will use for the regional orders if i can put up a regional buy order at a low cost station and use the station fee it will bypass at least the increased broker fee if the fee of the station where the selling is done is applied it will make impossible to calculate in advance the actual cost of the items brought
no extra check needed where before the base tax rate was 1 for the month or whatever the cycle is chosen for the update of traffic is doubled or quadrupled  if the traffic in the system alters next month the base rate goes downif this was a solution to overcrowding in jita i would have named the thread  jita overcrowding solved  like all the other threads that claim thatsince no extra operations are done except one a cycle and then probably that would be done at startup after dt your robbing peter to pay paul argument dosnt applyfor regional orders the tax and broker rate use is the tax and broker rate at the system you set the order  they are after all the tax people and the brokers getting your cash if you really want to get into the nitty gritty of whos tax juristiction the order falls under then i humbly suggest you are taking the immersion factor a tad too faredityes i can see now where the problem may lay  i assumed that the tax and broker rate would be a variable for each station you assume it is a blanket rate for every stationi guess the argument is futile unless a dev gives us a clue
only one way to help clear jita out turn it into a 4 system  or just allow smart bombs outside of station again but really i think its an interesting proposal but like everything there are drawbacks warping around everywhere to pick crap up is a pain so if this tax thing went through 2 things could happen apeople leave jita and warp a round a bit more to pick up what they need or b all that happens is stuff cost more isk everywhere as the eve economy is largely based of the jita average so what we have is stuff selling for higher in other systems like it does now there is more behind why that is ex mission hubs extso in my opinion it wouldnt work and the only way for it to change is for someone to take it on themselves to form a new trade hub
almost anything that promotes blobbing is bad so no
its about time do it also declaring war vs 1 person only costs 1mil isk
maybe your particular problem you seem to have with someone could be solved better by being able to wardec single player members of npc corps that are older than six or twelve monthsthis idea will not get any active support why would you be willing to sacrifice any single newcomer to the eve universe that might ever want to join innay
signed  well not as a command these are long needed  the amount of mouseclicks in eve is starting to show on my wrists 
maybe you have something more constructive  instead of just saying i dont like so it shouldnt be in the game
im sure this is probably something that has come up and i also realize a full hanger set up for an alliance would require a ton of work with roles whatever if it was done per personalright what i would like to see in the realm of alliance hangers is just like one hanger were an alliance member can put whatever they want in it to be available to other alliance members so no roles needed maybe a role tab for which corps are allowed access obviously you dont want to dump spendy stuff in there but it would be great to put basic mods ammo cap boosters ext available for fellow alliance members in areas where there corp may not have a hanger whatever you  ds
still being able to dump out hangar contents to a csv file would be very useful for peops who dont have the time to get involved in the whole api thingshould work the same way as dumping market orders imo
im happy to support this to happen apis are good but you still have to enter them into a program made by someone elseyes you could make one yourself to do it via the api but since the market iirc can do this why not what you own
well i think we need to rethink the roles of covert op ships in general because either your a scout or just more dps on the 00 front sure you can surprise attack but that does you no good when planning to take down a pos if they had a role that would allow them to take guns offline or something to that effect it would be cool a module that would incapacitate pos guns to bring more battleships to the front lines along with the ideas proposed to black op ships i think we could see a viable role for force reconcovert op pos attack optionsenjia fullblood
the current covert ops are fine no need to tinker with them they can already give you the perfect warp in on unsuspecting targets that alone makes them very useful they are cheap so if you lose one oh well its a ship tailored to scouting cloaking and scanning give them more roles and you just take away from the other specialized t2 frigates
op ccp had you in mind when they made the game look you can modify your ship to please your own gameplayhyperspatial velocity optimizer
personally i think warp speeds should be slowed down and the acceleration adjusted so that warp speed actually means somethingi mean if you want to see how much of an effect warp speed has in the game just look at how many hyperspatial velocity rigs are sold i would be surprised if it wasnt one of the 3 least used rigs in the game
exactly they are one of the least sold rigs in the game why unless we are talking large warps ie 50au or more you only save a couple seconds going faster and most people would rather have a faster cap recharge or more shields than a faster warp this makes the rigs worthless imho the heavier the ship the slower it should warp the warp speed should be based on the mass of the ship interceptors should warp their current speed and it should get slower as you get to a bs which should be have base warp speed that they currently are if you use polycarbs or nanos maybe you warp faster it would give them a new use after the nanonerf i mean were talking physics right since you know this game takes into consideration real world physics 
after a short experience with courrier contracts i ended up spending a lot more time making multiple sorts through the list to end up with the desired resultwork on this i expect wont even take much time to develop
wait the contracts have a sort function to them right now supported
supported for me as well
is this a still ongoing issue i must admit my mac client works fine for being in stationim interested in hearing what you guys think
i dont know  the linux client wont even install properly for me 
premium graphics do not work in any of the maclinux clients thats one issue another issue is that the official client is a hopscotch work that installs in cedega wtf corrupts any cedega you might already have there i used to have cedega before i went to wine and also sports significantly and measurable lower performance and less flexibility than corresponding wine client or of course the native windows version so in my eyes yes its still an ongoing issue
reply only forum with a limited number of csm posts would be more like it as it is csms dont have a lot of tools for keeping a topic on the forefront and kind of have to hope that anything they want to focus on sticks on the first try that leaves them competing with space whales and space hookah bars something a bit like a state of the universe address also space whale discussion should be stickied on that forum
terrible idea keep the learning skillz id say
did i post my idea here yetjust get rid of the advanced learning skillsthen replace 5 implants with 10 implantsbam instead of waiting 5 months people will want to log in and make isk to incease their skill progessiontoo crazy
funny thing a dev himself said it 1st during the last alliance tournament he stated that learning skills where the worst mistake eve ever made
and devs got caught cheating last year like there opinion counts for squat these days they have the vision of a blind man in a dark room with his head submereged in water
thisandcsm fails as a project it came to light as a good concept like so many other concepts that looks good at paper and crap when it comes to practical applianceit didnt work i dont buy the crap that it didnt work because it was x or y players there doing all the wrong stuff csm will never work because its proven to be totaly worthless for what it was created and brings the worst on people the ammount of pressure and judgement that those players have to endure to copy and paste a few forum posts so devs cant bother to take a few minutes of their days to look at its just appaling when the community have something to say they say it things didnt change and wont change because csm exists when devs wants to act prompty regarding an issue they will independent of csm taking their times to be wasted in countless meetings and enduring players harrassement here dissolve csm brush it under the carpet as one of many failed concepts everywhere and that is all it takes to move on players will get back to be players defending their own agendas discussions etc and issues will continue to be spoken between player base and ccp as they always were
i utterly despise this arguement to assume people paid any attention to the forums or the ingame news is laughable the actual majority just log on and play the damm game and id wager most wont even know what a csm is if you asked lets face it with the exception of maybe the factional warfare downtime the ingames news is mostly junk and is worthy of being ignored unended stories biased news same old same oldthe csm represent nothing more than the forum s and the forums are definately not what they used to be if i didnt have nostalgic memories of the community in 2004 and joined in 2008 and took at the sheer amount of e here now well i would not of bothered voting either
removed please refrain from trolling navigator
and this is supposed to be the community asking csm to represent them with classtalking about hypocrisy tbh
i think this could be implementedsimply put 1005 to be carebear stillno changemake 0402maybe just 03to 05mill sp pvp only if you have more concord come along and say gday and 0100 where its pretty well free game for anyoneanythingthis way the noob players can still pvp but with some safety from people with 30mill sp that would just 1 shot themthats my 2 bobs worthnow i just need to find 2 people named bob
please give my bhaalgorn some loving a nice 125 drone bay at least as its sister ship has a comperable sized bay
i cant support that the bhaalgorn has already proven to be a pretty win ship if proven right
whilst i too remember the glory days of the bhaalgorn back in the early alliance tournaments i think its fair to say that its a substandard ship today reasons are twofold the nos re balancing did hurt the bhaalgorns capabilities since it could no longer run the uber suckpowered tanks and the introduction of minmatar recons have very much put its extended webrange bonus into the shade so it remains now primary a faction version of a geddon without damagerof bonused guns and 35ths of the drone baycompare with the vindicator megathronvindicator maintains its 125 drone bay compare with rattlesnake ravenrattlesnake maintains its 75 drone baycompare with macherial tempest mach maintains its 75 drone bay now you could argue its not a straight comparison of that sort and say its a special kind of ship with combat utility bonus  but as i pointed out earlier  but the web and nosneut bonus environment has changed considerably since the bhalgorns heyday  and with curserapiershugins simply doing it better  it has a problem on balance im going to agree that the bhaalgorn should have the samesized drone bay as the armageddon because i honestly cant see why it doesnt already the other pseudopirate versions of faction battleships do not lose drone capability  not sure why he bhaalgorn does only thing i can can think of is that way back when the nos were at full power it was considered that a full rack of heavy drones  nos  tank was too powerful  but since these are unbonused drones and since nos alone can no longer flatline cap and since frankly a tech1 bs dominix does it so much better anways i cant see a decent argument for keeping the bhaalgorn drone bay gimped as an aside i know this kind of ship balancing issue is not popular with the csm as a whole  but you know eve is a game about spaceships at the core of things and im not sure we should be so dismissive there are many unloved ships in the game and readdressing the stinkers from time to time does keep the game environment fresh hell the nightmare used to be be pretty horrible and now its amazing  i dont think we should be afraid of submitting a general list of tweaks and balances to specific ships if were convinced by the arguments
this is actully dead on i remember the days when i would fly an ashimmu with 3 medium armor reps running forever while webbing out of web rangethose were indeed the days so while i never flew the battleship sized blood raider ship i agree wholeheartly with a simple dronebay increase
dunno if someone said this but eve is kinda like real lifewhat do most people do for the first 1517 years of their life do i hear someone say school if they want something easy something that requires no skill and absolutely 0 planning to this is say go play wowworld of warcraft for those that dont knowwith eve as with everything you do in real life requires some thought some planning why is this concept such a shock to everyone
im not really sure where to post thisbut feel its an easy change and would benefit all eve denizens by giving them the ability to divide their wallets into savings checking etcsort of like a true eve bank thoughts crticisms compliments cheap pickup lines
this was suggested over on the assembly hall i wrote a submission template for it but hell i cant find it
i think you might want to read the csm documents again you wont have continuous contact with ccp developer contact is limited to 1 live meeting and 2 online meetings dont get me wrong i would love up to date drawing boardknown issues pages but as far as i can see youll be doing very little to influence it as a csm
well they can look for what they want of course but i thought the csm was there for the playerbase to bring their concerns in a neat little package to ccp to get thing resolved not what ccp wants to hear

i would agree with the damp boost but not the tackle any ship with 100 both is overpoweredprenerf the arazu was a one man pwnmobile can you tell im a rook pilot but as always i am prepared for the nerf bat to come around and if need be fly the cough overpowered arazu if need be
supported this idea has been on the drawing board forever
tbh this can be done with preexisting assets already ingame you can place a pos tower that acts as the orbiting hub for the colony on the planet and set it up like any other pos tower sans the moon miningof course it wont have the same stats as a pos tower in this case but of a converted one to act as an orbiting hub which needs said storage i can see moon min storage being used here for the outputs from the colonyvery supported its already a huge pain in the ass to maintain poses asis and very little incentive to set up constellation sov cept to get those cyno jammers up
saying it is approved to be an issue is like sayingwe give you permission to complain well that doesnt really help us in and of itself unless someone is actually going to listen ive got about 8 months before i make an involuntary trip to a certain sandy place and id like to be able to proudly fly a balanced naglfar before then
some overhaul would be nice but i doubt it would help a lot as current empire wars are quite a joke bcos of alts currently war threatens only new playes in significant way

yeah good idea but maybe it should allow you to put skills wherever whenever you want kinda like in eft where you can adjust your skils since for me at least it doesnt update them for you mabye they should do something like thatbut a good idea in general
that would be quite good as currently maintaining overview settings is a bit too time consuming
here we have a multi page tread like many other black op treads in different locations on this forum on how they bad and need to be boostedbut the real question ishow come it takes sooo long to alter a ship class bonusrole after its has been released pre nerfedas soon a pre nerfed ship class comes in game and within weeks months maybe even the reactions are that they let simply say suck then this should be changed asapnow we are way past those weeks months and we dont even have any idea other then ccp is looking into itwhen is what we want to hear and what is the boost they will get is what we want to knowit just takes too long

multiple undocking points for one and the system differing between actions taken when players are in control of their vessel rather than being chucked out from a station or gate
yes a frigate bumping a massive bs any significant distance without taking massive damage to itself is well silly
lets say they implement collision damagewould the damage only aply aover a certain speedwhat happends if you warp to your gang and land inside another shipwhat happens when you warp to 0 and land inside a gatehow much damage would a bc take from accidently craching into his gangmate bswould a nanodread crushwtfpwn anything under bss if they ram them at enough speedwould a titan warping into a blob crashdamage all ships it comes within bumprange fromwhat happends when you warp your mining bargeexhumer to 0 to your bookmarked maxsized veldroid and land inside iti agree that bumping is unrealistic but id rather get my bs bumped out at 15kms from someones warp landing inside it then getting it damaged in the same scenario
i think current bumping mechaniks suks
many a battle is fought at a gate or station not talking about autopiloting through dangerous ares thats just stupidim not talking about collision damage with the complete lack of ship control in eve that wouldnt work im talking about the completely ridiculous tactic of ramming ships in order to hold them at a position where they can not escapethere are many ways to do this legitimatly with modsbubbles etc so there is no valid reason for this to be a required tactic it is more like an exploit of game mechanics and as i said its so far from realistic that it does take away alot of the realistic feel the game should havecollision detection would not make a bs turn away from its destination due to a frigate ramming it from the side the colision detection system would stop the frigate from reaching the bs simple and obviousthe only people who support this as a tactic are people who use it because they cant otherwise stop a ship escapingi never complain about losing a ship in a fight fair or not but id be pretty ed if i lost a billion isk ship because a frigate kept knocking me out of alignment and a bunch of incompetent pirates managed to kill me even though they had no scrambubbleweb or firepower to do so without this silly game mechanicnot that i have any billion isk ships
supported
as an inty pilot myself my first nature would be to disagree with this topic but for the reasons listed bumping is not realistic if there was a collision detection the computer would therefore be unable to set a course into another ship thus changing the course to stay the heck away from larger objectsseriously both ships should be taking damage if they attempt to ram at speeds greater than 1ks seems logical or have a skill thats needed to override the computer to allow bumping
bumping is such a joke it needs a realistic fix and quite possibly give out structural damage

would be nice to be able to jump them into hisec just make the generator burn goooood handful of starbase charters also and make sure only ships that can already use stargates jf and black ops can use that cyno
i think there should be a new pos module to create jf cynoes the user thus has to maintain a hisec pos the module should have a 5 day onlineing time so the pos has to be semipermanent and attackable the module should use a lot of powergridcpu
ding ding we have a winner i like that answer supported with love d
and combine this pos cyno module which uses starbase charters ozone and we might have a winner d
maybe if the cyno could only be launched while inside of pos shields
oh oh even better lets just be able to jump station to station in my jf without ever undocking just like jump clones
wow thats hideously overpowered when is it at any risk then
make it so that the cyno can only be put up at gates and the pilot has to be in a player corpand no not possible to change corps each time there is a war dec and ill might agree with this if not then still a big ass nooo

you said you were jammed for 2 minutes at a time that being 6 ecm cycles 04946  00145  145 my original numbers were assuming a fully optimized falcon including 7 racial jammers but 10 second ecm cycles  im a gallente pilot and apparently my memory of cycle times on modules i dont use is worse than i thought in any case even with correct numbers getting jammed for 2 minutes at a time reliably happens a vanishingly small percentage of the time now you wont get a lock all that often  as you say lock times do not help  but youre not jammed wholly out of the fight the way you imply also youre fighting a ship that costs as much as yours and requires as much skill as yours it should probably be able to stand in combat with yours as well even after the jamming youre doing as much dps as he is if not more with a far bigger hp buffer  if you can keep the scram on he will just die of course you cant do so solo very oftenthough him missing two consecutive jam cycles looks a lot like it at times which is his whole defence but if the odds go against him you can clean up pretty easily and even if the odds are in his favour you should be able to drive him off most of the time it depends on speeds and ranges and fittings of course but assuming closein combat with closein ships the eccmfit battleship will generally survive sometimes even bagging the kill against a ship of equal cost skill and power with no terrain advantages you win most fights if you fit the countermeasure to his setup this is a problem

recently i was buying a ship i had sorted the market by distance one price seemed ok but when i tried to buy it it said i did not have enough money ony then did i realize that i had fallen for the old move the decimal point 3 orders of magnitude trickbut when i looked at the market window the price seemed about right it was only when i looked very carefully i realized what seemed to be a period was actually a comma and that the price column had clipped off the last three numbers ie 000by looking at the market window there was no reasonable way that i could have spotted that the price was wildly offi propose that any prices that cant be fully rendered in the column be rendered as stars ie  etcthat would tell the buyer that they need to expand the price column to see the full price this will avoid the market window telling you liesthe ui as it is now encourages market scamming
the gargantuan profit margins are what encourages scamming not a display bug but that said this is a really stupid bug  theres a reason excel does this it wouldnt be appropriate for an overview but for market prices it certainly is either that or an arrow indicating that theres more to be seen  this solution has the advantage of being usable in all windows

eh im going to have to disagree with you on this one sorry to say but you want better ores go to low secseriously no joke all you have to do is fit an imicus or your races equivelant fit a cloaking device fit a launcher and 2 inertia stabs and you can get past any gate camp and if you dont then well       your just stupid frigs warp enough as it is w two inertia stabs its damn near impossiblei was able to cover every possible square km of a low sec system once and didnt get caught once seriously the only time i ran into someone was lol actually when i was leaving the system to just go in a frig and dont go to deep into low sec 3 or 4 jumps should be enoughwe also put up a miing op as well in low secjust have someone go into each system along the way and make a safespot trade the ss to each of your friends in stationthen you scout for them run scans to make sure no camps around run the directional scan set it for 360 degrees and set the range to idk about 20k km then you will also konw if they are going to drop in on you then they warp to the safespot you scout ahead rinse repeat its that easythe only reason we got caught was because we got scanned out      and it was a 00 system but even that is livable it takes at the least what 10 minutes for them to scan you out w probes all you have to do is have everyone align for a gate or soemthing while mining then freeze their engines then if someone comes in you can insta warp out plain and simple not even an inty can catch youalso go in some retrievers or something insure them use gasp again tech one equipment that way if by some miracle your screw up every one of my suggestions you dont lose muchand at least take one or two friends that can run security just bring two friends in cruisers because if you do get jumped the person is automatically going to switch to attacking the combat ships which are a threat to him which can also give your miners even more time to run awayplease leave the comfort of your high sec home w fuzzy slippers and silk robes and no risk at all and actually try another aspect of the gameyour zydrine is out there but tbh your just to damn lazy to find it yourself you want ccp to give it to you in perfect securityrisk vs reward people you have absolutely no right to make the same money w out doing  yourself besides running scans as the people that gasps go to low sec or take over space no right at all imoif you want zydrine for manufacturing sell some of that 9million isogen you have and buy it boohoo it cuts into your profits you dont want it to do that try gasps again going to low secthey really need a not supported button
wouldnt be needed if ores were redone to have higher quality of the same roids in lower sec status which also fixes several other problems
high end ores should not be available at all in high sec no
well low sec is not the problem and im not scared of it though mining in low sec is stupid i went there once cause i scanned down a small gneissochre site in a 02 system jc without imps covetor with t1 fit and insurance i made it the 3 jumps trough low without a scout fitted cloaking and nano but mining was horrible 6000mUFFFD is hardly 3 cycles and i had to warp out nearly every time rats showed up additionally a bad repro plant in system  in fact its nothing you want to do on your ownanyways my concern is not about better ores in particular its about other ores variety is the key im fine finding veldspar fields with 60k on a roid and no ore thiefs spamming around 
it would be nice if you could include a drone that saw a salvage drone and drones that had the different scaners on them like a suruvey drone i think this would be a good addition to the drone types

wrong as it need to check what is the used tax it will use a modifier to tax x1 instead of x11 for example but it will check what the modifier is and apply it same problem that you have dismissed the system need to log the number of operations done every time players do an operation at the market and apply the multiplier even if it is x1 and it was not about jita but the linked node shared by several markets to reduce the load on the systems nodes you increase the load on the markets nodes and the markets are already slowif you put up a regional or ranged buy order currently the broker fee applied is that of the station where you put up the buy order there is no tax on the buyer side i am a tad unclear on what you mean there for my point about the increase in the number of operations the system would do something like this 1 items is sold2 system check the appropriate tax charge for standing a3 system check the appropriate tax charge for traffic size b and it need to check every time as it will not know the appropriate tax4 system do ab and determine the appropriate tax  as the values a and b are variables the system need to check what will be applied each timeyou can change 3 so that if it is  to 1 it directly use only a for the tax rate but the check is needed the same the number of transactions done is probably already logged so it will not impact much on the systemnote that it will broke the market for the orders with a duration longer than the period used to cycle to determine the tax and it will require that the tax was displayed at the time when you set up the sell order
why not just add a congestion charge to over crowded systems there is not many forcing players who want to buy few items to go else where and players that need many items such as a ship and all its fittings can still profit from entering congested system such as jita
again your entire argument is based on your assumptions on how a piece of code you have never seen didnt write and wasnt involved in its design works unless you can of course prove me wrong
a people will only leave jita if they have a reason to leave jita in the same way they only go to jita for a reason this change wouldnt alter the fact the entire range of anything makeable is available at jitab no i suspect that the opposite might in fact happen as the cost of selling at jita rises prices at jita will probably riseso hopefully what will happen with in eve will mirror a little better what happens in real life tm such as if you search around youll find cheaper prices elsewhere in the smaller trade hubsshopping malls but if you want convient shopping you goto the jitalarger shopping mall and get it all at once paying a premium for doing sothis isnt a congestion charge and i regret even mentioning jita in my op my fault i got hung up on a side benefit of this system instead of spendng more time being clear on the benefits of this lag and its solution is in the hands of ccp the economics and its problems are in the hands of us and ccpwheres dr eyjog when ya need him im sure hed be better at explaining the serious problems that one massively dominant point of sale has on an economic landscapethose in eve who exclusivly sell through jita have an advantage over others who do not sell in jita by the sheer volume of customers available to sell to but in real life tm those with the biggest shop window which looks out over the most potential customers pay considerably more for the privaledge than othersits no about fairness its about logic those who sell in larger trade hubs would have to pay for the privledge of doing so
and you misinterpret me i am not speaking of the code but of the market for the seller your idea will change the tax bracket every month or week day or whatever time frame you want my order was done day 1 of month 1 with a tax rate of 1 so the sell price is based on that after i month the tax rate go to 2 as the system see a lot of trade that alone can eat 2030 of the profit for some item sample example 1 have sold a golem production cost is around 650 millions sell price 700 millions transaction tax was 556 millions broker fee 257 millions so my profit was a little more than 40 millions it the tax rate increase to 2 before my sale the profit is reduced by about 12 and that is in a station where i have good standings and with some decent trade skill so your idea will make difficult for traders to predict the profit as the tax will change from a period to the next that is what i mean with breaking the market for orders with a longer duration that the tax change cycle
wallmart docet rl is exactly the opposite you can usually find better quality items shopping around but very rarely lower prices than the big discounts
this is a terrible idea trade hubs are a good thing for the game
yes i completely agree but since this proposal dosnt get rid of trade hubs but in actual fact helps to encourage additional trade hubs at a slight cost to one dominant trade hub i guess you misunderstood
you keep saying that my proposal will increase the load on the market server and yet you claim this has nothing to do with the code  im confused by thiswallmarts dominance has less to do with lower prices on the shelf and more to do with dodgy business practices which in eve would be acceptable but in real life  but thats a totally different discussionand yes you can find better quality than walmart if you shop around almost alwaysbut yes you can find cheaper than walmart if you shop around but it takes some looking aroundbut wallmart dosnt open stores on the high street they open stores in locations with cheap rent knowing that their cheap priced goods will bring their customers to themand my proposal would hopefully help corporationsindividuals reduce their prices in comparision to the major trade hub and thus send them on their way to becoming the next walmart
current plex spawning mechanic is suchplex spawn random at dt as they are found and complete they respawn else whereproblem as interest in fw wane not enough people plex so trying to contest or save a system is best done right after dt after which time youd have to run plex all over the region each one netting you 25 chance a plex will appear in the system you wantproposed change make plex static and do not close victory point awarded on a per minute basis

as per the interview noah ward chief dev gave regarding the csm iceland meeting the same one where he said that they wanted to see sweeping ideas coming through not niggling little things the impression i got was that he saw it as one of his main functions was squashing the sparkly  original ideas that new devs bring to the team and giving them into the same jaded elitist im better than all of you so i could give a rats bottom what you think sort of person that he came accross as himselfpersonally i dont really care about the big ideas ea holds no interest to me whatsoever and from what ive seen of ambulation so far i dont think im really going to care about that either eve is a game where details matter fix the bl00dy details before adding a swathe of big new ideas it worries me that in the latest newsletter which i received yesterday sorry to spoil the surprise if anyone hasnt had it yet they boast about fixing 1000 bugs for ea with the implication there were still a lot more to fix when i read that i was horrified that there were even 1000 outstanding that they hadnt bothered to sort out never mind that the true total is even higher but what do i know  ive only been designing games not on the computer for 28 years so clearly i know jack about what makes good game design sorry for offtopic rant

ccp needs to weed out those which are causing a lack of progression within the csm right now or it is doomed to faili suggest starting with darius johnsondid the csm members actually have to sign anything to concur with a set of rules for behaviour on the csm
i agree get rid of the biggest troublemaker and the worst mudslinger in the group jade contantine
the csm document describes that the csm has to go by a high social standard so everybody should have read it but nothing was signed
not really or not in this instanceit seems to me that shes simply saying she doesnt loathe anyone in the csm
darius has done nothing but cooperate with the csm dont take my word for is go ahead and ask the rest of the councilim sure hed respond to this direct and personal attack but it seems hes held to a different standard by the moderation team than everyone else
thank you for expressing the communitys opinionand here we have darius a fine example of what not to elect to the csm if its ever to be anything true if epeen were worth anything hed be the richest man in the world but unfortunately its currency that only accumulates in evewhen the next election comes and its due soon vote anyone but a goon
for what its worth i dont think the csm idea was bad but the reality is we did get people elected who loathe one other and cannot remain civil let alone cooperate  and given eves political climate its hardly surprising that happens since the game is built around grudges and vendettas and dark brutality whatever happens in the future the reality is some of those people will keep getting reelected due to alliance voting blocks so yes its a problem and im honestly not sure how you deal with it you can certainly make sure you pick candidates you believe are capable of turning the other cheek  but you cant stop other players electing their own choice of knifewielding dramamerchants if it pleases themthe problem is that the csm ended up composed disproportionately of 00 leaders the csm should have different rules of eligibility next timedivide up the csm seats into districts so that there can be proportionate representation across the various places players play ie candidates will be running for a seat to represent empire players a seat to represent 00 a seat to represent lowsec and a certain number of at large that are open everywhere etc ccp screens candidates for eligibility they can determine where their activities primarily are

id much prefer a single skill to train with a second skill selectable as the rollover if the rollover skill finishes training haltsor a que that allows for 24 hours of training the skill must already be in place it cant be a skillbook this would be best for short duration skills generally less than 68 hours
1 along with most of what else has been said herejonas
isnt a simple solution that your primary skill can only be level 4 or less take care of the training 2 skills to 5 bit you cant set amarr bs v and queue caldari bs v for instancethen set the secondary skill as currently training skill to next level or any skill to next level you could set amarr bs 4 and queue amarr bs v or set caldari bs 3 and train caldari or gallente bs 4 on queue provided you already had amarr and gallente bs 3 and caldari bs 2level 4 doesnt take too long especially compared to training something to level 5 just saying
bumping should not cause damage due to landing in stations gates other ships when coming out of warp unless theres a certain timer that allows you to move outside the object before you come back into phase with the surrounding space during which youre invulnerable to such things as smartbombs bombs ect and cant be targeted this will allow people to load their grid during shortlag situationsotherwise the mass of a ship should determine which is affected by a bounce the lighter ship suffering the larger deviation on collision if the colliding ship is small enough it goes off in some random direction while the larger ship is unmovedthat will put bumping into the hands of bs pilots not interceptors
bumping damage isnt implemented until 1 second after warp completes a you phase back in hence you rocket off but dont take damage
wait you mean being able to instantly teleport huge amounts of goods from across the eve universe incurs some risk its fine freighters esp jump freighters arent really meant to be solomobiles yes you need your corps help and no thats not a bad thing
carebear whine thread there is hardly any risk in jumping a jf around you can have cyno up at pos or right next to station to dock whats the problem
there isnt any problem like many people said current mechanics arent seriously borked but there is a chance of improvement and even create a new profession for it besides there isnt any real reason for factions not allowing to cyno in non offensive commercial ships into their territoriesoh ccp give us our daily pew pew argument is a bit shortsighted here its not like you will be able to catch these suckers on regular basis they hug pos or stations and have more than enough hp to crawl back to their safe place
great answer fuze
i read this a while back and just backed off a bit because i my self do not see any value in fw but after reading other posts from players that have absolutely no clue what the alliances in 00 are about or their true nature i think this would be a great way for your normal npcempire player to get to know some of these guys i think this would be a great way alliances to find new pilots alsothis would bring in a stronger game play with experienced fcs that do this on a regular basis and the knowledge passed on would be immeasurable i would also see the new pilots learning how to pvp pick up a lot faster as a whole than just a few corps entering the fray
agreed another consideration is that allowing alliances into fw gives the militias themselves an oportunity to organize one of the drawbacks to the militias is that because anyone can join there are often troublemakers either intentionally or not allowing alliances into fw doesnt just mean that existing alliances would be able to enter it also means that corps already in fw can create an alliance collecting the best fw corps under a unified banner currently the only means by which to accomplish this is to try to convince militia members to join a single corp which is like herding cats while creating a cohesive alliance is no easy undertaking it gives you more tools and more flexibility to work with
just to clarify matters we formed the pie alliance not to take part in the tournament but to take part in the fw prototype aka the defiants  saracens story arcccp through their rped amarrian mouthpeice told us that we would be expected to have more than the three active war decs permitted to lone corporations  effectively forcing us to form an alliance
proposal cautiously supported by the way
i dont think no one else in the corporation should be allowed to cancel the job ceos officers etc should retain the privilege to go no we arent doing that however someone of the same rankposition should not be able to cancel the work order of a peer
exactly that
id rather that it be limited to people with the roles to install jobs have the ability to cancel themwho deliveredinstalledcancelled jobs should be logged howeverlimiting it to only the installer can be very difficult to manage if that person is offline when the job is completedorjobs can be delivered by anybody but can only be cancelled by the installer or ceo
i like the extra logging who canceled a job as well
signedi know of 5 alt corps setup for research and manufacturing just because of this that would all be gone if this was put into place  fixedjonas
thats sort of what im getting atthe idea is more on the lines of getting some back up from friends who might not necessarily be in your corp it would also be sort of like being able to have an alliance for missioners etc as they are definately vulnerable against someone who is in a pvp ship compared to the missioner who can be effectively helpless in a mission setup shipthe way it is now a fleet member could be being attacked and theres not much that anyone can do about it apart from sitting there watching him die i just think this would make it a bit more even for the carebear instead of being a sitting duck
as one of the 8 i wholeheartedly support this idea while ive made various little tweaks to not make it so hard to distinguish between red and green it still doesnt solve all the problems
count me in on the wanting to hear an update but dont hold your breathas for me personally i always love it when the execs at ccp open their mouths it gives us players solid quotable evidence to call them on when they always fail to live up to their promisesunfortunately i hate to break it to you but i have been with eve and ccp since it went live and i have never not once seen them live up to the spirit of a promise i have seen on rare occasion them live up to the letter of a promise but even then they are never anything even remotely close to what should have gotten done andor fixedso take my advise and take what any ccp exec says with a grain of salt they almost never have the fortitude or the dedication to ever deliver on what their big mouth promisesjust my two isk from experience peace
no more lag on the internet lol youre delusionalhardware upgrade requires code upgrade to function properly which is in progress as indicated by several devposts all over the place itll be finished soontm or at least eventuallydoubt the csm will be able to get any eta on it as there probably is no eta maybe some progress news will be provided at fanfestbut it cant hurt to ask anyways so support
i would personally love an update sadly i have a feeling ccp either1 will tell us to go away and play in our sandbox2 will announce something at fanfestbecause all lag will be gone by 2008 right
yes for tangible rewards and meaningful consequences to fw plexingccp already said somewhere that deny docking rights is technically difficult to implement but that deny service use is an optionbut that does not solve the problem that fw currently only cost a lot of money for the participating players with no actual reward besides the onetime standing boosts for promotion and any tags the players might snatch from the npcs it would be nice if the militia would offer a sustainable playstyleid like to see some more discussion on the possible rewards and consequences before i bring up this issue
how come conquerable stations have this implemented a possible option could be that can use station services for free or have reduced costs when your faction owns the system
without other potential gains for capturing systems locking your enemies out of a system by limiting dockingservices becomes less of a reward towards your faction but instead only weakens your enemy especially vs neutrals to fw and in the long run might lead to your faction virtually locking down all your enemies epecially an outnumbered ones systems for goodbesides having occupancy influence docking rightsstation services introducing faction specific lp store items and lp awards for capturing plexessystems would seem like a nice touch
ive said this before in other threads but ill repeat it heres a simple easytoimplement method to make system capture more fun for rpers and more profitable for everyone1 remember those cosmos sites with trade agents that demand various ancient landfill products in exchange for rewards recycle the code and create fw bases with similar agents for the matari these would be reeducation camps for freed slaves to be reasimilated into npc society and agents would accept slaves in exchange for lps for the amarrians these would be heathen religious camps for captured matari to be enslaved and agents would accept refugees in exchange for lps no cash just lps2 reuse the cosmic anomaly code to create fw civilian sites that would drop slaves in amarrian sites or refugees in matari sites possibilities for these anomalies might include colonies slave pens cripples transports etc the creation of these sites would be triggered by the capture of complexes  each complex might spawn one or two of these sites while system capture might generate enough to require industrials to transport the slavesrefugees for system capture make some of the sites spawn immediately plus more periodically over the course of several days3 come to think of it make it so that both factions reward the return of both slaves and refugees this would create a new commodity to fight over as is the aftermath of a system capture both sides race to takerecoverfreeprotect slaves or freemennote that this is not in place of elises idea but in addition to i like the idea of each faction not having access to services in hostile stationssupported
sure
and i dont think you can readseems to me lv wants the answer that never came and i support his desire to have an answer when a company says well look into it most people expect them to say something about it after a while and apparently ccp has not
you are rightmy idea with this post was also that it would be a good thing to see what the community thinks about this the support shown in this thread shows that the community would like to see this
actually the support in this thread shows that a dozen players in the community assuming they are all uniques support this from 20000 that votedalso how do you know that ccp havent already implemented the tagging just cause you dont see any in patch notes it doesnt naturally follow that they havent done itthere is another possibilitytake carearithron
i looked through the first couple pages and saw no mention of this so ill trywhat about a trust or feedback rating system for contracts where you can rate a player after a contract transaction for example you buy some nice dg launchers from someone and afterword you just give a thumbs up or down which gets tracked for the user then if someone else does the usual trying to sell a regular raven as a navy raven and you fall for it you log a negative on them almost like a ebay feedback system if a user has a 0 or below rating there will be a pop up flag or some warning right on the contract saying the seller has a negative rating and to make sure to read the contract there are so many scammers taking advantage of people too trusting or naive some will say we dont need this if you fall for a scam whatever but in rl there are avenues to take to get your money back better business beureu in the us local police news agencies etc why not have the same in eve i would think its a simple system and wont prevent anyone from properly selling and wont really fully prevent scammers but it would helpjonas
that would be great for contract handling particular couriers to get a break on high collateral or something
i cant support this  a contract doesnt suffer from ebays problem of nondelivery since the terms of the contract are written out explicitly and inviolably and failure to complete a contract is impossibleexcept in the case of courier contracts but they have collateral for that i dont care if the person im buying from has scammed a thousand people before  i read any public contracts i think of accepting and dont accept bad ones eve operates on caveat emptor not the bbb and fraud legislation
eh when you put it that way id have to agreebut i thought the scc was the eve version of the bbb or the sec  o 
good plan i fuly support this using standings is not an appropriate way for this for several reasons so this rating should be a new dimension
hello all i just read a thread in the skills category and it talks about how bad it sucks to train up to large t2 hybrid turrets the skill requirments are horrendous while the missile skill requirments are easyusing the skills for example to train up to t2 torpedoe launchers for me gallente would take only 26 days and to train up to tech 2 cruise missile launchers would take only 38 days again this coming from me being gallenteto train for t2 blasters large would take me atm about 70 days which i find a bit excessive and might sound a bit carebearish but i find it a bit unfair that soemone could train for these tech 2 weapons so easily while it remains so damn time consuming for large t2 hybridsnow to put this in a bit more focus isnt it a bit stupid that i can train for two different battleship sized tech 2 weapons in less time than it would take me to train for one battleship sized tech 2 weaponwould only take me 64 days of training total to train for tech 2 cruises and tech 2 torps while taking me 70 days for large tech 2 blasters and an additional 23 days to train for large tech 2 railguns for a total of 90 days of training for my own races large tech 2 weaponsnow im making a proposal i honeslty believe that either ccp needs to increase the support skill requirments for t2 cruise  torp launchers or decrease the support skill requirments for large t2 weaponssome ideas i had in mindfor t2 cruise missiles you need warhead upgrades v for tech 2 cruise launchers to increase their damageand you need missile projection v for t2 torp launchers to increase their rangeoronly require motion prediction to lvl 3 for large t2 hybrids and only require medium hybrid blaster spec to lvl 3 as opposed to motion prediction lvl 5 five and medium blaster spec to 4 for themand maybe do similar reductions for medium t2 hybridsand do the same w minmtar projectile and amarrlasers since thye are also affected by thiscontructive criticsm that i probably wont read and other replies appreciated
definitely support this in principle at the very least there ought to be a mechanism by which a stock transaction can take place in a semisecure means i dont think it would actually be possible to prevent ipo scams so clearly buyers will want to be careful who they buy from but it would be nice to be able to put out private or public buysell orders either on the market or through contract to automate the actual trade of the sharesa couple of specific capabilities id like to see1 the ability to offer stocks for sale either to the public as a whole or to corp members only or to specific individuals2 the ability to place blanket buy orders under similar conditionsfor example my corp has a stock program i would like to be able to as a hypothetical example place a corponly sell order for stock at 500k isk a public sell order for 550k and a public buy order for 500k this would allow the public to buy stocks with a transaction fee while not charging the transaction fee for corp members further any owner could sell the stock back at will so long as the buy order was reissued as needed
geared toward versatility and prolonged deployment in hostile environments marauders represent the cutting edge in todays warship technologyhaving read a few nonconstructive treads example on the issue of marauder i was thinking it was best to devote a new thread to this issuemarauders as i understand them  and i have marauder v and fly a golem daily  is to be the best ratting ship in the game and by correlation missions as well mine has been a joy to mission run in but thinking about ratting versatility and the prolonged deployment part then the ships are missing the powergrid to fit for utility here are the comparative powergrid numbers for the marauder and their t1 brethrenpaladinapocalypse 1350020500golemraven 65009500kronosmegathron 1200015500vargurtempest 790015500now some of the reasoning for the lower powergrid is that the marauders only fit 4 pg heavy turrentslauncers but the problem is that they cannot then fit any of the utility items heavy neuts cap boosters smartbombs mwd  etc since they are horribly low on powergrid this is most apparent with the vargur nearly 50 pg nerf and golem with 6500pg the  boosting rigs and items dont do muchthe result is that the marauders are fine missioning ships but horrible at the versatile lownullsec ratting exploration and complexing in hostile environments  which the flavor text at the top implies is their role nobody is going to take a 650 million isk ship that cannot fit neuts cap boosters smartbombs  etc into lownullsec of course some will reply that theyll never take such an expensive ship into hostile territory but some of us wouldnt mind so much if it had a fighting chance the only way to fit said items is to not fit some of the turretslaunchers and then there is no point to bring a marauder over the t1 versionsmy idea is therefore to increase the powergrid on these ships so that the possibilities for versatile fits increases if done correctly theyll still not be better damage dealers then the faction version of their t1 brethren which i think is a design goal but theyll live up to their role and mayhaps theyll see lowsec usage nota bene if lowsec usage of marauders is successful then there is the added bonus of making the lowsec pirates happy in that they now have a 600m isk ship to hunt for
by limiting gridcpu and sensor strength they shoehorned the marauder into typically only pve content they are very very limited when it comes to enough variety to their fittings strictly to keep them that waywhile i would like to see them useful for pvp combat they would probably unbalance it too heavily in the favor of the bigger alliances this would further unbalance the already excessive advantages the bigger alliances enjoy currentlygood idea but not one that could be easily supported
well my problem is that they havent made it useful for typical pve content it is only really useful for highsec or safe nullsec pve content and that defeats the whole purpose of the ship per its flavor textand let me reiterate the point marauders do not need more damage do not need more tank but they do need more powergrid to become versatile
pve versatilei agree that the vargur needs more pg leave the others alone
im assuming you didnt understand so ill not respond as to a trollyes versatility is needed for any ship to see actual pve usage in hostile environments lowsec non safe nullsec if it can only be fitted with the 4 weapons and no heavy neutralizers smartbombs heavy cap boosters mwds then it cannot be fitted against putting up any fight what so everyou are correct in your assumption that its not because of the pve environment but because of the pvp environment that this is needed but the role is still to make use of pve  just in those regions of space where pvp also exists
heres the pg situation for each of the ships with either 2 lar ii or 1 xlsb ii and four of the most pgintense weapons of the appropriate class and all skills at 5 paladin 2575long2375shortkronos 950long1893shortvargur 3545long405shortgolem 2848long959shorta pulse paladin blaster kronos or cruise golem has enough pg to fit support mods without great difficulty  maybe 12 rcus for a full set thats especially true for pvp on the paladin and kronos where you strip 23004600 pg of lar in order to fit your mwd and cap booster ill agree that the vargur gets screwed though  you can put together an autocannon pve setup but not much else ive played around some with a pvp kronos on singularity and for that particular ship i dont see any problems you can fit 3 medium neuts without fitting mods or you can strip damage mods to upgrade to large neuts my paladinflying buddy says the situation is similar for him and eft agrees  you can even keep some damage mods if you want to a golem is sketchier but depending on how you choose to fit it it can be effective so yeah id have to agree with the poster above me who says its just the vargur thats the problem  give it enough for a rudimentary pvp setup because an artillery vargur isnt exactly a gamebreaker in missions but leave the others alone also dont expect that any amount of pg will make people use marauders very often in pvp  theyre just too expensive for what they do it should be reasonable to try but its not something many people will ever actually do
no the problem is simply that lowsec ores suck and the solution is to boost them the normal lowsec ores the ones you find in hisec explo sitesmine into a jetcanif you mean npc pirates then get a friendalt to kill them for you if you mean player pirates then you dont need to warp out whenever they enter local just use the directional scanner and see if they try to probe you down if you see probes then warp out
there should be more of them the rats should be a lot tougher for the local security with minimal bounties and they should not be so amazingly difficult to probe out
npc pirates can ruin your mining if you are alone as mining barges arent meant to fight the rats you can find in 04 or less and they will spawn in the exploration site sadly you need to warp away if pc pirates are in system as the gravimetric systems are not deadspace so you can be scanned with a spook probe from outside you on board scanner range with almost pinpoint accuracy more than getting better ores my opinion is that a bit more gravimetric sites are needed and that the kind of ores and difficulty to pinpoint the site of high sec ores should be changed a bit to reflect the current ore values currently if you find a difficult to spot site it is almost always omber today one of the worst ores availablethe rats are exactly the same that can spawn in the belts of that system the gravimetric site is only one more spawn point in the system
wouldnt it be nice to travel through a region where your standings with the particular interested party might otherwise preclude such safe passage ever wanted to jump into a system to buy something urgently but standings meant that such a journey will result in destruction from those pesky gate guns etcwell heres an idea to allow just such things for a little isk of course its not my idea it might even have been proposed elsewhere but here it is in the assembly hall for comments and supportideaallow the option of paying officials a bribe effectively to grant safe passage from npc gunsships etc and to allow access to stations in regions and systems where otherwise you be considered hostile due to low standings with said racefaction etc make the charge for passage related to standings with said entity and to the standing with that entitys enemies the bribery needs to have a very definate and short time period effect maybe allow longer periods for a higher cost but a exponential costit might be possible to have stations eject characters if their time runs out whilst dockedmaybe some other players have additional ideas just add them belowtake carearithron
a system where small fleets can either knock out the security of a pos allowing a raiding party to steal a limited amount of loot from hangars silos ect in a power down mode but the destruction of the pos is impossible or maybe sumthing like a shield jamming module that allows an enemy ship through the pos shield to do the raid oviously the defences would still be on so the raid would be dangerous to the small raiding fleet this module would only be fitted to sumthing like a cruiser that has a limited cargo capacity and would take up most of the power or cpu of the ship meaning you couldnt tank or fit many wepons meaning it would be a daring raid but proffitable if pulled off this would mean that the pos owner would have to activly patroll the pos to avoid such actions
because you insist reading 2 different arguments as one1 it will increase market load2 it will create problem for sellers as they will not know what the tax will be next weekmonth and this will make impossible to predict the actual cost of the tradeif your read the posts instead of skipping it is will be clear but jita is wallmart not a store in central manhattan it has the lowest sell prices not the highest you are trying to solve a problem that dont exist jita live on mass trade not high margins
no it wont increase market load and i can say that with equal authority that you put forward your claim because neither of us actually knows how it would effect market load because neither of us knows how the market worksrunning a buisness is a gamble which products you make what price you sell them at and where you sell them are all a gamble not knowing what the tax will be next month is just another very minor gamble at last a valid criticizm and lets be honest one i cant answer because your right perhaps im seeing a problem where one dosnt exist
agreedfw is dying more quickly than slowly due to the lack of any tangible results
do you have any idea who the members are there are 9 seats only 3 are from 00how does that have anything to do with the problems in the csm
removed please post constructively navigator
his poor attitude is clear for all to see who can read these forums its not suitable for a member of the csm if you cannot see this then your blinded by your association to him
im not convinced thats actually the problem so much that the 00 leaders it ended up with all came from the same kinda philosophical block without much healthy debate or alternative viewpoints between them we have had the problem that the 00 knowledge expressed by the experts has too often been gone unchallenged by rigorous debate and left to stand some of the non 00 csms on the council have been a little too hesitant about going against the stated prevailing wisdom of the 00 csms on nullsec issues and this is something i feel to be a mistake given eves interconnected single server nature  things have always gotten too personalized too quickly ive certainly tried to be a counter to the bigalliance status quo vote but its very easy to stereotype my position as being some whining wannabe that simply wants to damage 00 empires because im apparently not good enough to run one rather than seeing the input for what it is being the promotion of genuine gameplay options for smaller organizations and roving playstyle the tendency to personalize these things ruins decent debate and to be fair its something ive tended to do as well by representing the other side of the issue as lazy status quo worshiping bloatinterests that just want to defend their own backyard but i guess thats partisan politics baby and the problem is you dont typically find out anything about the reality of 00 warfare without getting passionate about the whole thing so you come to table either without knowledge  or with knowledge tempered by bias against the other side of the argumentthats an interesting idea really be a devil of a thing to sort out the details for though  youd need some kind of objective re ccp sponsoredindependent oversight committee to decide the electoral boundaries  maybe mr ingthorsson could help againbut yeah if it came down to something like off the top of my head 13 00 seats contested by 00 powers13 empire seats contested by mission runners pveers empire fighters13 lowsec seats contested by pirates bounty hunters mercs explorers etc13 random indeps contest by whoever felt they could make a special interest messageyou might well get a more interesting council all round worth talking about certainly though of course the flaw in system would likely be that a big 00 power could just split its vote again and get a candidate in for 00 and for one of the others to double up its csm power the only real cure for that one is an end to voting apathy and ensure as many people as humanly possible are encouraged to vote or make voting mandatory on the login panel  you have to pick a candidate or click abstain to get into the game that also might work
not really  youd wind up with random csms not good ones the current crew internecine warfare aside has been fairly effective and representative of all the various types of players in the game i dont trust that the 89 of the population who doesnt care would elect a group as good also its never a good idea to make people do work that they dont want to do in order to be able to play a game that theyre paying you for access to
thats what the abstain button would be for
dividing seats on the csm by district or however else you want to is really an unworkable ideagiven that many players have multiple characters how would you and who would deem x player eligible for running to represent x district or maybe you were thinking of the characters coming from these areas forgetting that players who run characters have multiple ones making the csm form from characters from certain districts on a quota basis just silly when you think about it afterall its not the characters that discuss issues in real life with ccp or get together in csm meetings its real players having districts etc doesnt avoid certain types of players or make the resultant csm anymore diverserepresentative in any realitytake carearithron

would have to agree on the drone bay issue there it just something id keep in the hanger these days
quoting the goon wiki give this thing the same 4 turret layout 100 damage bonus as the new nightmare instead of a ty laser cap bonus then maybe peopled actually fly iti know i would this ship suffers pretty heavily from an overall lack of dps really give it the ability to do damage and still have enough high slots to be effective and i think it would quickly change from the subpar ship is now to well worth the 800mil isk these things are worth
this is exactly my thinking one of the best posts i read in monthsfor all people flame about wow and co on these forums there is one thing to be said for them accessabilitynow im not saying get rid of the skillsystem alltogether because eve is pretty much based on it but like maximum i started an alt recently and thought back to being a noob how much it sucked then and how much more it must suck nowas a noob you see all the cool stuff and cant wait to play only to find out that to do anything at a semicompetitivelevel will take them literally months to attain and thats a highly specialized character not a good character with some versatility without them even being able to accellerate the processim sure the devs realize at least to some extent that the hole grows ever larger but i wonder whether they can look through their blinders enough to save eve from its slooooow agonizing slip into obscurity
i have always thought of eve as a secondstage mmo game  the kind of game you come to when youre worn out with the accessible and easy games like wow which are out there that kind of newbie isnt looking for more spoonfeeding they want a challenging game and thats what eve is yes it is a cool game but i would be wary of recommending it to someone entirely new to the genre let them get their feet wet in more accessible games firstive been playing mmos for over 10 years now meridian 59 everquest asherons call daoc horizons and even wow before coming to eve and i had no trouble at all adjusting to the way the game works i would rather need to train something for a long time to be good at it than to be automatically good at everything  otherwise the training is worthless and the game becomes boring with everyone good at everything for me wows problem is exactly that  every class is capable of soloing admittedly some better than others which makes it pretty dull and blurs the line between the classes
ive loved this idea since it was posted
wasnt aware of this idea until just now but i like it
supported and added to the agenda for sunday 28th sept
the part where it makes basically no sense and seems like an excuse for ccp to do nothing based on anything the csms are doing surprise were going to make a huge change to ship speeds now on test vs csms are going to have tons of input into how we run our game well fly them to iceland and have discussions they also cant talk about anything that was discussed in specific detail and we may or may not implement anything at some point in years after the meetingwhy make a big deal about this program institute a forum and so on if theyre going to sweep everything under the rug i can read bein when he says i cant comment but that doesnt mean i actually understand why thats the case

this is a constitutional issue that has been stated in a passing note within the latest csm devblog about the sudden 21 year age limit suddenly imposed by csm for candidates in the next election as mentioned in the comments thread this has effectively broadsided lavistas reelection campaigngiven that voters were conscious of lvs age and that he had been publicly tested and vindicated on the forums through running 2 public organisation successfully within market discussions lv having wanted to run for csm was first effectively elected within md as the preferred candidate for championing science industry and economic matters and won a place on the csmtherefore this sudden rule change has put a massive spanner in both csm candidates and voters who are interested in this particular area and thus is something that requires a little more thoughtthis is especially pertinent as the next patch midas will be targetted to industry and general improvements across this part of the game of which lv is the champion delegate of exactly that areanow while i generally agree with the age limit in this particular case the candidate should be omitted from this rulei therefore propose a small clause to be added that instead of just the 21 year age limit to be a valid candidate that it becomes the 21 year age limit to be a valid candidate unless the candidate has held a position on the csm previously
adding the thumbs up
can understand in some countries this might make sense but to put it on all eve players is a bit much 18 i would agree with but 21 is too much
i guess its because of the hard spirits and ccp doesnt want to be compromised by pictures showing them with a drunk underaged tbh i dont care average age of players is well above 21 i can imagine and so i have no problem with that rule ccp will have their reasons for that
dont nerf lavista vista
lavista vista cant go
limit should be higher and not allowing kids to do important things
youre right players of 20 years old and younger are not important and completely irrelevantwhile were at it women should be banned as wellcommunists toowhat have you been smokingif there needs to be a limit it should in my opinion be 18 but i also highly doubt there should be a lowest permitted age limit at alledit 1 isnt this restriction a bit too photographicedit 2 since a there is no relevant age restriction on playing the game other than the 13 years of age b if the underage player has parental consent to play the game and c the csm is the body that represents the players i find it highly irrational to impose an age restriction if the csm is a democratic representation of the player base let it be a democracy for everyone
the sudden change is odd and lv should be allowed under this rule if alcohol consumption is the key here simply make a rule about underaged drinking and minimumage in country of citizenship
alcohol consumption was not an issue the csm was asked to stay sober for the csm meetings and it could simply be enforced for people who are under the age of majoritythe age of buying alcohol in my country denmark is 16 but people should of course respect icelandic law i agree the answer xhagen has given is that its due to practical reason of the nda but this is irrational due to the fact i had to have it signed by a legal guardian as welli could understand a limit of 18 but not 21
lavista vista is doing a far better job as being a representative for the notsopewpew side of eve than many others who are on the csmhe stays until his 2 terms are up
i believe lvv should be grandfathered in the rule was not in place originallyhe got specific permission from the gms last roundhes got parental permission parent signed nda i can see this rule being applied forward but not backward i support putting lvv on the ballot
lv stays or our wrath shall be furious
lavista vista is doing a great job he replies to numberous topics and are helpful and brings forwards alot of ideas to ccp which probably wouldnt get there if it wasnt for him hell is he possibly one of the most loved members of the csm hes had this position now and suddenly it will be denied
i voted for vista he stays
one of the guys i respect the most on the csm let stand again ccp
whether you agree with the age limit or not its bad to change the rules after a process has already startedget lvv back in
age discrimination is not cool
ccp puts this cause they look funny to press bad stuff ccp i though you had mroe personality as a company
im all for the 18 rule instead of the 21 ccp consideried the csm meeting to be a success thus proving that people under 21 can handle the responsbility that has been entrusted themfurthermore ccp wants us to move towards a gaming democracy even if in this case could be considered metagaming and the people the players have cast their votes
gotta say im surpised by this move i had a nice long post typed up but the forums ate itprobably because it was witty and clever so in short i hereby dismiss any agerelated changes to the csm requirements effective immediatly pull your head out ccp and do the right thingas amarr citizen 155 spokesperson for the amarrian race and supreme ruler of vaajaita i approve this messageedit forgot my thumb
support added
its a simple as this since lavista vista has already signed an nda and is legally bound by an nda he doesnt need to sign another so legally ccp and lavista vista and the parentlegal guardian who signed the nda are coveredthere is no legal reason why lavista vista should not be able to run again
the irony in this post is unbelievable
stopping a wellfunctioning and wellsupported csm member from running for reelection is not gonna increase faith in the csm as an institution
this is hilarious ill support it as such
thissigned for added support to lvrule could be applied but current underaged csm members should be allowed for a second term let voters decides if they did a good job or not
i support this let lavista run again
stupid discrimination is stupiddont nerf lv or any other victims of this new rule
already signed an nda there is nothing to talk about let him run again let the voters choose
having an age limit is coolpreventing a well known proven csm from running again not coolget your act together ccp
the 21 year old age limit is bull i voted for lvv and want him back hes the only person on the csm that cares about us carebears
id at least like to see ccp explain why theyve changed the age limit if theres some obscure insurance or legal issue then i guess theyd have to comply but tell us so rather than just pull the rug from under an existing csm
echoing the sentiment in this thread he has done a good job and is very visible on forums being generally useful waive the restriction for him drop the restriction back to 18 or at least give us a very good reason why you have instated it
me signedthere should be a brain age limitnot an age limitlike the yahoo who remarked about kids he should be blockednot the other way aroundmost kids these days are not very bright but there are a few who are actually smarter and more intelligent than the adults aremost adults are as dumb as brickslvv is great for the csm he has my supportdont kick him for his age should be an qualification of maturitynot age
lv one of the main reasons that the csm was at all effective and not a complete joke
no i can not support this so i do a thumbs downyou either let em all in or none of em in
i support the clause let lvv be grandfathered in
i dont actually agree with this per se as im against the plan in general  i think lavistas candidacy alone proves it redundant and given people can own accounts and play under the ages of 21 then they should also be representednevertheless ill vote thumbs up as a clause highlights theres a flaw in the proposed plan
lavista vista is the best of the csm delegates and has performed his elected role better than any other two csms combined that you could care to name should he wish to stand again he should have the option to do so as an earlier poster mentioned lv is why the csm project has not deteriorated into a complete farce
i dont know the guy but all of a sudden changes like that that seem to blatantly out someone is ridicules supported

the op wants to cyno into high sec because he wants to move his stuff with zero risk and maybe do high sec to high sec jumps basically instatrading so let me rephrase my post from before its an iskfarmer  carebear whinethread
absolutely not terrible ideaflying a jf is aready pretty risk free as it is if you know what youre doing if you dont then people will be there to equalise the gap between isk and iqit will also shrink the universe even further make logistics easier who needs their own manufacturing capability in 00 if you can jump from your hq to jita and back again in 20 minutes easily doable with a cyno chainyou need some protection for your multi billion isk shipcargo get out of your hugbox and get your corpmates to secure the jump in pointedit how do i make thumbs updown

if you never proposed that then this makes absolutly no sense

so you can pop a high sec cyno for your jf to jump to then what if your jf is in high it cant jump out hmmmmstill stupid and 999 ultracarebareishfeed me feed me im a hungry troll
exactlycyno to low sec allready possible cyno back to high then use normal stargates to move your jf aroundor cyno back to lowthrows in another beer

spot on
me wants to join an alliance and fw so make it possible ccpyou wont see the average 00 pos warfare in empire simply as there are only few very good moons to harvest and because you cannot claim sovereignty anywaysthe idea with the alliance standing sounds good just give it a try one could still remove the ability again its only a game after all
theres no need alliances whether they roleplay or not are too powerful and too wealthy to be a part of what ccp wants to be the pvp training grounds the idea is for hisec people to experience pvp in a secluded area with a variety of ship types and to then get interested in 00 to eventually move out there or move to low sec its simply not designed to allow alliances to partakenow you may say that youre a tiny rp alliance but that doesnt mean large pvp alliances wont join up and turn fw into capital wars even if you set a high standing to lessen the chances of larger alliances joining you are still setting a precedent for them to do so and kill fwtheres a lot that people can and cant do in this game keeping alliances out of fw is just another one i feel sorry for you but the big picture of alliances with fw is very unhealthy perhaps disbanding into one large corp is your best option and well very doable i might addconsider the wide variety of players who do their own specific racial missions who is to say in an alliance what faction they will go for or against you could literally sit in an alliance with 1000 people and watch your standings drop to a faction that you worked so hard for by doing nothingalliances bring too many cans of worms keep them out period
i know you are chair but this tells me that you are abusing this seat to push an issue that only a select few care about its your personal opinion and i dont think its ever been a big enough issue to present to the csm or ccp its rather been your agenda a well done campaign i must add but there are far more pertinent needs in fw than the whines of a few rp alliances once those details are wrinkled out ill be glad to listen to your alliance debate but until those are fixed adding your personal agenda should be pushed to the back burner i hope you see the real flaw in fw and say as much as you can about what the players of fw really want rewards that should be the first priority in your fanfest meetings so please do that first add up the people involved in fw then add up your rp alliances now tell me who deserves their needs first fix fw then worry about allianceswrong alliances wont fix fw they will kill it use the games current mechanics to be a part of fw simple
supported and added to the agenda for sunday 28th septthe arguments for this are frankly superior to those against
yes yes yes yeswant to know what sucked less than two weeks after forming the first ammatar roleplaying alliance in eve we were forced to ditch into a fw corp to actually defend the mandate does that make any sense no find a smart way to keep huge nullsec alliances out but allow people whove been supporting their chosen faction since day one to get in uglebs ideas are winners
just last night i dropped 7 probes in a system to get full coverage and just after the last one i got disconnected it was a bit frustrating plopping down another full set right next to the ones already there the probes keep the corp tag on them there isnt character association data displayed ever not sure if that is something that is just not programmed to be displayed left out intentionally or if the data isnt there at allpoint being if there is data behind the scenes that tie probes to a character i dont see why they still cant be used after a disco

i believe this issue was already brought before ccp through csm the answer given at the face to face conference was that the developers would keep this in mind going forwardas a valid point but not rework what has been done in the passed
csm memberswhat business is it of ccps if weve used a given password in the past and have decided we want to do so again why do they need to keep a list of all the passwords weve used for our accounts why shouldnt we be able to rotate a set of three or four passwords that we commonly use most importantly is their current policy a good onein short i think this is a nearly useless feature which keeps track of personal information that is not ccps concern in the first place id like to ask the csm to address the elimination of the message and preventative measures keeping us from reusing an old password keeping track of passwords formerly associated with a given account is a pretty big security risk anyway as those passwords may be associated with other noneve personal accounts such as email maintained by the account holdersthanks for your support
im not sure i quite get itcould you please refer to where you read that ccp keeps a log you have used in the pastthanks
this is easy for anybody to testjust try to change your password in account management to any password youve used previously and youll see the issuenot only does ccp tell you that you cant which is troublesome in and of itself but that means theyre keeping track of all the passwords youve used before

having played eve now on various accounts since 2005 i have had plenty of experience in both empire and null sec conflict and it occurs to me that there has been a very important and distinct difference betweeen the two in null sec alliances can live up to there full potential and in high sec they cannotto me this represents a huge imbalance in the gamein null sec due to the abscence of concorde and gate sentries different corps in alliances are free to use modules on eachother that in empire will either get you concorded or leave you as a target for sentriesthis leaves alliances open to various griefing corps in high sec that mercilessly exploit this imbalancei feel it is high time that this be addressed in some way let alliances in high sec have the same opportunity as there null sec brothers to live up to there potentialremote repping for the win up with remote sensor booosters down with friendly aggro
not supported there are risks you take when you enter null sec hence more rewarding fine the way it is
mara so are you saying that like 00 the repperbooster or what ever helping out is as targetable what i mean is if you come in and rep you buddy in high sec are you now targetable
no what she is saying i think is that while pilots in a corp can use remote repping modules on each other reasonably safely its highly risky for members of an alliance to do so if they arent in the same corp the reason for this is lag combined with eves targeting interfacebasically it works out like this im in a fleet battle and im shooting my war targets fair enough now my buddy starts getting aggro so i target him and put a repper on him still no problem my target dies and i carefully select the new primary and start firing no problem so long as im careful not to click on my friend right well what usually happens next is that a huge lag spike hits just after you activate your weapons the client delays activating your modules and the new target is destroyed your interface automatically picks a new target and activates your weapons on the new target instead of the old one unfortunately the new target it picked was your buddywho is in your alliance but not in your corp instant concordingthere is to my knowledge no way to prevent this from occuring it doesnt matter how careful you are if you have a friendly locked for rr or other aid when you activate weapons you might end up fireing at the friendy if the friendly is in your corp its ok because firing on a corp member doesnt provoke concord its ok in nullsec since there is no concord unless your friend is really touchy about such things but in high sec its instant and unavoidable death and as ive stressed theres no way to prevent it other than never using a logistics moduleit gets worse by the way imagine if you will that you are in an rr circle or something similar when the above occurs you get concorded then the guy whos repping you gets concorded for aiding a criminal then the guy aiding him and so onthe solution is not necessarily to change the concord rules by the way what needs to happen in my opinion is for the weapon activation to be linked to a specific target at the client the instant the button is clicked that way if lag hits you get annoyed by the you cant target that guy because he doesnt existis exploding rather than losing your ship because of a poorly designed interfacesupported
becq i understand what you are saying i guess what mara wrote threw me a bit and i was trying to grasp the point she was trying to make but she mentioned watching them die so i assumed there were no war conditions and her alliance mate was involved in a suicide gank or can flipping incident where her mate might be in the same alliance but mara is not involved in the aggression between the two parties i would like to see if there could be a little more clearer proposal before i vote one way or another even you said i think
there needs to be a way people can lock targets separately such as a friendly lock and a hostile lock maybe have two icons to lock with and alter some keyboard commands ctrlclick  hostile lock shiftctrlclick  friendly lockeach lock will only accept certain mods activated on it
why make it complicated just make the mods like energy transfer amour shield and hull reps and all other passive type stuff act like the ship cargo scanners simpleonly thing however if you are in a fight it would truly suck to have some one not even involved to start repping your opponent with out the ability to shoot the space priest
short answer nolong answer noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
missile skills have many compensatory disadvantagesin short while its quicker to skill for a specific large type of missile it takes longer to train for a class of missiles because you have to train the short and long range variants separatelyits as naive to say that missiles are easier to train as it is to say that missiles always hit youre taking an extreme case but lets look at the other extreme to train t2 small hybrids rails and blasters takes 280000 sp to train t2 standard missiles and rockets takes 770000 sp the gunner can master his frigate class weapons almost 3 times faster than the missile user we have the classic eve tradeoff quick payoff vs long term reward specialisation vs generalisation etc etcin short missiles are a different weapon type from turrets just as drones are are a different weapon type each type has its own skill characteristics  quirks eg surgical strike 3 damage  level vs drone interfacing  20 damage  level vs warhead upgrades  2 damagelevel on the face of it its brutally unfair that drone specialists get ten times the damage bonus that missile users do no why do gunners get 50 more damage bonus for 20 less sp
so i dont need to train large blaster specialisationincluding medium and small sepcs and large railgun specialisationincluding medium and small specs to use t2 all hybridsits truth that misiles train easier forgot abpout torepdoes rank 4 when others are rank 5 d
for my industry altit takes 32 days to get t2 torps100 days to get large close range weaponso you train 3x faster for bs class weapon is this alrightabout damage skills misile have much higher dps at start than turets on all 5 they are 2nd most damage weapons with no tracking only thing is you neeed to wait 2 sec to get damage done no big deal at all who trains standard misiles to t2 and rockets no one ow forgot that crows that are 100 hiting things at 7kms when turets would be 999 miss
did you even read what i wrote theyre different weapon types with different characteristics youre comparing apples and oranges are you in favour of eliminating the different shortlong range weapon type skills for missiles as well how about the missile support skills which are substantially weaker than the gunnery ones rof dps oh and make missiles hit instantly too pls  my manitcore will pwn when it doesnt have to wait 20 seconds for its shots to hit in fact just turn missiles into another kind of turret and eliminate the missile support skills altogether  unless youre going to introduce seperate support skills for each kind of turret hybrid sharphooting projectile sharpshooting energy sharpshooting what about the fact that gunners get trackingrange mods id love tracking computer scripts for missile velocityexplosion velocitylaunchers are as different from turrets as drones are deal with it
while you bring up an interesting topic i tend to favor a reduction in requirements for t2 turrets trying to get people into the ships they want to fly in a somewhat timely manner is importantalthough an extra month isnt so badalthough i think these weapons are quite different and as such require different requirements long range versions especially rails are much more effective in fleet battles and often blasters can easily match torps in close range and provide other benefits like actually being able to do meaningful damage to small shipsid have to say based on the current metagame this type of change is unneeded
not this myth again here are the sums of the ranks of the skills in the skill trees of missiles and each turret type split into weapons and support skillsmissile weapon skills 50turret weapon skills 41missile support skills 26 24 if you exclude defendersgunnery support skills 18missiles sum 76 74 if you exclude defendersgunnery sum 59the missile skill tree is significantly longer than each gunnery one and contains no transferable skills in return the missile user has the option to start the skill tree at different points its balanced
you count all misiles but dont count all turet types intresting

absolutely supported  its an annoying and outright silly process to switch ammotypes atm allowing this feature would make pvp much more fluent and quick
i know ccp explorers arguements but why not make it a client mechanic where you can choose a reload all with x ammo and your clients split the database calls into several smaller ones like it is manually been done these days by the user that should avoid increased database calls while at the same time make changing ammo alot more comfortable for uswould that change the behaviour of users to change ammo more often i guess so maybe numbers would go up by one fourth of total ammo change database callsis database calls a bottleneck in eve dunno
while i disagree with explorers arguments it isnt something that can be eliminated by the mechanism you propose the concern isnt eight database operations at once its that people will switch ammo more often when the ui for doing so gets less obnoxious it has nothing to do with the distribution of database calls and everything to do with the quantity as for the number of extra switches id wager its low people are used to spending too long on it and they still switch when necessary and in response to your last question yes database calls are a bottleneck in eve and a really bad one browse the market in jita to see what i mean
i disagree with the op marauders were designed for short range weapon systems alltogether even the vargur is fine on pg as its not an artillery boatalso they were designed as pve specialists if you want to use them in low sec area without any guardiance well your risk really imho it was ccps intention to not make them able to fit their primary weapon systems plus heavy neuts or other offensive or defensive like remote reps stuff as with one eccm you would have superior pvp ships and they were simply not designed for that
yep pretty much nailed it
the fact is they do not live up to the description that ccp teased us with foreverthat is a ship built to last in hostile space for extended periodsread the descriptionthis is a horrible attempt at bait and switch imhopromise us one thing and deliver something falling far below expectationsand on top of that making them in some cases more expensive than there faction counterpartsmeh

i have 54and 3 adv  5there is the beginning where a player is newim speaking nonalt he needs a bit of time to get his bearings having learning skills gives time for him to get to know the game before he gets confused by the variaty of things to doi know my head was spinning when i started in 2003 even when i had my brother guiding me this is even before we start talking about issues with macro miners and trialist exploitations opening uphaving to many cannot be trained on trial would surely annoy anyone valuating if he should play the game or not so learning skills does serve a pointto some extend anywayon the other side people say its your choice to train them well sure its your choice but you decrease your performance in the long run right away if you dont train them asapand if starting now youre already 5 years behind which is hard enough to catch up to also i feel it makes the game even more confusing for a newbie to enter the world knowing little and being gimped by a lot of training speed compared to someone who had a friend giving him heads up about learning skills learning skills arent the same as any other skill since what you sacrifice with other skills by not training is efficiency of certain field or usability of certain module what you sacrifice with learning skills is efficency to any field or usability to any module that is until you have trained itand in the end i dont feel its much of a character progression to decide when you train something it is rather when youre deciding if you train somethingmechanic that stands due to we had to do it suck it up well that is one failed mechanic personally im all for removing the learning skillsand adding base attributes by 11 or so and giving those trained the option to spend the amount of sp in skills of their choices dont see ccp caring enough though to do any changes so mehps someone talked about implants adding attributes i feel that is still character progression and spices the game up for all involvedmind this would have to be done in a bit more complex manner since you might suck at fx charisma and rule at memoryint so using the sp for charisma primary skills would give you advantage since all the basics are memint and 25 are dependant on them
i agree that youre hurting the character in the long term by not training them but you can certainly take a less focused approach than omg got to train all these to level 5 instantly before i can do anything else after all in 6 months time will it really matter that the character took 2 hours longer to train heavy missiles than it otherwise would have donei dont believe that a new player would really have too many issues with how fast his skills train  certainly not so much he would quit because they were too slow i didnt have an issue with it at all when i started i gradually phased the higher levels of learning skills in with my other skills and it was not a drag to learn them at all yes sure here i am 2 years down the line probably a couple of days worse off than if i had learned them all immediately but ive lost more training time than that just through forgettingnot being able to log in to change skills when they expirehowever if youre that keen not to hurt the new player experience boost a new players skill point acquisition times by say 25 reducing by 5 every week or two and ensure that aura has a section on skill training where she makes it clear that in order to maintain the skill point rate certain skills need to be trained
signlearning skills are an obscene waste of a new players time and nothing else

what much like the empire people having the same general concerns because they all encounter the same types of problems in empiregeographic proximity leads to the same problems experiencedie if it is cold people put on warm clothing when they go out i somewhat agree with you about the levels of healthy debate but that seems endemic to all csm discussions rather than a particular grouping of problemsnice kevin williamson approach to writing there thats the sort of approach that gets you flak handily ive pointed it out to you now so you should rectify that and no doubt get less flakagain probably a consequence of too little debate and discussion perhaps those adopting an issue could start by outlining the problem and leave the proposed fix to a subsequent post once the problem is clearly understood things should go more smoothly i have no idea what you are trying to say here this paragraph makes no sense put against the rest of your post please elucidateugh no that system creates elitism where there shouldnt be any one man one vote and all that pretty good idea id support that for the next elections it might need a shade of reworking ie people get a few chances to vote at login giving them time to look at the candidates or something iunno
in my opinion one of the hardest working and indeed best behaved csm members is lavista vistanow ccp plan to introduce a 21 year age limit for the next csm this would put lavista out of the running lavista vista has the right to run two full terms in office support our campaign to have lavista given special dispensation to complete his time as a delegatein order for csm to succeed ccp shouldnt be ruling out the admittance of one of its better members for a second term all the technical jargen that ccp have come up with were dealt with in the last electionplese go here and add your support
having the right to run again and completing a term is two very different things yes all delegates have the right to two terms but each one is seperate from the other in the sense that they are not counted as one period as such rules may change and they have lv has the right to run for csm when he is old enough acording to the rules put forth by ccp until then he must wait
look our various operating system disagreements aside i like lavista vista hes a nice guy and ive enjoyed alternately sparring and agreeing with him here on the forumsunfortunately some of the under 21 csms have shown an inability to handle the responsibility thus ccp is raising the age bar to ensure a more mature csm group that will take its job seriously regrettably this puts lavista vista out of the running for the time being however if he is still around in 3 years he will be eligible to run again and i will look forward to voting for him at that timein the mean time i would hope some of our more seasoned player base will step up and respectfully fill the chair that lavista vista will be vacating that is the best thing we can do for him to select an honorable replacement that will make him proud
voted for vista and if ccp doesnt let me vote for that guy again then im voting for goons besides smoking people out of csm via these means is utterly ridiculous
in england at the age of eighteeen you can purchase and drink alcoholic beverages join the army and go off to die for your country get married without parental consent vote in elections stand as a candidate in local electionsnow if an eighteen year old is considered mature enough to do all of those things why doesnt ccp consider them mature enough to sit on the csmin my view if an eighteen year old is sufficiently eloquent and passionate to garner enough votes why shouldnt he be on the csm
the csm thing is a waste of time
same thing in denmark but ccp isnt in england or denmark theyre in iceland and even if the csm agechange has nothing to do with icelandic laws theres nothing stopping ccp from making their own requirements if they feel that you have to have played eve for a minimum of 3 years be at least 25 years old and have a college education then thats their call granted the csm will not be more popular with those requirements but its up to ccp to decide they have changed the agerequirement thats all there is to it
who honestly cares the csm is justa farce anyway and nothing to do with ccps original idea of people having access to ccps data to ensure fair dev play
maturity isnt a digital thingif lavista vista is doing a good job they should grant him dispensationgenerally i do agree with that policy mind you
maybe we should do it based purely off of experience and intelligence those things you just named an 18 year old can do require little to no intelligence whatsoever to doa 21 year old can be just as immature especially in mmosand an 18 year old can be experienced and at the same time mature all depends on the personinstead of having an age limit the voting process should be more rigorous and based off of the persons reputationcharacterexperienceoverall intelligence and knowlegde of eveand especially the knowledge of eve i saw a csm post an incorrect statement about smartbombs that offended me how can someone representing the playerbase have no clue as to the mechanics of smartbombsthe standards should be changed i agree but age shouldnt even be a main reason for doing sothere should be some sort of exam we have to hold these people to higher standardsoh and of course have more voter participation
right so lets all vote for goons thatll show themuhm wait  is this part of another goonspiracy to take over the csmedit amazing  seems like avatars got rolled back by several months what happened on the servers
i dont think he should be given special dispensation but i dont think the rule should be there either if you have people under 21 playing the game and owning accounts then you should have the chance for under 21 people to be on the csm afterall as ccp are so fond of telling us its a teen rated game with a teen rated forum i can understand the concern about maturity but id disagree thats neccesarily dictated by physical agethat said maybe 13 year olds wouldnt be a good idea but i cant for a minute imagine a 13 year old either having an interest getting voted for or being prepared to do all of the work required 21 seems extreme if an age cap is neccesary id put it at 16 or 18 personally
i can see one obvious reason for a minimum age of 18 one funny reason for 20 but i have no clue why ccp set it at 21 not that i disagree but still18 you have to be of legal age for the nondisclosure agreement which all csm members must sign for those that do not know what a nda is in short its a legal document where you agree to stfu about everything you learn about ccp and if you tell anyone you can be sued theres way more to it but thats the rough outline20 legal drinking age in iceland is 20 so to go out and get some bree after the meetings you gotta be legal
some of the over 21s have shown the same thinglvs focus of industry is not where my interest in eve lies but if it did i would want him representing it on the csm i think he has acquitted himself better than any other member of the delegates so far his term in office has proven better than any argument that age is not a determinant of maturityi think this is a nonsense rule if it goes through  if the player is over the age limit to play the game they should have the right to stand and represent the player base if voted in and i have little doubt that if lv were to stand again he would win a second termi noted in another thread though that he seems to have lost his csm delegate tag in the forums ive not checked any of the other csms to see if it is affecting them too but i sure hope its not related to this
nope its a bug which is being looked into

i m just wondering if its possible for ccp if they can use solar power on their sever buildings in london or in the offices or since theyre based in iceland can run thermal power generators
interesting subjectsadly i couldnt tell you as i have no idea whatsoever but i must assume that the iceland offices are running off energy based on thermal power generators
would be interesting to know if its possible to cover some of the energy used by the great server with solar energy or something like that i know investments in these areas are high but i bet would be a nice marketing project to have a solar run game server not mentioning the energy costs in the long term
i hope theyre using dirty nuclear power imported from some lessthancareful country or possibly coalpower otherwise im quitting p
so how do the carebears get from 1005 to null sec that would segregate a fair percentage of players considering that to get to high sec from null sec you cross low secquite simply put eve already has the tools for new players to learn the game via the tutorial missioning and now factional warfare you already have new player zones ie where you do your tutorials eve caters for a certain mind set and basically if your not going to be self sufficient you will get no where excludes jita scammers

i can see age restrictions being relevant in some cases however 18 and an actionable nda seem quite sufficient in this case 21 is overkill unnecessary and blocks one of the more effective csm members currently serving from extending his competent work by rerunningodd move ccp
an age limit is okay but its wrong to blind side lavista with it he has served well and should be allowed to continue to serve if he is elected a second time
lvv is great for the community and has done far more than most no reason at all not to allow him to stand for reelection
unless there are some very compelling legal reasons under iceland or international law possible something laws have strange quirks i see no reason to implement a 21 years age limit competence is much more important18 seem sufficient to avoid legal problems for my limited legal knowledge
huh under 21 is banned from being a delegate so much for the youth has the futureage is overrated  you you get older than 40 you know trust me thumbs up for this proposal although i think age limits are stupidrb
lvv shouldnt be the victim of ccps ignorance of his age before the first electionsbesides hes a darn good csm delegate pherhaps too good
at the very least i think ccp should give an explaination
which is why he should be nerfed   just a joke people kiddingi think it is rather stupid to impose this if they simply aare doing it because of the fanfest alcohol or whatever then it shouldnt be a problem they have to respect icelandic law which means he couldnt drink anyway if hes under the age ofcourse why the hell should they impose another rule about it if ones already there
i agree with most people that the rule especially imposed so late in the process and so shortly before the elections smells of elitism and corruption some csm want prevent other csm from running and thus maximize chances of success i fully support repelling of the rule in its current form and giving lvv a chance to run again especially since he was the only one who kept us updated on a dead horse pos issue while rest of the csm was asleep or ignoring it
or generally ing around like always
supported
i support an age of 18 at maximum unless ccp gives an acceptable and credible reason as to why it should be 21 instead
viva lavista
if he can get elected let it happen
i do not see that age means anything in this subject clearly understands the game the economics and the math so let him keep working on it
they were not ignorant he asked prior to the 1st election they gave a nod at that time i am disappointed they are giving the no now
barring some legal reasoning that you think they would have known about before the first election id say 18 could be considered a reasonable limit but 21 is stupid
if this is collision prevention then the current method is broken the sensors of the ship flying towards an object should simply calculate the size course and speed of the object in its path then perform a two stage ignition of the forward maneuvering thrusters stage 1 drop speed and shift course to avoid object stage 2 return to original course and speedneither ship goes off in a random direction at insane speeds the ship avoiding collision drops in speed maybe 10  20 to maintain stable flightin this way a frigate will have to fly a ways around a battleship or capital while the battleship or capital simply changes course 23 degrees well in advance to avoid the small shipif you want to keep a guy away from a gate or a station simply get a large enough fleet to form a wall and prevent the ship from approaching
ok having 7 jammers pointed at you and only being jammed 50 of the time is pretty ing good tbh if a specialized ecm ship cant jam people reliably why even have them around canceling out ships with a 11 ratio doesnt work well a specialized ecm ship should be able to reliably jam multiple people unless they specifically fit to counter throwing on an eccm does exactly that maybe you get jam but to keep up reliability the pilot has to focus more jammers at youand subsequently not at your buddies
no u ur the bad posterthe eft shot you posted doesnt do anything to support your argument because only the dumbest of dumbasses flies a 7jammer falcon on tranquility drop down to 4 or 5 jammers to represent what youre actually likely to see in game and run the numbers again
i will support this but only if00 players are forced to spend the same percentage of time that npc corp tax is  in high sec space if after 6 months in an npc corp the tax is 50 then members of 00 alliances should be forced to spend 50 of their time in high sec space after all why should this repeated argument that npc members should be penalised for not being able to suffer from war decs  not be applied with similar logic to 00 residents 
that statement only works if jurisdiction was held over land your over americanism fails in eve you can leave a corp but still maintain your assets in the same place its all about services on offer and the immunity to war is sure a nice one worth paying 1020 tax for
the immunity in war is worth exactly 1 million and corporation management 1 all that is needed to build a 1 man corporation if a player has no interest in a corporation and someone in a npc corp has no interest in a payer corp he has no reason to stay in a wardecced corp his reply will be you wardecced my corp i close it and go to another so again no service rendered by the npc corps and before you give the standard reply ccp has stated that the players have the right to avoid wardecs
thank you to all who gave their support to this proposal and took the time to consider this with an open mindplease do continue to add your feedback so that the csm may hold an informed debate
that actually surprised me i hadnt realised that ccp literally and specifically encouraged you to form an alliance to participate in rp contentand ofc fw is rp content figures
so your entire argument is that the alliances wanting to join should disband the alliance and form a large corporationhow does this change the powerful  wealthy partyour 4th paragraph describes one of the reasons large neutral 00 alliances wont get involved bobrzrtri arent going to jump in if it requires the entire alliance to have a high standing with anyone of the empires for the very reason you describe  it will drop the standings of the members with good standings to other empires if the players you say will be affected care about that change they will leave the alliance thus decreasing its power and wealth
ok this is my fifth account and once again im staring into the abyss of learning skills tbh i think its time we did away with them all together but i would like to propose the following solution1  all new chars get there stats maxed with whatever they would be if they were maxed out 2  all existing chars get there stats maxed the same way3  all skillpoints invested in learning skill previous to the change be reimbursed to the player  as credits toward training to be spent how and when the player sees fit  so for example i you have 25 million sps in learning you get 25 million sps to spend however you see fit whether its battle ships five or whatever skill you want or you can hold onto them and spend them at a later date so think about it you get free training dpending on what youve already spent on learning  if you spent two months on learning  you get all those skillpoint back in somewhere more usefull i feel this is a simple and fair solution yaynay
ive kind of gone off flying caldari cruisers can i get the sp for that reimbursed tooalso i believe that navigation and evasive maneuvering to v are effectively mandatory skills for any ship so i think we should remove them and just make all ships 25 faster  more agile
or you could troll threads for attention removing skills you trained for your own purposes no  removing skills that are a barrier to being able to play the game yes
no
ccp effectively already precompensate you for taking learning skills to 44 at that point youre already learning at 90 of the rate of a character with 55 learnings if you want to specialise and get that last 10 then as with everything else in eve you have to pay and as with everything else you get to choose between a quick payoff and a long term reward you dont have to train learning skills i certainly agree that its a very good idea to train them but i think its an equally good idea to train evasive v too bluntly that 10 margin is less than the variance between having good and mediocre stats between having the patience and intelligence to work the good ways at isk making vs the dumb grindy ways and consequently having the isk to use 5sto put it another way getting learning skills to 54 which is what most veteran players have costs about the same as taking a single large turret spec from iv to v to get that last 2in essence you want to give everyone millions of free sp for no other reason that theyre in a skill which you really want but dont want to spend training time
just remove the damn learning skills it hinders new players and no reimbursement for those that have already trained all learning skills1 remove learning skills2 add 11 attributes too all toons3 more noobs will learn to enjoy the game quicker
total removal seem excessive removing the tier 1 skills and adding 5 to all stats with some form of compensation for players that have already trained the skills will seem reasonable it will probably reduce the number of players that will start the game and then abandon at the prospect of a month of almost mandatory training for the learning skills before leaning how addictive eve can be 
is it just me or people dont like to wait for anything anymore
4 alts become vastly more powerful especially disposable trial alts
no macro miner you can not fly hulks on trail accounts
supported epeen waiving  smack talking is part of what gives eve its flavor and this would add another level to it
i hate this feature hacking the server could give the passwords to most of my internet accounts because of how often i have cycled through passwords
fyi they dont have to keep your actual password itself they can just run the password through some fancy algorithm to turn it into gobbledy then when you put your password in it runs it through the same gobbledy generator and compares the garbled passwords without even looking at the original password if thats the case then theres no privacy problems so long as the gobbledy cant be converted back into the original passwordit seems gook is censored i didnt even know it was offensive
logs well we dont see any anomalies in the logs sorry we are unable to reimburse yooh wait wrong thread
i know they dont keep the password around only the hash but i hate this security feature everywhere i find it
google john the ripper ccp needs only one hash in order for login authentication everything else amounts to storing a set of hashes for passwords users likely cycle across multiple accounts at multiple sites one hash lets a cracker have a decent chance at getting access to any account i have he still has to find the account and has to get lucky holding a list of those hashes gives the cracker an entire database of passwords i like and more chances to get lucky on any accounts of mine he can findthere is no reason to store old hashes it unnecessarily streamlines the process of gaining access to large numbers of accounts a good practice in security is always to limit the availability of sensitive data by having no redundant copies ccp storing hashes would amount to redundant copies of credentials to other accounts where the user has used one of their common passwordsi expect a ccp reply on this its obvious from the behavior described that ccp is keeping old hashes in the database its a nonstandard process that isnt necessary and increases user exposure it needs to stop
my guess is they keep track of them just in case of an account being stolen
if this is true theres still no reason to prevent users from reusing the old passwords
seems fairly straightforward not that id know ofc  do eeet should also be an option to enslave for those so inclined
jade can i suggest you frame it in a sense of just asking how the ambulation tools are progressing  any news on thosethey sound pretty much exactly like what this is about so rather than proposing anything new which presumably has more issues with getting traction we just get some words back from ccp about how this is progressing for reference the ambulation tools were talked about herewhile an actual ingame demo of walking in stations will not be available until fanfest this november ward was able to provide a few highlights of what the players can expect the ability for players to have npc characters working in their shops and offices ie a bouncer receptionist complete with custom conversation trees that the player can createwith the ability for players to create their own conversation trees with npcs this expansion opens up the possibility for players to create their own missions for other players again ward reiterated that they really wanted things to be player driven and open up the features to as much customization as possible
yep good idea ill add this questionclarification to the issue docs for sunday
lovely just some of the more pertinent questions off the top of my head but im sure there may be others too  will this be included in the first iteration of ambulation  is ccp aiming to build this up into a fullyfledged system or is it more just a little side projecttheyre the two things im wondering most about at this stage presumably theyd be coy about any specifics but i think those two might be answerable even in an early development stage and should give us some things to think about fex if its just a minor deal those interested in seeing it more fully developed can lobby for that
while your at it why dont you refuse to give them skill booksand tech 2 weaponry and lock them out of anything elsehell why not the game at that point so long as they are in a npc corp
lets say you get your wish then you have a flood of individual players creating their own corps just to compensate you will effectively bump up the already massive corporation numbers by the thousandsgood job thumbs down
how bout making sps recycleable an example you have say 1 mill sp in missiles but for some reason you changed for turrets and never use missiles anymore why not make it possible to recycle say 75 or something worth of skillpoints from a skill or the total amount currently trained you already know and adding them to another skillmaybe having a basket where you can store skillpoints for future use or just swapping them directly from one skill to another skillnow i know that its not a waste to train different stuff but this way it will be easier for especially new players to test things around faster to find their profession and for a bit older chars to be able to take skillpoints in certain areas and add them to skills they actually usecant see any downside but i bet people and ccp have their say and opinions as wellcheers
whats nice about eve is the fact there is no cap to what you can train theres no need for respec if you want to train turrets you simply take the time and train it if you get bored or need missiles for another ship voila you can use them no need to respec back and forth
since arriving at a common definition for this key value the aforementioned market average i continue to stand by my proposal to bring this issue to ccp via the csm i see this as a user interface or game database issue which i would be happy to see lumped into that category in a broader proposal if you have already included this request in a csm petition please post here to notify us that this thread is redundantto address one suggestion ive heard i also reject the notion that ccp is attempting to disguise the meaning of a term that is displayed in the buysell now window which is obviously there to help in evaluating whether or not to make a market transaction therefore disclosure of the equation or calculation method for this value continues to be requested for my part
ok let me clarifyin the order of your repliesfirst and foremost this is not an attempt to change 00 mechanicsfar fromits rather an attempt to introduce certain aspects heretofor unavailable in high sec due to certain limitationsfor one currently it is considered an act of aggression for one member corp of an alliance to use certain logistics modules on another member corp of the same alliancei only propose making this possible in time of war with in the narrow confines of said allianceso im not talking widespread unregulated usethis would allow high sec alliances to realize there full potential in combat during times of warhopefully that clarifies my meaning
it was that way but some genius used it as griefing tools boosting rats in missions and complex so that the people doing them could not kill the npc and would finally succumb to the ratsas it was a clear exploit as people could cause the death of a ship without any way to retaliate for the one losing the it ccp changed it to correct the problem will require some code change in the alliance or gang features probably not a simple change the idea of the friendly lock could be a solution but it will depend on implementation making remote rep energy transfers ecc non aggressive act will simply reintroduce the old exploit
well with all the code changes required for fw and all the other big deal stuff someone please tell me why such activities couldnt be applied to improving empire playagain by making the changes specifiwar time onlyas it is in order to fix the game ccp effectively broke itand btw ive seen more exploitation of the fact alliances cant effectively support themselves in empire by small griefing corpsthan i did of the aforementioned exploitdisappointed
not supporteddont you think like this those empire corps who sepcialzie in empire warfare need an advantage over the nullsec inhabitants just like the nullsec inhabitants have station  jump bridge pos capital and what not advanatages over these corpsits two different worlds big alliances are supposed to be weaker in empire its not their turf
tough crowdi swear every time i come to assembly hall im flamed to hell and backedit at least my post can get one 1
might have something to do with your lack of good ideas
seems im the only person whos using these windowselse this is just a little reminder bumb 
can we get the citadel torp issue looked at tooits about to pass 100 support votes some people just put signed and didnt check the box
bugger i forgot that one i meant to add it but ran out of time before the deadline earlier damn long working days  if nobody else puts it up ill make sure i advocate it to the agenda for the next meeting i agree that the citadel torps do need looking at  and it is quite ridiculous how easily they get neutralized by smart bombs at the moment
actually i hear that the heatsinks from the server farm are sufficient to provide hot water and thermallygenerated power for a small town nearby
taken from the hompage of national energy authority of icelandabout 90 of all housing in the country is heated with geothermal energy the remainder being heated mainly with electricitythe majority of the countrys electricity 80 is generated using hydropower the remainder being based on geothermal poweronly 20 to 25  of the technically and environmentally feasible hydropower and only 20 of the conventional geothermal potential available for electricity production in iceland have been harnessed i dont know where ccp are placed in all this but if one looks at the average of iceland i can not see a reason for them not to use renewable energy
approvedalso a question if this issue is not implemented would it be possible to prevent npc corp players from lootingsalvaging pvp wrecks because it is pretty ghey to not be able to wardec offenders
i fully support the op
this thread is more about which vultures get to pick the bonesimho the loot should belong to the player who got killedflag anyone taking it
more whines from people who never leave overpopulated empire and then complain that their mission was scanned down and looted
not much to say great idea
really they should have been exportable from day 1 supported as its harmless but very helpful
any updates on when or what areas the bo class will be buffed
i like lvv as a csm but even if i didnt id be quite confused by this it is of course possible that this is just something forced upon ccp by law somehow and im hardly in a position to dispute the interpretation of icelandic law theyve gotten from their lawyersthough according to wikipedia the age of majority is 18 in iceland and only 21 in 13 small countries and mississippi but assuming it wasnt a lawyerly mandate i cant understand what theyre trying to avoid here they know firsthand that younger people can be effective intelligent and mature representatives and im sure im sure that icelandic politics isnt so foreign that theres never been a childish buffoon well over the age of 21 elected this doesnt make sense as a we want csmers to be people worth consulting with move and unless they feel a need to follow the age of consent in chad or singapore it also doesnt make sense as a legal move especially given that theyve shown a willingness to accept parents cosigning ndas and even if they werent willing to accept that they should say must have achieved the age of majority in both your home country and iceland not a flat 21 it still wouldnt help lvv for this cycle to my understanding of his age but itd be better for all involved going forward
this and supported
the age limit should be the lowest of the age one is considered an adult in the candidates home country and iceland as much as younger people can contribute there are very good legal reasons to have this setit really is a question for the lawyers
ive yet to hear a sensible justification for this move
i understand there is a csm meeting today how much you want to bet they take the easy way to eliminate one of competition in the upcoming election and do not even discuss this
thumbs up really needs a looking into
my thoughts exactly lavista vista has shown himself to be as mature as the rest of the csm possibly even more so in some cases changing the rules like this after the fact when it was brought up and accepted prior to the first csm seems mighty unfair to me
first off such an obviously undemocratic move would get them hammered in the vote secondly a bunch of them wont be running again and thus have no reason to block lvv even if they were inclined towards such behaviour thirdly theyre not all complete s
fourthly the issue came up after the deadline for submission to discuss at the meeting  no doubt it will be on the agenda for the next meeting tho or possibly the meeting with the devs
my sentiments exactlyalso in favor of suggestions to reduce it to 18
changing the rules under the current circumstances is just odd normally this wouldnt matter but since we have a csm member under 21 its a bit of an exception the rule itself is ok but an exception should be made for lvv
yes for the exception no for removing the new ruleif you were elected as a csm in the previous election or an alternate in the previous election you should be allowed to run again dispite the age limit new applicants should be required to be 21 years of age
and whats the odds we ever will hear a creditable reason  supported not only to allow vista the chance to run but all players over 18 or so as we the voters should decide who gets in
you know if you wanted me to make a more palatable falcon fit you could have just asked instead of being an asshat about it
right because all falcons fit 4 of every type of racial jammer right and fit 2 strength rigs as well as 3 distort ampsrecalculate your chances with a more realistic falcon fithigh covops cloak cyno gen salvager hml iimids 10mn mwd ii sensor booster ii multispec ii grav ii mag ii radar ii ladar iilows 3x signal distort amp iirigs ecm range agility
hint what if that falcon pilot needs to jam a sniper apoc the single most dangerous ship a falcon pilot can face what are his chances to jam it
this discussion is not about how to fit a falcon so quit derailing it the fit on the falcon isnt entirley relevant he would have had a fair idea i was flying gallente ships and seeing as we were in empire could have purpose fitted so i should probably put 6 gallente jammers on there if you really want to theory craft it
actually the way you fit a falcon does matter for your argumentyou didnt choose a rook scorpion or blackbird for your argument because in a fleet battle the rookscorpionblackbird will likely be targeted by anything it hasnt jammed immediatelyin a fleet battle even 1 falcon or rookscorpion can only reliable permajam 1 battleship so to permajam a fleet of battleships would take a fleet of ecm ships on the cruiser level ecm ships can do a bit more disruption the ecm ship will be doing relatively low damage that its hac counterparts have to make up for so the battle should last longerlikely what you should be requesting instead of a boost to eccm or a nerf to ecm is for another look at how the falcon balances for example since the boost to the falcon how many rooks have been sold in comparision to before is the falcon still being used in its role as a force recon or has it also taken on the role of combat recon from the rook
the point is fitting eccm in small gang combat as a countermeasure doesnt work as much as it should but this thread is necro too much craptalk
the thing is that the players in npc corps could make their own corp to avoid the tax and join that where they are unlikely to be taxed unlikely to interact with other people less likely to continue playing or join a real player corpas for other players avoiding war decs for most forms of income in this game that arent missionsratting they simply need a char in a player corp who never undocks to wash the isk totally free from harmthe reality is that you can not grief people out of this game there are ways around it which prevent the game population from tumbling to about 10 of what it is today personally i regard getting people to leave their alliancecorp as success enough and anything further as pointless if you want the dyspro moons and 00 miningratting etc you have to be in a corp and usually an alliance what measly amount people make in highsec npc corps is laughable and impossible to remove from them anywaytaxes are not very much anyway most corps are only around 5 and it doesnt apply to any trade mining loot contracts etc it only applies to npc bounties and mission rewards not bonusesim not sure i get the problem here you want people to remain in their player corps and keep dying  that isnt going to happen if they cant go and make isk theyre simply going to leave the game macroers will put up with the losses because they work on the scale that if half of them die they still make tonnes of isk new players will simply quit never to grow up to be a new player in a capital before they should be who you can kill and lootall this will result in is people avoiding wars anyway and more new players leaving the game not a single extra target will be created for people that wish to grief can anyone here see anyway that this will work out positive for any player 
it is about short term goals fitz they want more targets now it that will exterminate the specie later it is not important sustainable hunting is never important for this kind of people
exactlythe only thing this does is penalize newbies that do not realize they can create their own corp and avoid the tax
wtf are you smoking you realise that if you force people to join corps everyone will make hisher own because they dont want to lose the tax and dude just because you dont like that someone stays in a npc corp and smacktalks you and you cant wardec him does not give you the right to go and kick em all out so you need to stfu and leave us carebears alone wow  this way
fail
not supportednot just because im in a noobcorp as i couldnt care less about my income im not rich and ill never be rich and i run the occasional mission for standing rather than moneyfact is that there is a significant npc corp population that are casual players fact is that many npc corp players want to be in an npc corp so they dont have the hassle and obligations of being in a player corp rather than the i dont have to pay taxes argument it is a valid playstyle and i see no reason why this playstyle should be punishedif you want to tax players in npc corps then i demand the following services in return1 the ability to change npc corp at will with standing requirement2 the ability to put up a poskeep in mind that in addition player corps also have the extra benefits of1 having people around to escort you2 having help for missions3 organized mining ops4 having means to avenge yourself if someone hurt you in any way or just es you offso why exactly should npc corps extract tax if they do not offer any service besides immumity to wardecs which ccp stated are paytogrief and are legitimate to avoid by corphopping and other tactics after all
there are hundreds of single player games on the market this is an mmoi think that after a predetermined amount of time in an npc corp the taxes should start to go up incrementally until they hit about 50 after say 12 months
imo this topic is interesting but requires further thought in this thread before progressing to ccpthe some penalty againstencouragement for  moving to player corps is a good concept but 10 tax as a penalty doesnt seem like the best solution to meif we think about it in a broader context all the pros and cons of being in a npc corp combined with the picture of eve and mmo longevity being about player interactionspc only nonmmo screensavers are fun for a while but they dont create the kind of binding emotional attachment to a game that does social relationships in a community  love or hatethen we have an exciting concept to enhance new eden
my boosted ares says yes
tbh id support this on the caveat that you get asteroid kms when you manage to finally run an asteroid dry let miners see who is truly the most awesomemest rockcrusher
i agree there are limits to imposing security the least ccp can do is allow us the players who pay their payrolls to rotate passwords of our own choosingthumbs up
ok honestly till this was brought up i was unaware of the fact and find it quite disconcerting just mere fact of the possibility existing that my passwords may be logged whether via goobly yada or actual log is discomforting to say the least all i really have to say about that
thanx for informing me of this as i truly have been blindsided by it
even wrose is the fact that when you forget your password they dont send you it they give you a password reset process insteadwhat point is there in keeping track of all these passwords ive gone thru several for the sake of security some lead to one thing others lead to others but i need to come up with new ones just for eve because they are keeping track and storing themno this is a security list and its not something they should be doing unless they were to turn around and say hey heres your old password then its completly uselesstake this feature away its anoying and unnescary
good security would actually make you change it every 30 days and not allow people to use simple passwords without nonalphanumeric characters etc password hashing on the other hand means they are not storing your password they are simply storing a nonreversible hash of your password which you can get from your password but you can not get your actual password from the hash this is just an extra layer of security which shouldnt be needed anyway but the more the betterit is good policy to never use the same password for two separate sites unless the security of none of those passwords is important to you dont use your eve password for other sites dont use important passwords like banking passwords for eve the fact that they store your past password should be of little concern considering they are storing your current password albeit hashed which is all anyone needs your past passwords are of little use unless you personally are employing much much worse security than ccp are attempting to
this is because they dont store your password thus are unable to send it to you  this is good security what good is your old password to you if you cant remember it anyway yes  you do  that is good security a hash is one way encryption the process is the same and nonreversible when you change your password they hash it and store the hash when you enter your password they hash it an then compare the hash you entered to the hash that is stored to be overly simplistic say your password is ag a hash may in the simplest form add those two chars together and store your has has 17  8when you go to type your password in it hashes it and gets 8 which matches the hash stored and lets you inif someone gets hold of the hash all they have is the number 8 if they know the hash algorithm in addition they can guess that your password is ag bf ce or dd but they still dont have your password with a more complex hash and a good password this becomes incredibly difficult to even come up with a list of potential passwords the longer and more difficult your password the harder it would be to even guess a list for if someone was to get a hold of the database and the hash function it used
rule number 1 never listen to someone who wants to take away a security featureevermassive troll threadbad idea
lies if i had to change it every 30 days id be writing it down at my computer desk either in txt or in hardcopy i trust that less than i trust my longterm security provisions at present also im not supporting this thread because im worried about ccp storing old password hashesbecause until quantum computing becomes functional im not im supporting it because banning you from using previous passwords is stupid  it only makes sense in the context of forced password changes
believe what you will this is a legitimate concern not an attempt at trolling negative response has been minimal and nobodys slinging any personal insults thankfullythis is not a security feature anyway its a mere inconvenience ive learned that changing passwords 6 or more times will likely free up the original password as the server only retains a certain number of old hashesso if circumventing this feature is so easy why have it in place in the first place
the practice of keeping old password hashes is a pretty standardized practice across many industriesso please explain why this is a security risk
yea free the slaves even if we dont get an enslave button right away
since this is something that is going to be looked into it would be nice to have some sort of status page that can show how many slaves a certian corpplayerallaince has freedenslaved that way we can have another thing to epeen about and also give players looking to deal with slaves an easy way to find a respectable corp an example would be a player who doesnt want to bother with the process of freeing a slave could look up the info for uk or em to see how successful they are in freeing slaves it would be a definite boon to normal players especially rp alliances
my minmatar tribe will not sell freed slaves and we cant just leave them in our hangar we have to dump our slaves in the trash hoping that they get out alive and get away to freedom
my 002isk into the csm meetingvotenice idea for all the right rp reasonsthere is a game mechanic to enable this already agent missionsso suggest establishing agent missions to convert one to the other the reward or cost for the agent mission is proportional to the baseprice difference the agents offering the mission are places in 04 or lower space so no problem with contraband rules for the empires ie enslave or free slaves in the border zones balancing issue is frequency and quantity for the missions offered the mission locations will be wonderful combat zones for all the rpers opposed or supporting the rp of settlement of placing the outpost formerly named iss fabrica in formerly minmatar space will actually work as i can actually free 1500 slavesadded bonus is lowsec gets more love
ok now i know most of you are like stfu carebear etc etcbut i come with a real problem most missioning occurs in caldari space most notably around jita gallente is mostly lowsec along with some of amarr space and minmatar now why would they crowd around caldari space because you have access to a high end lvl 4 agents in high sec so every mission runner from here to there gathers to run missions in safety i suggest and remember i am trying to help here that we make more high end lvl 4 agents in high sec around eve and therefore reducing lag overall hopefully i dont think its about mods but if everyone could run missions for whoever without the whole i have to mission in low sec so  this thought missions would be more fun encourage a more even base of missioners in eve and potentially reduce lag in jita and eve in generalbut just a small thought from me later
people mission primarily in caldspace for two reasons 1 cn is the single best missioning corp in the game because its got the best agent progression across all four levels  high effective quality 95 combat agents in contiguous highsec at each level with a big pile of good l4 agents to finish it off the other navies tend to be missing one or more of these things  either they dont have a worthwhile l2l3 agent or their l4s are in lowsec 2 everybody rolls achura starts in caldspace with cald ships working for cn and because of the above they never need to change the thing is theres a lot of good l4 agents out there that arent cn but the corps that host them are a pain to work up to i work for a l4q18 combat agent with my storyline agent in the same stationthus giving me corp standing in huge blocks as well but in order to use this agent you have to get to 69 standing without ever using an agent that has more than 50 combat most people arent willing to do this  which is why i have one of the better agents in the game and zero lag  but this sort of situation yields the problem you mention its not that they dont exist its that people are more willing to eat lag than they are to do extra work to avoid it
is it not also possible to work up your caldari faction standing so that it is high enough to use 4s my faction is in the high 8s at the moment and i am pretty sure i can use every caldarialigned agent there is except maybe rd but i dont care about them  certainly i have access to 4s in caldari aligned corps ive never missioned for but i do admit ive not checked every agent in every corp 
there are plenty on agents in all regions either put a bit of effort in and find them or stay in the lag systems sure some of the rewards will be slightly less but surely the less lag will make up for this and also less looters popping in to help salvage also on the subject of cn lp store there are plenty of caldari corps with the same mods in stores and several not in caldari space at all so if this is part the reason then it just lack of research by the missioners who are happy to moan about how busy there mission system is without ever thinking they can solve their problem themselves and find a quiet agent off the beaten track a bit with perhaps slightly less q but certainly with less lag
is there any realistic solution to these problems because to be honest they are damaging all aspects of the game1 while isk selling is not allowed people are doing it because there is a market for it otherwise theyd stop this makes for a richest in rl means unbeatable in war game2 mineral prices are dictated by isk farmers and macros not real miners3 manufdacturers are being priced out of the market because macros and isk farmers are making t1 modules and selling them for less than mineral value just to get money back quick so they can then sell the isk4 gtc sellers are now really taking the p by pricing people out of the game entirely since the 90 day card loss i have no problem with people selling gtcs at fair pricesso what can be done to cambat these things and more importantly will ccp actually combat these issues at all
there are partial solutions as a final solution will require to change human natureccp cant change the mind of people so the only system is to punish isk sellers and buyer through bans and purchased isk removal and that is limited by the number of people that can be devoted to it without increasing the cost of the game i think ccp is doing about as much as possiblenot really there are plenty of factors dictating them macro are one of them but not the only one sadly player miners arent the most important factor as mining with guns is very important isk farmers shops work for the money minerals are easy to sell so unless there are contingency reasons like moving the minerals to a better market or a glut of some specific mineral they arent building stuff and selling at less than mineral cost who do that are the mission runners without the skills or knowledge to reprocess the loot for the minerals t1 loot converted in minerals is more than 20 of the reward in my mission in amarr space all those player that havent trained the refining skill will gladly sell modules for a price between 70 and 90 of the mineral value as it is more of what they will get reprocessing them fair price is what the market will accept little to do with isk sellers much more to do with less sellers and more buyers as the  in rl are harder to get yes ccp is fighting them reporting the isk sellers and suspected macro will help but dont hope for a immediate disappearance of the suspected macro investigations require time and manpower not buying isk and discouraging friend from buying isk will help too
isk farmer problem exists for a few years and all we hear that ccp doing something in reality most of 00 space is infested with isk farmers as lowsecs too where transport missions can be runned with a pach of macro alts if ccp wanted to kill this problem this could be done easy by combing 00 space and checking transactions of raven ratter but it takes time and people resourses to do the job easyer to put it off on brakes only responcing to petitionsthese they are also paying for a game with gtcs and they dont care about gtc price average ratter can make up to 500m per day so price of 600700800m is not a problem for them and each our of not ratting is impact to rl money income
need quick button to report isk spammers and etc
1 is unrealistic  how many people want to spend thousands on a game  but probably the best of the ones you make because the other three just demonstrate spectacular ignorance re 2 its easy to allege that macros provide the majority of the minerals for the game but id want to see hard evidence of this before i believed you it looks to me more like its a mix of human miners both in 00 and highsec and npclooters re 3 there does not exist a market in manufacturing t1 items because t1 items drop in missions the market is people with low refining skills selling them to people with high refining skills and maybe a few inventors your explanation is just nonsensical  minerals are far easier to liquefy than items re 4 a fair price is what people are willing to pay its a free market of pure exchange between two types of currency just because you dont like the price going up does not mean that the system is broken
make me dev for a day i could charge through lonetrek and ban at least 300 accounts of cnr isk farmers
and at least 150 of them will be regular players that you think are isk farmers for you it can be acceptable but ccp live selling the game and charge through banning suspects without checking is not the way to keep the game going
the drop rates of these are beyond sad they used to be found in cosmos and now who knows where you can get them with exploration but the fact is the prices have gone through the roof the means to try and find them and the risktime involved is way out of whack not to mention those they do find them in bulk are simply farmersi dont know how the actual change needs to be made but something needs to be done to make these as common as they once werethis is a support for ccp to examine decryptors
no please don not turn everything into useless garbage please keep drop rates in line with demand we dont need market floodingi like how decryptors rise in price
summary of my input at csm meeting could be done using existing ingame objects ceremonial circle minmatar art et al with a market price expire like cans and have no practical value would require anchoring restriction to reduce risk of uber lag at gates planets moonsoverall wait for this until after walking in space ambulation is out and the features offered there
if we cant implement a rating system what about simply making contracts a required skill to make a contract instead of being able to use one and then make the contracting skill not available on trials that would probably remove a lot of trail members from scammingjonas
lmaogetting desperate for war decs are wehahahaha
and why not make it so that anyone in an npc corp pays 90 tax learn at 50 speed and cant use any hardners or tank modules that would teach them a lesson maybe then theyd play this game the way a real man would well i say game but in reality this is a tough world and fun shouldnt come into it at all just grind grind grind like the real worldwhy should anyone be allowed to enjoy eve goonswarm for the win they play fair and dont interfere with anyone elses enjoyment at all hey timmc join the gooners your exactly the kind of pilot theyre looking for
yeah i change my mind tax thread sounds better
just cause u cant live without a player corp doesnt mean you have the right to dictate the rules on what players have to do to get the cool shipsi think the biggest problem is the fact that you get sick over a game you really do need to get help
as much as i would love to dump some of my useless skills and finish fighters v or insert race here carrier v in a matter of days i must say no as it was said before eve does not limit your max skill points unless you cant afford a new clone for some reason and you can easily switch skills you are training the only way i might ever possibly support this is if sp that have been moved cannot be moved again ie under each skill level bar you get a second bar that shows how many if any skills have been boosted and the minimum level you can reduce it to based on how skill points have been add to that skill in the pastfor example i have level 4 rank 3 skills a and level 0 rank 3 skill b i dump level 4 of skill a and gain level 1 and 2 of skill b if i then choose to remove skill points from skill b it must remain higher than level 2 because those skill points have already been movedremember you are messing with peoples brains here neurons can only handle so many reconfigurations before they fail
nobeing able to retrain for the fotm overnight will just make things in eve very dull everyone would be fly the same uber ship and setup at the same time
i also think this is a bad idea not only for the before mentioned ways to exploit but also with a game like eve you never know what is going to be needed at a later time i previously thought that having amarr ships skills was a waste of time until i saw the ship of my dreamsmmmmcurses are so sexy
okay meeting done it was shorter than normal because we had some serious problems getting the quorum in attendance ankhesentapemkahdierdra valinanna zunijade constantinelavista vistaomber zombieserenity steelapologies for nonattendance received from bane gloriouslavista only had 60mins so we needed to close the meeting after the last issue he voted on anyways we voted on1 free slaves issue passed 2 event tools issue denied 3 improve game sound issue passed4 implants on killmails issue passed5 npc corp taxes issue deniedcsm formal meeting 10 chatlog
just out of curiosity as i dont see it on the list of things to be discussedis the pos flogging the dead horse proposal going to be addressed at all during this meetingedit added link
actually yes ccp is planning on moving to 100 solar power for their server farms in the interests of going green in wholly unrelated news downtime is being extended to an average of 12 hours per day seriously though they get their power off the national grid just like everyone else their offices in iceland are mostly powered by being on top of a volcano and the servers in england are mostly powered by hydrocarbons of various types with a large minority of nuclear power theyll have backup generatorsthat i can almost guarantee you run on diesel fuel but for daytoday use they get their power from the standard power generation system it hasnt been financially practical to generate electricity for private use since the early 1900s
they use nuclear hamsters fed by the tears of hippies
i find this quite a difficult one to comment on on the one hand yes its damned irritating when someone loots the wreck you just killed on the other hand this is eve and for all of the restrictions we already have and with good reason it should be a sandbox and a career of thieving from kills should be just as feasible as a career in canflippingin addition nothing anywhere says that pvping should be profitable indeed when the question about rewards for fw came up ccp replied pvp is its own reward that doesnt mean you cant make money via pvp real pirates prove that all the time but to expect it if youre not engaged in piracy is the wrong attitudeits a purely highsec issue because everywhere else if someone steals from a kill you just made you have the valid option of blowing them up as well we fight over all sorts of things  the right to loot seems as good as anyi think id cautiously support dualownership of dropped cargo the contents of a wreck id not do it the way the op suggests because its overly complicated and would be a nightmare to code a simple corp 1 is the ships owner and corp 2 is the corp of the member who most recently put a blow on the ship and is wardecced with corp 1 would be about as complicated as id be prepared to take it which neatly avoids the loot from suicide ganks being flagged as i dont think they should get any assistance against thieves visually indicating anything more complex ownership is visible remember would get silly one corp name in white as currently and one below in red or some other easytodistinguish colour would seem goodi have absolutely zero time for any notion that changes salvage rules which is not what the op brought up salvage belongs to noone  first person with a salvager nearby wins  i see no reason to change this timehonoured practice endorsed by ccp time and time again
oo  signed
well maybe the original intended state was found undesirdable by ccp and now they are out of ideas  i think the bo class was added for impressive rp but fails to deliver same as stealth bombers great concept on paper sounds very fun but horrible implementation ingame
supported partially1 skill queue onlyskill still continues training if account disabled but the queue does notsimple and quite effective and makes char farming impossible but gets you through 23 hour skills easier
id leave it to ccp to decide how to balance the precise attributes and ranks and so on but yes supportededit or instead of having the potential cons of instant travel and 00 alliance hyperblobbing keep jump clones exactly as they are and deal with one popular reason we have jcs implants separable implants and clones as described by raven timoshenkonot wishing to derail the thread just pointing out there are alternatives that directly address at least one reason why people may have different jump clones
jump clones as they stand today already reduce the significance of geography in eve each increase in the easefrequencyquantity of jump clones or alts per account further worsens geography to the direction of insignificancethis is a bad thing for eve as less difference in geography means less differentiation in trade markets less importance and ability to apply territorial holding less consequence in choice of battlefieldslocation less consequence of hiding in a station cant lock me down ill just jump cloneand generally moves eve towards a single monotonous landscapeweight it up  reduce all of the above vs having a shorter jump clone timewhich do you think it better to have
very very good read  various others have already pointed out potential difficulties but overall well worth implementing in the game vs what we currently have nicely doneedit if ccp find the merc stuff too problematic as clearly that is the area of biggest debate the bounty system proposed alone is extremely good
this has another consequence which is all your transactions youd need to select the wallet division that it came from so effectively youd need the ability to set a default wallet divisiona simpler implementation of this might simply be a place you could move cash tofrom but doesnt have any other accessibility for eg trades etcadditionally all the eve apis that support wallet export information would need to have additional support for the balance in any savings walletthe key question is is adding this functionality worth it given the increased complexity to player wallet managementwhat are the opinions of the people here
i would tend to think that this has to be an optin system how it can be hidden from the average player without not giving them the knowledge this is possible im not sure though
i support lvs reelectionadditionally if a parent signs for the minor wouldnt that take care of concerns regarding liability
that is correct and this was also the case with my nda thus making it valid this invalidates xhagens claim that its due to legal reasons
exactly any naysayers are full of fail and po0peyand like to take it in the p0operpoop
bizarre  especially considering ive held mature debates with 15 year olds and heard thoroughly immature rubbish from 30 year olds blanket generalisations never go anywhere goodedit besides at the age of 18 in a lot of countries youre old enough to drink drive vote and have sex preferably not at the same time  i dare say those are vastly more important issues than whether or not you participate in a csm about an internet game so 21 seems a very odd choice
its not fair on lv and he has been doing arguably the best job on the csm either give him an exception to the rule or better yet lower the age to something more sensible like 18
if there is a limit it should be 18 any 21 year old limits are ridiculous anyway including underage drinking related laws
not only does the iclandic eqvivalent to systembolaget only have two sorts of ale and trappist beer this is even more backwardsdrop it to 18
viva lavista
levista vista should get grandfathered in because he has already signed all the legal documents from last time and has proven him self a valuable member of the csm also 18 is more reasonable for democracy and that is age of majority in most countries
agreed another solution must be foundi am also very disappointed to see that such a thread is necessary
yes create more blobage please
undockexplode
i dont care about blobs as any plan to change bumping would only result in bring in more ships so you dont have to bump them to kill them
im inclined to support this if noone can come up with a really good reason how it will damage the marketsnegative effect on individual traders i dont see as significant as the benefits and realism of corporations being able to manage their assets this scenario could be balanced with a longer timeout for modification of corporation orders by corp members other than the original sellerbuyerit needs to be taken into consideration what is happening with the corporation wallets  corp member a modifying the order of corp member b would need to have the same corp wallet access to ensure the taxes et al all went to the right place otherwise there is rife opportunity for scam and unnecessary complexity
good point thumbs up
so youd like to see that jf jumping out of highsec wouldnt be possibleat least it would be more consistent that wayyou can jump inout tofrom highsec or you cantmakes more sense than this strange compromisealso when there were highsec pos you could jump to youd open a can of worms when people want to jump from highsec to highsec now that would be funny
geddon has 17 fyi thats less then an avg bc all caldari have 22 or more and average would be around 21 as to the dual eccm fitting eft shows optimal numbers and doesnt take range in account even then it can reduce change from 88 to 38 at optimal no fleet bonuses or overheating with a 4 times multi all level v falcon pilot 98 to 48 with racialsso countering 4 mods with 2 opposite mods is rather significant but the pilot can also choose to use two sensor backup arrays and reduce it even further 13 and there is the point where it gets questionable if 4 mods vs 4 mods should equalize or not jamming has the range falloff penalty but eccmbackup array dontone could argue of bs would get a few extra sensor points if you look across the board the way sensor strength is divided to classsize 20 should be minimum for a bs same goes for command ships which have the same sensor strenght as their t1 versions and are just above cruiser sized ships eccm could get a small percentage increase or have the stacking penalty removed since it reduces the chance of getting jammed by 50 but you also can introduce a rig that amplifies the eccm effect to counter jammer that uses rigs to amplify the jamming there is a sensor strength booster in the itemsdb database but that has a 100 increase of sensor strength which is basically the same as a t2 racial eccm of 96 but its not in the game so its considered being overpowered which makes sense so changing it in a eccm amplifier with penalty to cpu or speed could be usefull but you still end up with a gimped fit having a ship with a sensor strength over 150 more than a carrier hardly makes senseanother option would be a skill that increases the eccm and counters ecm related skills which should require same prerequisites as the ecm skills eg fm skilland after a few hours of looking at the numbers it seems that with the skill bonuses rig bonuses amplifier bonuses and ship type bonuses the falcons are very powerful ecm vesselstldrrevise standard sensor strength mechanism for ships alltogetherbuff eccm
i think eccm should be ecm countermeasures not defense if you fail a cycle there should be some kind of penalty like being jammed back forr 20 secs or losing cap regen or being auto scramed for a duration and so on
as was pointed out before while a 50 chance on a target with a dual eccm seems like a very powerful amount the falcon pilot can only achieve this by using all seven of his jammers on the eccming target and if that falcon is jamming only 1 target his buddies are probably busy shooting the crap out of the falcon especially because it didnt fit a sensor booster or range rigs and is probably less than 120km from his target and when a falcon is being shot it doesnt survive for long no support falcons are fine
i think we need to be careful here about what the problem is the problem is not a falcon or other jamming ship being able to perma jam pretty much any single target thats fine in my opinion if you put the training in then they should be very effective at jamming any ship the issue is that if you choose to try to counter the jamming by fitting one or more eccm it is very ineffective even by sacrificing 3 mids for eccm on a bs you can still be easily perma jammed by a single jamming boathave a look at recent cown movies for proofi think if you sacrifice so many slots to defend against a single form of ew then it should be much more effective than it currently is my problem with jamming is that no matter what you try there is no real effective counter its becoming the norm to see multiple falcons in any gang for this exact reason and as a result its becoming over powered a drastic increase in eccm effectiveness is needed to give us a way to fight back
you think there is more interaction in a single player corp than in the npc corps you are totally wrong the members of the npc corps are some of the more supportive i have seen in eve even if they are lacking most of the tools available in corporations and alliances to collaborate with other players at the same time the npc corp channels are used to scam recruit and a lot of other options that dont work so well in the local channels so people in the npc corps are living in a mmorpg and interactingif you and your friend are incapable of recruiting if is because you are incapable of offering something better if you want more targets to wardec get lost
you may want to do some research a very large amount of most mmos players time is taken up by solo play
realy where does it state that i cannot chatgangshoot other players while in npc corps lot of pirates are in npc corps exactly because they cannot be wardeced you think they dont interact with other players i love the people misusing the mmo label it says only that there are many people in a world where they can interact it does not say you are forced to interact in any way 
i will support that when someone supports getting rid of all nonconsensual pvp in high sec which is what the vast majority of people actually want therethe  of people who hang around in high sec looking for pvp may be loud on these forums but are tiny compared to the playerbase why cant people just admit it high sec is for pve and socialising
it never ceases to amuse me that people equate npc corps with solo play theyre not go learn a little about the game before you comment on it plenty group in npc corps via private channelsto those arguing it provides an incentive to go to player corps your player corps really must suck if you now are asking for a game change to promote your recruitment have you considered that perhaps what you demand and offer isnt the right thingas for solo play itself  what pray tell is wrong with solo play what is wrong with solo pvp what is wrong with solo trade how does one propose true capitalism works in a nonsolo capacity if solo is so bad why do we laud those who go out and get kills solo against superior oddsso go show them i dont see why a tax helps that at all if anything its an irritation to encourage people to quit sooneryou argue that thousands sit in a system and grind for ages assuming were not including the farmers that ought to be petitioned why arent you making an alt in say sak chat and encouraging those people to go and see the world if so many are truly like this id have more time for yours and others supposed passion if your actions reflected this ideal but they dont the vast majority of people posting and supporting this idea dont strike me as the type to welcome new players with open arms but with locked weaponsim all for encouraging a social game encouraging a game where we work as cohesive groups  none of this however requires a player corp it just makes it a touch easier and youre never going to change the game to the extent where it does and keep subscriberscarrots not sticks if the player corp community has failed to attract people into player corps the only group to blame is the player corp community the immaturity visible in this thread just goes to illustrate whymmo does not mean force people to socialise with me learn what mmo means then come back and comment
i am less worried by these proposed changes than some of my militia counterparts but still cautious about them we already have an element of blob warfare at times even some occasional pos warfare and for the most part those that cant stand that form of warfare steer well clear and fight somewhere else but its still not a trend to be encouraged unfortunately if the enemy tactics are entirely blobbased you end up being forced into that mode of warfare and i do know that quite a few in the amarr militia have expressed distaste for capital warfare blobs left 00 combat for that reason and have no desire for its returni object to this notion that fw is pvp with training wheels it isnt but it does have newer players trying it and that is a good thing what it is however is a sechitfree no sp limit easy way to find quick fights in lowsec close to a highsec base of operations and learn about pvp if i was going to attribute a reason for the reduced militia participation recently its that the combat used to be a lot more smallgang and roaming and people actually committing to fights they might not win lately i have noted a trend of larger and larger fleets and often said fleets run at the sight of an evenremotely similar force fighting huge battles with 80100 ships is dull laggy often has capitals and has no real way for the individuals skills player or otherwise to make any difference fw encourages nay requires small t1 ships like frigates and destroyers how can they operate when someone hotdrops a carrier fleet on them let us not forget that fw is in lowsec and for many it was hoped to be the return of the roaming small gang but on a larger scalei can see a benefit from large alliances joining fw if they provided funding and support to the militia beyond direct military intervention as the biggest criticism by those new to pvp is that funding pvp is expensive when the enemy keeps fielding carriers and battleships somehow i dont see the alliance coffers or resources being made available thoughi would strongly argue for the operating area of factional warfare being increased if larger alliances can participate to reduce the chances of one large pair of fleets dominating the battlefield at present there are only a few ways into the amarr theatre of operation  i have zero desire to end up with a circumstance where a large alliance decides to blockade those few entry points with hundreds of shipsi dont feel ive been won over by the arguments enough yet to see why wed want large organised capitalbacked alliance fleets versus somewhat slapdash militia fleets because the militia pilots have less sp less isk fewer numbers and arent as used to fighting alongside each other any hope of the trend of more people trying pvp and actually considering more active roles in lowsec or 00 would very likely be dashed
he said it good no need to remove learning skillsalts do not worry me but new players dont have the isk anyway so the process of skilling up and making money is more gradual than if you had maximum attributesit is fun to make your own toon and get into top level on your own there is no need to remove this climbing ladder experience
incidentally whenever you see i demand x change to help new players you can be pretty sure that the proponent is an experienced player who is fully aware that change x will benefit him far more than new players its eves equivalent of wont somebody please think of the childrenthe real beneficiaries of new characters starting out with 55m free sp in free learning skills will be experienced players who want quick cyno alts quick scout alts quick market alts quick hauler alts quick tackler alts quick salvage alts quick rd alts and quick fw altsresulting in a further huge encroachment on all the niches currently open to new players to actually play the game as a multiplayer experience
i hate the learning skills because they are conceptually wrongwhat the learning skills do is favour players who dont play and players who use multiple accounts this may sound strange first but look at it closely the learning skills are most useful the sooner you train them so the best effect is received by training them right from the beginning instead of starting to play the game new players dont want to train stuff that makes them train other stuff better which will give them more bonus to train real stuff eventuallyeffectively the best thing you can currently do if you start playing eve is to get an account have it train up the learning skills and only then start to play the game this is stupid and doesnt motivate new playerson the other hand secondary account alt characters are overly boosted by the learning skills because someone who already has a character can afford to have his secondary char train nothing but learning skills in exactly the right order of skills for maximum effect that is both lame and unfairso in my opinion the current system does not favor new players it favors experienced players massively any specialized secondary character gets where he is supposed to go almost two times as fast as any new player would get
so faster skill training isnt your own purpose just because people with something else to do can use them a bit faster doesnt make them horribly unfair a proper interspersing of learning skills with real skills will result in you being down a few hundred thousand sp at most over the course of months in exchange for being able to play the game and the wonderful thing about it is you can choose which you prefer effectively giving alt accounts a free few days of play is hardly broken  compare it to power of two which effectively gives them months of free play time
i wasnt sure at first if i wanted to continue to play eve when i got my first trial account because it takes so long to get anywhere especialy turrets grrr so i gave up for abitthen i got a second account and trained the learning skills almost strait away and actualy started to get somewhere exept turrets grrrr if you could actualy train some decent skills strait away then more noobs will play the gamejust make sure more of the specialised skills are blocked so you dont have people spamming trial accounts like theyve blocked industry ships
well if all of them so called newbs want no learnings sure but all learnings to v give you 10 atributelearning it self that ads up to about 11 on each atribute hey ive got an idea 11 to all toons and throw out the learnings the oldy moldys will be happy the new ones will be happy im happy
in my early days i didnt have the advanced learning skills or the money to get them my corporation didnt pay fro the advanced skills which altogether cost around 22 million when a new player rolls a new character he should not be worrying about power leveling but rather find the aspects which he can enjoy in eve be it wealth making socializing or the advance and complexity of the gamea real specialist toon only takes one attribute pair to the 555 beginners can do well with 400 and when they can they get 433 normally couple months from the start when they realize that skill path they choice is what they like they further develop the character to 544 it can happen on month 6 to 12
this is in regards to the eve news story third party skill training macro contains a trojan
well this would benefit about 1020  of people because i have a thought that most of the people would just put on the queue further and further not actualy waiting for the both of them running out this would also benefit the capital ship pilots whos skills may take several months and you need to plan it just right so that you can go on suspend for lets say carrier v or something and thats how you can save your iskies anyway im all for the queue thing it be nice to have like 3 skills in queue just for gigglaz
most capital players i have spoke with and i am one as well would not go away from the game for that long since we have vested so much time into not only our primary characters but we also have secondary support characters for those accounts as well so taking a suspension out of the game for that kind of time period is just not going to happenill go even further on that for most people that are operating carriers dreads and such even 20 days is way to long to be out of the game the way eve politics changes on a weekly basis you can find and often do your assets way off in a region you can no longer gain access to so in the long and the short no dont think what you suggested would happennow back on topic for what i posted how many times have you been somewhere else when a skill finished training you had a program like evehq or evemon send you a email message letting you know that it finished but you could not log on for another 4 hours or more to change it i think that number would be like 80 or 90 of the people playing evethis idea of a duel skill training system has been around a long time there is no reason not to implement it ccps long time players are still going to be loyal still going to be here to play the game doing things like that makes your player base that much more loyal to you it keeps you connected to them it shows them that you do listen to what they saythat is why there is this news article right now these holes know that people want this that is why they created it that is why it is working so damn well a simple news article is not going to stop them or anyone else for that matter of trying to take advantage of something that they players their customers clearly want and needall i am saying is that csm needs to step this up in their priority list it benefits everyone equally and it not hard to implement at all it just needs to be doneas nike would would say just do it
wow something i can support without feeling like a insert appropriate expletive here 1 it doesnt upset game balance 2 its not breaking something to fix another 3 not a selfish attempt to bend game mechanics in your favori am so impressedtwo thumbs up
yes we desperately need some variety of skill queue but this has already been submitted by the csm i cant imagine anything more happening with it in this term of office take it up with the next council assuming nobody runs on the platform of doing so themselves
this issue has already been raised and passed but i suppose a new thread to move it up a few notches on the developers plans would be worth trying
its in caps so it must be important
whilst i empathise with a fellow industrialist id point out that in theory transit of goods from empire to nullsec or viceversa should be target number 1 for pirates a popular reason for their existence and the best reason for a logistics train beyond the obvious that your enemies should have logistics to attacksadly jump freighters render a lot of this moot so i do struggle with the notion that says moving large quantities is too difficult  its become a lot easier than it used to bei think id be quite keen on ore compression in empire and mass export to nullsec of lowend minerals i could dust off my mining skills and itd give more of the industry side reasons to mine and fewer reasons to cart freighters around if the actual transit to nullsec entailed some risk semisupported but with sympathy for the already endangered pirates in fact compressed ore would be smaller and easier to fence and so supported but with a desire for ccp to look at just what traffic lowsec pirates are supposed to be preying on
the events in tribute this past week are a classic example of this issue the emergence of massive fleet engagement have escalated out of control and everyone counters that its our own fault for bringing these said massive fleets to to the fight thats extremely weak logic at best and at worst its a flimsy attempt to divert away from the real issue to defend against absolute force you have to bring absolute force there is no way to skirmish and win against a 250 pilot enemy fleet occupying a key system you need to recapture and defend due to ccps meticulous game designs and improvements you need to bring a force which matches that in numbers and composition and basically do so with a full frontal attacki would like one ccp staff member or csm to acknowledge that the emergence of massive fleets numbering in the hundreds has caught ccp off guard and they have planned to eventually at some point in the future resolve this issue to their paying subscribersthis will never happen because they didnt only know this would happen they planned for it to happen and without the needed improvements to the games infrastructure to handle it its a classic example of enabling the feature without supporting the feature which boils down to the root cause of poor planning
now that we have this awesome new stacklessio technology concerns about server load are no longer relevant right
hmm good for reducing those unwanted convos however when i was a ceo i would occasionally gain a pilot out of some of those random convos soooo

absolutely no waythis is a can of worms just begging to turn into pandoras boxsorry great idea good thinking but your going to make a complicated game even more complicated then ever before by a factor of 10if people dig it ill jump in the boat but honestly theres more important matters to suggest
the added level of complexity is the whole point devalued currency would do in new eden exactly what it does in the real worldcreate opportunities that cant exist in the 2d economy eve has now
correcting some nasty misinformation going on people with limited experience in security please qftto anyone who has ever ripped thousands of passwords from a shadow file the idea of having multiple hashes for every user is a fng gold mine of access credentials hashes are not secure hashes are not secure hashes are not securethis is not a security feature in any way and merely creates a database of sensitive information that is serving no purpose a smart hacker who gets that database can go through and check for duplicate usernames or link a user to another account somewhere and try all of their passwords until one works keeping multiple hashes makes a bad security break into a catastrophic one
youd need to know what hash they used to start with or your cracking time explodes exponentialy to every hash you try to crackgoing through shadow files is easy because people are usualy stupid and use only the bog standard unix crypt call that fails any security test 8bit hash iirc good luck going through md5 hashes or even better encryption methods
it is standard security practice to store x of your old passwords to stop you using the same one again as presumably you changed it for a reason eg someone else got it the longer you use the same password for and the more places you use it the more likely it is to be crackedit is also standard practice to store oneway hashes of the passwords instead of the password itself so that a hacker who gets into your database cant just read out everyones passwords the idea is that the hashes are useless for someone trying to hack in as the server is expecting the unhashed password and they are in theory irreversible as the hashes to certain common passwords are already known it is standard practice to salt the password before hashing it so that the password hashes in your database are different to the password hashes for the same password in someone elses database this means that it is not a security risk to store the hashes either i would be shocked if eve doesnt do thisoff on a tangentnote that hashing the password in the client and sending the hash over the wire is exactly as insecure as sending the raw password over the wire from a security against tapping pov either way they have exactly what theyd need to send to log in as you to verify that the client is really there and it isnt a snooper just replaying the packets from someones earlier login you need to use a doublehash mechanismperson signs up with password aserver salts it salta and hashes that hasha and stores thatclient wants to log in server sends them a random salt pepperclient salts and hashes the password like the server did originally hasha then salts that with the timeunique salt from the server pepperhasha and hashes that again hashhashaclient sends that to the serverserver salts its stored hash of the password with the timeunique salt and hashes that the same as the client has to it gets hashhasha as well and allows the login because it matches what the client sentnote that this way means that the server doesnt store your password that you dont send your password or the servers hash of your password over the internet and most importantly the code sent by the client to login is different every time so that capturing the packets wouldnt let you log in just by replaying them this still doesnt protect against a keylogger or other spyware on the client pc or someone hacking the server to change your password or install a backdoor into the login process it does make the security of the wires between the server and client irrelevant though making it safe for internet useid hope that eve also uses something like this but its not necessary as keyloggers are still by far the biggest weakpoint in any password system some people just cant keep their pc secure and others will log into the eve forums uses the same userpass as the game from an insecure public pcjust assume that ccp know what theyre doing eve is pretty big now and they havent had a major security problem so they must be doing something right
need to know the hash i can tell most of them by inspection and can find 100 of them with a little bit of searching on random forums the availability of decryption tools is endless unless ccp uses a proprietary hash thats not a derivative of a major encryption scheme they face the same exposure as every other systemthis feature is fundamentally wrong you need the current password to change back to the old password so preventing a user from going back to an old password doesnt do anything except prevent a hacker from being able to randomly regain access as the user randomly decides to switch back to an old password that they already crackedyeah rightthe real reason its fundamentally wrong is very simple the procedure creates an aggregated database of access credentials its bigger than eve having a list of likely passwords for a user is a huge asset if one wants to access other accounts of that userplease ccp tell me you arent using lanman cant tell you how many systems have handed me over a list of lanman hashes generated for windows filesharing with an atleastslightlydifficultandsomewhatreasonable hashing system in a shadow right next to itanyway guessing the hash system isnt hard salting can be defeated a program can probably do it for you if youre lazy insert massive word list add mangling rules add semantic acronym generator still better than random with more mangling rules pipe through someones stolen cluster viola you can now shaft 1857 people with weak to moderate passwordshow to avoid an attack like this run your password through an md5 generator and copy some characters out of the result you wont remember them so write them down thus undermining the utility of passwordsfor however standard this practice is ive never pulled any kind of shadow with duplicate user entriesin the end it doesnt matter if ccp has the most l33test cryptographic system in the world keeping more access credentials than necessary increases exposure of sensitive information while gaining no utility thats a fundamentally bad security practice
well another way at looking at this isif you were a hacker looking for passwordswhich would you rather sort througha huge database of which a very large portion is outdated or a smaller database with mostly current passwords
yes yes there are many mechanisms in place to protect the information its not alarmist thought to ask for a system that doesnt carry more sensitive information than its actually using
cracking through hash generation is all about scale the more passwords in the database the more likely you are to get matches which you can potentially link through those users to other accounts to hack their other accountsmost people reuse access credentials across multiple accounts and only vary which one theyre using on a particular system when it comes time to change passwords they likely pick an old one that they already have memorizedkeeping multiple hashes is completely unnecessary and only increases the severity of any potential security breach not to mention a ccp employee could easily rip the information using an obscured program running on eve cluster nodes themselves for a going away present sell info quit ccp does ccp think theyre above this
yes its possible  you need one of agent standing corp standing or faction standing to be high enough to use the agent this provides a pretty nice workaround if you have a friend capable of using the agent you want to switch to  do gang missions for the agent and the agent standing will shoot up very quickly compared to how long itd take to do corp missions its still a few dozen missions but its a lot faster and its standings you can just outright buy if you like since you only have to be online and in gang to gang complete incidentally my corp sells exactly this service if anyone is interested in your case if you have 86 standingsl5q12 then you can in fact use every caldarialigned agent in the game or more realistically 70 faction standing will get you all useful agents i didnt mention this because you have to be a massive missioner to get that kind of faction standing and if youve done a couple thousand missions for the faction youre unlikely to want to switch agents however it works just fine
do more research i run for amarr agents and get pretty much nothing but sanshaangel missions from a l4q13 and l4q18 in a 05 system very very nice the reason most people are in caldari has already been pointed out really everyone is an achura and everyone is running for cn without more research into alternatives
868 unadjusted i dont do much else in eve other than run missions and i cant play daily or for very long so its slow going noticed yesterday that my main is now over 25 years old i am trying to get standing into the 9s as i hear you get faction ships offered to you at various levels in the 9s i think frigate at 91 cruiser at 95 and bs at 99 im not bothered about the lvl 5s though  i dont go into low sec unless im able to run a cov ops cloak
isnt one of the things why people stick to navy corps that often the fact that before the loyalty points shop was implemented agents would offer random items and people would get navy ships from the navy corps
its called roll achura nad train ships and misilesguenry 3 faster than otherwith maxed learnings but no one do that
as an achura admittedly somewhat randomly that left caldari space and never looked back after about a month id say theyre not looking that hard i left for amarr space and have since run with the amarr navy and never had to go to lowsec to gain a high standing with them and access to level 4sas for the big mission hubs that form in caldari space that is an entirely separate problem of agent quality and lack of alternativesimagination no different to jita really quite a few corps only have a very few high quality agents so people who want the maximum return cluster around them there have been quite a few suggestions over the months in features and ideas on how to improve thisnavy corps offer extra lp items blueprints for faction ships so that can be an incentive to run for them
i find it hard to see the problemmy corp has been able to successfully run level 4s around the rens area without too many problems most of which are brutor tribe of coursemaybe its due to jita that your seeing the high trafficmaybe your not looking hard enough
i agree the agents in balginia are great i just think people are to lazy to get out of their comfort zone to look else where nice market hub nearby good agents etc etc

i think many agree that bumping as it is makes quite a lunatic concept at least when some tiny peepots bumb huge ships multiple times their size and massthen there is another issue with the collision system that comes up again and again ramming or the lack of it as an optioni have read most threads on ramming concepts with great interest and what i noticed is that most people want ramming to cause damage that this would be quite a bad idea is obvious for many reasons however damage is relative or to be precise what constitutes as damage is open for interpretation damage to shields armor or hull is damage yes however preventing an enemy from escaping is damage too not direct damage thoughthis lead me to this concept1 smaller ships can no longer bump larger ships the usual way only ships that are smaller than your own can be bumped2 ships get a special option ramminghowever unlike often suggested this ramming does not do any damage to the target instead it bumps the target and causes damage to the bumping ship that damage depends on the size difference so that ships of equal size can bumpram each other for little damage while a frigate that rams a battleship would still bump the battleship but it would also be destroyed in the process of doing sothe advantage would be that ridiculous effects are reduced a lot and that bumping an enemy to prevent him from escaping actually costs something it would also add ramming in as a possibility while at the same time preventing any abuse beyond what is already possible the normal collision system would still work because normal bumping is still possible only that the larger ship will always win
we didnt want to kill stationhugging capitals anyway
doesnt make sense for a ship to take damage for bumping but not the ship that was bumped
1 is unrealistic  how many people want to spend thousands on a game  but probably the best of the ones you make because the other three just demonstrate spectacular ignorance you know it is possible to put across your point without resorting to insults i believe i am making valid poits here so dont go insulting meyes your points are valid that doesnt make them right and you more intelligenti believe many players would like to see many of these issues addressedand you dont need to spend thousands on isk to get alot ie i have seen 1billion for sale for UFFFD22 roughly so if you want to flatten a smaller corp all you need is a UFFFD88 and you have yourself 4 billion isk worth of ships to send into battle fearlessly there are many people out there who would happily do thatbut please dont resort to smack talk in a discussion like this it just says what an ignorant egotistical jerk you are or maybe an just an isk buying macro user
i believe the best solution i have seen so far is to either limit the amount of time you can be in an npc corp this would effectively force everyone to either start their own corp or join an existing one at some point then all those macrominers would be making the people who find them and wardec them rich
actually my points being valid does make them right  thats what valid means and i never claimed to be more intelligent i just claimed to be less ignorant as for your price UFFFD22 is about 40 or a bit more than a price of a gtc that price is less than twice as efficient as doing the same thing legally in the gtc market making me wonder why anybody would risk getting it taken away for that small of a markup for your UFFFD88160 just buy 5 gtcs make 3 billion and actually get to keep it instead of trying to fly those ships with a negative wallet also most wars youd want to be unbeatable in take a lot more than 3b or 4b isk to fight never mind how much it would cost to be unstoppable
decryptors are a joke at the moment they not worth buying unless you plan on inventing high end ships basically all mods are getting the shaft now when it comes to using decryptors as an economical means in their inventionsyes its optional but its become mandatory to not use one on modsif what you say is true as to keeping drop rates in line with demand then supply needs to be drastically increased have you noticed anything about their market
decryptors were never common and they are more common than in the past the difference is that the number of inventors has risen faster than the number of people doing exploration so the production is low and the demand high hence high prices making them easier to find will not increase availability by much as as soon as the price drop people will stop exploring for them the return for the time and risk isnt noting to brag about reduce it and a lot of people will stop exploring
exploration plexes are very limited you may find one with decryptor per week plexes are overfarmed anyway
in hi sec i had 5 decryptors last day they all come from radar sites finding and hacking these sites is a professionthe rarity of an items makes it valuable id prefer player driven economy but not complete abundance of everythingthe market prices will bounce back when more covops pilots turn to exploration and radar sites they need to realize that their effort is worth itit may take as long as an hour of probing but you only receive one or two decryptors which makes for 15 millhour not very profitable thus the covops pilot dont want to spend time on this
so what youre saying is that scarce items are used for their more valuable purposes before theyre used for their less valuable purposes glad to see that the laws of economics still apply
the reason for that is that with invention you get to pick what youre making pick your success rate and pick what you get with exploration you just get to pick where you look and 99 of the time find nothing or nothing worth the cost of the probesinevntion  goodexploration  suckthats why
they were abundant in cosmos before and got hit with the nerf bat the increase of inventors is one cause into the demand for these but also the decreased supply and increased effort to find these has made them skyrocket in priceim not saying we need them to be easily obtained but we definitely need them to be reexamined before the board and looked at again

i think the bounty system as far as there is something deserving the name could use a revamp a massive revamp to be precisemy suggestion is to make it based on transferabletradeable killrightsthe concept goes like thisplayer a gets killrights for player bplayer a goes into his character sheet and selects the killrights there he gets the option to contract his killrights either to a specific entity or to a bounty officethe bounty office pays an amount of money for the killrights based on the bounty on the person who the killrights are on starting with a negativeplayer c is a bounty hunterhe goes to the bounty office and sifts through the kill contracts or buys them directly on the contract market via item exchangeauctionthen he buys a killrights contract from the bounty office and gains the killrightshe can then hunt down his target and cash in the bountythe bounty hunter gets the killmail player a gets a copy of the killmailkilling a pc with a bounty on his head does not get you the bounty only someone with a bountyhunter contract gets the money if a bounty hunter with a contract on you shoots down your ship you do not gain killrights on him he just did his jobsuch a system would solve multiple issues in my opinionfirst of all it would amplify the often proclaimed concept that everything has consequencesplayers who are normally too weak to strike back could easily give others who are not the chance to dish out canbaiting and ganking even a rookie could have consequences if a bounty hunter decides to come for yougetting your own bounty is not so easy anymore because players cant just wait and let it raise since sooner or later someone real will try to collect it bounties would not grow so high too after all you are never completely safe anymore with a big bounty on your headbounty hunting would work legitimately even in empirepvp inside empire would increase while at the same time it would not hurt the carebears issuing a bounty on someone would actually mean somethingsuicide ganking would have serious consequences because it would quickly render the suicide ganking character unusable if you overdo itpeople could even make money from selling kill contractsplayers could pvp and shoot players while doing something productive and upholding the law the profession of bounty hunting would become a real possibility

this poster lacks in substance
isnt the age of consent 14 in iceland i thought they passed down responsibility earlier rather than later over there maybe theyre just more liberal with sex than they are with internet spaceships
that was raised passed and submitted to ccp months ago it wasnt discussed in iceland but its in the list that ccp recently submitted a preliminary reply to speaking of which does anyone have a date for us as to when the players as a whole will see ccps answers i understand that theres still some things to be done but id like to have an idea of when we can expect it
honestly no we have no idea whatsoeverthe problem is on ccps end this has to be done on the weekends but the important people from ccp who has to attend are busy with conferences and crap so its going to take some time before we can meet
the problem is we only have the short answer and ccp still needs to go into detail during a meeting with us and despite my attempts and the direct feedback from the csm we have not yet been able to arrange this meetingi really wish i had some feedback for you on these issues but we really need to discuss them with ccp directly first
me grumblesisnt this why we invented email its not as quick as a chat under normal circumstances but given that its already been about two weeks and youre making it sound like itll be a few more then facetoface really is a false economy you can say more over email in a daynever mind a month than over chat in an hour so waiting a month to have that hour seems crazy to me besides youve got 47 issues on the agenda  you didnt have time to properly discuss that many with a full weekend full of meetings youre not going to do better squeezing out a few hours in a chat channel
i agree if the csm sent an email they could send a well composed and detailed request instead of rushing through a meeting and forgetting details and have to do it again the csm would also receive a better and most likely a more well thought out response considering that the other side does not have to rush their answers to squeeze it in a small block of time ccp might be able to answer some of the questions 15 minutes here or 15 minutes there as time allows rather than having them find 2hours they might not be able to afford the csm in which they could have probably answered your questions long before the time you spent waiting for a response to the possibility of a meeting you would at least have the issues worked on and or addressed until they ever do have time the csm could address some of the issues before you have a meeting then you could have a meeting that is not as rushed and maybe a little more in depth due to the fact you have fewer issues to addresssitting on your hands waiting for some one to find time is not the answer
we already mailed ccp a response which they have yet to react ontrust me we do everything we try to make this work but ccp is not working with us at this point so we are really not able to force them to do anything at this point
apologies if it looked like i was blaming you  i dont know who is at fault here so im not trying to blame anyone in particular but if insistence upon a meeting is the stumbling block as you and ank implied that it was then id like to see that insistence dropped to allow things to function properly and efficiently really i dont care what is done how its done or who does it i just want this process to feel a bit less like its being run out of brigadoon i dont expect miracles from anybody and i dont anticipate that the csm submission is going to be released as a patch next tuesday but i want things to work as reasonably and efficiently as they can and i dont think that they are right now
essentially youre trying to justify the intrinsic value of 00 ownership while separating the extrinsic value selling rights to isk farmers and forum registration fees which are connected with corporate membership would seem to be fairly extrinsic as are trips to iceland and getting mentioned in forbes articles darius the fact is humorous quips aside theres plenty of extrinsic value to be seized i think its just myopic to wait for it not think outside the sandbox
not one of those things you mentioned has anything to do with 00 ownership aside from renting to isk farmers which as im sure many can attest is a very risky proposition for your alliance those extrinsic items shouldnt be looked at as a replacement for a fun and rewarding gameplay experience nobody really sets out wanting to achieve those things they are pleasant surpriseslooking at the makeup of the council being a 00 participant would appear to actually hurt your chances
wasnt there a survey that ccp did where they found that well over half the eve subscribers never left empire if that is the case and i dont know if thats an actual fact or just an internet stat then the spread is actually not too far from the actual ingame split of where people spend their time indeed given that i dont think any of the current council are exclusively high sec it may even be weighted in lownilneg secs favourbut as i said thats based on a stat of which i know neither the accuracy nor the origin
ill say it right up front im a relative newcomer to eve i started playing in january of this year on a whim what harm could a fifteenday free trial do i asked myself on that rainy winters day in seattle ill probably get bored and quit inside a week after all no video game at that time had managed to hold my interest for very longive since subscribed two alt accounts i have evemon skill plans going out two three years in the future im hooked i love this gameso since i have come to care about this game so much and since ive got so much invested in it obviously i want to see it thrive and prosper and i would love to have not just a chance to have a say in where it goes but to be a voice for the people who play it as a result im running for csm in the hope that ill be able to help make a better brighter future in eveheres a few random facts about my life in eve to give you an idea of where my eve experience has taken me00 resident00 alliance executive board memberavid but still rather noobish pvpercaldari ewar speccedaspiring capital pilot have a carebear alt  industry and researchhave participated in fw with a noncalamari altmac and linux userwith the preliminaries out of the way there are a few platform issues i want to talk about to give you an idea of my areas of focuscrossplatform supportthis is my pet project i started playing eve on a mac i hate having to boot into windows to pvp worth a damn i hate that the inset map is broken i hate the disco box i think we the nonwindowsusing community deserve better to that end i campaigned in the forumslink to postand successfully petitioned the current csm to raise an issue to the ccp developers about this issuelink to postas a result ccps response has improved slightly theyve been more active in the mac and linux forums but we still are no closer to having regular ongoing status updates about the status of a mac premium client and we continue to have severe graphical bugsas a csm i will give this issue the attention it deserves and i wont ccp get away with saying its coming therell be a dev blog about it in a couple of weeks and then lapsing into radio silence againtldr we should be able to pvp on nonwindows platforms at a reasonable framerate pretty graphics would be nice ill bug ccp about it until they get sick of me and give us a proper client just to get me to shut upthe evolution of 00eve as a game really started for me when i got to 00 i like the danger the excitement the wars and the politics and constant shifting of influence that goes on in 00 space as a csm i will encourage and support new ideas on how to improve the 00 experience from making sovreignty more valuable to increasing the role that noncapital ships have in sov warfare at the same time i realize capitals need love too  i cant wait to fly one and i want them to still be as useful and exciting then as they are nownanonerfevery csm candidate needs to have a position on this one in my opinion in my case im cautiously for it but im concerned about how it will affect blasterboats i do feel that something needs to be done  im tired of the predictability of nanoship gangs its all i ever see in small gang pvp and it gets monotonous levelling the playing field will force further tactical evolution and id like to see something newlagccps hard at work on this one and as csm i would continue to encourage them to do so im in a 00 alliance that means i have to deal with plenty of big blobs and the lagfests they generate not on the scale of the big boys of course but even so i feel your pain
forumsthe forums need work the censor software has an unacceptably high rate of falsepositives and the human moderators have trouble keeping up with the rate of posts i like the forums  i enjoy reading them each day and i think they are one of the most vital parts of the eve community lets give them the attention they deservepoliteness and professionalismif elected i want to work with not against my fellow csm members i am committed to dealing professionally with both the other members of the csm and with the community at large i wont let my personal feelings get in the way i have no alliancebased axes to grind i just want to make things workin conclusiontheres a lot more that i would like to say about each of these issues but im trying to resist the temptation to blast you all with a wall of text ill be setting up a campaign blog in the next day or two in which ill talk about the issues i support at more length until then thank you for your time and fly safe
this the stuff belongs to the player killed and not the killer as soon as there a wreck it a free for all with the winners being flagged to the owner of said wreck if youre tacklers are not fast enough to get the wreck as they should be close enough and fast enough then it youre problem and not anyone elses train them properly and youll get the rewards just dont whine about people not playing fair after you just killed someone 
bumping this
this is a nice idea and could use more consideration in particular it would make a nice link to the issue raised to change freed slavestourists  slaves can you expand on the idea more particularly in interaction with other aspects of eve eg can i planetary bomb your colony do i need a dreadnought to do that or something biggeretc
it is as you say with the exception of the widow which is a worthy successor to the scorp it can dps tank and jam cloak and jump drive however all the other ships are simply tier 1 battleships with a jump drive seriously agility bonus not damps wtf
i would like to see the covert hauler for sure fleet logistics make little sense in eve and you should be able to support a fleet deep in hostile territory with some kind of supportsupply ship maybe one day soon we will see an end to blobbing
actually id argue that the widow is the worst black ops since its completely outperformed by the falcons it can in theory with a fuel boost jump no matter how you fit the ship youre either wasting the ecm bonus with a missile gank fit or wasting the missile bonuses with an ecm fit which cant even ecm properly at least the other black ops bring some solid dps to the fight id much rather bring a redeemer than a worthless widow
i currently have an apoc tied up in a station that has been taken over by another alliance this apoc has t2 lasers fitted with t2 ammo as well as used faction and t2 ammo in the hold it is also outfitted with rigs as the current system stands i can do nothing with the ship because the laser crystals are damaged i can not create a contract if i repackage the ship i lose the rigs i have no way of removing the ammo so the ship just sits and collects dust tldr you can not contract ships with useddamaged lasermining crystals and there is no way to remotely remove these damaged items without losing rigs no other ammo type has this problemmy proposed solultion give me the option to remove the ammo or any damaged item from a ships hold as well as the weapons when creating a contract the ammo is already removed from the guns when creating a contract why not dump it in the hangar instead of the cargo bay
i thought this one had been submitted previously but apparently it hasnt been yes contracting of damaged goods is desperately needed
please fix this it would make life much easier and since only amarr and miners really have this problem it doesnt seem fair
this is a bad thing for eve as less difference in geography meansi doubt it will even change the market whatsoever i disagree even if people could jump clone even more while it might worsen the blobs it wont make 00 unimportant at all it just decreases the barrier to entry doesnt remove itwith a 20 hour jump clone timer that hardly changesthats really true for all of the above toono no no even if the jump clone timer is lowered it wont make people jump around like monkies people can already jump away if they get station camped or even worse they can go and play on an alt again i will have to disagree im not talking about giving all ships unlimited jump drives theres talk about a jump clone timer in the area of 12 to 20ish hours timei see 20 as quite reasonable
heartstone suggested a high skill requirementscience and infomorph v i think this is a good idea and i will write that into the document as an option tonight
we really could use an update on this since it has been sooo long since the last one
i like this idea with one single exceptioni dont like how the pay out is based on the kill its self this is for several reasons1 bad price checks what do we base things like faction loot and the loss of faction ships additionally do they only receive compensation on things not dropped and destroyed there are many things to consider with this2 rewards older players disproportionately lets face it the chances of a guy in a frigate killing a pirate in his fully fitted faction bs or his t2 hac is nil to none older players have a better chance this makes players whove simply been here longer more sucessful bounty hunters this shouldnt be the case3 removal of the personal feel lets face it im a pirate and that bounty on my head is a direct relation to my epeen the bigger it gets the better i feel about myself its an indication of job success good pirates arent measured by the ship they fly or the implants in their head but their noteriety a bounty hunter should get a good reward for killing famous pirates not ones with expensive tastes in ships and fine wines also part of what makes bounties so fun is having them cost players to get revenge its not a system that just works its a personal feeling kind of like defeating them in a duel
no different to normal pvp not a real issue according to those who repeatedly say that isk and sp arent an issue and new players can do pvp just like everyone elsebeing famous reputation bounty these are all things that the pirate cares about  not the targets  indeed most targets dont know the pirates reputation whether theyre infamous in the sector or whether the bounty is due to success or put on by the pirate themselves to make themselves look more capable theres nothing to stop you checking your own bounty hunter contracts indeed ccp could add a sum of those and keep the existing bounty notification
yes please

i agree with this i dont think small frigates bumping larger ships to be of much benefit to the game although this problem likely started occurring because of dockundock tactics which need reevaluation to
fix bumping exploits becoming features ftl
titan portals and then getting bumped you lose the portaltitan being of a mass smallest one 1537500000 kg so anything smaller then a cap sized ship should be able to disturb a titan let alone break the portalkinetic energy  ek12mv2bumping at velocity should cause some form of damage and when done by someone1 not in your gang stops warp bump damage2 not in your alliancecorp similar to repping without being ingangto the bumper1 high velocity bumping should cause damage to the ship to with a kenetic value in relationship to the mass of the target ship ie you try to bump a titan in a interceptor going 6kms just using an medium speed with a mass of 1075000 taranis the interceptor should be damaged at least into armor if not structuredestroyed seems like another part of the game that was omitted for ease of programming titans should not be able to be bumped by friendly ganged pilots especially while creating a jump portal bumping a freighter on a gate for an hour is griefing but under the current mechanics its not an aggressive act this needs to be corrected as wellramming is a valid military tactic where the attacker and target both take damage submarines were sunk while the attacker did take damage during rl use of this maneuver the game needs to be fixed not adding new material fix what we have and make it solid
you just need the role to do it i am not ceo and i can modify corp market orderask your ceo to grant you the role
id support this on one of the following two conditionsa doing so risks being caught in the cyno jammers disruption giving you an exceptionally risky 85 chance of your ship and cargo being destroyed on landingb the faction you jump to responds to your aggression and targets the jump freighter and cyno ship maybe even retaliates and invades your little section of 00
i cant see how letting jump freighter completely bypass the choke points that every other ship in the game must travel through in order to move between low and high sec is a good thing frankly it doesnt appear to me as though a jump freighter needs to risk much as it is if necessary cyno to a friendly pos then warp to the gate and instjump it also eliminates war declarations as a mechanic to stop hostile logistics since jump freighters would be able to bypass any empire blockadenot supported
no
this is so necessary even if they make the cynojumpfreighter system a sort of high sec pos module using very similar system as the covert cyno stuff you just make the jumpfreighter system work this way which honestly is good because once you add the jump fuel costs the pos fuel etc etc the corp standing idea is all setup to make sense with the storyline rp stuffits not overpowered because these systems will cost so much fuel costs excessive addition trading costs will make your profit margins hurt compared to what your competitors who arent jumpdriving aroundso really nothing changes except it gives an advantage to the jump freighters which are respectable
ummm being a jump freighter they already have an advantage of well being able to jump before they had to fly everywhere taking forever to do so unless you did things right and had some corpies with you to web the freighter on gatesjump fighters already dont have much risk as they can jump to a lowsec system next to highsec warp to gate and bam there in highsec i have been on a couple jump freighter kills and the only reason we were able ot catch them was because they did stupid stuff like cyno on a planet or there cyno buddy put them to close to the station and bounced them off dock range
please visit your user settings to reenable imagesnot a huge difference between a 6 or 7 jammer falcon so i dont know why people are getting their knickers in a knot over this still being jammed 463 of the time with two eccm mods
except that you upgraded to 2 racial jammers from the 1 you had before although your last fit also had 1 correct racial jammer on the falcon and two pointed at the dominix so it could use a bit of work there too heres the whole list of numbers with 2x sda and 2x pda just for completeness5 jams1 of each racial 1 multi 395 jams1 correct racial 4 incorrect 355 jams2 correct racial 3 incorrect 436 jams1 of each racial 2 multi 4616 jams1 correct racial 5 incorrect 3886 jams2 correct racial 4 incorrect 4637 jams1 of each racial 3 multi 5237 jams1 correct racial 6 incorrect 4237 jams2 correct racial 5 incorrect 494realistically the top one is the most likely to be used for a total of 39 jam anything above 463  and that implies luck  means youre facing a pretty bad falcon pilot now how is this a bad thing youre spending two slots on a countermeasure to a whole ship as expensive and skillintensive as your own and with full exertion it can deal with you almost half the time instead of keeping two or three ships down most of the time like it normally can that seems like a countermeasure just as effective as i want it to be
up at the top left of this page ccp keeps a lot of player resources handy some are genuinely useful  the tracking guide for example is excellent some are less useful and probably the most egregious of these is the item database keeping this updated would in a sensible world take exactly zero effort  you update your item database on the tranquility servers and it dumps it straight to the website automatically however not only is it not updated automatically its not updated at all look on the item database for marauders jump freighters or the other trinity ships  theyre not there look at the amarrian ships updated in the boost patch months ago  theyre still listed as their old versions it looks like the last time it was updated was revelations ii which came out in july 2007 there is also a plethora of information there that is either useless or actively misleading to new players  thrust strength is an interesting window into design paths not taken but it should not be on a site that is most likely to be checked by the newest players finally and most annoyingly there is no sorting whatsoever done its not alphabetical its not in order of most used to least its not in order of ship sizes its just random i would like to see the following changes made to the item database keep it up to date at all times  remove all information with no game effect sort all pages alphabetically having a database thats easily accessible and with urls is convenient and it should be made as useful as it could be a thirdparty skill monitor having a bettermaintained item database than the official website is embarrassing and this should be fixed

with regards to the issue of people using the skill queue to shut down their accounts for longer periods the answer seems simple all skill training pauses when an account goes inactive alternatively training pauses after the account has been inactive for a week therefore protecting people who accidentally let their account lapsethis prevents people from abusing the queue concept while allowing its functionality to benefit those who are actively playing yes this is a nerf to those who engage in the pinnacle of afk gaming cancelling their account while training a long skill but frankly i dont see this as a negativesupported
sorry but im gonna have to disagree here the reason they dont have this feature is that there would be no value in having an account continue to be paid if you could queue up skills to be trained that and their people loggedin would change which is one of their objectives to push the envelope of mmo designif people download macro programs they get what they deserve if they get a trojan or virus on their computer they chose to download the program and only admit their guilt when they complain to ccp i dont even know why ccp posted that warning as it doesnt affect them or their serverswith the dualskill i think you mean dual not duel system people will simply set insert highrank level 5 skill trainings to run then let their account expire for 3 months this will not benefit ccp as ccp is a business whose purpose is to make money by providing an enjoyable recreational product

someone could whack me over the head with a balance cluebat if they have a reason to but logically i dont see why you shouldnt be able to configure a normal fab ie station industry to do ore compression like a ship floating in space can of course i also dont see why you shouldnt be able to produce just about anything small anyway with a rorquals industrial core if it is reconfiguring itself into a factory
clearly you never actually bother reading the dev blogs or interviews like the recent stackless io release just because you view a particular feature added to the game as useless doesnt make it so perhaps you should get off your high horse and recognise that this is a very deep multiplayer game with enough complexity that no one person finds appeal in every part of it if ccp have determined that a given feature adds appeal they have every right to add it and you have every right to not continue to pay them money thats about it plus you clearly know nothing about lag if you think that ambulation or even more amusingly factional warfare add to lagi truly cant believe you are against the notion of more subscribers purely because more people might cause more lag  thats just plain stupidyes i support the notion that larger fleets should be less laggy and that either large fleet battles should either be fun or not possible not somewhere inbetween for reference many talk of trying to get the return of the small roaming gang so huge fleets arent everyones cup of tea but they should be possibleim not quite sure why this issue is necessary given that its very clear ccp have this goal already in mind a quick glance at the infiniband project would show that
after last night this issue once again rears its ugly headccp you cant make pos warfare mechanics the way they are and then punish fleets for trying to fightlast nights engagement was a travesty and you should be ashamed of yourselves not only was the lag crippling to nc but it wasnt for gbc resulting in a slaughter and a bad taste in a lot of peoples mouthsi do not expect this to be fixed but i have to post on it anyway the game is broken and im not sure i want to play it like this anymore
in 2005 when i began playing this game i remember no major instances of lag now i notice lag just in normal game play and thats been going on for some timelag in missionslag in loading solar systemslag in warpso on so oni do believe stackless python will go a long way in helpingbut the problem is while player numbers have grown quickly the effort to produce programming and infrastructure to handle the load has forgive the punlagged behindi dont believe trying to discourage new players from joining or changing mechanics in a way that only benefits the highly skilled etcis the answer anymoreits way beyond thattime to get serious ccp if your gonna add new features and entice more players then better get to work on supporting it1 or it will bite you in the rear end

what you need is a proposal to change the way sovereignty warfare works in 00 at the moment it encourages necessitates enormous blobs as the only way of harming the enemy you need a complete and fundamental rewrite of the sovereignty war mechanics that makes blobbing tactically and strategically stupidthere is no technical fix here only option is to change the rules so the wisest fleet commanders and alliance planners distribute their forces and avoid blob fest scenarios as a bad idea
as much as everyone likes to hate blob warfare ive yet to see any reasonable mechanic that would replace it i know how much we all hate real world comparisons but theres no warfare tactics i know of to explain why the larger of two similarly equipped forces should lose on the types of battlefields you encounter in eve pos warfare isnt fun but even without it blobs are going to be around as long as there are large organizations of players that want to win fightsccp needs to fix this on a technical level because they designed a game with large fleet battles in mind and the current server technology cant support it
that would require a change to game mechanics whereby the smaller fleet inflicts more economic damage upon the larger fleet and i cant think of any such change i could support
right now eve is plagued with limits on how much we can say a forum post cant be more than 4000 characters a bio is even shorter and an evemail is shorter yet even the notepad in game which should specifically be for storing huge gobs of text you cant put anywhere else is apparently having a fairly short character limit imposed upon it this is stupid and counterproductive instead of making one forum post when i have something long to say i need to make five instead of sending one corp mail with intel i need to send three this adds overhead to the system and makes the player experience more annoying take all character limits anywhere even close to the game and either eliminate them entirely or make them so large as to have no meaning if you want to make us have a 100000 character limit on a forum post i wont object too strenuously  anyone writing a novella can handle a bit of chapterization but the limits should not interfere with the play experience of average players  someone who wants to ramble for a couple pages in their bio or discuss a mildly complex business deal via evemail or post more than three dozen links in a forum post should be allowed to do so without any restrictionsalso it should be noted that a thread similar to this related to bio lengths specifically has already been sent to ccp however since the problem affects more than that im posting this in hopes that the solution will as welledit apparently there are concerns about unlimited text lengths being exploitablesee post 18 i dont quite get it but ill adjust my proposal accordingly  add a whenever practical to the above id rather have short text lengths than a broken game but i still prefer that they be raised as high as is safe
i support the principle wholeheartedly butforums wont change until they bring in more development effort and redo the whole thing as you noted  weve already submitted an issue on the bio length and will be arguing about the outcome when we get our chat with the devs re the other text limits  yes it needs to be sorted out for sure but one thing you need to be sure of is that larger text limits in chat wont be exploited by cheating players ingame to gain an advantage over their enemies eve is a game where people have invented can spamming bookmark bombs shuttle explosions and all sorts of dodgy techniques to gain an advantage over their virtual foes  think whats the worst thing a bunch of exploiters can do with this change when suggesting an increase to game functionality that impacts bandwidth issues sad to say that decent adult players do suffer by sharing the playground with people prepared to exploit the system to gain an advantage in virtual war but saying that  by all means lets construct an issue that makes sense in general terms and see if we cant thrash out a compromise that lets us type more without delivering the mechanics into the hands of people who will use it to spam their enemies with 10000 character rude images to lag out jump in fleets
you raise a few good points bios have already been asked about and forums are also in the works to my understanding the mail system should likewise be fixed wholesale and not just having a character limit increased  we need a sentbox an address book options on how to read it and elimination of character limits not just one of those its only really the notepad that needs to be addressed singly i stuck them together to make a point about how the game should work as much as i did because the topics have never been addressed before regarding utility as a lag bomb the obvious solution is pagination every 10000 characters have a little arrow at the bottom to go forward or back a page something similar should be done with hardins corp history  i tried loading that once it took multiple minutes i doubt many would use something like a bio which gets read in a lot of contexts few of them enemies in combat as a lag bomb but even if only for bandwidth reasons i can support automatically splitting it into pages my goal here is to allow people to carry on business without artificial and unnecessary limits the details of that as you say are up for debate

when the best viable artillery platform is an abaddon somethings wrong with arties
the current policy of refusing all large scale losses for reimbursement is harmful illogical and is in need of reconsideration ostensibly the logic behind this is that ccp does not wish to put the man hours behind having to investigate claims in reality this policy is spiteful derisive and is a horrible business model towards its customers a carrier is approximately 1213 billion isk with fittings if we take the 2040 mil an hour bench mark thats 120 manhours through missioning or ratting this may be lessened through other income gathering methods which is outside the purview of this debate but the fact is that most fleetfights will see several thousand manhours expended and then wasted because of a desync or blackscreen this in itself is quite frustrating and perhaps the single most unappealing aspect of the game the fact that it is blatantly obvious moderators do not even examine the complaints shows a sign of callousness well beyond that the policy should be changed to as followsif evidence of a desync can be provided no modules activated no hardeners on not warped out and evidence of similar circumstances occuring in the same system the hull should be replaced along with the destroyed modules and any insurances payments should be reversed from an immediate perspective this does not change the immediate balance of power these ships are still rendered ineffective while the pilot has to replace them they suffer the cost of replacing modules and the parties fortunate enough to find the wreck get the dropped modules coversely it reverses the long strategic advantage gained from server performance failure pilots concerned do not lose their killmails or the loot acquired and they get the momentary benefit of those ships removed afflicted pilots disaffection for eve is lessened reducing net outflow of players from the game and improving this particular point of customerclient relations players patience with hardware limitations is not unlimited ccp can at least indicate that their gms can spend three minutes on a customer for several hundred man hours put into a system instead of callously showing appreciation for their patrons time and money by simply sending prescripted responses
our logs show you should not fly what you can not replace
its not spite if its truth investigating these claims takes a lot of manhours and ccp likes spending money on customer service staff as much as any other company  ie not at all and given the ubiquity of desyncs it would really be a monumental expense for them to investigate them id rather they used the time and money to fix the problem  which if the last dev blog is to be trusted theyre well on their way to doing  than to fix the symptoms besides for better or for worse desync is a known concern when you warp into a big fleet op and being lagged and killed happens and more importantly it has always happened a known risk with a known lack of reimbursement should not be a surprise of course itys somethign that should be fixed but as i said above fixing the lag is the right solution not putting a bandaid on
i also take flights but should one i take crash my next of kin would have little issue successfully taking suit against the airline in question nor would my knowledge of the risk mitigate this in any way people werent desynced warping in we had a fight going and then the entire node died following this everyone was shafted by ccp seeing as how best estimated put the active players at 60 total with the remaining 900 people being unable to do anything except die or stare at a black screen i agree the solution is to fix the lag itself but that doesnt mean that when servers deprive people of their labor with nothing in return they shouldnt be remunerated
if the logs do not show anything then fix the logs its blindingly obvious that there are desynchblackscreenetc problems in this game and pretending they dont exist is not going to change anything
being able to afford to replace a ship  losing it in a desynceven if you can afford it its hugely frustrating when you are in warp while seeing your hull reduce knowing there is absolutely nothing you can do losing a carrier or whatever in an actual battle is less annoying just slightly inconvenient
if you are tired of desyncs lag blackscreens etc then why do you blob you know the servers can barely handle 300 people in a system so why do you get upset when big surprise a system with 900 people in it suffers from those problems ccp should actually increase lag and desyncs that way you blobbers never get the chance to fight in the first place
now that i can agree with spiteful much
i think you are either unfamiliar with the situation or are just simply so poorly versed on the mechanics that you seem to equate a simple reality of forces necessary to counter an opposing group with some malicious decision to use numbers capable of destroying the system there was a hostile force of 450 in system this force had close to 100 capitals 300 support including 4 motherships and two titans the intitial allied forces that breached were roughly 600 not including the ships we held in reserve of the roughly 1000 people who loaded 920 were looking at black screens for 4 hours 80 people at most were able to play it would not have mattered who held the system prior to the battle as the node crashed everyone had to load up because the node crashed and ejected every player from the system there is no way around this situation in the mechanics of the game when 90 of your customers are unable to access the game this comes down to a design flaw screaming fix the lag doesnt change this systemic flaw i empathize with the difficulty of making such a scenario playable and id be willing to allow ccp the time to make it playable but in lieu of a working scenario asking the majority of participants in a fight to bare the brunt of a broken mechanic is simply unnacceptable
closer to 40 iirc not to mention not all 00 players are regularly lagged out and unable to login the majority of the time
sniped the comments about getting evemails about my loss 10 min before i saw my ship getting destroyed because it doesnt really matter anymorestill give my support to this issue
in this particular battle local was at 600 and change 1021 prior to the crash however given the privileged position of being a lazy fc who wasnt actively in charge of either support or capitals i was able to tally up the numbers on both sides through straw polls killboard stats and contacts with bob and ncallied forces
can someone explain to me in simply terms other than epic fun why it is necessary to have 1000 pilots flighting in a single system what tacticalstrategic advantage does that serve and are there no alternativesif i was losing ships to the lag monster id adjust tactics to some other means of conquering the universe are you saying this simply isnt possible
the advantage it serves is simple  if you have a fleet big enough to drop a capital in 20 seconds and they have a fleet big enough to drop a capital in one minute youre going to inflict three times the damage upon them that they are upon you  possibly more since their relative fleet size will also drop faster the bigger fleet usually wins against the smaller and thats true in virtually every context in both real war and fictional just like the american navy could crush the canadian the 500man blob can crush the 50man with massively disproportionate losses about the only way to avoid this is aoe weaponry  it doesnt matter how big your fleet is if i nuke it in harbour but eve only has three varieties of aoe  one overpowereddoomsdays one very narrowsmartbombs and one vastly overcostedbombs the only one of these that can be targeted usefully is the one thats most useless because its an easily interdicted weapon system on an easily destroyed ship perhaps there are ways of avoiding this  give some t2 ammo a splash radius perhaps  but at present there is no conceivable way for a small wellbuilt fleet to beat a big wellbuilt fleet as for countermeasures you can try but the problem is that if you try to avoid lag with a 100man fleet the enemys 500man fleet that doesnt care about lag will show up and pulverize you besides you may be losing ships to the lag monster but so is the enemy  its not like you can eliminate lag for your fleet while keeping it for the enemys
if there are 100 people willing to fight each other then coming to a compromise is useless because neither side trusts each other theres no such thing as tactics when it comes down to this because numbers usually make the most difference
you should know that such a concept rests solely around the prisoners dilemma insofar as both parties seek to to get the other to cooperate whilst allowing themselves to defect no group is going to accept a numeric disadvantage even if scaled down as you propose nor does it mathematically make sense to ill leave it to you to learn lanchesters laws unless youd wish to trade your polaris frigate for tutoring lessons simply put its against both the mechanics and scope of the gameplay to seperate battles essentially the only way your proposal is viable is if the party who must take the system volunteers to jump in one at a time thus providing a lagfree experience for all parties involved and often with the same results so tldr version no the mechanics of the game do not permit splitting a battleedited correcting point previously noted
serenity is not an employee of ccp
lets not confuse that arguement with such trivial things as facts d moreso this is not the thread for discussions on tactics resulting to such lag the lag itself or anything of that nature this thread is predominantly concerned with ccps policy on reimbursements and its interaction with game mechanics
im not sure whats funnier the fact he assumed he was ccp or the fact that its totally random and off the walli for one cant make the connectionas for the discussion even if ccp manages to fix the so called problem its going to exponentially get out of handfeasibly the only way you could have a lag free massive battle is to make sure both parties have an equal number of pilots of sufficent epic size to insure the battle actually takes placein other words 300 ships on either end or somethingbecause i dont know about you guys but crashing nodes to win is not what i call funif all the massive wars for 00 where like that hell id quit wheres the fun in thatid rather get my  kicked in live time not blacked out
unless the bulk of advertising devblogs and information regarding conflict in eve online is false warfare is never about a fair fight if a gm were to state to both sides alright the servers are not intended to fight at this level so my calculations are that x bs x dreads x caps etc from this side and y bs y dreads y caps from that side are a reflective distribution of numbers arrayed and i will be willing to move all those outside this number to a staging groundaway from the combat zone and allow the reflective portion to duke it out id be happy with the outcome whatever it may be this isnt something that the onus should be put on the players this is a fault in the mechanics of the game and i simply feel that ccp should own up to their responsibility and take the necessary steps to rectify their shortcomings rather than let their playerbase arbitrarily suffer suggesting that battles should be divided into even numbered engagements simply evidences an abject ignorance of warfare and conflict to the point that id like to ask drake that if he and i are fighting and he has more isk than me perhaps he could send me some because its unfair of his financial advantage
just saying if one side had 600 frontline ships available to confront a 450 shipfleet with further reserves available  they could have gone and sieged 34 other locations and left enough forces to camp the enemy where they stood in the best event the smaller enemy would be able to counterattack one of those 34 locations but would have to charge through a camp and jump in through cynos loading grid secondaccepting the loss of a system while striking numerous others surely is something that would work better in the future
wow you really do think things through dont youepic fail1 ccp owns up to it and fixes lag by getting more servers more hardware2 fleet battles numbering twice if not thrice there size before shows up3 server node crashes4 rinse dry repeatcare to try again
you should not lose ships in this game while staring at a loading screen period whether its a frigate or a titan thats just about the epitome of crappy illcoded game playif their logs cant show them that the player wasnt actually in the game when their ship died they damn well need to enhance their logger having a ship replaced that died before you loaded shouldnt even require a petition its a defect in how the game is coded and if they cant fix it they should at very least fix it so that players arent disadvantaged by it
once again this isnt a question of choice of tactics moreso youre saying that once you have 400 in fleet the jump button should change to the i win button on the overview
care to troll again this isnt a decisionmaking discussion on behalf of the players ccp being unable to produce the product as advertised and paid for should result in some form of compensation it should not be left to the players to speculate what the servers capable of and then find some way to negotiate with the enemy to make a game playable were not playing alternativedisputeresolutiononline this is simply a question of ccp taking responsibility for its errors even if it means an increased workload
agree very much
really shouldnt even be a matter of increased petitions and workloads though losing your ship before you are actually in the game  broken  defective  not working rightcan anyone really say with a straight face that your ship arriving in the game before you do and dying before you ever get there is working as intended look its not rocket science there is a protocol set of messages that go back and forth between the client and the server when you log in like so1 server recieves login request from client2 server authenticates the user and starts sending game data3 server places the players ship on the grid4 data transmission to the client is complete client starts rendering the game you stop seeing the entering game screen5 client finishes rendering the game and gives the player control you can start clickin stuff and activating moduleswhats wrong with the above its pretty obvious step 3 shouldnt happen before step 5 they coded it wrong in lowload situations its not obvious that its coded wrong becasue the time lapse between 3 and 5 doesnt matter much in high load situations it is obvious and it breaks the gamesince its coded wrong if they cant easily fix it they should just put an extra bit in there where the server goes damn his ship got blown up before step 5 stick another one in his hangerthe end its broken fix it

the lagfests we are seeing almost every day only help to make it clear that this game cannot handle the fights people want to get intoeven though they try very hard to boost systems by throttling connections restrictions on player capacity it just doesnt handle itif you loose a ship through their server not being able to handle the amount of people in the system you should get reimbursed fully this is a game i know but we also pay money every month to play this game
to answer the opi agree ccp shouldnt be shining you on and replying with canned answers in these instances this policy is wrong and it should be addressed

isnt setting a ceiling to the price of a gtc an indirect way of fixing its price
its a fairly direct way actually its not like these people are asking it to be capped at 10 billion after all
wont happen and shoult not happend also comparing gtc to other necessary good is not even wrong governments rarelly fix prices for luxury goods
the problem here is that gtc cards now cost more per month in real cash than when the 90 day cards were around so yes ccp is making more money if the playerbase would be stable or larger than b4 the 90 day cards got removed so yes they can take action to bring down the price of gtcs it would mean lowering prices on them  i for one am all for that as i still think we got screwed over with the 60 day cards setting fixed prices for gtc cards in isk is a bad idea though 
working as intended i agree with adding 30  90 days gtc again but they wont reduce they prices so these would be added with new prices proportional to current 60 days gtc if anyone thinks they would change this hes a fool and should learn a bit of economics too
no bad ideayes the gtcs are ridiculously priced all you have to do is not buy them eventually those who want to get isk for gtc will lower pricesif people are still willing to buy at such a ridiculous price then why would these gtc traders lower pricesthe claim that people are faking sales is absurd
meh put up wtb orders and spam it in the other channel in the trade tab if your buying a couple at a time you can still get them for 350400mill
im all for using mmos as a lab to test realworld economic theory  for that matter id like to go to grad school for it at some point  but there are limits even for me forex is not fun for anyone but the geekiest of finance majors and the eve player base is decidedly not composed of wall street typesthese days they cant afford the subscription it would make gameplay an utter nightmare  youd have to keep track of five separate wallets and keep five submarkets active  and you wouldnt even have the convenience of your visa statement automatically converting it all into your home currency because your wallet doesnt run through a corporation that plays on the forex markets youd be throwing a huge roadblock up to anyone who doesnt have enough money to carry a comfortable sum around in each of five currencies and youd be doing it for the sake of making internet spaceships more closely approximate realworld financial markets i like my financial theory as much as the next guy but this is taking it too far its still a game and gameplay still has to come first
im hardly suggesting it be made as difficult to understand as the real world marketno reason anyone who doesnt want to see all the different currencies should have to press the esc button and click on show all monetary values in isk the players purchases would automatically be made first through the currency that is required and then the players other currencies would be exchanged at what the computer determines to be the best value available only players that want to get into it would ever have to see what was going on behind the scenesthe same way most markets workas you say its a game theres no reason a group of creative minds cant think of ways to make something complicated seem easy
the real world currency market is not difficult to understand  its actually fairly simple as long as you just look at the what and the how rather than the why its just generally a headache you know that might actually work as long as there was an active currency market and there would be theres no reason you couldnt automate it like you suggest i still dont think that its necessary or wise but im less opposed to it now that you mention that possibility
no
your forgetting the programming effort involved in implementation of such a system would be quite dauntingbut oh well
proposal is simplelet salvagers salvage podded pilots to retrieve special implant salvage materialsadd bpcs via lp storemissionsexploration sites etc so that pilots can use the special implant salvage materials to build new implants
kinda spooky if you think about nercoin someone floater for hardwarenice idea but in a dark kind of way
nice
better yet sell the bodies for organic materials to medical service stationsthats how they get clones for there clone bays  o 
grisly but interesting id like to see ccps take on this
the mida industrial expansion will allow players to build implants no idea on how it will work
hashes are secure hashes are secure hashes are securesee what i did therehow about actually justifying this instead of making a dozen posts all saying the same thingproclaiming that you ripped password hashes from etcshadow hardly makes you look any smarter an 8 year old can rip passwords from there although most people prefer to call it copy and pastingif hashes werent reasonably secure id be worried about other more important things then my eve account
the difficulty is 90 getting the hashes and only about 10 turning the hashes into useful access credentials yodathe dark side clouds our vision and moves in secrecy experience security breaches you will limit their damage you mustyodai like the 8year old comparison let it be known im throwing experience out there just to look smarter instead of asking that ccp not hold a database of mine or anyones access credentials its bad practice as ive already pointed out half a dozen times
in the real world if you dont earn over say 20000 a year you dont get taxedif you earn a million every month you get taxed 30setup a graduated tax for the npc corps so that anyone earning say a billion a month of isk in the npc corps get taxed a certain amountif they dont like this they can make themselves a corp or join a corp
or we can decide not to make people play their game the way you want them to
csm turned this down flat last time i doubt they will pass it in the future
exploitable idea is exploitablelarge alliances all join minmatar fw take over amarr space recieve reward repeat  profit
i think that dockingservices limitations depending on who is in control of the system is a good concept and makes sense from a storyline point of viewif you are in fw then losing docking rights is a penalty for failure and i think more immersivei dont agree with someone elses suggestion of an end game big payout that encourages people to blob up on one side and farm it but that wasnt the ops suggestion anyway
large alliances profit  wtf noone in their right mind would ever suggest introducing lp store items unbalanced enoughto make taking over fw by your large alliances worthwhilethe idea is having any kind of rewards at all not some overpowered nonsense again where did anyone ever suggest such a thing
when a node crash ccp should give back all destroyed ships signed
the thread immediately below this one is on exactly this topic dont duplicate threads unnecessarily
that is to bob vs nc
epic failme thumbs down
use a nanotitan srsly bumping should just be removed altogether
because pos bowling was such fun that it it should be brought back in a new form
this needs moving no issue posted
you should post that as a proposal 
no if you dont like it pay for your accounts
note okay this has been delayed twice now due to the csmccp meetings on the same weekends and its now important we get this one out of the way to clear up the backlog  lets make a special effort to be there promptly at 1500 hours on sunday and get through this in a timely and organized fashion csm meeting 11 sunday 19th oct 1500 hours eve timeagenda announcements 1 2 csm raised issues  csm delegates must 1 reply to this thread listing the issue name and assembly hall thread they wish to advocate and 2 supply the issue in templated form to csm mailing list by 1800 hours friday 17th oct to be heard in the subsequent meeting1 rp alliances in fw jade deferred from meeting 102 planetary colonies jade deferred from meeting 10 3 alliance logo submission system hardin deferred from meeting 104 negative pirate standings ank5 citadel torpedo balance  extreme vulnerability to smartbombs jade6 rnd security dierdra7 issue corporation market order modification lavista8 database export release dierdra 9 issue invention implant needs fixing  lavista10 probes losing ownership after session change dierdra11 issue test server skill speed increase  lavista12 idea advanced infomorph psychology  lavista13 faction warfare complex spawn mechanics  ank14 more fun with smartbombs  jade15 lack of focus and goals in factional warfare  ank 16 break mission monopoly obtaining standing through  ank different means17 standing recovery  ank 18 skill queue and 30 day gtc now that ghost training is gone ankpopular issue biggest unaddressed assembly hall issue  will be added after csm raised issues1 aob any other business additions can be submitted prior 1800 hours friday 17th oct1 tba2 tbaall csm delegates and alternates are invited to attend can i ask the moderation team to pay special attention to this thread please and ensure that it is kept free of trolling flaming and personal attacks and is able to serve its intended purpose of allowing csm delegates to list the issues they wish to be heard in the next meeting and for members of the eve public to ask questions in a respectful and civil tonethank you
any chance the citadel torp issue can make it onto this one
yep ill add it
the bottom line is that if you dont want muppets on the csm then you shouldnt vote for doctor bunsenit really is that simpleof course it does require a little bit of research amongst the voters to work out who the less suitable candidates are but then its part of the fundamental nature of democaracy that the system wont work without an informed electorate
look mate in a game where you try to blow eachothers ships up and harm other players you cant honestly expect the game to take something that seriously dont like the bigots pod themadditionally ccp stands for crowd control productions it doesnt mean thought control productionsbesides who would enforce this wonderful utopia world of eve you there arent enough gms to handle this theyre too busy moving people in and out of jita by hand
just to clear this up a bitcsm sent in its documentation ccp responded with 12 line or in some cases 3 word answers on those topics this was as most would agree unacceptable for most of the issues raised a compiled set of questions from the csm delegates were again sent to ccp asking for clarification of its responses and this point that is what the csm is waiting on  a response to that requested clarification from ccp
how about the csm sending an open letter to ccps ceo whose name i recognise but could never spell from memory copying in a number of prominent gaming sites which have already given column inches to the csm complaining that despite ccps assurances of how the csm would work ccp are constantly holding up progress and appear to not really care any more now that they have milked the press coverage for all they can
no given that the csms only power comes from their ability to influence ccp burning your bridges with ccp by slamming them in the media is a very bad idea that is a last resort and even then im not sure what provocation ccp could come up with that would justify the csm actively trying to destroy the game
why a bad idea if they dont keep their promises they should be blamed if they are nto stupid they wouldnt break their media campaing by suddenlly closing down csm or cutting all comunicationsseriouslly of a staff of over300 guysgals on ccp they cant devote soem hours to comunicate with csm and respond to feedback by the comunity smells bad
my point there was really that ccp have jumped on a media bandwagon with the csm and they have made some public commitments and now the spotlight has faded and it is time to deliver on them dont seem to be doing soas a minor example i distinctly remember ccp saying that they were going to host chat logs i have just tried to see how far they had got with this only to find that when i clicked on the csm link on the left hand column oddly positioned in the middle of my account and my character only to find that the link is broken way to support the csmmaybe herschel is right and an open letter is a last resort  but if ccp are not responding it needs to be escalated if someone at work isnt doing what they should be and is ignoring your emails you can escalate to their manager to get them kick the persons arse and get them to do their job i think its definitely time to consider doing that
my guess is that right now ccp is probably of the opinion that theyve sent off their answers and the csm is just being annoying and hard to please to try to get unnecessary information and that its making them look bad in the process its entirely possible that they dont think that theyve done anything wrong and as such see no need to fix it remember the csm is a side thing for most of ccp and their day job is still hacking together code for the next few expansions and supporting the game generally you cant expect them to write a book every two months i dont know if your viewpoint or my hypothetical ccp viewpoint is more accurate or if either of them even comes close to the mark theres very little information for us to judge it based on but dont bring out the sledgehammer just because youre a little bit annoyednow that is a much more reasonable solution get email addresses going up the chain of command and send off nasty letters internally if you cant get satisfaction through normal means but dont go airing dirty laundry outside the family unless it is truly necessary and right now its not
i would focus on getting your contacts to escalate your requests keep it professional keep it civil they did not have to give us a forum to voice our ideas or concerns for change they could have as easily told us to pound sand of course that is not very healthy to your goodwill and growing customer base i have seen the attitude from them before now from a business stand point we are not privy to their current work load issues projects man hour shortageoverage or what crisis is currently flying through the office atm we assume since they have 300 people that some of them have nothing to do if i had 300 people and some of them had nothing to do i would not have 300 people the next day and i would not be hiring either
oh i thought you were talking about acdc the rock band 
neededseparation of industrial aspects of stations from military aspects of stations it should be possible for example to wage warfare on someones economy without attacking a pos as it stands you can only smash down the door of a manufacturing pos and then wait for the blob fight in a few hours surgical strikes should be capable of blowing up important structures like moon miners reprocessors and reactors you cant defend all the targets of opportunity in a good system most home systems have 35 poses at the least one is a death star the other is a cyno bridge and the others are all industrial and moon miners making industry into smaller bitesized chunks will not only make the economy more interesting smaller corps could then get into specialized industry but also make for more targets that cant all be defended the losses would be pretty menial 100 mil or less while it wont end the viabilyt of blobs to kill them it would certainly enable smaller gangs to do the work rather than a blob
i think the op is a bit too tree hugging for my taste to even suggest they use solar anyway it is very impractical to use solar power in the uk due to latitude position on the earth and as any islander will agree overcast and mostly cloudy a good porion of the time the places that are better suited for that are very southern europe north africa and the south western part of north americai for one dont want those dirty spaniards to have that server farm
