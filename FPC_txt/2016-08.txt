extremely fun for some of us so malcanis is right in that creating a corp with a dozen other new players and hanging out in highsec is no way to play eve joining a preexisting corp or alliance can be problematic however fortunately for me when i first started playing i ended up in an npc corp that has a group of players with a consistent presence in nullsec it allowed me to pve and gain wealth while at the same time pvp and gain combat experience i learned by playing both with and against people who have been in the game 10 years we have hardcore players we have casuals we have combat players we have industryonly playersif you dont know anybody who is already in combatcapable corp try some of the npsi groups you dont need to be hardcore just show up for a scheduled event when you have the time and follow along try to make some contacts in game and figure out with whom youd be happy i dont really have much advice on how to find a corp to join though having never gone through that process myself sorryi dont like highsec by the way its a terrible place to play eve and has terrible mechanics i only visit it when i need a market hub
i noticed recently that carriers and fax ships have exactly the same suggested skills for mastery levels so the fax needs skills in fighters and remote repstriage likewise the regular carriers however given that a fax cannot use fighters and a carrier cannot do remote reps or triage is it not sensible to split this mastery off i know exactly what has happened here they have taken the pre citadel mastery and just copied it to the new fax ships instead of splitting the old mastery in half between the two ship classes to take account of new roles
honestly who cares about the mastery system apart from ocdites
i would like to propose a feature much like overview settings that apply to chat tabsthe purpose of which would to put them in a defined order keep them in that order between log off and log on and then be able to colorcode said tabsit would be a nice thing and i think a lot of people would enjoy it and benefit from iti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
lately with these new updates and patches nothing interesting got out of them  so i was thinking if we could have to option to replace those station ads with a hd adult stream for those of us that are 18 
i second this idea
awesome idea
while im not as against this as the judge was following the current ships in the game it would most likely have a reduced cargohold from a bowhead if you look at jump freighters vs regular ones the jump freighters sacrifice a significant amount of cargo for their mobility that being said if this ship existed its ship moving capability would most likely be a little over two battleships since the current bowhead is about 3 battleships i doubt many people would utilize the ship as that cargo is barely more than what current carriers fax dreads can already move
10
until the fax came along carriers were the faxs the mastery is just a remnant of that to reiterate what was posted though mastery really doesnt gain you anything just sorta a guide
personally im 100 lawful hisec but i do agree aside from the presence of concord and national security forces pirate nullsec regions should be just as liveable as their hisec equivalentspirate lp stores should be the main source for pirate faction equipment and bpcs as playercreated items rather than loot drops from npcs

one problem which eve has in my opinion is that the reality often fails to live up to the hype especially for players who are attracted by stories of epic space battles and instead end up running level 12 missions for 6 weeks and then never returnive been fortunate enough to have an eve career in corporations and alliances which are at a level where ive been able to take part in 1000man battles and both capital and supercapital gameplay many players for whatever reason will never progress this far and thus never really be able to take part in these experiences i personally believe that this is especially damaging for new players as once the beauty and thrill of flying a spaceship wears off the reality of hitting a few buttons in the minimalinteraction activities of mining and mission running quickly burns one outwhy couldnt there be new epic arcs introduced where players could have a completely pve experience where they could use a titan bridge fight with allies and take on an enemy fleet wouldnt having the option of helping the caldari navy fight off a group of guristas capital ships be a meaningful experience that would seem especially epic for many people who want to experience the thrill of epic space battlesi dont participate in pve content all that much mostly because its more of a grinding experience than anything however i remember when i first started eve once the initial thrill wore off that i was left with a feeling of is this it with pcu numbers hovering around the 20k mark i think it might be time to think of reinvigorating the pve experience or at least providing around 3040 hours of engaging new content
all i heard was profitdeletetheweak
playing eve in highsec when wardeced is not easy or funny no matter how good the ceo is especialy if your corp is made of mostly new players with low skills like me to take on an aggressive counter against the wardeccers you need some capacities regardless how skilled or brave your ceo is it just dont cut it with a handfull of newbies some of you have listed some options i thank you for that as those advice have been most helpfulli have realized one thing during this boring time of wardecs eve is about pvp and not about hanging around in mining barges to make som isks i guess many of you experienced players laugh a little about this but here is my thought when i came into eve the very first time end of may 2016 i had absolutely no idea what to do and how to do it not unlike thousands of others i guesswhen you get your hands on a venture and understand how to use it a bit of the new world opens up then mining is what you want to do for a while at the same time you finish the career agents and by the time gain some good insight however those contain no word about pvp then you do som lvl1 missions and shoot some rats wow cool i can do itthen you do that for a while and you mine and then you get contacted by a recruiter who asks a lot of questions and before you know it you are in a coorporation well that is cool eve is a mmo then the wardec came up most of us are new a minority is experienced it was kind of a steep curve to suddenly get wardeced and be forced to do pvp well i got shot but didnt shoot any i have barely gotten into how to shoot rats the road of learning the hard way steep learning curves might be the second thing i have realized in eve during this summer i guess there will be some people just quiting the game because they find it too hard  unplayable for my part there has been some developments that might be a good road to learn some moremy killboard still isnt much to brag about but i guess there will be some greens in between the reds by the time  fly safe
seriously  ive been here since 06 the majority of my accounts 18 expire towards the latter part of this year i do not see my renewing the majority of them unless ccp surprises me which i doubt eve is changing and ccp is only listening to the power blocks that plague the influence of the csm barbie dolls in space oh look i have a monocle blah blah blahi begged pleaded and got on my knees with ccp years back to not develop the csm as it would negatively impact the game imo it has done exactly that for many years now too many imbedded vets everyone pays a monthly sub for each account they could have simply placed a voting forum for changes ccp plans then let the paying players vote not some group of puppets supposedly representing everyones interest called the csmback to the real game playi ventured into losec and nullsec on my own and expected to have my arse handed to me on a platter it usually happened yet i also lucked up and returned the favor sometimestoday the visceral attitude towards anyone who plays this game for any other reason than pvp is right down hostile especially towards the players who wish to remain in hisecccp has allowed this harassment to continue with impunity something is wrong when you can take 4 t1 fitted catalysts and 1 or 2 shot a 300m isk ship the ones doing this couldnt 1v1 you if their lives depended on it but they can cowardly go out and take your 300m isk ship out with a few million isk and 3 more cowards yet they call it emergent playpvp in lo sec is stale wo much variety anymorenullsec pvp is dead currently null is nothing but an isk printing machine for the for mentioned power blocks youd be more safe doing a mining session in null than you would in hisec the flip side you have a better chance pvpn in hisec than you would in nullfact most of my mining sessions are in a rorqual usually in a few dead systems owned by alliances whom im not associated with people just fly right on through no attack nothing when my alts have filled my hold with abcs i pack up and cyno homei have alts in a few corps located various parts of eve from null null npc losec and hisec no wormholes though i resided in one a while back for about a yearas my accounts continue to expire i look outside my window trying to come up with a hobby that will replace eve thinking of taking disc golf back up or maybe start a new apiary simply build some rc airplanes to bring back my days of youthgood luck with your gameplay
well that is not the truth some of the wardeccers might wait but others will pay a  small fee to a freakin agent to get the system and station where youre in it happened to me we stayed the hole universe away from our enemies why we are enemies to them are not so clear to me still they hunted us down and gatecamped us boomand about staying in a npc corp eve is a mmo it makes no sense to stay in a npc for years
one of your loss mails was in niarja so no you did not stay off the pipes between hubs niarja is particularly bad in that you have to go through it to go from dodixie to amarr and jita to amarr the other onebad luck learn to watch localalthoughyou didnt accept somebody new to your buddy list did you
since starting up in eve ive been in more than one corporation that has been ruined due to pvp corporations looking for easy targets so my idea is could corporations that enjoy the basics of eve for example mining and industry etc be allowed to purchase concorde protection much like we do renting a station but wed pay a monthly sum to concord that would stop pvp corps war deccing those players that are here just to enjoy the game obviously there would have to be restrictions would only work in high sec as other corps would abuse this i believe alot more players would return to eve knowing they can enjoy this game without fear of been war decd as alot of great corp communitys are ripped apart as a result of war decs
the question is how would you make the difference between a normal corp and an industrial and mining corp 2 words you cantthus youll have abuse of this system almost every corp even larger and largest while abuse of this to be untouchable in high sec there is an easy solution for industrial and miners  mine somewhere where there are few people in local dont afk while mining keep an eye on local and warp off if someone war target enters in the system use an alt out of corp to haul your stuffsolution2 pay for surrender yeah looks like living in nulsec right  not that far and thats how eve works i agree some people may suffer from war especially new players in corps but being a carebear  giving miners and indus an unfair advantage against others is not fair and shouldnt be done1 for your ideaesipy  python 27  33 swagger client based on pyswagger for esi
how is game mechanics that allow a players to grief a miner by bumping said miner to infinity fairhow is game mechanics that allow 4 t1 fitted destroyers to blow up a mining ship supposedly built for the rigors of deep space fairsigned care bear at least i was accused earlier of being one in another thread
griefing isnt allowed in eve so bumping a miner who refuses to comply with the code isnt by definition griefing the miner has options he can leave he can log off he can buy a permit he can get a friend to come gank the bumper he can get a webbing alt to come and get him into alignment faster there see no infinite bumping of miners four players working together killing one player that not only sounds fair it seems like good tactics versus bad why was the mining ship there to be attacked in the first place when gankers are around sounds like he wasnt paying attention maybe even afk four players killing the ship of 0 actual players seems even more acceptable the miner should have been playing and watching local and dscan not doing the laundry the people cry for justice but if you really want to hear them scream give it to them by choosing to mine in new order systems highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct wwwminerbumpingcom
as for the op your corporation was ruined by the inability of your leadership to organize defensive actions and the unwillingness of its members to risk ships and isk to defend themselves in short the corporation had no reason to exist in eve as it was unable to protect what it had one of the basic rules of eve is you only own what you keep others from taking i know from experience that there are the rare few mining corps who will defend themselves and who can at least justify their existence the others mainly exist to exploit new players for the benefit of the ceos who in every other respect are incompetent bumblers being bad at eve is no excuse to ruin it for the rest of us by choosing to mine in new order systems highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct wwwminerbumpingcom
keep up with that line of idiotic nonsense and you will continue to see subscriptions to eve diminishcheersyeah i know you gonna say good riddance to the ones who dont renew because they added nothing to the game i do know one thing they added to the game the subscription money paying ccps bills
so that there is more time for player actions to determine the outcome what exactly is the outcome you expect ganking a freighter if concord responded even slower do you expect the freighter to engage you with its thrusters a hulk engage your fleet with 5 drones an interon v engage you with its 2 hislotsi mean really what kind of engagement are you expecting from a industrial shipspvp much or do you just set at hisec gates with 3 million isk t1 ships popping 8 billion isk freighters while complaining on forums about risk adverse players
first off they are 8 million isk ships and second if you stopped over loading your mother fecking freighter this would not be an issuered frog freight shows what can happen if you are prudent youll lose your freighter every 10000 jumps assuming the average trip is 50 jumps there and back we are talking 1 freighter loss for every 200 trips if you use your freighter 1x ever 2 days youll lose a freighter 1 time every 400 days and that is the average it could be far far lessand ffs it is averserisk averse not risk adverseand ffs stop using risk aversion as if it were a bad thing we are all risk averse and seek to minimize the possibility of losseditseriously if you put 8 billion in a freighter you are just begging to get ganked in this game the expected drop is 4 billion 4 billion pays for 500 good damn catalysts 500 if you put 8 billion in your freighter you can pretty much expect to be ganked in short order you might get away with it a few times but one you are seen with that kind of cargo thats it you are going to get gankedthis is what i call being imprudent irl it would be like taking your 401k and putting it all in 1 stockand then when that stock goes  up you sit there and talk about how unfair it all is while it was your own greed and imprudence that lead you to the horrible situation you are instop being imprudent and youll have very little to fear from gankers put no more than 800 million in your freighter to be really safe limit it to 750 million put a tank on your freighter so that it takes more ships to gank youie make it more expensive use a scout if you see lots of hostiles in system dock up and wait use the standings function to set various ganking groups red so you can spot them in local more easily if you really need to move through use a webber but note that is putting you at increased riskother alternatives1 if you are moving small volumehigh value items look into a blockade runner one of the fastest ships in game in terms of alignwarp speed and it can fit a covert ops cloak so you can warp cloaked making you nearly impossible to catch in hs2 if you use a blockade runner use insta dock and insta warp book marks3 use a jump freighter if you can afford one jump over gank spots vs running through themstop blaming everyone else if you behave imprudently learn from your mistakes and move onand yes i have actually lost a jf so spare me this crap i dont know what im talking aboutor just gtfoedit ii and no i am not telling people how to play i am giving my own view on how to play you want to stuff your freighter with 8 billion isk worth of goodieswell go for it but do not come here and complain or i will point out what a god damn mother fecking idiot you were for doing such stupid fecking thing butby all means be as stupid as you want to bebut realize the nature of this game is that if you are imprudent there are players who will show you exactly how imprudent you were
absolutely correct it does not guarantee safety it guarantees a certain group of people with millions of skill points and years of knowledge about eve mechanics come into hisec space take advantage of the less informed player with far less experience and far less skill points i can afford to replace my losses easilyyup sure can any time you can take 4 3 million isk destroyers to pop a 300 million isk ship oh yeah i can afford to do that all day long too well until there are no more newbs to take advantage of and the servers are closed cause no one is renewing subscriptions to help pay the bills yup excellent plan
you do understand the irony of what you are pointing out righta couple of characters that are probably alts with probably only a few million skillpoints in 12 million isk ships cheap by most standards attacking another player and netting some profit out of itthat sounds like the most newbie friendly thing everit shows you do not need tens or hundreds of millions of skillpoints to achieve somethingit shows you do not need hundreds of millions or even billions of isk to achieve somethingit shows that you take the time to figure out how to work the system you can overcome obstaclesas for the rest of itonly ccp can define what is and is not harassment and they take it on a casebycase basiswhat do you suggest thenand dont say something along the lines of something of less value should not be a threat to something of higher valueeve was based on the idea that even a small worthless ship can be a threat to something bigger and more expensiveand the reason for this is because the idea of something not being threatened by anything of lesser value works more in favor of older richer players see it isnt newbie friendlyi think you are missing the point many points in factthey are not interested in a 1v1 they are not interested in your sense of honor they are not interested in what you think they should or should not be able to dothey are interested in the simple act of blowing someone up and grabbing what loot they can that is fun to them that is the point to themas for the value aspect itselfa cargo ship worth 5 million isk that carrying 300 million isk worth of goods is still a 5 million isk cargo shipcargo value has nothing to do with ships capabilities this is why many people say choose the right tool for the right jobhell even if a 10 million isk cruiser is fitted with 1 billion isk worth in enhanced mods yes yes hyperbole but i am using it as an example it is still a 10 million isk cruiser at its coreit may fly 10 faster do 15 more damage tank 50 more damage but it cannot escape the fact that it is still a relatively cheap cruiser with clear limits on what it can and cannot do
shahfluffershow is being able to take 4 destroyers t1 fitted taking out a hull that supposedly was built for the rigors of deep space mining right how is what im referring to possibly be considered irony im referring to hulksmacks not something like an interon v i understand your point if i were talking about a hauler i myself while using haulers have alts for a front and rear scout on valuable moves i understand all that i also understand the hypervigilance needed in hisec mining i personally have not lost but one hulk in all my mining and that is because i dropped drones and miscalculated the timing of them engaging me and was concorded yes the whole system had a good laugh so did iim referring to the ability to knock out a 300m isk ship with a few throw away alts in t1 destroyers i personally mine in every section of eve with the exception of wormholes and i see far more aggression against hisec miners than anywhere unfortunately the ones code and the like prey on are the newbs who havent dried behind their ears yet to me that affects the game negatively because i feel we lose valuable income from monthly subs if the player loses a ship every time heshe turns around simply cause some lowskilled alts of players with years of knowledge on game mechanics in eve decides to pick on someone who cant fight back thats just cowardly regardless of what another said about what ccp believes is or is not harassment id find it hard to believe if this were a real life situation and one person consistently showed up in the belt to bump one particular person 90 of the time he undocks is nothing but unadulterated harassment not a big deal with me as i have quite a few locations to mine jump clones several mining alts various locations that i simply clone jump or log on to do as i wishmy focus is on the new comers that dont have the luxury i and many others who grinded through and maintain and army of alts their options are limited join a corporation so they can be wardecd until they quit join a corp to cannon fodder there are a few corps who actually take care of the newbs however a large number only want a tax number and oreice purchases at or below 10 jita price which we all know is a riphowever the constant direct and purposeful pursuit to make new comers life a living hell in this game is beyond vulgar its down right unfair to the new comer as they have no way to offset this aggression other than dock and log how long do you think that new player will stay in a game where heshe can only look at hisship in dockwhat do i suggest excellent question hmm unfortunately it will never happen quit preying on the weak newb miner and instead of killing soft targets try a challenge and go after someone with equal or close to skills reason why lo and null secs are dying everyone is up in hisec taking the easy targets because they are too lazy or too cowardly to fight someone who might actually kick the living crap out of them bring your ballsi mean really for each new player chased from eve is a loss for us all yeah the player who was able to make the other rage quit well hes a winner but also a loser as we all are because its one less subscription helping to pay the bills ccp have to keep this game goingdont think im missing any points tbh i do think many are missing the fact that as they continue this onslaught of newbs and industrialists in hisec is having negative affects on the game and why you see so many posts about it i dont care really for the statistics i keep seeing linked and the excuse people are moving on or summer vacation etc people are leaving and replacements are here long enough to read forum posts and personally experience the concentrated effort against certain game play then they move on to another gamehope i was clear and hope the wall of text doesnt hurt your eyeso
nothing can be bumped to infinity anymore since ccp introduced a 4min max to warp not sure about the time but you get the ideawhats wrong about your t1 destroyers  its game mechnics to be able to shot whatever you want but suffering the consequences ok theyll kill some retriever or whatever you are using then theyll die from concord works as expectedyou dont want to be easily ganked  then use a skiff with tankremember ccp idiome  risk vs reward thats it take a hulk get plenty of isk but youll get easily ganked or take a skiff tank really more with a lesser yield you just forget one important thing  space is not safe and never will high sec is only safer you are not the only one whos gonna be ganked even haulers even missionners even incursionners will be ganked the latter with far more expensive ship than your shiny mining barges but the only 2 who cry are miners and haulers because they dont want to assume the risks of what they half do half in a way that those 2 activities are more than often done while half afk its part of the game and its not going to change and i hope ccp is not stupid enough to change it so if you dont wanna lose your ship stay docked  esipy  python 27  33 swagger client based on pyswagger for esi
adverseaverse potatopatoto  look up the meaning before going off the deep end sucking and huffing and puffing please relaxi failed to mention i was speaking just the hull of a jf which usually run close to 78b last time i looked not contentsas for it being 3 million or 8 million per ganking ship still peanuts compared to the loss of a jf compared to the losses of ganking parties arent you special you lost a jf proud of you now try to hang on to that temperjust gtfo lol at this one because apparently from looking at the player numbers at this point that is exactly what people are doing
since you mentioned looking up the meaningaversevU02D0sadjectiveadjective averse having a strong dislike of or opposition to something as a former cia director he is not averse to secrecyadverseadvU02D0sadjectiveadjective adverse preventing success or development harmful unfavourable taxes are having an adverse effect on productionso risk averse is the correct usage and that took me all of ten seconds on google to find outas for your jf comments you do realise that when used correctly a jf is almost impossible to gank right there are only two windows of opportunity to gank a jf as it undocks prior to jumping and if it bumps off a badly placed cyno and both of them rely on the jf pilot being stupid enough to let his ship become vulnerable as was pointed out above you also ignored the ability of blockade runners to almost effortlessly evade gank squads when used correctly are you spotting the theme in what people are saying yet using the right ships in the right way vastly reduces the risks of gatting ganked and its not like the information is hard to find again i did one google search that took less than ten seconds to type and i got youtube guides mittanicom articles blog entries and multiple forum posts all offering advice on the subjectbasically youre wrong teckos is right stop being an arrogant dumbass and actually think about what youre saying for a second
translation  i hate facts think reality should conform to my expectations and evidence that challenges my worldview totally doesnt count because reasons
youre right and i was wrong about the averseadverse thanks for bashing my head in and calling me names unwarranted but thanks simply shows the toxicity towards playersgame still has problems and the inability to speak with people without hostilities and name calling will get it fix awesome
try not being arrogant and dismissive to everybody you talk to and maybe people wont be so mean to you i also cant help noticing you failed to address any of my other points might want to get on that
awesome for red frog and what a great example of one of the larger groups of players in eve who are risk averse when you brag about such shining examples of the very thing you say is hurting the game well what can i say if red frog wants to run a haulingtransportation corporation then they need to put their npc hauling alts in said corporation and play with the rest of us my point exactly  you make another awesome point here whos taking all the risk a broken system that allows a group of people with throw away alts to take advantage of an already vulnerable target with little to no consequence to themselves short of losing a t1 fitted t1 ship and sec status which means nothing thanks for pointing out the disproportionate advantagesdisadvantagesbtw  a 4 billion isk drop would buy a little under 3000 catalysts but im being trivial just to be trivial however had i posted this inaccuracy there would have been myriad of posts about how out of touch i am with eve from the little corner of gankers wishing to perpetuate the extinction of any form of resource gathering short of going to null power blocks and mine for them the reasons are simple to derail conversations about subjects that force certain playstyle upon others who wish to play differentlyimprudence isnt the problem here its the disproportionate risk to loss ratio in favor of the gankerhaving lost one yourself makes you an expert got itbtw  very familiar with the use of blockade runners as well as im with players wanting them nerfed because they arent easy enough to gank with minimal effort and cost really rich quote here i like itthe gtfo comment well that is exactly what is happening dismiss it as summer break people moving on other games etcim sure those reasons are partly to blame imo it doesnt come close to the root problem in an attempt to avoid anymore name calling and chest beating  i will keep that opinion close chested as it is already apparent within my posts
errr sandy you might want to try quoting things i actually said when you try and argue with me unless you just messed up the formatting and were talking to teckos in which case thanks for proving my previous point perfectly
thanks and fixed
translation to yours i didnt read past the first paragraph because i dont agree with your preferred game play or posts therefore your responses are invalid got it thanks
oh i read it all i just didnt see anything i havent been hearing for years already stop acting like any of your ideas are a new thing because they arent theyre the same things that have been coming from posters opposed to ganking since this argument first started over a decade ago ill even list them for you just to be clear oh think of the newbies  numbers are unfair if this was real life  i dont care what ccp says why dont you fight people that shoot back gankers are killing the gamenone of these things were true back then and they still arent true now as for your statistics comments i believe the drop in numbers is far more likely to be attributable to changes in mmo culture and how people choose to play games rather than this one specific thing dont forget eve is 13 years old by now and general attitudes change over time its a hardcore time dependent game that takes a lot of effort to learn and requires embracing a certain mindset to enjoy and general gaming culture is simply moving away from games like that at the moment
greetings capsuleersplease enjoy this brief summary of the current csm lead projects being run in lead up to the fall summit this summary doesnt include anything covered by nda or any projects started by ccp themselves that the csm have beenare involved in so please manage expectations accordinglynullsec content creators focus groupcomprised of primarily nullsec fcs and alliance leaders spearheaded by the judge and jintaan the nullsec content creators focus group is designed to bring as many high level nullsec personalities together to focus on one common goal pinpointing the core barriers to gameplay currently experienced in null security space and to further condense these opinions for the csm to use as points of reference at the fall summit at ccps hq in reykjavik at present there are at least 20 different players from all over eve who have expressed their interest in being involved in this focus group with the possibility for that number to grow as the weeks go on in the lead up to the fall summit csm members will be moderating this focus group but wont be actively participating in the discussion themselves to prevent any tainting of opinionswormholers town hallspearheaded by noobman and moderated by bobmon gorski car sullen decimus the judge and the directors at hard knocks inc the csm ran a town hall focused completely on wormholes this is just one of many csm initiatives to help members of csm xi focus a clear and concise message to bring ccp at the fall summit in iceland this town hall took place on august 13th 2016 at 1900UFFFD2100 eve time giving players roughly 2 hours to present their ideas and concerns to the csm members in attendance we expected a strong turnout for this town hall seeing as wormholers have a strong identity and camaraderie when it comes to their space homes and we werent disappointed with over 130 people turning up to participate depending on the success of the wormhole town hall overall it is possible that the csm could form a small wormhole roundtable to continue the discussion from the town hall with the aims of further pinpointing the feelings of the wormhole community as a wholeindustrial roundtableprimarily focused on the upcoming capital industrial rebalance and expanding into mining and barges as a whole this roundtable is still in the planning and invite stages if you think you might have something to offer for this roundtable please contact either jintaan or sullen decimushisec ganking roundtablethis roundtable is aimed at looking at the mechanics of ganking and how recent changes have impacted players and how the future bumping change will affect them the primary goal is to give the csm an understanding of what gankers do why they do it and how ccp might look to change ganking in the futurecsm quarterly reviewin continuing the weekly summaries style the csm will be releasing their quarterly review bringing together each members personal opinions of their experiences so far this term this review will be released through the major eve news gateways en24 cz tmc as well as reddit the planned release date is august 19th 2016a big shout out to ccp seagull ccp guard ccp logibro the o7 show and ccp as a whole for being steadfast supporters of the csm
just a little addendum for those reading this is both not all of the playercsm interaction were doing to prepare for the summit being limited to the larger group sessions were doing discounting the many 1on1 discussions were seeking out and of those group sessions only those which have been actively kicked off we have a lot more planned to get underway and im sure even more slowly brewing in the back of our heads i know sullens been doing some excellent work curating a little things sheet hyde has been amassing what basically amounts to a full run down of pretty much every module ship ammo type and mechanic in the game to write down his balancing assesment of it bobmon  nashh have been hard at work finding out what can be done to help event organiser and ccp communication and of course all of us have been taking part in the collaborative effort that is working with ccp when they ask our input as well as proactively giving input on things that are on ccps roadmap personally im looking to set up a few more roundtables if the currently planned ones turn out well specifically on things like incursions and industrythank you all for your support however i am glad ive been able to take part in the csm and look forwards to representing the interests of the playerbase in this upcoming summit 
just ask endie  he spent a year working on that very subject with impressive results
any possibility to participate hisec gank roundtable
guests have already been sorted for it would be happy to do a second one to get the antiganker view on the matter at some point however just dont know how to get in contact with them 
i would also like to point out that none of these scheduled groups or town halls precludes you from individually or collectively contacting us with your ideas or opinions we are all available throughout our term to hear from you on any topic confirming that this is my main personal project going into the summit if you have a balance issue its very likely i have it down already but if you feel strongly about an issue and want to reiterate your perspective on it to me please send melink me your docwriteup numbers and justifications preferred over mere opinions thanks
thank you for the csm update is anyone on the csm is looking at lowsec and fw i cant seem to find any recent mentions of changes to lowsec and fw is this on the radar for ccp or the csm o
gorski carr is our resident lowsec expert and yes hes asked for a meeting on fw with ccp 
ganker invite onlywhat a pityhope eve hasnt become too difficult and hard for high sec career criminalswhat would i ever do if they all up and rage quitif you really are lost in the wilderness on how to contact an antigankerjust drop me a linei might know one  or two  extremely experienced people on the matter
it might shock you to learn that theyre not willing to talk about certain things in the presence of the people dedicated to countering their profession hence why i intend to do an opposing roundtable also stops things from getting heated between the two parties or arguing back and forth over what is fair which doesnt actually achieve anythingplus that community did reach out to me first id have happily hosted the antiganker community first if theyd have contacted me id like to hear about the issues that face your community and how ccp could make your playstyle fit better in with the game mechanically note that i specifically ask for problems and not solutions though as this leads to something that ccp can better use in their future development saying x solution makes our lives easier is a lot harder to implement than y is wrong with the current system is there anything we can do to solve it as they understand the coding already in place and how best to work with that 

do you think eve needs a moratorium on introduction of new ships at least for a while i think ccp are adding those too fast and even i an experienced and active player cannot wrap my head around the changes at this pace while newer and casual players have even more difficulties
industry is a big deal in eve and a lot of people were very happy to meet crius and what was considered a longawaited first step of its revamp unfortunately we found out it was the final step furthermore one of its pivotal features  teams  was later dismissedi would be glad to participate in discussions on this topic but i dont think there is enough consensus in the community at the moment to start a successful roundtable right away
you keep using the term risk averse as if it were some sort of slur and actually not a virtue it suggests you are completely ignorant of the concept what it means is you seek ways to reduce your risk you want to avoid the downside to itit is not risk aversion that is hurting the game nowhere have i ever complained about anyone being risk averse in fact i have defended people being risk averse because it makes the game more interesting not lessbtw you are so foolish you fail to realize that this supposed slur risk aversion it applies to you toothe person taking all the risk is the stupid freighter pilotUFFFDand he does not have tooa catalyst for ganking a freighter will cost 8 million 8 goes into 4000 500 times hence 500 catalysts typically gank catalysts fit t2 guns uses t2 damage mods t2 ammo and also rigs iirc if those are t2 alsothen donUFFFDt take the risk overloading your freighter is something you do not anyone else if you donUFFFDt like that risk stop taking the risky actionsno iUFFFDm saying i did something dumb but iUFFFDm not here bellyaching about it i looked at what happened figured out where i went wrong and found a better way to avoid that kind of problem in the future
btw the guy loading up his charon with 8 billion isk worth of cargo is risk seeking why is he complaining when the bad things happen he was seeking it ffs
14 years in and people are still saying this
well i think if you go around continually killing the same person in high sec it is considered grieging and therefore a banable offense high sec ganking when i spent my high sec days mining i never saw these code peoples i saw the marmites en route selling my mins but yeahhowever risk vs reward you make less isk mining in any sec space than you do doing equivalent missions  anomalies in the space for the risk its currently a negative reward unless at the cost of full mining boosts 
was this an invite only group or based on a csm member selection process i know some nullsec fcs that would be very interested in this and could bring some good insight
the biggest bug in w space is the core citadel not spawning the correct amount of battleships it should be 8 and not 2hence the reduced payouti enjoy livng in w space as no two days are the say one day connected to hard knocks and then anohter connected to tdsin if your really unlucky rolling into the same hole after rolling your static 3 timesbut hey thtas w space for you you can never predict it null sec is mundanei prefer the old fashioned dominion sov to this entosis crap
thank you for your insight and maturity in your assessment it is likely that ill do a general pve townhall pre this summit it might be useful to do a postsummit industry one as theres a good chance well be in a better shape to understand what ccps plans will be with regards to industry and shape our questions accordingly
war mechanics in empire are edthis needs discussing
so just to point outif you want to work on player retention then you have to look at that 85 who quit having done no pvp as ccp saidwe need more conflict not less this means a reversal of the nerfs to combat over the last few years and injecting more danger back into the game
hey all just checked this out after ccp seagull mentioned it on last nights o7 show hope its the right place etc etci have been thinking a lot about the ongoing division between play styles lately read a few old and resent posts on the old high sec vs ganking topic and thought i would try and offer another opinion to the muddled soup already out therewhats clearly needed is a small compromise from all sides ccp cant do sht until the involved parties agree on somethingwhen ccp gets new players into eve we need to give them a place to get comfortable with the ui navigating and shooting sht so they stay and then let them head in the right direction for a play style they made a informed decision onhigh sec ganking can not be removed it would make eve bllocks but here is also where the biggest compromise is requiredsofor the newbro 10 to 08 this high security space should be just that highly secure space it makes no sense to new players that they can get blown to sht for no reason in high sec just as easily as in all the other lower security systems there is no real difference other than the attacker looses the cheap ass ship afterwards what i am suggesting is security in high sec isnt granted fully at first but earned or lost through in game choicesplayers with a security status 10 or lower should have restricted entry and be bared from docking in or clone jumping to npc stations if you want to roll a new character to gank with and load it up with skill injectors great so be it thats cash for ccp and the ingame economy but as soon as the security status for that character hits 10 concord finds you blows up your ship and moves your pod stored high sec clones high sec assets and home station if set to a npc one to the nearest npc station in the nearest low sec system if you persistently break the law within 10 to 08 systems then the message is simplefck offlow null and wh life is harsh and unforgiving thats what eve is so high sec consequences should be the samegankers need to man up on this stop flogging a dead horse and think about the bigger picture enough tears and winging you would loose access to the 3 highest tier security systems unless you have a war dec on a player corp based in one these systems already have reduced bountiesmission payouts high taxesindex costs disincentivizing poco fees and are primarily filled with learning newbros and casual or more peaceful players anyway they play the game too and contribute to the system in their own way its high time this was just acceptedcitadels should still be anchorable of course and player corp holdings and assets need to be attackable so either concord needs to alow players with a low security rating entry providing they have a active war on a player corp based in high sec in this scenario should a player with a security rating of 10 or lower attack anyone other than players in player corps they have active war decs with they get removed as above and banned from the system for say 48 or 72 hours or player corps would have to loose access to anchoring in 10  08 systems i can only see the former idea working the later would be horrific for the player corps already bedded into these systemsfor the ganker  the bear 10 to 05 to counter balance the above i would suggest having two separate timers to concord response times the first the standard timer with a longer response time than at present giving the ganker more time in effect to do the gank before concord show upthe second timer would relate to the victim and what there standing is with a the empire that owns the space b the navy that protects that space so theoretically if the victim was in a 05 sec or above amarrian system and had 100 standing with the amarr navy andor amarr empire the response time would be shortened to the point that a gank would be futilethis also adds a point to standings again and would make the high sec carebear have to earn their respitenow im sure ccp are aware of this idea and its nothing new i suspect it would be hard if not impossible to implement so perhaps as the standing would relate directly to them a new faction type police npc could fill this roll it could use the new ai ccp are playing with and the current concord response timer could just be extended somewhatthoughts do try and abstain from the usual finger vomit these posts attract we of eve are a relatively small community all sides need to show a bit of respect for opposing views and play styles so we can get on with supporting ccp new players and playing eveo7
actually thats not truei mine daily and i make more than people who rat do ofcourse there are different kinds of income if i compare my income versus cruisers  its greaterbattleshipsmarauders  its somewhat equalcarriers  i fall short but then again i fly ships worth 200mil while those rattingplexing in battleshipscarriers not plexing get more iskhr by having more tank and higher firepower but risk more isk if they get dropped by blopscapsnot sure where ive seen it but apparently only 15 of the pvp action happens outside of highsec space so why dont you whiney miners just either stop with your afk activities andor move to nullsec
so basically you dont participate in pve events but are making a suggestion on how pve should be structuredright the problem with eve experience is that 99 of the people still live in npc space without actually seeing more than 13 of the universe they get bored and leavebut you could always show people how its like with your supercapital forces im sure pandemic legion could offer new players exactly the experience youre describing bridging with titans and what not
they were already discussed by the previous csm  ccp according to the available public records tldr  they dont have a clue apparently people having clues just dont trust the seals clubbers of the csm
i have simple proposal give us 2 tokens per year which would enable us to have professional and instant help chat with the ccp support officer over the certain in game issue we have at the time in eve majority of support is provided with help chat channels monitored and maintained only by other capsuleers and therefore it lacks professionalism and is a place you can get lots of trolling even from mods which are in fact only other players giving a support for fun or other reasons which may be honorable but as well may not be from my experience its all good and you will most often get help you needbut there are cases you cant get help or you cant get it when you need it as it is only a public chat channel in such cases you are only left with eve support ticket system form my experience that ticket system is far from perfect and response time is least to say horrible in average i have waited 5 days and more for ticket to receive first replay but i am sure there is a statistic that will show i am wrong here i know that on trial account i was receiving instant help with tickets but it all changed dramatically afterwords now i am convinced that most of us where in a position when 5 hours would feel too long to wait and 5 days are enough to make you wish to quit the game my proposal is about that situation which i am pretty sure does not happen very often i know that for my 4 year experience with eve i was only twice in such situation
and how would the game know you really are 18 and permissable for viewing hd adult content
last wreck i left in that plex in gaoth lasted about 1hour 30 minutes before it vanished off of dscan
i have tactical shield manipulation to 5 and i see no difference than when i had it at 4never been quite clear on what the skill description actually says
i reposted this in a better format i thought i had lost this should i earse thisi posted this in another thread i thought i had lost this i did it better in another thread should i earse thisi cant find a suggestion box so can you pass this onto whome ever it nees to be sent to can you tell me whom to contact in the futuresuggestion my character to build a deicated container for blueprints a small standar container is just too big i propose that mundi creats 2 boxes 1m3  10m3 size line them with something that is highly resistant to scan and make them secuure audit logs they should be no way in hell be anchorable unless you can anchor in a cargo holdmy tooncharacter is a researcher and inventormanfactor so he has the required skills it may be as easy as cutting down the containers we have now this has to be approved and coded i know i am asking alot but i think alot of our players would like this very muchthanks to the gm that pointed this fourom out to me
i think eve is losing pilots more due to other factors then the high sec violence main reason in my opinion is due to wrong approach to the player community in general and a player as a person for example we have the great fun fest but poor and unprofessional in game support as fun fest is a way of marketing and support is not its enough that they say they dont want to spoil you but in fact they don t want to spend money on it its better that it goes in to the marketing same approach led in to many other ingame changes which resulted in lose of great ingame spirit eve had years back
how can one know about these events in advance for example how was the wormhole town hall announced
hello oi have been playing eve just over a year now all of it basically fighting for the gallente militia  its great funcan we please adjust sec status hits for shooting neutrals inside fw complexes no one has any business being in a plex if you are not defending it or attacking if i am defending my novice and i see a tuskers pilot in a dramiel sliding in i am certainly going to shoot first because they are not there for the company and i am going to need every advantage i can get the security status protection inside plex should only extend to pilots engaged in fwthankspete o7
personally id ban anyone still in the newbie npc corporations from making wild and inadequate suggestions on the forums go join a player corporation do incursions or missions factional pvp or wormholes then make some comments
the wormhole town hall was first announced by noobman on 20160729 two weeks before the town hall itself on the wormhole section of the eveo forums link
actually majority of support is handled by tickets outside of the game
this is an excerpt from a correspondence with a gm and they said that the forums might appreciate such a thought and if there is public support to such a backing i chose this forum instead of the players ideas because i think that this would make a great csm represented idea over a player onecustomer support past present and futureagain this was simply a rough idea i had as i read the devblog and wished to air it further
actually faction warfare space should be free for all as far as sec stats drops go you should still get shot by gatestation guns but there shouldnt really be any security status hits when you are defending your space or attacking someone elses by that matter or just restrict it to no sec status hits inside fw plexes
another suggestion i have ice mined and after a while it looks like a snow field is that ice going to waste what if we create something like a slavager that collects all that excess ice chips in space good god i bet you could fill an entire ore holdjust a thoughtmundi
there is a problem with the code not honoring your own terms with the permit aspect is griefing bumping after being asked to stop is griefing
those that arent in fw shouldnt have access to the areas of fw the plexs camping the ag to one is fine it would be no difference in camping a stargate within the systemthey should however be granted access if they are in a fleet that has insert number of pilots that are in fw and are on the same sidefor example since i am on the gallente side of fw anyone in my fleet would become a temporary target to my enemycaldariamarr fw pilots while also suffer a consquence if they shot at me or other allies that are in alliance with me while in the fleetother gallenteminmatar fw pilots that are in the fleet
neither of those statements are true
i am all for legalize it all the way in high sec dont half arse it tax it grant premites for a isk feei got a side issue as worm holes are not hi sec then can the manufactoring of drugs allowed in wh including the use of items that are normally restricted to low sec will the recation and silo work in wh
im pretty sure you already canits not restricted to lowsec its restricted to security levels below 05 so lowsec nullsec whas for why you cant do it in highsec i like differences between the sec levels i dont want to add new restrictions to things which already exist but im not for removing them
if this should bwe asked somewhere else please contact me and tell me where i should transfere it tother are certain equipement that can only be used in low sec would this equipent be used in worm hole space it isnt hi sec or low sec i think it should be allowed but if it is is there code in the game allowing it or will it have to be aproved by ccp and coded for game play
i think of the main idea of a new class an idustiral capital ship with the suggested portals and ect is fantastic i also like the nomadic use of it the extended role of a rorqual is also excellant i would like to see this idea talked about more and the council to seriously look at it
out of chachter notesreal life comments this isnt meant for ccp staff it is directed toward the other players i ask for their understanding i had a head injury from the war injury so my grammer spelling and even how i look at things may be off ccenter from the way you look at things i trying to look at what i wrote 10 times to smoothing it out as i go adding and correcting rearranging each time then i run the draft trough a grammer and spell checker program please try to take it as it is meant a humble but serious suggestion i would not insult you belittle your iq or other abilities so please pay me the respect you would of your loved family member well onto the suggestion in character as my character for the pupose of carrying your bpos and bpcs onto a ship you normally use a  small secure container  i would like to point out the container is way too large the container is  120m3  in size and if you want a fast ship which is part of transport small expensive cargo like this you cant fit in shuttle and a few othersalo9t of your fast ships are under the 100m3 mark and the fastes is under 30m3 and a shuttle is 10m3what i propose is to make a speciality container beside the coiner itself i will try different scan resistant material to line the inside of the container to limit the effectiness of a cargo scan it will be a proper secureaudit log container my tooncharachter has attempted to make a model of his intent he has taken 3 containers and cutt them down with a weilding torch and weilded them into a useable version of the 3 containers he wants fabericated by a profesional shop the containers made to have the blueprints placed either into secured partions in the larger versonUFFFDs or just to lay them into the smaller onetthe containers are of the following size one will be  075m3  2nd will be  5m3  and the last one will be  9m3  any of the sizes will fit even in a shuttle they will be securable and offer some hinderance of being scanned at least equal to a small secure container i believe this is a easy solution for the problem i look forward to reasonable feed back to myself and the council the gmUFFFDs so we can sunmitte a request to ccp for implemation of my ideamundi comedentisresearchpsi couldnUFFFDt find a space stated for bpUFFFDs maybe one of the gm can provide that info for me a artcitect gave me his rough finding of fitting 1500 being easy inside an  075m3 
would you still feel like its beneficial to your bottom line when 10000 other manufacturers decide that its a business to get in to when theyve pulled the bpc and material prices way up and pushed the sale prices way down
sorry didnt mean to duplicate so i blanked this entry
since a bowhead is metioned and if the other ideas dont get enough interest then why dont we take a bowhead and give it jump capabilty that seem the eastest solution plus it would give us another ship everybody knows that we enjoy getting another shipbasically beef up a bowhead design to be able to handle the jump drive and fighter defense capablity with maybe these slots increase to 3 mids 4 to 6 lows 3 rigs the bowhead already has 3 mids 3 lows 3 rigs as someone else suggestion i dont see why this ship would need either little general cargo space or no cargo space at alljust a general thoughtmundips as i get used to doing more posting maybe i will get better at it thanks for putting up with me expresing myself
helloi recently was able to have a long sit down with several high profile members of the hisec ganking community to discuss the implications of changes that were talked about at fanfest and the state of ganking in general  with regards to freighters miners  industrials  as well as the thinking and motivation behind it and the relationship between ganker gankee  antiganker this was something that i felt was really valuable in giving us a lot of needed information on the subject and was incredibly productive as they answered a lot of our questions in a fair and self reflective way however i feel that i need some input from the other side to truly be prepared to address this issue going forwards as such im looking for knowledgeable people who are able to discuss the issue with me some time in the next two weeks date to be confirmed with the participants of course specific people im interested in hosting would be representatives from pushx red frog freight or any of their subsidiaries especially their high value hauling members and leaders of antigankervigilanteetc communities however im letting myself be open for applications from all areas on the issue here if you dont wish to post publically an ingame mail will more than suffice i will be looking to keep it small however as i find this works best for the format of a roundtablethe meeting will be recorded for the purposes of helping the rest of the csm but will not be made publicly available and any information shared will be considered a private matterif you have any other questions or suggestions feel free to ask
i dont suppose we could get a list of who turns up to these
plase forgive my awful english which might make my language more abrupt than i would likesince youre somehow asking for comments lets try to express some  eve is a hard game its hard for a lot of reasons everybody spends its time talking about but what makes it even more interesting and unique is also the fact that some players organized themselves to weight in the metagame and bend the whole game towards their views ccp makes the rules in new eden players play the game if someone finds this too hard she can join whatever organization of players trying to bend the game towards their views if she prefers something harder she can just belong to the vast majority of new eden dwellers spending their time simply playing the game whatever the rules can be one day or anotherthats why as ironic as i might be i think whatever might comes out of this gankers roundtable is of little importance it just adds a little spice to that unique game and having some players lobbying publicly for rules changes make sit even more interesting whatever the consequences might be nice people will just adapt whatever comes
i prefer to keep the lists of attendees of both these roundtables  focus groups private as i dont feel its information that would add to the actual points of the discussion i do try and keep them as representative as i can though
this sounds great i hope the round table goes well id be willing to be there to help point out the concerns of a pilot carrying valuable cargo but delegates from pushx and red frog would undoubtedly be more qualified i have never lost a freighter and dont plan to start but i have moved packages of great value
could you ask when ccp will tackle the issues i know that they will bring out the mining platforms first but the even got a thread last year in the upcoming features section and that it imho is fitting a ship one of the main features of eve and worst ui ingamealso a guide for noobs how to fit a decent tank would be great this had been one of my biggest problems at the beginning till i found eft they got a tutorial video about ship skins but nothing about fitting a ship
ghost fitting is coming i dont have a date for you but its actively having work done on itas for teaching people how to fit there are some ideas being kicked around both from ccp and from the csmone im fond of and am pushing is a number of sample fits in game teaching by example they wouldnt be wonderful fits just solid ones which take minimal skills
thanks for the answeri dont think that some tutorial fits are enough this topic is complicated and its best if you can print it out and use as reference while fitting especially while you are not familiar with all the different modules so a fitting manual would do the trick you need to understand the principles behind the fitting where some example fittings will certainly help tight wonderful fit are nothing a noob can use anywaythe best source of information for me was uniwikis tanking site
you know there are not always two sides to a debate worthwhile changes are the type that promote highsec aggression while counterproductive changes are the type that promote carebearism a carebear for the purpose of this discussion is a capsuleer who plays eve like a solo game and spends all his time grinding for isk to buy a plex and bling modules for his grinding ship so he can grind slightly more efficiently for another monththere are still some capsuleers who have actually spent their entire existence in highsec and never even experienced pvpthe csm should do its best to ensure that such a fate does not befall our new players
imho one of the problems is the short reaction time of concord this will almost always prohibit any player interaction because the target or the ganker is dead before someone even notices whats going on so you have to prolong the timer to compensate this for the target they needs additional defenses give ewar and slots to freighters give weapons and slots to miners at the moment the whole thing of ganking is to know your target and your timeframe you can predict very accurately how many cats you need normal fights have a much greater element of surprise if you can really fit a ship you might fit it for max cargoyield or tank or even gank who knows maybe they have ewar good luck with the round table maybe you should include someone from the mining community to get the whole picture
i think there should be a healthy ganking culture but what is missing is the ability to white knight i dont know what this would look like but it should be active and engaging not just hanging around in a cloaky ecm ship if it could be brought about highsec could be revitalised with quality content
one seems to often forget that without the carebears grinding isk salvaging mining gas harvesting killing sleepers or other npc rats for their loot and salvage blueprints datacores and sundry other necessary items no ships would be would be built for pvpers to enjoy using without the carebear pvpers would soon be reduced to pvping in the ccp funded noob ships with their civilian gunscarebears ensure that pvpers not only have the shiny ships they want to fly at reasonable prices and actually would be even cheaper were it not for code doing its best to help keep market prices stable by ensuring that the supplies of goods reaching the markets or builders was not excessivenew players should have the opportunity to ease into the pvp lifestye when they feel comfortable in so doing not just unceremoniously ganked the first time they undock that unfortunately leads to a lot of new players giving up when eve certainly needs new blood new blood not necessarily spilled at the first opportunityi am all for blowing ships up and structures such as the keepstar coming out of anchoring in nalvula
still looking for participants here please try and get in touch as there is limited time before the summit in which to organise this 
hi and thanks for organising this i wont take part in the roundtable  anyone will tell you that i never speak on comms  but i can mail you any thoughts that i have about gankrelated game balance if that would help edit although if mr patrouette and another friend of mine who is taking part are going to say everything i want to say and more besides i probably dont need to
in looking at old articles like this one
i have revised the post i made after the csm x minutes on faction war here it is again bringing up the forgotten promises ccp made for faction war in the end it is about fun warswhat do i consider fun frequent quality pvp engagements how frequent i think a faction war players who are fully engaged in sov warfare should be able to get about 10 decent fights in 3 hours of play it is very disheartening to spend the time to get the isk spend the time to figure out your fits and and fleet comps and then you just spend another 2 hours online with few decent fights good fights happen but they are not frequent enough and they often are just random with no context of achieving any sov war aims what do i think is boring having several alts orbit buttons ready to flee at the first sign of trouble yet this is the best way to gain vp in faction war and vp is the best metric to see who is winning the sov war so currently if you really want to win sov for your faction then get alts out there what can ccp do to make faction war sov more fun and exciting they already said they would do it 1 timer rollbacksoctober 22nd 2012 ccp fozzie saidccp fozzie wroteUFFFDthe rest of the planthere are some other changes to the rest of our original roadmap that we are making after consultation with the communitywe will be attempting to release two new features to the fw complexes that have been suggested many times by the fw community to increase pvp opportunities in complexes have plex capture timers count backwards to the default state when no players are contesting themUFFFD
these seem to be going well could we have an evesports roundtable and a low sec roundtable as well please
lowsec roundtable exists under gorski eve sports would be under nashh but his focus for the first csm is on event organisersrl community events
how wonderful that you and you alone get to define just how a sandbox is played congrats so according to your singular definitions a player who is only interested in mining fabricating inventing and building which is you know part of the overall sandbox must be some sort of failure because they have no desire to pew pew you and others of your ilk continually bleat that eve is a spaceship versus spaceship killing game i have no problem with that as that is a large part of the sandbox but it is only a part it is not by any means the sole entiretyjintaan i would very much like to be a part of this round tablesincerelyalbrecht patrouette
im not alone the culture of eve is with mewe are not ilk we are the ruling classwe do not bleat we preachyou must be an antiganker champion of the afk miner protector of the botter
then stay in starter systems where its a banworthy offense to suicide gank and in npc corps where you cant be wardecd when youre ready to be a big boy capsuleer you can join everyone else in the rest of the game
highsec violence is good and it should be happening
go back to an npc corp or harden up
drop corp and join a fw corp hopefully someone there will help you have fun you can make decent isk for a newbie and theres low level pvp content that would be a good way to get the feel for this game
why if they enjoy that lifestyle who are you to save them from itmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
we are the new order it is the carebears who cast the first stone they complained and wrote endless petitions to obtain nerf after nerf to highsec aggression because they were intolerant of nonconsensual pvp in a pvp game they are a vocal minority of players whose response to losing a ship is not learning and adapting but complaining to the devs they still demand that highsec be turned into a riskfree theme park they seek to curtail our lifestyle and destroy the game we loveas a result we strive to ensure that every pilot is exposed to pvp before he is infected with carebearism and we aggressively attack all carebears in retaliation for the horrible things they have collectively done unless they are willing to bend the knee buy a permit and pledge support for the new halaima code of conductadditional readingwhy do they ganklet me tell you why people are killing highsec miners a manifesto
it seams to me that highsec ganking is generating a lot of conflict in highsec this is evident by the many tear mails we see on this forums and everywhere else for eve conflict is indeed the desired content it is the motor of the industry and lifeblood of the gameevery part of eve which creates content will generate tears and people who say it should be nerfed on the forums the question is is there actually a problem or is it just people who are not aware of an already pretty good balanced game mechanic maybe the answer here is educationi know the first reaction to tear post is to assume we need to fix something in the game but what about all the other parts of the game which create no tear mails and traffic on the forums because they are pretty much dead if you want to make eve a better game the focus should be on this game mechanics i think enable the people there to create content for other people since this is what makes eve interestingno one joins eve to become an afk minerhauler or to run the same linear mission for the millionth time think about it
the problem is the design of the mining ships and freighters they are designed to be passive in conflicts this way of tanking is easily overcome when you know what you have to do because there is no variation imho the ganking culture deserves to die because it is bad for the game and be replaced by a fighting culture there should be no easy ganks but fights there should be another way for players that dont actively search pvp then just running maybe miners can dig in with weapons and some one use shield restoring sentry drones which dont show on the dscan or a freighter can actively ewar atackers to keep them at bay cloaking disruptures that reveal cloakers but need to ankered to asteroids nope not for gate camps sorry 
one thing i found a pain was the mechanic that makes ships invulnerable as they undock from a station having attempted to lie in wait for a suspect  criminal to undock only to find that they can just warp off before you can even start to get a lock on them criminals suspects and 10 security status should not have the benefit of an invulnerability timer when undocking in low or high sec
because instaundock bookmarks should be reserved for the lawabiding
one way of exacting revenge on code is an indirect approach gank anyone who pays their ransom and displayes their licence code i predict codes revenue will take a hit also for most high sec players it will result in a damned if you do and damned if you dont situation they will either not undock or they will turn and fight
please dont they have done nothing to you you just sound like a griefer who wants to make us and our customers sad
and ccp gets the money to hire more people from where

the big problem with freighter ganking at the moment is that concord is too powerfuli write here as someone who has spent some time saving bumptackled freighters and exacting revenge upon the gankers and their loot ships i see that first responders to a bumped freighter often struggle to do much about the machariel thats typically bumptackling the freighter and have to wait around until the gank fleet turn up only then can the defenders use logi ecm etc against the gank fleet but not the tackler freighters getting ganked from time to time is not the problem its concord defending the gankers thats the problem and im going to tell you whywhile neutral logi may go suspect bumptackling ships carrying out the rather aggressive action of holding a ship face none of the consequences of their actions that every single other combatant does this is the big inconsistent elephant in the room regarding freighter ganking  and its a pretty big elephant given the size of freightersas the bumptackling ships are defended by concord this means that the only players that can typically engage with these machariels are players who dont mind giving away a killright on themselves and losing their ship because of the killright the only people who can get involved are those who dont live in hisec but yet somehow happen to be in the same hisec system at the time of the gank or those who are prepared to create a hisec alt purely to reversegank machariels so we see that engagement with the machariels is limited to a fairly small pool of players which exacerbates the dps floor that concords misguided defence places on prospective defenders if you dont do enough dps to the machariel in x seconds it survivesin contrast we see a much wider pool of players using ecm logi etc in an attempt to save tackled freighters these players would surely be interacting with the bumping ships if those tacklers werent protected by concord which shows that concords zeal is reducing opportunities for player interactionconcord defending the machariels is like the police turning up to a robbery and shooting the person who beat off the attacker instead of going after the thiefas its perfectly possible to moduletackle a ship for hours on end its completely consistent to be able to bumptackle a ship for hours on end ccp have proposed putting a limit on the amount of time for which any ship can be bumped but as the fundamental issue with freighter bumping is not really the time that people can do it for but that they can do it while defended by concord im sad to say that ccps proposal somewhat misses the mark concord should not be defending important participants in the gank in fact if concord did not defend the bumptacklers then we would find that the problem of freighters being held for hours if it even is a problem sorted itself out naturally via sandbox interactionswhat can we do about concords sympathies then bumping has various uses and consequences throughout the game so any modifications to bumping in order to fix issues around freighters are likely to have consequences elsewhere thats perhaps the main positive feature of ccps 3m warp proposalhowever the existence of other bump interactions outside freighter ganking means that the natural solution of making bumptacklers go suspect might have too widespread an impact even if it was technically feasible to decide who is the bumper and who is the bumpeean alternative change might be to make freighters more heavy so that the effect of a bump on the freighters speed and alignment would be lower and it would take less time to recover from bumps as this change only affects the a parameter of freighters it may not have much effect on other parts of the game which is an appealing property however it wouldnt address the issue of tacklers being protected by concord so the solution is flawed in the same way as the one that ccp has presentedin conclusion freighters getting ganked from time to time is not the problem its concord defending the tackler thats the problem and this needs to be resolved somehow for the good of the game
it is not very difficult to decide who is bumping cause his movement vector is directed at the other ship if you go suspect after the third bump there will be no problem with accidentally bumping into another ship or you can even use the bumping timer that the bumper gets the flag after 30 secondsother bumping actions take place in low or null against capitals where a suspect flag is irrelevantmaking freighters heavier will prevent bumping as a game mechanic for ganking which is imho bad a suspect flag for bumpers opens up opportunities for player action which is the better choice
if you were the ruling class you would not dodge the every wardec that your bumping alts corps suffer from like carebears do that you loath in a way gankers and in particular code gankers are worse than carebears because you preach water dont dodge wardecs fight stand your ground dont crap talk in local and so on and drink wine you do not stay in your corps and fight back against wars your cuckflood in local speaks for its own if code was participating in this roundtable it cant have been all that productive and insightfulsuspect flags are also irrelevant in high sec no one engages a target that can shoot back and even targets that cant shoot back are regularly ignored i have seen so many pirates and suspect people floating around space outside jita that no one engages at all however if a freighter goes suspect you can count on that people flock to whore on itfurthermore and in light of the above it is not that easy to find out who the bumper is and who not a suspect machariel that no one cares about can just bump a freighter into an immobile catalysttalos and really quickly we have the freighter suspect flagged as bumper the machariel can just warp off once the freighter is suspect since no one careswhatever ccp could do matters would only get worse especially if crime watch got involved we have already seen how desperate people are to overcome the limitations of any restriction put in place and the introduction of crime watch to the bumping system would only make matters worse for freighters this entire feature should be left alone because right now it works you can easily explain what gankers can do to get you and what you can do to not get caught which is already stacked in a 31 ratio of possibilities against freightersno arcane and overly easily exploitable mechanics to make ganking overly easy are in place it requires effort from both sides to do it and to prevent itthe same goes for longer concord response times you can give freighters a carriers worth of defenses they are still just freighters and playerdriven antiganking business is neither prevalent enough nor rewarding enough to make it more prevalent except for no appreciation from haulers you dont get anything from it and appreciation alone does not pay bills and again if you introduced a reward system for antiganking it would be easily exploitable and only make matters worse right now antigankers can have a fleet ready to kill the gankers the long response time in 056 systems allows for that once they go criminal and remote repair a freighter neither is working properly to save a significant number of freighters because not enough people are interested in it  and never will get interested in it because it is a boring and tedious activity with nearly no action and a lot of waiting
an increase to freighter mass could have a range of effects depending on the magnitude of the increase ranging from making bumping slightly harder to making it require a full fleet of machariels i would suggest that any value of mass that made bumping practically impossible would be too highi have seen many ships go suspect on gates away from jita and get piled on so i strongly disagree that if bumptacklers went suspect that noone would get involved in any case as go on to say defending a freighter is tedious because there is so little activity this would surely change if bumptacklers were engageableto defend a freighter you have to wait around and engage almost exclusively on the gankers terms  ie during the same 1525s window that they are engaging the freighter damn right thats tedious and theres no prospect of getting a 10b killmail which is surely one of the motivations for the gankersimagine then if bumptacklers went suspect through some simple and nonexploitable mechanic the window of engagement for defenders would be longer as they could choose to engage either the tackler or the gank fleet and it would be slightly more on the defenders terms which would make the operation more interesting for the defendersactually it would be more interesting for the gankers too as they would perhaps have to decide whether they use some guys to defend the tackler or perhaps even use cheaper bumping ships and more of them to deal with the risk of loss currently bump tacklers almost always use the optimal ship despite it costing half a billion isk simply because the tackler is put at very little risk because it is defended by concord there should probably be some opportunities for play and counterplay there too does the tackler fit for tank fit for high dps or just go for max bumping and that would have an impact on how defenders would engagethe entire process would be more interesting for both sides if bumpers werent defended by concord
tank doesnt mean a thing neither for haulers nor gankers gankers are riskaverse and would stop bumping altogether or only bump once or twice but not the third time to prevent the flag they can just warp around on grid or to a closeby offgrid spot to get rid of the counter and come back to continue bumping instead of making it more interesting for defenders it would just remove bumping altogether not that bumping was necessary in the first place in the past people just scanned freighters followed them and engaged them when they wanted to warp off slow aligntime is slow or were approaching the gate completely without bumping this focus on alts for ganking however has seemed to make bumping necessary so that nonisbd alts can do that job of actual people
the introduction of npc corps for dodging wardecs is one of the nerfs i was referring to earlier once a mechanic exists it is foolish not to use it imagine a bumper who loses a machariel because he didnt drop his wardecced corp and lets the freighter escape or an antiganker who loses his falcon in the same way they would be ridiculed nonetheless we believe that npc corps should be removed completely for everybody as far as dodging wars the purpose of the code alliance was originally to attract wardecs our agents are among the politest and most respectable people in new eden because we need to set a good example for the unwashed massesyour second paragraph was pretty good
so when is pl resetting ncdotits easy to discuss about how other people dont want to risk their assets but when our own assets are in danger were all riskaverse sure it doesnt have anything to do with me im exceptional
the guys who invented eve you know ccp they are the descendants of vikingsgood luck on convincing them raiding defenseless or less powerful targets and looting the remains is not a preferred way to interact with othersthey like itthey encourage group activity not solo thus a pack of gankers flying in cheap destroyers can take out a single pilot in a huge expensive freighterthey make profit when your ship is exploded and you have to replace it its their business model they have no interest in balancing defensive capabilities versus offensive capabilities in any consistent manner thus a freighter has no ability to carry a weapon but a tiny rookie ship one percent of its size canreality is ccp likes the game the way they want us to play it not the way we might want to play it once you reconcile that inescapable fact you can perhaps still find enjoyment in ways ccp will toleratea combat pilot must have two goals to survive 1 get the first shot in every fight  2 get the last shot in every fight
this is not a viable option imho wardeccs should not affect players aka accounts not toon 23 month subbed not plexed and without any kills if you kill someone you are a free target it should also only protect industrials no freighters if you can finance a freighter you dont need any protection and mining ships these people need to get on their feet to be fun to fight with taking candy from a baby doesnt show good pvp skillsdroping the corp should imho never be an option because the corp is the focal point for social interaction dropping corp should not have any beneficial effects
someone liked this posti just want to point out that above a new player claims that it is not easy for corps of new players to deal with wardecsplease everyone ignore that and think for a seconda new player completely lacks the knowledge and experience to judge about thatdo not ever believe anyone who tells you that you cant do somethingit doesnt even matter that hes clueless and doesnt know betterjust dont believe the wimpstheres a shitton of literal failures and losers out there who will constantly try to pull you onto their levelwhoever reads thisignore them if you cant hurt themand if you can hurt them  then make sure its a lesson that sticksand ps kill anyone who supports carebearisms in the name of new players
interesting that no actual lower security space drug manufacturers chimed in against allowing this to happen in high sec now that it is legal to usethe proponents of keeping it restricted are using the same worn out tired refrains that resist every change proposed it will destroy the economy it must be preserved as a perk for lownull sec inhabitants run hide change means the sky is fallinghonestly on this issue i expected betterwhy we keep thinking that in order to force people to inhabit low sec and null sec we need to keep giving them special privileges mystifies me what is the einstein quote doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome is the definition of insanityi lived in low sec the blood pumping rush of the instant danger is what made it desirable for me undocking and rolling the dice against pilots who are usually better at combat is a challenge you choose to accept because it improves your own skills with each brutal lessonthe special stuff you can mine or build helps with the cost of ship and implant replacement but they are not the primary attractionone day i hope someone in power embraces the time proven fact that you can not manipulate people into taking risks until they are ready to try it no matter how many shiny perks you dangle high sec is the most densely populated region because most people want to undock take care of their business and then perhaps afterwards roll the dice for risk and excitement when they are in the mood or with a group of like minded people it does not make them bad if they were encouraged by better more effective offensive and defensive technology that made them think theyd be more then just cannon fodder for combat experts theyd likely do it more oftenlow and null sec aversion is combating perception more than reality successfully eluding an attack or making a good fight out of losing to a better pilot is what makes you want to continue to return the instant pop followed by some juvenile ranting in local about what a great warrior he is because he and his squad of equally juvenile friends killed an unarmed vessel is what turns pilots off about returninga combat pilot must have two goals to survive 1 get the first shot in every fight  2 get the last shot in every fight
1 guess i am not as afraid of competition or change as you sound2 guess i think your predictions are not fact based more likely ignorance and fear based3 everything i have done to earn a living in new eden is being done by countless other pilots already i am not scared of a bigger market4 nothing stopped pilots from entering drug manufacturing today or yesterday those who want to will others will not5 if more people get into drug manufacturing that means more people will buy the components to create drugs which in turn also could mean gas mining will become more profitable6 i look for the opportunities change creates instead of crying about whose possible fiefdom it might infringe upon7 guess i was hoping someone on the csm could be a positive agent for change on this subject instead of just going with the popular meme of protecting the status quo at all costa combat pilot must have two goals to survive 1 get the first shot in every fight  2 get the last shot in every fight
not all change is good and accusing your opponent of being unable to adapt isnt a valid argument towards a proposed changechanges should be evaluated based on the good of the game which as a user of these forums you may be surprised to hear do not revolve solely around the needs of hisec playersdo you have any solid arguments that this change would be good for the game at large rather than just make your drug manufacturing operation risk free
you are attempting to create a straw man argument nothing in what i said or proposed created a risk free drug manufacturing operation your straw man failssolid argument an expanding market is indeed good for the entire game more drug products being created by players mined by players consumed by players in more facilities built by players in more areas of new eden is the definition of good for the gamegas needs to be obtained from gas clouds where they spawn is not a part of what i am asking the csm to modify so your risk free argument is just plain factually incorrecta combat pilot must have two goals to survive 1 get the first shot in every fight  2 get the last shot in every fight
make missions pvp based go to x system and help in the battle there if you kill ships your side will winhowever a pilot on the opposite side is also receiving the same missionrework the donating lps mechanic for ihubs another idea that promotes just farming lps and not working for the greater good paying lps without any benefit for yourselfrework the tier mechanics theyre terrible as they are they discourage joining the losing side get rid of them completelymake pirates and awoxxers illegaly attacking militia members lose standing with the militia of the pilot its just stupid they can go and dock into caldari space for example after killing pilots fighting a war for the caldari its like allowing free access to terrorists on your own military bases theyre the only ones that shoot both sides of the war but still can dock in every station in the war zone thats stupiddont allow anything but t1 nonfaction frigates in novice plexes but halve the rewards they give theyre called novice for a reason if you can lose ships worth 20 million youre not a novice anymore while the real novices get stomped all day long you expect to fight other novices when you warp there

except it totally is if you stop sheltering newbies and explain to them that you are going to get  by wardecs theyll either move out of highsec or be smarter at avoiding them sheltering new players does not benefit the game
well good luck with this until its sorted its quite simply good bye new playersi tried a considered and what i though interesting and impartial post on a possible solution but it got nowhere
this is an interesting point of view  why would certain ships continue to be built without much defence in such a dangerous world
the skiff has today basically the stats of an heavy attack cruiser which can still mine at the same time and yet miners are still complaining if they get yet another buff they will probably be used as combat ships
i should absolutely be in this  and someone verbally capable from code should definitely a part of this as wellparanoid loyd should be in here just as much
yes we need to get rid of those who want to impose their playstyles on othersyouthe first golden rule of eve  you consent to pvp when you click undock you lostgoaway
those tears are incredible it almost makes you wonder what the story is behind themapart from that no you should not be able to produce drugs in highsec
hi wondered if there was a update on something from last years summit regarding the npe specifically on the topic of rejoining your starter npc corp if you leave a player one
i would also like to know about this 1
right im all for more opportunities and player interaction i dont see anything wrong with your ideas lets make this happen
nah im not going anywhere but thanks perhaps if you could read you would have noticed i have never said ganking should be removed nor would i wish to impose anything on anyone but this is not the place for a argument dude you clearly win with your highly positive attitude and intellectual prowessif we can get and keep new players ccp will have more revenue thus allowing faster and better content do you really want to wait another handful of years before we get things like player built stargates and other overdue or potential features i would like to speed this up a bit if possible and that is my sole intention there is no way for a confused and bamboozled new player in a venture or retriever to counter a gank thats all im trying to address here and kudos to jintaan for attempting to get info from all sides and relay it back to ccpso lets help him not hinder
i think ganking is part of the game but at the moment its a bit too easy it would be nice if you couldnt buy your security status back anymore to add the grind penalty back for people who choose that play style if you want to gank full time then youre going to have to run missions and rat belts just like before or be stuck to null and low sec there were many times in the past when i still wanted access to high sec but would pirate and gank it makes you choose your targets instead of just killing every little thing you see the tags could probably even be left in game as long as you were not able to trade the item making the person that needs them to go out looking for them
i like thisim all for retaining new playersto me the solution is easy and obvious as long as enough people work togetheri still have a thread to make to finish the seriesmy thoughts are more about social development and effects of things ccp throws at ustheyve posted the eight golden rules recently for this for a good reason
meaningfull pve  on a scale that matters  does not and can not exist and putting it in quotes doesnt change anythingplease use the appropriate word instead of abusing one that doesnt fitit can only exist for those who want to believe their pve activities matter to anyone  but that is just in their heads  because no one else gives a damnnothing you mentioned gives a meaning to pve whatsoeverwhat you are saying though is that pve is boring and should be made more interesting
