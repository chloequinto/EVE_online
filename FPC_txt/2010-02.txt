so which other sniperhac has an optimal range of 145km 80km is mid range for an eagledont bother with ad hominem crap present some proper counter argumentsyour absolutely right about eve not being a long range tickling contest as such there is little point in comparing damage at ranges beyond optimalfalloff where damage is below 40 of base dps a more reasonable comparison is optimal12 falloff where damage is still at 80 of base dps for that the rokh has a range of 210km to the apocs 175kmyou have done a wonderful job comparing the raw damage output but i dont think that will be enough to get ccp to change anything if you look at the effect armour resistance have on the effective damage from these two ships the size of advantage is greatly decreased the driving reason for the last change to the apocs specs was because of the significance of armour tanking so you will have a hard time getting ccp to buy into any comparison of rails and lasers without factoring for resistancesthe rokhs 320 dps becomes 224 against armour while the apocs 400 becomes 2225 now the difference doesnt appear to be too much as far as damage goes against shields the apoc has a decisive advantage over the rokh with 370 dps verses the rohks 224 dps if a rohk is going to face off against an apoc it needs to do so well past the apocs ideal range of 175km however it would appear that the rohk has the range to do so it is just a matter of seeing who can control the situation betteryou might get the csm to take the railgun balancing issue to ccp but you will probably need to give them more to go on if they are going to get ccp to act on itedithere is another problem with a 15 boost to railgun damage compare these two partial setupsabaddon tach3 x heat sink ii8 x tachyon beam laser ii aurora l1 x large ancillary current router iidps against armour  27912625available pg  4845optimal  falloff  119  25abaddon rail3 x magnetic field stabilizer ii8 x 425mm railgun ii spike l1 x large hybrid collision accelerator iidps against armour  2774835available pg  6402optimal  falloff  130  30
apoc should fairly easily able to get to 230km optimal with tachs not sure where the idea that theyd be limited to 175km came from but they certainly shouldnt be with any decent fit for raw damage at least the rokhs advantage is pushed out right to the lock limit your point about average resistances is a good one though and admittedly not one id considered however getting close to double damage on shield targets should come at some cost indeed if were pegging rails as doing equal damage to both armor and shields it makes perfect sense for them to do more against armor then lasers do assuming the same range now of course the rokh does get better range but somehow i dont think thatll make the shield tanked rokh much happier that hes getting hit nearly twice as hard as hes dealing it might make sense for the increase in damage to be toned down to 1015 instead still leaving a very heavy bonus for lasers hitting shields but at least getting a mild advantage hitting armor averaged out though rails do the exact same damage to armor as they do shields essentially just leaving it will really poor damage in all circumstancesweighting armor as counting for 3 times as much as armor a 15 increase in damage for rails would still bring the average damage to just about even thanks to how much harder it hits the one shield tanked target the 15 advantage at hitting armor ends up being fairly equal to the 42 advantage lasers have against shieldsif were going to have a game where different weapons do better or worse against armor and shields then the weapon that does equal damage to both shields and armor should preform better then the poor preformer vs armor instead of simply being able to tie lasers poor armor damage while suffering incredibly against shields
i see brilliant argument fit railguns to an abaddon i will certainly be taking your advise for ws balance from now on sir you seem to know exactly what you are talking about especially about the bolded part where you demonstrate your excellent knowledge of fleet engagement envelopeplease try to understand when i am talking about railgun rebalancing i refer to the engagement envelope of the ships that use them not an in vitro comparison of the turretsfurthermore i am talking about these ships in the context of pvp let me offer this piece of advise gained from experience in 00 after a few years of roaming in curse catch and providence and quite a few large and small scale engagements1 sniperhacs engage  70100kms fleet bs snipers engage  170200kms if you are going to compare ships and turrets you should first look at them at those ranges2 when sht hits the fan the enemy gang is on you or you are going balls deep you load shortest range highest damage ammo and tracking speed scan resolution scripts and slug it out therefore that is your secondary scenario to be examined3 fleet support bcs need to be able to hit 70kms with max damage in order to be able to protect the fleet bs4 if you are flying t1 cruisers you need to be able to reach 70km if you cant fly a ceptor youll be better off in it and youll get a few more kms on gatesif you still are failing to understand the logic for these proposals and call my arguments ad hominems you need to either stop taking those drugs or ask your doctor to increase the dosage now please use your vast experience to blind us with your unassailable arguments about sniperhac ranges and rfailfitted abaddonsprotip fitting t2 rigs on fleet bs  throwing isk awayfake edit t2 rigs oh you are talking about pve arent you
supporting the topic with a few reservations wish the op had taken the time to state a case rather than simply demanding a boost and pointing to a lengthy thread as justificationedit forgot to check the box
you havent been playing very long or are you also trolling using an alt have you forgetten the good old days when it was better to fit projectiles on amarr ships some of us still remember when the bonuses to laser damage didnt mean anything i would like to see those bonuses remain useful but then what do you know your character didnt even exist back then
wellthe same could be answered to you ki tarra during the first stages of eve gallente were horribly overpowered ask to your senior fellows they will confirm that look now in what we have turned into what i can say is that following three years flying exclusively gallente and under its actual condition once i discovered the beauty of amarr and minnie weaponry i dont even think to fly it again rails sux blasters are too shortranged and drones are a pain in the arse if you have to combat on longrange fleets
i can see that hybrids are currently underwelming but the solution is not to break game balance and return them to fotmccp has told the csm that players dont need to provide solutions they just need to raise issues it would appear that more often than not player suggested solutions are broken when it comes to balanceif there was a proposal for the balancing team to take a fresh look at railsblasters i would be all for it lasers got their major rebalancing back in 2008 and projectiles got theirs in 2009 it is time for hybrids to be looked at toohowever a 15 or 20 damage boost across the board would break more than it would fix as such i cannot support this proposal

it looks like a lot of people are replying to this topic before learning about the issue responses to a few i caughtlocking range maxes at 250km all of these ships have no problem reaching over 200km optimal when they are fitted falloff gets them to max range the issue is that stacking penalties mean that 23 damage mods which all sniper bss fit who arent failfit function as a uniform percentage increase to damage for all guns because this is a percentage increase this means that the difference in damage only increaseslet me quote the important line you seem to have missed  and this is not even taking into account the cap issue the point is that a few minmatar ships will alpha strike destroy a battleship that is a huge bonus over rails which have crap alpha and dpsim laughing check the bonuses caldari ships have before typing pleaseno a 15 damage bonus and their alpha would still remain less than any other ship a 15 damage bonus and caldari would still have less alpha and dps than any other ship this is simply how drastic the difference is currently fit 23 damage mods and the difference becomes even more apparent this is patently false each of those guns have almost the same midrange with short range ammo seriously unbalance err the fact that rails could get a 15 increase in damage and still have less alpha than other guns and the dps doesnt get very exciting either shows the guns are not balanced right now that is the pointsure lets not ask for a specific increase lets just say this is horribly unbalanced please fix it
can you please share your 200km optimal range abaddon armageddon maelstrom andor tempest setups
true this is not the character i had in beta yes i spend a few years away from the gamebut at least this character undocks and fights i didnt see anything of importance in yoursso let us leave this faceless alt troll bang the bars of its cage and move on to discuss the matter at handi agree that the 15 is a rough estimate of where railgun dps should end up and it is a compromise reached through consensus that applies to the 10 pg increase as well i felt that it would be too tedious to reiterate a 20 page threadnaught but in the end i did offer numbers based on my experience i have stated repeatedly that i use data from my own engagements and fits as far as hacs go while relying on my alliances data for bsesi have stated the scenarios that these ships are used in and i am asking for a balance such that the ships operate using the intended ws for each one and being not equal one and the same but comparable to each other
i was wrong about optimal two tracking computers and two gyros is standard fare on a minmatar ship three tracking enhancers and two heat sinks for amarr an apoc gets 1 enhancer and 3 heat sinks two tracking enhancers and two mags are good fits for a gallente ship fleet fits for rohks usually have 3 mags and a tracking computerhowever as i alluded to damage is touched by the golden thumb of compounded interest when we start talking about fittingsso to compare fit ships we are looking at thisarmageddontachyon  60dps 327alpha 00544 16848kmapocalypsetachyon  50dps 345alpha 00476 18832kmabbadontachyon  56dps 408alpha 00544 16848kmrokh425mm  40dps 211alpha 00346 20935kmdominix425mm  45dps 250alpha 00356 16849kmmegathron425mm  45dps 250alpha 0049 16849kmhyperion425mm  45dps 250alpha 00356 16849kmtyphoon1400mm  44dps 775alpha 00281 14072kmtempest1400mm  55dps 968alpha 00281 14072kmmaelstrom1400mm  44dps 775alpha 00281 14072kmto compare apples to apples heres the per gun fully fit dpsalpha firing on a bs  200km many thanks to eftarmageddontachyon  37dps202alphaapocalypsetachyon  43dps297alphaabbadontachyon  35dps255alpharokh425mm  41dps216alphadominix425mm  29dps161alphamegathron425mm  29dps161alphahyperion425mm  29dps161alphatyphoon1400mm  22dps388alphatempest1400mm  28dps493alphamaelstrom1400mm  22dps388alphaand here we find that the rokh supposed king of long range is actually not the one thing it is supposed to be good at gallente just look pathetic across the board still minmatar continue to have stunning alpha but their dps drops to the bottom of the barrel at this rangewith a 15 damage boost the railgun boats would look like thisrokh425mm  47dps248alphadominix425mm  33dps185alphamegathron425mm  33dps185alphahyperion425mm  33dps185alphathis would finally give the rokh something that it is good at dps at silly range still trumped by all of minmatar and two amarr ships with alpha and gallente would simply not suck so bad please note that the rokhs dps would be the only thing that changes if you are ranking the ships
there is one thing you should just get right now if the tempest doesnt get any powergrid boost like it really need then you can just forget to get a powergid boost right here and now on any ships from caldariits not that im against a powergrid boost on some of the caldari ship its just that if the tempest doesnt get a powergrid boost no other ships will get it from caldari
honestly i could care less about a powergrid boost for any ships they seem to all have appropriate fitting numbers for me
this looks like a good fitting start what about targeting range there is no point have 150km optimal ranges if you cant get a target lockare we comparing glass cannons or should these ships be able to fit any sort of buffer tanki would like to make sure that we are comparing them all on reasonably equal footing
they all can lock at 200km with lvl 5 skills and gang bonus they all have a reasonable buffer tank no glass cannons all have mwd all are rigged all but the rokh are blessed with armor tanks they are what you will find for most alliance suggestedmandatory sniper bs fittings
i have not been able to replicate setups that meet your description can you share the full setups you are using for your comparison
please tell me which specifically you are referring to were talking about 10 different ships here
i wonder why any 00 alliance worth its salt has pretty much the same standard fits available for their pilots oh wait anyway i believe it would be more prudent when we compare fleet bs that we use the unrigged versions rokh is already 130mil i see no reason to fit another 50 in rigs for fleet engagements since there is no mass dd anymore
you edited out your link but anyways i am still looking for your abaddon and armageddon snipper setups lets start with just the two for now oh whati cant figure out what the fits are because i am not in 00 alliance or there is no way to fit an abaddon or armageddon so that it has three tracking enhancers two heat sinks a mwd a buffer tank and can lock at 200km which is your meaning
the damage changes are more important than the pg changes but whatever im not going to let the good suggestion become the enemy of the great suggestion

how much do you pay for your setup a quick check of current contracts show that there are currently two available on the market at a price of 300mil each
most fleet fits use quads some fleet fits ive seen require a 1 or 3 cpu implanti ditched the link because i decided against linking stuff from my alliance prefer to stay in the reasonably good graces of the big guy as to the geddon and baddon my guess is you dont have rr on them the alliances ive been in are strong believers of rr bs the geddon needs a 1 cpu implant but the baddon doesnt need any implants the geddon is an ugly fit but just like a raven scorpion phoon and domi it isnt meant to be a shipofthesniperline
not supportedcaldari ships are already good enough i feel that the balance between races never been as balanced as it is atm the only thing caldari needs is a rocket buff thats it
that is a fair reason for taking down the link as for the geddon and baddon setups your link did not provide tachyon setups just pulse laser setupsi would still like to see armageddon and abaddon setups that meet the criteria you set earlier in the thread three tracking enhancers two heat sinks a mwd a buffer tank and can lock at 200km if you cannot provide setups that meet that criteria please feel free to make adjustments as needed to the criteria and share what you believe to be an acceptable shipofthesniperline setup for these ships
why are you trying to use abaddon as a comparison to rokhthe natural fleet sniper bs is the apocalypse that is the ship you should compare to the rokh furthermore using tachyons in a fleet sniper is not the best idea the turrets equivalent to 425mms are mega beam lasers and they are fully capable of reaching 200kms on an apocif you dont know the fit look around in large alliance kbs those that are public at least and you will see a lot of the variations that are aroundthe fact remains though that if you compare a lvl 5 apoc vs a lvl 5 rokh and if the two ships are fitted as close as possible with 3x damage modifier each then you will see that the apocalypse does 116 the damage of the rokh both  193194 kms optimal t2 ammo the apocalypse will also have better cap stability by 30 secs and a bigger buffer 145k armor vs 139k shield if we want these 2 ships to perform roughly equally the 15 damage increase to the rokh is absolutely necessary

provarocate all you wantmini get 33 more dps at level 5 hull trainingamarr get 33 more dps at level 5 hull traininggal get 25 more dps  blasters  and 50 more dps  drones  at level 5 hull trainingcaldari get 8 more dps at level 5 hull traininghow can you say that that  is not broken 8 extra dps for caldari missile boats when everyone else is gettin 33 or  25  50 
counting dps only is a vision from 1 side look at dps graph in eft compare turret ship and missile ship close range turrets have their incredible extra dps with tiny optimal you will see significant reducing dps after optimal missiles have guaranteed extra dpsps see blasters optimalfalloff range see distance of peak blasters dps
were not counting dpswere counting the delta in the dps between lvl 0 and lvl5 hence the terms more dps at level 5i dont have eft but im pretty sure if you do the graphs for different hull skill levels you will see that for hybridslaserdronesproj the graph grows on the y  axis by around 2533 for level 5 hull skills compared to level 0 hull skillsi dont know how eft handles the kin bonus in terms of dps but if you set up for example a cara with 5 laucnhers 1em  1exp  1therm  2kin and then compare dps graphs for lvl0 and lvl5  you will see that the dps only grows by 8
could you explain why increase of dps such important balance factorfor example amarr apocalypse battleship has 0 delta in the dps between lvl 0 and lvl5 therefor according to your logic it must by terrible ship am i rightalso lets not forget about prophecy maller or punisher 33 more dps at lvl 5 indeed
the geddon is the damage modded amarr bs not the poc  poc gets range iircnot everyship in everyclass gets a damage bonus  and no one is suggesting that eitheramarr damage modded ships generally get 5 rof  33 more dps at lvl5caldari damage modded ships generally get 5 kin  8 more dps at lvl5you seem to have picked out tank modded ships in your example in an attempt to disguise the issue or is it just oversight on your part 
oh so now other attributes are relevant too then i guess drake is tank modded ship too and caracalcerberus are range modded by the way apocalypse gets only 75 range bonus compared to 10 on everything else so my point stands according your logic it is terrible ship because other snipers get 10still at 33 there are exactly 2 t1 ships with rof bonus omen and armageddon there are more ships with dmg bonus or no bonus at all
which attributes depends on the other attributes you wanna talk about i guessrange bonus on the apoc relevant to the kin bonus being a poor bonus  norelevant to the ability of the ship it sits on  yes of course it isi dont know if the poc is a good sniper or not  i never used one for thati would say that obviosly as a sniper it does not skill up as well as the rohk for example
bolded the important part youve been ignoring all this time kinetic bonus on ships like drake caracal or cerberus is good bonus combination of high count of missile bays ability to change damage types dealing high and constant damage at superior range than any other weapon system  they are already powerful at lvl1 or lvl5your 8 argument is simply stupid either use ammo with 25 bonus or use other one when its advantageous to you still better than no ability to switch ammo dmg type at all amarr gallente or weapons with serious range penalties minmatarbut lets pretend the bonus itself and completely unrelated to the ship is truly weak what would you prefer to keep all ship in balance couple of ideas if you dont mind1 nerf lightmedium missile damage add extra missile bay to sacrilege2 remove missile bay from drake works for raven with 1 less bay compared to 78 turret mounts on gunboat battleships caracal other tier 2 combat cruisers have only 4 turrets anyway and remove the bonus from cerberus altogether must have less damage than close range sacrilege3 screw the balance you want your uber drakecerberus on matter what4 better idea humor me
i still wouldnt mind seeing missiles rebalanced to resemble drones each damage type missile has different damagevelocityexplosive velocityect just make the kinetics the most desirable one to use as thermal drones are the most desirable for drone boats then let caldari ships have a freaking missile bonus for all missiles already
still dont see op getting changed like you claimed
lil bump
i really like where this is going youve got some really good ideas there
lets call it security status rebalancemyself i would suggest1 highsec is supposed to be npc superpowers controlled space so lets make it this way if you are on bad terms with npc superpower you will not be allowed to enter the space and when you do you will be shot on sight if your security status drops bellow 10 you got banished from the empire to low sec you cannot return back unless your security status at least 0 again if you do you are shot on sight if your security status drops while you are in highsec you will be asked to leave asap our low sec pirates will be happy to rejoin with similar minder brothers in empire and thus have plenty of targets to fire uponif you destroy ship of other player in highsec concord destroyes your ship you lose security standing and also charges you with prize of the ship you destroyed suicidal ganking will disappear player corp vs player corp warfare is prohibited in highsec its logical thats local superpower will not like fighting in their territory2 low sec is criminal haven add several criminal npc faction agents there several empire agents to redeem your standing most of the goods from the empire is not on the market t2 a t3 equip unless it is smuggled from empire on reverse you may smuggle drugs and pirate faction tech into the empire this involves some npc agents too to pay you or make things legal ocasional raids destroyable npc ships to low sec npc rats are friendly to you if you have enough standing with them unless you attack them first 3 00 unchanged as it is  complete sandbox up to players to shape
some good ideas being thrown in here guys some less practicalpopular but thats wht this is aboutlets get outlaw noticedany csm input please
yes on reconnectno on rats not shooting drones you should be carefull with them thats punisment for forgetting them and if you didnt forget but disconnected whell theres a lot worse things that can happen on disconnect and thats something we all live withi also agree no recconect after abandoning drones you can still scoop them the old fashioned wayalsomaybe im wrong but i think i remember this was mentioned by ccp as comming soontm
i support all drone related improvements
when making the proposal i hadnt considered abandoning drones i agree that any abandoned drone is exactly thatit cant be reconnected to
oh please yeseither this or make npcs not target drones when you get dced
i support it
this issue also affects people in 00 who dont have access to outpostsand in a very minor way also affects people in losec
make it so csm
with the amount of shields on caps it will be useless even if they made it persistent across sessions nope it wouldnt be  read up
finally this issue is raised as a pilot who flys mainly caldari ships i see this is an imbalance that needs to be adressed i am dumbfounded at the csms inability to fully grasp this issue and how it effects people like me almost daily  its totally unfairsomeone should propose the opposite topic to the csm when armour tanking ships receive gang bonuses the total armour amount will be increased  however the extended hp will be in an unrepaired state this change is necassary to bring armour tanking ships inline with shield tanking ships and render the bonus received totally useless

tldr the whole threadanyway back to the core of the question i have a proposal for ccp why dont you check how many gallente pilots since a couple of years are still sticking to gallente ships once we became aware of how this game works most of us quitted a long time ago about flying gallente
make it so
we need also ability to hide all star ssytems that do not belong to current region or all star systems more then 20 jumps away i dont whant to move camara to middle of goodspace upon misclick when i am looking at dodixie because there star system is somehwere in the background i personally prefer a 3dimentional starmap ofcource 2d interpretations are simpler but let us also activate several filtering modes at once for example bringthness of the star system would display amount of people in it and the colour from red to green would display the amount of ships destroyed in past hour then having a small lue dot next to it would meant there is a station in system that would make usin the map easier
yeah the map as it is now its just annoying
eve needs ui improvements all over the place this is just a drop of water in an ocean
supported because as a newer player here my ability to make isk does not grow exponentially at the rate of the cost to upgrade my clonei run lvl 4 missions a few hours a week to pvp for a few more hours a week the amount of time i have to play eve is the only thing that effects how much isk i could makei can see that at some point in the future loosing a pod is going to be a major influence on what i choose to do in evethe more sp i have doesnt effect how much money i can make
reading comprehension failsupporting this idea
stupid forum timer grr
hm i didnt find a i dont like this idea button that suxx a bitanyways i dont like this ideawhen i started playing this game the amounts that i have to pay for my clones quite regulary today where fantasy numbers i could not have imagined to make a few million in a weeknowadays the clone isk are peanuts to medying should hurt and not be softenedas a matter of fact it should be raised a bit to reflect the changes on eve that made it quite easy to raise alot more money
just because the op want to fly fully insured t1 ships doesnt mean pvp should be risk free keep the clone cost as it is not supported
why should income grow exponentially when your clone cost doesnt go up at that rate it goes up gradually if your not making much more isk by the time you are at 30million sp than you were making at 10million sp than you are doing it wrong increase the gap in sp and you are stuck in a rut isk wise diversify maximize you isk per hour there are dozens of isk generating things to do in eve stop training so many combat skills and train something that can make you isk the more sp you have can effect how much isk you make but only if you have the foresight to do something about it training every weapon and ship isnt going to help you increase the isk you make but somehow you need those skills and wonder why you arent making more isk as you sit there looking on hangars full of ships fitted with tech2 and faction modules right
going with this make an attempt to not get podded this is not counterstrike in space
the clone cost really should eventually level out a player with roughly 50m sp can have all subcap ships and supporting skills maxed for a race just as you eventually max out skills hourly income from game mechanics rattingminingetc eventually max out as wellso should the cost of clones they shouldnt continue climbing for the skysure you say dont die you say the end game is 00 enormous battles occur in 00 sec  and almost everyone is involved in one of these battles on a somewhat regular basis 00 sec in case you havent seen it recently has some fleet lag issues if the grid goes silly happens regularly  you hear about it at least once a day and you are unlucky enough to not load the grid for an hour and eventually get primaried you are dead invariably some dont following commands from the fc to the letter and pop pods assuming you actually load the grid eventually so you can come into a fight with pure uberness  ship skills implants  and without even seeing the field of battle you wake up in a stationthis effects players regardless of sp cap the clone costs
you mean this isnt already in game 100 support
agree
hi all i have a thread running in the fid forum link to threadpurpose to create a working and less exploitable bounty system that is not so much designed to hurt piratesgankersgriefers as it is to introduce a thrilling new career into the game for those who like to play the hunterbasic is concept is that bounty kill rights are obtained by bounty office agents like other npc agents when you start a conversation with these agents you are assigned say 3 random online targets within say 20 jumps this is my 3rd attempt at a bounty system fix post and ppl seem to like it but it is not attracting anywhere near as much attention as really bad ideas on this topic are seems like the fid forum is only for slamming crap ideas and no feedback on potentially good ones hahahahaone of the main topics in this debate include who can place a bounty should u be able to place a bounty on anyone with negative sec status or must you have kill rights on that personplease add a comment to the fid post linked above and if you like it please let the csm know about it right here
like the idea simple and somewhat effectivei like some of the other more complex ideas better but this is definitely an improvement over the current systemthere are some problems thoi wouldnt want to get 3 1000isk bounty contracts so you need a well thought out system on how the contracts are distributed also details on not completing the mission a lot of exploits have to be considered some mentioned in the fid thread on second thought a lot of details missing from your proposal but i still support the general idea anything is better than what we have
i really like the sound of that

this is kind of where i was going with the bounty agent level idea bounty agents have levels 14 like other npc agents the higher level agent you have access to the bigger bounties youll be hunting maybe a minimum bounty placement of say 100k isk would be good this would affect your standing with the agent  the bounty office your standing then impacts on what level agents you have access toi have thought this through quite thoroughly but wanted to keep it simple for the forums haha anything this else you are concerned about please ask away
what about the exploit mentioned in fidi go into jita and start putting bounty on all freighter pilots if 100k is the mimimum bounty i can get 100 freighter pilots with only 10mil and then i just start accepting those missions and some of them will surely pop up soonedit  and since i placed a minimum bounty i dont care about standings with agent and just keep canceling missions untill i get one of my targetssetting a limit on sec status to place bounty is not a good solution i think i might get annoyed by a positive sec player hmm ninja salvager comes to mind and i cant place a bounty on him
give the contract a certain activation time and the victim gets a mail notifying him that a bounty has been placed on his head tho it shouldnt say by whom or who accepted the contract
 U043DU043FU043BU043EU043E
now i didnt read the post but i wantted to point out that your not supposed to be able to put a bounty on someone unless there sec rating is below 1 not sure about thisif that was to be maintained wouldnt be easy to exploit as most freighter pilots would obviously not risk it
a plain no  limiting the scope of potential victims to online and nearby would make the system prone to abuse eg espionage stalking stuff i guess this is not in line with the op intention  the bounty amount doesnt tell anything of the opponent in opposite to traditional rats so it will happen that you find yourself facing your victim in an absolutely wrong ship making it best case close to impossible to even scratch your victim or worst case surprisingly seeing your pod in space right where your ship just used to be while this might be in line with the op intention i doubt itll make the bounty system more attractive to anyone  additionally bounty agents wouldnt be in line with the way the bounty system works while you may freely as long as the prey meets the requirements put a bounty of any amount to anyones head and for whatever reason your imagination is capable of thinking a bounty agent as it is proposed would provide you with a well sorted listhowever as i agree with the idea of overhauling the entire bounty system i would instead propose to have the locator agents made more freely accessible to anyone so you dont have to run missions over and over in order to get usable results this would even be more in line with the usual bounty hunter stories of picking a valuable target tracking it down and finally getting it hold

ensure that all 1200 are spamming the scan button and pressing every ship command 50 times
this combined with bigger watchlists
no support bigger fleets do not need more help they need less
fix lag firstthen bigger blobs
what i mean is a ship a tad bigger than a battleship that gives a 5 to race bonuses ie 5 to armor warfare links whatever the titan bonus is some new gang links is good vs light support and crap against anything bigger and can use gates also has a small corp hanger to carry loot
well at last we have a role for the hypothetical t2 carrier

rank 16 charisma based skill well why not
rank 16 i will hate you forever if that happens i support the need for larger fleets
if you have other suggestions related to this please voice them as there will be time in iceland to discuss them with ccp
first whatre we talking about here afterburners ab boost speed by providing extra thrust the ship stays relatively constant but it gets pushed harder personally id like to see ab leave a trail or something so you can tell when its running micro warp drives mwd boost speed by generating momentary warp bubbles the ship goes into warp briefly and then comes out over and over personally id like to see the old shield bubble effect used for these as the warp bubble forms and collapses repeatedly warp scramblers scram disrupt the guidance of the micro warp drive they prevent the ship from resolving the destination properly standard warp drives resolve a destination several au ahead while mwd resolve a destination several meters ahead if they cant resolve the destination the safety protocols wont allow warp stasis webifiers web reduce ship speed by ensnaring them in micro tractor beams1 according to all this an inty is the single worst ship to use as a tackler simply because its the smallest and lightest ship around and attempting to lasso a battleship with one should only result in an inty going along for the ride2 webs also shouldnt have much of an effect on an mwd because the ship is actually warping ahead of itself so it should easily slip out of the tractor beams grasp with each pulsethe problem apparent here is that some think the scram and the web are creating the same effect scram disables the module while web only gums up the worksone resolution would be to change the training necessary for webs to include the same kind of stuff as needed for tractor beams because there is no real ew involved in a webif you really want to get down to it then the two boosters should have their own specific countersmwd  scramandab  weband they should have no effect on the otheryou want to be the official tackler then you have to fit both one to slow them down and one to keep them from running away
multiple webs on 1 target each increase the effect multiple scrams dont a webbed mwding target may go faster then a scrammed target but the webbed ship has a much larger sig and is easier to lockhithowever my ashimu would love to get 99 webs so yes please
i would just raise the webs to something like 7075 the nerf was needed but was too heavyhanded imo alternatly they could make it falloff based where at pointblank you get 90 speed and at longer ranges the strength is reduced
your neut bonus is already a 99 web p
i would like to see an increase to 66 seems reasonable
i agree here
just add more webs noobs pvp orientated people always complain about wanna be solo players here you are asking to make a module stronger when the solution is to have more people using that module bring in nubs as your webscram peeps and train them up more people in 00low wherever you are fighting
this not supported
if you want to do that you could do it much more easily with just a simple program that duplicates your keyboard and mouse input to a second maschine you dont need voice control for that anyway i beliebe the idea is great it just adds a little bit more fun to the game and im pretty sure that it does not affect macropilots at all if it is done correctly i know that it would be nonsense to add a command target next veldspar but if a pilot already has a target lock on an object what is wrong about being able to say hold fire or open private chat in order to talk to your vitim i would say let ccp decide what they actually make out of it but the idea itself is great and should be supportedsigned
its a bump
yes that is why i said these items are very rare and very expensive and need to be fixed
hmmm new csm new chance glad someone necroed that 
1 modules rigs skills implants drugs fleet boosts did i miss any24 adding something even if you say isnt mandatory will only mean it is completely mandatory if you want the best you can get and no one will be happy unless they can get their hands on every little bonus availablealso keep in mind who youre asking to implement this ccp does not have the best track record for stuff working well the first time or eversure you have crew which look remarkably like rigs with faces oh and due to a glitch your cap doesnt recharge unless you have a full crew complement onboardor even better those cheap crewmen you found were actually corporate spies seeded at the hubs by goons and i bet you were wondering where all your isk went when you logged in this morning huh
 whats that robot stuff about according to eve background story we allready have crewsalso i dont want to know how much more complex the calculations in battles get if crew in special several crew teams are added to the equation wonder what they would simplify to not cause horrible lag
id actually agree with this as well a nice isk sinkthe only beef i have with this proposal is however that its yet another unnecessary boost as mazzilliu already said  while i love the idea of crews i can see them pushing certain setups out of balancecrews would be a great idea and welcome addition if they had some sort of indirect effect something that doesnt directly affect combat and ideally isnt already being modified by modules skills or rolesthe idea needs some refinement before im willing to support it
afraid of one more level of complexity possibly unbalancing things simple scrap fleet boosts they have never made any sense  numeric superiority and good coordination seem to offer enough of an advantage on their own
first solo player your insaneback to the opi think slots for ship crew would be cool these crew would be found in npc wrecks like modules and would have three different versionsof course there would be many different aspects that would receive bonuses but in each area it would only be 05 10 and 15providing that little extra punch to whatever you want them to specialize in once installed they can not be removed if you kill a player ship that say had a crew for 15 to shield amount when you loot the can they would be a downgraded version of 10in closing a slight modifier to a ship is cool but lets keep it relativity low to keep things from being unbalanced i have mixed feelings about the longer they are in a ship the better they get or the more you use the ship the better they get
as it stands once you deactivate a module it may not be reactivated until the cycle completes this potentially poses a minor annoyance for every type of player what my solution is would be simply allow the module to be activated if mistakenly deactivated or otherwise a minor nuisance but i feel reasonable enough to request changingeditthis is seen by the coloration of the modules outline which can be green active red deactivating upon cycle completion and none module is neither active nor deactivating what i am suggesting is that this allow you to switch from red to green obviously without circumventing the cycle timer that way you can run afterburners strip miners armor repairs etc and should you mistakenly click on the icon you have the ability to basically unclick it thus preventing speed loss waiting until cycle is done on a miner or letting your tank break in a mission as per above examples
how would you tellif you have instant deactivation itd just be a way to get around a modules rof
the op is not asking that we have instant deactivation rather that we can tell the client that we want to reactivate the module before it completes its cyclefor example if you deactivate a hardener you could immeadiately click on it and have it continue running on the next cycle if you deactivated a gun you could select a new target for it but it would not fire at the new target until the current cycle completedwhat would be nice to go along with this would be the ability to schedule ammoscript changes without waiting for the cycle to complete if the ammoscript is changed midcycle the client simply waits until the current cycle finishes then completes the requested changei support this idea but i do not think it is a high priority
supporting my topic also edited it for clarity not a high priority fix just something id know id use quite often
im sure everyone who plays eve has a computer that can play eve what is your pointare you supporting the removal of our personal client settings if so why
it isnt about prices eve isnt a game where you need to see the action in space to win your hud and target icons along with the overview show you all you need so there is no need to have a greatuber system to run eve yet ccp ups the requirements and removes options reset all clients to high settings to show off the damn planets i should be able to run this game on a far crappier system than i do i have several other programs running sometimes i run up to 3 clients and id like eve not to look like total crap when it resets my perspective to inside my ship or thereabout to increase fps and reduce the lag that the worse client since dominion or summer expansion it has gotten more resource intensive i run other clients on medium does it matter lowmed no not really i can set it all to low but only until ccp decides that makes their game look like crap and they cant have that cough cough eve classic cough so i say no to low and high only medium means if something goes it should be low but theyve gone outside the box and removed medium so people wont complain you still have low the only thing next to remove is low or upping low and high requirements leaving no wiggle room
it seems to me this assembly hall is to get ideas that we would like to see in the game its not to inform ccp about the technichalsoftware coding difficulty of implenting the idea if ccp would have difficulty from a technical side than that would go into their consideration of implementing it but if people like the idea they should vote to have ccp look into it
disallow activation of any sort of module capable of affecting another ship within dockingjump range in empire once in nullsec anything goesremoves the undock gotry limits the lame logistics jumping backandforth and resolves a ton of lag at hub stationsif i was the proprietor of a business i would take a sledgehammer to anyone who started fighting in my lobbyparkinglot  then i would call the cops to clean up the messas for mechanics supporting arranged fights canflipping does that very well currently  only thing broken with what we have is that people have no honour and readily undock a small fleet to gank whomever is foolish enough to agree to a fair fight not sure if our despicable human nature should be controlled too much  supposed to be a game where you sell you sister into slavery to get ahead
arbitrator vs eagleyou cant balance on isk
i have fantastic ecm skills so i would be giddy about an arena i would be happy to ruin peoples days in an arena this doesnt make it a good idea 1v1 would boil down to who got the first ecm hit on the other player team vs team would be interesting but you would have to limit logistics like the alliance tournament or you may end up with a lot of neverending fights

would ccp really give the procurer gas harvesting bonuses and would the procurer be able to out harvest the retriever which have a 1 harvester advantageif the answer is no to either then the procurer is still without much use
yeah give procurer double bonuses to gas cloud harvesters and allow it to fit 3
yes the skill tree for mining profession dosent make senseprocurer should be the first ship a noob miner gets after a frigate and he should get it fairly fastdont agree with the op on nondedicated miners because nondedicated miner would still get a retriver and a procurer mines less per minute than a t1 cruiser so its just useless except for noob miners who cant fly cruiserson the gas harvesting bonus no way maybe some new t2 ship or maybe add another bonus to the mackinawskif so it gets a dualrole
not if you throw in a 4x harvesting bonus and a compression bonus for the cargo hold
bonusesthat aside you can out perform a procurer in a battlecruiser with mining lasers i know ive seen me do it they definitely need a looking over
gas harvesting mechanic is not yeld based like regular mining or time based like ice mining its turret based as in you get to use one more turret every skill level  i dont see how you can fit a singleturreted ship in this mechanic bonus or not bonus
i would think a very large bay that can only hold gas would be easier to implement
two pointsthe most important is that ccp truly does not have the logs you think they do take a step back and think what machine is responsible for taking logs thats right its the machine thats coughing and wheezing when it comes to multimachine simulations like mmos there is no single timeline that is true all of them simply have degrees of truth to themsecond it is in ccps strongest interests to not admit to the lag problem that every single 00 player knows exists they have to control the pr and the last thing they need is people making blog posts and quoting a gm about how their ship got reimbursed so theres clearly a problemnow what i still cannot figure out is why they cannot emulate this effect unless the issues are coming from upstream of them ie theyre not buying enough bandwidth for their own good these battle problems should be 100 reproducible and this should be in their ticket log as a blocker because it is basically undermining our faith in the feasibility of playing the game
i dont really think this should be a terribly difficult thing if one pilot mashes jump then goes to plug their john for the next half hour instead of playing eve sure dont reimburse it was obvious because it was only one playerbut it is a big stretch to say that an entire fleet collectively took a dump together i mean if the server logs show that 500 people jumped into a system and proceeded to not play the game for the next half hour i think the lost ships should be reimbursed at that pointthe logs have the facts in this situation unlike other strange mechanics that had deserved reimbursement but could not be proved in the past it is the huge gaping black hole of nothing happening that should flag the situation

this has been part of many improve mining threads but i feel this change goes beyond the scop of improving mining but for expanding gas harvesting as a professionreplace the 3 yield bonus from strip miners to specialized gas harvester modules maybe 22m3 but with a longer cycle time than tii harvesters plus a gas compression bonus to the barges cargoholdgive it a 2nd high slot to fit in a probe launcher
the problem with that is that a maximized gas harvesting cruiser can take in 100 m3 you would have to make it so the module would be more efficient without completely overwhelming the cruiser modulesgas is such a pain to harvest that it keeps the prices high if you make it too much easier to harvest you would sink the prices for gasses and therefore the costs of t3 ships and boosters this would require a delicate balancingalso the procurer is pretty much beyond repair the best idea would be to refit the skiff to do this while i can agree to some of these points in an extended view i cannot support this idea as it stands now
the problem is that the skiff already has specific boni that it uses to perform its job wellif a perfectly set up cruiser can mine 100m3cycle then the procurer with equal skill training time should be able to mine that amount even if it requires a longer module cyclethe perk can be applied to the cargo bay cruisers without expansions can run about 600m3 given a compression bonus allow the procurer to hold 1000m3 although this is limited to gasses onlythis will make the ship more viable without affecting production yield and help keep the value of gases at a manageable rateit should be a viable ship choice for hisec gas mining the skiff would be geared to lownull as the intention of other exhumers
of course

considering hugin is designed for webbing and is not a cloaked recon it must have a web stenght boost to get a dual bonus on his main weapon wich is the web like the curse have on neutra i think a 75 bonus per recon skillinstead of the target painter bonus that nobody use on a hugin level would be a good think making a pilot with recon 5 have 825 web strenght
there have been countless requests for a web strength bonus on the hugrapier ever since they were nerfed but i think that with the current combat philosophy 82 would be too much 5 per level sounds more reasonable imo for 75 webs
there is even without additional intel tools we propose in this topicyou would be surpised how people can adopt to no loacl envoirment only lazy or unlucky people actually die in wspacetrue
a big problem with getting fair fights of neareven numbers in eve is that the current stats on killboards reward only fights where your side hugely outnumbers the other sideplayers and corps soon learn that the way to get good efficiency is to never undock or engage in battles except at 3to1 or even better oddsas a result it becomes really hard to find neareven battles which are far more enjoyabletherefore enable killboards to be able to pull up blobometers for players and corps average number of ships in your gang vs the other gang in battles average ship point value of your side vs the other side in battlesthis can show right away whether corps and players have good stats because they just blob or whether they engage on fair fights or outnumbered onesperformance metrics are hugely powerfulinstall blobometers and somenot all corps and players that specialize in neareven or outnumbered fights will be able to identify and regular pvp against other corps that are similarand they can aim for stats they can be proud of look the stat shows we fight outnumbered instead of only showing lower efficiency than blobbing outfits
killboards are in no way associated with ccp why would you put this in the assembly hallthis could easily be modded on top of the edk most likely even though i have a hard time making much sense of your suggestions at alledit not to mention how many glaring holes the suggestion hashow do you define a battle should you have a scoring system for different ship types a person in a merlin is not exactly as useful as a person in a falcon who keeps that up to date
clarification of suggestionenable killboards to be able to display the following stats for players and corps average number of ships in your side vs the other side in battles average ship point value of your side vs the other side in battleshmm yeah maybe its a suggestion for edk insteadthe reason i suggested it here was because i thought ccp may need to release some sort of statistical help via api to enable edk to display thisbasically when you look at a person or corps kb now you just mainly see efficiency killratio and number of killspeople who blob regularly actually usually have better stats than ace players who engage solo or against tougher oddstherefore i think kbs should also have stats on numericalship point odds the person engages at to complete the pictureyeah its going to be hard to figure out but any improvementimperfect additional ratio is better than none
dont think it would take much cpu at all and api output is cached anywaybelieve that the information is lacking because the whole thing is an afterthought that was never really completedthink there is an issue where bpo and bpc actually look the same in the database thus them not having different iconsif they redesignfix the icon issue then making api report original vrs copy should be easiershouldnt be much issue to include the meperuns fields just work that no one has been assigned to finishhint you can actually compile your mepe information from lab jobs finishing and reporting the blueprint info in api however its not a very accurate technique

this isnt even just affecting the rokh though it would have to be balanced around such since its the most likly to overshadow other ships if made overpowered it would also offer a much needed boost to the megathron as a sniper which in the current state certainly needs to be offered something to become competetive once moreif you include reload times in dps things get even worse asn you start to see the rokh do less damage against armor and far less damage against shields theres no excuse for this as the apoc dosent suffer any penalties to balance this out
i wasnt trying to use it as a comparison to the rokh i wanted to use the armageddon and abaddon as a comparison to the megathron and hyperion bagehi made some claims about what could be done with those ships and i want to see if there is any truth in those claimsi will need to explore the mega beam setups some more the apoc setup that altaica amur provided is a glass cannon that doesnt stand a chance against a properly setup rokh he left two empty slots on his rokh setup and really made no effort to get anything out of it i expect problem is with his setups as they dont appear to properly represent what should be done with either ship this is not intended to be a personal attack it is just that those setups dont show the rokh as being weaker however i am having a harder time finding the specific flaw in his apoc setup and would welcome alternative suggestionsi am still looking for those setups with the setups that push out to 220 km that i have looked at so far i have not been able to get the apoc to come out on top but i am likely missing something i expect to keep looking for a better apoc setup maybe by shortening the expected ranges a bit like you suggest 190200km not 220250km i can give the apoc a reasonable buffer instead of fitting it as a glass cannon
define glass cannon do you look at eft ehp or armor shield buffer since now that there are no area effect dds fleet bs ehp is significantly lower is 50k too little
i look at eft ehp using the expect damage profilesince he didnt finish fitting the rokh i figured i would do it myselfthe rokh deals 3207 raw dps and against the aurora damage profile has 76350 ehpthe apoc deals 4015 raw dps and against the spike damage profile has 32231 ehpconclusion apoc dies on the 20th volley from the rokh 105 seconds if 1v1 the rokh would die on the 28th volley from the apoc 192 seconds if 1v1 the rokh kills the apoc setup almost twice as fast as the apoc can kill the rokh and that is giving the apoc the benefit of staying within its 231km optimal my rokhs setup has an optimal of 253 decreasing that would allow for an even stronger tank sure the apoc can kill the rokh faster than the rokh can kill another rokh but what use is that if the apoc cant take the return fire from a rokh that is why i said that altaica amurs setup appears to be a glass cannon lots of raw dps but cant take the return fire
the drake seems to be good enough or perhaps even slightly opnerf it and caldari have what left pi do think that the drake should be slightly nerfed for pvp somehow
just fyi this thread deals with railguns not with caldari ships although theyre some of them related with that kind of artillery actually involves more gallente than caldari shipstherefore i do agree with you most caldari ships are already good enough but plz dont derail the subject
might use rails for gangs without being laughed at
they were glass cannons primarily for the purpose of examining turret preformance since thats what this thread is about to fit the rokh with similar focus upon turret preformance would simply put it further beyond the lock limit of 249 at which range the apoc will still be doing similarmore damage then a rokhhowever ill entertain youtach apoc2x heat sink iitracking enhancer ii1600mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates i2x reactor control unit iidamage control ii3x sensor booster ii targeting rangequad lif fueled i booster rockets8x tachyon beam laser ii aurora llarge algid energy administrations unit ilarge energy locus coordinator ilarge ancillary current router irokh3x magnetic field stabilizer iidamage control iicapacitor power relay iiquad lif fueled i booster rocketslarge shield extender iicap recharger ii2xsensor booster ii targeting rangeinvulnerability field ii8x 425mm railgun ii spike llarge ancillary current router ilarge hybrid locus coordinator ilarge ancillary current router iend result is rokh has more ehp apoc has more damage and yeah in a sniper duel rokh would probably win unfortunately sniper duels dont exactly happen fleet fights do and in fleet fights apoc gets the benefit of the eleventy billion ships with armor rr fitted while the rokh cries because its a shield tank now you can certainly make the argument that the rokh still ends up getting a fitting advantage as a result of its range bonus making its life easier allowing it to become a tankier sniper however since the primary purpose remains shooting the other guy the fact that its survivable is a nice benefit to get for paying for a tier 3 ship while sill being burdened with low damagealso to prove the point well try a tankier mega beam setup on for sizeapocalypse new setup 12x heat sink iitracking enhancer ii1600mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates i2x adaptive nano plating iidamage control iitracking computer ii optimal rangequad lif fueled i booster rockets2x sensor booster ii targeting range8xmega beam laser ii aurora llarge trimark armor pump ilarge ancillary current router ilarge trimark armor pump imore damage more ehp then the rokh only disadvantage is range and then not by much they key here is while the rokh only has one weapons system and a fitting advantage the apoc has two weapons system and a damage advantage which can be sold down for more ehp which is easier to aquire thanks to the natural advantages of armor at this size the key problem lies in the low damage output forcing you to maximize damage in the fit to be viable then forcing you to fit shield tanking mods with the ships bonus and the fact that theres nothing else to do oddly mid slots being less useful due to the tracking computer nerf which should also be fixed and the fact that fitting mods are all low slots
i am not an eve veteran however i have been playing a couple of years i am originally a gallente pilot i have now cross trained all races mostly because of the arms races that go on in eve blasters are king no now its missiles hang on lasers are freaking awesome now but that alpha from projectiles is attractive so from my experience in eve and eft warrioring like mad i see thisusing railsgallente sniper boats lack tracking even a lvl5 mega pilot and alpha high rof though they also suffer from slightly lower ranges however this is a racial balance as they have sensor damps although they need a boostcaldari have extreme range and good dps god awful tracking at this range however they are the bastard child shield tanker and would only be good in a rokh fleet with shield logistic support wont happenusing beamsphenomenal tracking and good range heavy dps moderate alpha heavy cap usage but 1 sec crystal changeusing projectilesunbelievable alpha strike and at the higher end of the dps battle moderate dps with good tracking capless weapon system but the lowest rangeso in summary when snipingrails  extreme range if youre a rohk pilot  high rof with low dps and very low alphabeams  good range high dps extreme tracking  good alpha with high capacitor usageprojectiles  extreme alpha strike good tracking good dps  capless weapon with low rangeso where does the balancing beginthis is a very difficult question but i think perhaps switching the tracking between artys and beams could be a start artys do have lowest range and should have the best tracking but beams hold the crownincreasing dps of rails i think might not be the way forward however what about a rof increase to rails this would have the drawback of heavier cap  ammo usage of rails would give some extra dps and give rails a real secondary advantage

very constructive post sir did you miss the hac comparisons or the 425mms to mega beamsof course you did thats why you post inanitiesagain if you compare apoc mega beams with rokh 425mm and mega 425mm with similar fittings and all of them having an optimal of 180190 then apoc does a 116 the dps of a rokh and 119 the dps of a mega as far as buffer not ehp if you are in structure in a sniper fleet you are dead warp out you fool all 3 have roughly 14k of armor shield with the mega showing the highest ehp due to high structure and dcu ii btw and so that we have all bases covered if you look at a tempest 1400mm it has an optimal of 140 but with 70km falloff has no issue to deliver the exact same dps an apoc doesas an aside if someone came here and asked that apoc get 30 cpu more id support itbut in the end it comes down to this when comparing similar fitted ships with the same class of weapons apoc and tempest do at least 16 more damage at the same range when compared to rokh and mega thus railguns need a 15 dmage increase to be able to compete at those ranges
you are probably right however that would completely remove the apocs raw damage advantage over the rokh given the popularity of armour the rokh would see a much larger effective damage advantage over the apocthe rokh sucks and the rokh uses railguns therefore railguns need to be boosted non sequitur the more you importance you place on armor the worse the apoc will look when compared to the rokhthose setups were entertaining the apoc has a 11 advantage in raw dps but the rokh has a 13 advantage in effective dps against the eleventy billion ships with armor rr fitted the rokh has a longer optimal range and falloff both are similar in cap usagenow for a crazy observation swap a few modules and lets see what else we can do with the rokh replace as followscapacitor power relay ii  energized adaptive nano membrane iilarge shield extender ii  cap recharger iiinvulnerability field ii  tracking computer ii optimal rangelarge hybrid locus coordinator i  large trimark armor pump ilarge ancillary current router i  large trimark armor pump inow look at the comparison the new setup has 10 less ehp than the previous rokh setup but it still has 24 more ehp than the apoc further the rokh has 9 more armor ehp than the apoc and it has better armor resistances so the eleventy billion ships with armor rr fitted are even more effective in helping the rokh than the apoc armour tanked rokh stupid but still more effective than that apoc setup still need to take a closer look at that mega beam laser setup and cross compare with the megathron and rokh i will let you know what i find
1st mistake fitting rigs in a fleet bs2nd mistake insisting on using tachyons3rd mistake selectively disregarding the data and analyses from people that live in 00 and have taken part in the fleet fights were using in our case studyyoure outdid i not present the facts in a concise and easy to understand way lets see them againon deimos i updated the data with a fit that a member of my alliance brought to my attention and was able to improve on managing to reach eagle performancei dont see you bringing anything to counter these arguments to the table apart from the buffer and resists so lets look at them
ok if i understand this correctly you expect laser users to get the same if not similar damage on armor as rails do but getting a massive bonus to hitting shields for free thats not balance and if you think it is then you dont understand what balance is lasers are high dps weapons that favor hitting shields and disfavor hitting armor rails are midlow dps weapons that dont favor either they do the same damage to shields and armor so logically balancing things would put rails as doing more damage to armor currently they dont in fact ruling in reloads pegs rail dps as being less on armor then lasers as i pointed out in a previous post even weighting damage vs armor as mattering 3x more then damage vs shields a 15 boost in dps or rof for that matter would still keep rails average dps 224 currently 257 after 15 boost less then lasers 260true if there were no shields in the game at all the apoc wouldnt be nearly so powerful compared to the rokh however there are shields and even if we choose to put less importance on them then armor the damage shields receive shouldnt be completely ignored or else have it normalized while you may ignore the 65 more damage shields receive that range is where rails should be damage wise probably around 20 above laser damage on armor but well take 15 to respect lasers as a higher damage weapon overall rails a weapons system that does equal damage to both armor and shields shouldnt be constrained by the poor damage lasers do to armor while they do so much more damage to shieldsnumbersrail dps current15 boostraw 320368vs armor 224258vs shields 224258average 224258laser dpsraw 401vs armor 223vs shields 370average 296

what fleet bs setups would you suggest that we compare can you provide an independant reference to support the claim that rigs should not be used on fleet bssi am not insisting on using tachyons i am currently reviewing the alternatives but so far they dont look much differentwhat data or analyses have i ignoredcare to share your full setups so that all of the comprimises in fitting can be seenalso can you show what side effects this change will have on ships other than hacsi am still looking at comparing all these ships comparing 4 ships rokh apoc mega temp is alot more work than comparing 2 ships so far i would point out that it is no more reasonable to expect the megathron to compete at 190km than it is to expect the apoc to compete at 220km the megathrons appears to prefer ranges closer to 170kmthe tempest is starting to look promising all the more so because of its advantage with damage type and its ablity to fit rrs along with a proper gankwell there is the huge problem with fitting tank or gank but not both rails also have a range disadvantage railgun ships with bonuses out range laser ships with bonuses railgun ships without bonuses out range laser ships without bonues armor is used everywhere in pvp for several reasons as such if lasers could not deal reasonable damage against armor they would be useless in pvp yes i expect laser users to get huge damage advantage on shieldsstructure thats what makes them different from projectileshybrid and reasonable damage on armor but not for free they pay to do so401 dps for lasers on what ship the mega beam laser apoc that you provided only deals 331 dps and we have seen why your tachyon apocs dont work very wellshieldarmorstructureapoc 306184331rokh 224224320also you can expect to take a strait average of damage to shields and armor when fleets fit 5050 armor and shield tanks as it is armor rules supreme in fleet combat you cannot completely ignore the effect of shield and structure but atleast make some attempt to put them in their proper context ccp is well aware of how significant armor tanking is in pvp dont expect them to ignore that fact when rebalancing hybrids
yes it is thats why we are using benchmarks and similar fits and not arbitrarily throw some mods togetherdont be lazy similar ones have been posted on this and other forums many times also you might want to check public kbs the reason that i am not posting them is that they are the result of a lot of trial and errors and that cost us quite a bit if you want to compensate me for serving them on a silver platter ill take a modest gift of 250 mil for them optimization is a very lucrative business and it costs quite a bit so pay up and ill send them to yousee above multiply the dps and alpha for both railbs by 115presto

quoting youi dont see the op getting correctedon another notehurricanes are vastly easier to tackle than drakes missile ships are the bane of smaller speed tankers for example a hurricane is not going to do any damage to you even if you get webbed however drakes will still do damage to you even if you dont get webbed additionally hurricanes usually use 3 medium2 light drone split which does reduced damage to interceptors than 5 light drones that drakes usually fieldand sacrilege are not known for heavy missiles because it gets 25 more damage for hams ship bonus
thats because i havnt changed it yetwhen when i feel like doing iti am only going to update it for non relevant dominion ships and factor in the 33 of rof damage anywaysthe current op understates the issues with kin bonuses somewhat as it assumes 25 for rofmost competent cane pilots fit a neut  drakes can too although a med neut on a drake requires more compromises that aside if your minimum orbit distance is outside 12km  neut range  a cane will hit a ceptor  not everytime but it will still get hits every 2030 seconds or so especially if the cane is mwding and the ceptor is at a periapsisapoapsis if those are big hits then you could lose your ceptor drakes damage against a fast orbiting ceptor are very low  aml drakes excepted  and if your the ceptor pilot you know exactly when to leave if you need to leave at allso stating that constant damage is preferable to random damage is wrongdrones dont come into the arguments as we were talking about missilegun constant damage v random damagebtw cane has 30m3 drone bay  1 med  4 lights or 6 light  1 reserve poster stated that sac cant fit hmls which is incorrect
dav bonuses get dropped all the timelet me think armor bonus on brutix is ignored many times on the command ships as welldamp bonus on gallente recons is often ignoreddamage bonus on thorax is often ignoredi can think of a bonus on amarr frigates that gets dropped punishers fitting autocannons instead of lasersjust to list a few somewhere you said missile damage isnt high i think it is damage is dependent on range missiles have lots of range lots of range and the damage done at range is alot you get no penalty to damage at range so getting slightly less damage than other systems debatable is a good tradeoff for being able to engage at any range doing full not losing damage for range damage
brutix arazulachesis thorax  punisher all have fits that give 100 of there respective bonuses 100 of the time when using there respective combat tacticscmbs do not
ill grant you the hurricane point because i havent done research on the likeliness of an interceptor getting hit at further ranges however id like to say that short range interceptors and tech 1 frigates especially the ones with a small nosferatu will be able to tackle and perhaps kill hurricanes with impunity so the situation can go either wayarm kinetic missiles there oh but i know what youre going to do youre going to assert that pure kinetic missiles is not caldaris combat tacticsyour argument is dumb and you know it toostil harkonnen sometimes ships with one usable bonus are still balanced for example the brutix few uses its armor repair efficiency bonus and none makes use of it in pvp combatdav varan but theoretically some random guy may strap an armor repairer on it and utilize its bonuses to their fullest extentjames tritanius uh if you fit kinetic missiles on the drake you can get full bonuses out of that toodav varan yeah but it conflicts with the caldari combat tactics tmsince youll probably call me troll for this and completely miss the point i figured that i better include an explanation and here it is that was a mock conversation to illustrate the absurdity of your position
cmbs do have fits that give 100 of there respective bonuses 100 of the time when using there respective combat tactics its called use the missiles with racial damage ammo typeedit beaten by james regarding 1 and 2 do you have problem understanding your own text in both cases i was referring to your statement which i actually quoted there relevant to the ability of the ship it sits on  yes of course it is in compound sentence the pronoun in second part usually refers to subject of previous onei said oh so now other attributes are relevant tooyou concurred relevant to the ability of the ship it the ability of the ship sits on  yes of course it isyou say maller is tank modded ship therefor it doesnt need damage increase i can easily say the same about drake the fact the drake gets bonus to caldari racial damage is a plus not disadvantage as you claim to be the same for apocalypse vs cerberuscaracalbut im repeating myself
up ygocouldnt agree more that lowsec needs a major boost and these for the most part sound like great ideas
this needs to be fixed ccp

signed seems silly they didnt think of this already
how i see it is like thisyour fleet commander is already in the system with a hostile gang enganged  blah blah not too much detail you jump in UFFFD as an armour tank you get your instant hp and are able to help out as a fleetUFFFD as a shield tank you jump in with an increase of around 1hps shield recharge however you do not receive the bonus of hp youve lost outthe reason i think it should be applied instantly is that if you think about your argument that the extra shield recharge is enough to warrant not applying an instant hp increase you need to consider the fact that this is how shield tanks work they have recharge you can not change that without changing how you have the ships in eve
i use shield gang boosts with my buddies and like them the way they are we fly hisec and are not usually involved in war command ships are used when doing mission ops or cosmos sites etc the recharge rate boost they give is much appreciated we use a lot of passive shield tank ships having a command ship lets us introduce new players to team activities that would otherwise be too high risk for themi appreciate most of the earlier posters may be involved in nulsec warfare fair enough however please remember that that is just one segment of the eve community i think it is good that the various command ships have different functionality the vulture is our command ship of choice for our hisec activities i would be dissapointed if it lost the passive recharge bonus
hi you like pve and thats great np but since the actual problem ie this thread is about shield bonus disparity in fleet pvp situations well it kind of makes your whole post mutelets face it pvp and pve are different the ships are differently fit the tactics are different the average pveer isnt using a cap ship for instanceas for the pve what if it lost the fleet bonus to its passive tank really how much difference are we really talking here the things can damn near survive in any lvl 4 with full room agroin a perfect world everyone would realize that shield tanks have passive and active tanks going for them and armor tanks have spider repping better resists better buffer going for them the entire fleet bonus confusion is crap in virtually 99 of pvp cases the passive recharge donkey balls when was the last time someone jumped into a fleet fight and said screw buffer ive got 400 shield recharge per secondthe problem because game breaking obvious when you consider cap ships you almost have to be semi ed to use anything that fires missiles anyway on top of that you get the passive recharge rate of the average hollywood movie and no effective hitpoint bonus sure you get the possibility of those hitpoints and if your fleet fight was scheduled to allow you ten mins to rep up after jumping into system then your fine if not they you should have skilled up armor tanking and brought the right shiptldr the entire crap about its balanced because of passive recharge is  and lets face it everyone making the argument knows it you can not honestly tell me a few extra hps a sec passive recharge is of relative value to say a load more ehps not even close unless your one of those ing idiots that only flies a drake and then you can go  yourself
i agree tactics and ship fittings are different for pvp and pve activitiesas i understand it the proposal is to make a change to shield gang boosts to benefit pvp activitieswhat im trying to point out is that this shouldnt be to the detriment of people who use shield gang boosts in pve activities where the passive recharge rate boost is very usefulpvp and pve are both valid activities in eve
i agree with you theres no reason the fleet bonus shouldnt give the passive shield regen bonusthe fleet bonuses and spidertanking mechanics aside shields and armor are more or less balanced between themselves meaning that neither one has a clear advantage over the other in my opinion the shields should keep their bonused passive recharge and get the ehps immediately from fleet bonusesbarring that armor shouldnt get the effective hitpoint bonus then shields and armor would have to rep up to take advantage of the potential ehpseven though this prolly wont make it past csm this is something i hope ccp notices and considers for a future change

dont worry im a programmer too i can tell you right now its simply not parsing the markup for whatever reason all they need to do is a start parsing markup entered into chat b parse markup entered from the clipboard or c discard markup at copy timelike i said any of those would be acceptable i just hate having to manually delete the tag garbage if i want to relay chat infounfortunately i get the feeling that this idea is too insignificant to be picked up by csm ill have to start looking for other chatrelated suggestions and roll them up into one post
yes this would definitely be awesometrading faction items and the like would also be considerably easier
the point being made i think mp rhianna had nothing to do with income increasing to match the cost growth of replacing a clonethe issue being raised as i see it is at some point for some players clone costs become an issue in 00 it is very easy to loose a clonethe pros to this proposal is it opens up another type of game play to a certain type of player and has no negative effect i can think off on any play style in eve and is a relatively minor change to a few database keys i imaginei think the op is doing it right
not supported maybe you youngns are whining about a few million isk for your clone cost but the point is to discourage you from making risky decisions with your podgod seems like people these days just want riskfree pvp on tranquility if you have 120mil sp and cant make 30mil isk in a reasonable length of time there is some serious fail going on with your playstyle
clone cost should eventually level out i have 50mil sp so i try to not get podded but on occasion it does happen at the moment it doesnt bother me since implants are costing me morei think if i ever got to 100mil sp it would be strongly discourage me from taking risk id rather have more fightshes in loony toons what would you expect
not supported for pretty much the same reason seth outlined aboveanother alternative if highsp players are sufficiently bothered by this they can sell their char and buy a younger cheaper one and the isk difference would then keep their clones uptodate for a good long time ben
well so far everyone thinks this is an ok proposal looking to drum up a little more support maybe from some csms
yeah being able to tell if a character has been sold to a new owner should be implemented and the housekeeping with mail and other stuff sounds more than reasonable
good idea supported

thanks drakei did mention in the op that the current system of placing bounties would remain 200 sec status i think true you couldnt put a bounty on a positive sec status player but this is better than being able to put bounties on anyone i thinkjonah podonline and nearby  i believe if the nearby range was quite large 2030 jumps then this would be less exploitable regarding online status this is just trying to add a bit of fun but i do see that it could be exploited if you came on straight after dt when there are very few ppl online maybe no bounty contracts could be accepted in the first hour after dt bounty office closedin regard to your other points this may not be the best system but as far as i can tell it seems to be the least exploitable so far and thats the real problem at the momenti also dont think the target should become aware when someone is given the contract to kill them maybe just when the initial bounty is placed on them does this happen at present
noyoure dumb
if thats all youre gonna contribute gtfo of this forum section
this would be an espionage system about a hundred times less useful than the buddy list and a locator agent im not worried so what youre saying is these agents dont give you boring predictable pve encounters they actually make you fight players and gather your own intel again not worried given that this is the entire point surely there would be limits on who could get bountied youre right if it was just anyone id be opposed but it presumably wont be it should either be based on kill rights or sec status preferably the former nah if you want npcs do do things for you you need to do things for them like missions its how it works for everything from refinery taxes to market listing fees if you dont like grinding there are people out there who sell standings overall a cool idea its not a complete system but its a good element of one
the proposal says and nowhere it states x status or worse for free killdefinitely not supported too easily exploited for free griefing just spam the minimum bounty value on everyone you see in local then try the agents why not just wardec instead wait with wardecs the decced party also gets killrightsif the hunted at least also got a killright on the hunter when he accepts the contract the proposal would still be bad but less so
all agentoffered bounties ought to be standings based characters with standings 0 should not be bountied by an npc agent as this would make vulnerable new players instead the npc agent could list the three loweststanding characters in the region with bounties of 100k isk or better per 01 standings below standings  0 a character with a 03 standing would have a 300k isk bounty and one with a 09 standing would have a 900k isk bountybut no one above a standing of 0 would receive a bounty
i say drop all player made bounties and go straight to corp standing bounty missions the most negative players to any npc corps standings gets the highest bounty reward many npc corp stations have bounty offices just switch to mission generators and follow what the op said 3 random targets  a small fry a medium then a big fishif you want to play law man work for concord and work sec statusits as simple as that also add in special bounty rewards such as large sums of lp for that corporation and after enough kills decorationsmedals and such
this is the first suggestion on overhauling the bounty system ive seen that actually looks like a good ideasupportedtwo conditionsplacing a bounty is subject to an activation time 7 daystargets have negative sec status or bounty can only be enforced in lowsec to prevent abuse for ganking industrialssome of the opposition in this thread but i dont know what ship the bounty will be flying sounds like carebear whining its up to the bounty hunter to decide if they have the balls for their profession
thanks for the feedback dmac88 and herschel yamamoto  however still no support from me even though i can understand your perspective its just that i try to imagine a bounty system interesting enough to make me becoming a bounty hunterreading your comments herschel yamamoto i get the impression of no changes at all being necessary to the current bounty system locating a target easy buddy list and a locator agent will do the jobthis i doubt grinders usually dont do pvp so they probably miss the standings required to use the usable ones of the locator agents this is why i proposed to allow easier access to locator agents  and may it be for the sole sake of bounty hunting so others would still have to grindpicking an appropriate target gathering intel as usual you say find him follow him get him thats the way it is now and it is obviously not fun enough  additionally the names in the list are basically meaningless as i doubt passive or dead characters are being removed from it also the reason for the bounty is unknown etc ppthis is  as far as i understood dmac88  where the bounty agents come into the game they shall provide you with a suitable whatever this may exacly be at least it should be alive in feasible distance and maybe other criteria target with chances of finding it not being too close to infinite impropabilitythats the point from an opposite perspective in fact this is what i would expect when starting hunting but im not john doe and i expect especially new players and old mission runners as well to be absolutely not prepared they would most definately take any bounty agent acting more or less the same as pve agents finally offering pve like targets big fun for the targets for sure but not for the hunters i guess  as i understood the op proposing an addition to the current bounty system so the only limiting factor is your sec stat which is ridiculous imho as this in turn provides you with an easy way to stay immune to being bountied all the timelets add another addition to the bounty system and allow only real victims to place a bounty ie youve been shot at your ship andor pod destroyed whatever concord or ded may be able to find in their records and force them to add a reason maybe predefined maybe not plus drop the sec stat limit this in conjunction with bounty agents might be way more interesting than the current system plus the agents only just a spontaneous idea though
though not so extreme a rank its just a bigger fleet maybe keep it at 12 or 1314
sweet a new leadership skill to max out
preciselyben
no i think its a good limit because it forces such a massive fleet to have multiple commanders with excellent leadership skills allowing one person to bonus across 1000 people is ridiculous
okay this attitude i simply dont understand do you know how 00 fleet sizes are determined you take everyone who can show up and you put them in a fleet it doesnt matter how much support or opposition there is from ccp and it definitely doesnt matter how big the ingame fleets are because everyone just uses vent to fc with anyways the only difference that this would make is that the game would be less annoying and thered at least be a slight chance of people using ingame tools at least a little bit this isnt about encouraging big fleets its about acknowledging reality and trying to help ease things a little with it instead of trying to resist it futilely
second thiswhoever wants smaller fleets shall make huge fleets pointless until then have the engine support what its breed asks for 
not supportedwhile the current system my not reduce blobs it does however make you bring more fleet bonus trained pilotsallowing one guy to bonus 1200 people is ridiculous needing multiple fleets means you need multiple titans and multiple fleet command ships
as for the pin i do not disagree but as it stands having an authenticator would do the job and keep things secure
authenticator should be mandatory to reduce on ipo  i got hacked scams p
no thanks  old hugsraps were far to op in gate camps even with reliable mwdnow without reliable mwd any increase in ranged web power just takes us back to the bad old days
the real issue here is that warp scrams are once again powerful one slot two big boost modules like sensor boosters  damps  tracking computers etc used to beyet ccp introduced them without scripttherefor not supportedwebs in general are fine at 60minmatar recons could use a bit of oomph with 70725 however
i dont know how to fit a full tackle onto a ship because im a total noob or how to get into the right range i want my battleship to be a solopwnmobile in low sec and i need stasis webs jacked up again to do it please csm make this idea pass i cant imagine having to fit a scrambler onto my ship and a webifier
i was watching a clip from battlestar galactica and i loved the missile effects in that along with the explosions now i know that is prerendered cinematics and this is a game that has to be able to run at least decently on even basic modern integrated nonintel graphics cards however i would love it ifa the bright light especially on larger missiles is greatly reduced and possibly replaced with an actual model yes i know there is a cone their but that is unseeable by the bright lightb a smoke trailc more emphasis on the smoke traild smaller explosions in general but the explosions are more firey or emery that impacts different parts of the outside of the ship and not the center of the ship and having a hundred torpedoes all against once target all those explosions get very dull very quicklye i really dont care if their arent visible launchers on the outside of the ship but i dont want missiles to come out from different parts of the ship
bump
fine arguments keep them cominghmmm thid sounds a bit like slave labour  go on i like it  maybe just for faction crews thoughso as not to threaten your current comfortable status quo i say more bonus but at higher costs actually this might be a means to address existing misbalancesagreed  crew experience should be untransferable or at most at a high penalty reduced by 50 per transferagain why the fear this is a major point of this proposal create an incentive to keep a ship alive of course just parking a ship in station should not yield experience fighting more than mining and pvp more than pve as risk should precedeincrease reward
i think that this would help clear things upmake the server only update the state of the module at each cycleallow a user to switch on and off as many times as they like but if the model is off when it cycles it will be off till turned on however if you turn it off and on again before the end of the cycle it will remain onthis seems fair i understand that ccp might not like this as it can spam data to the servers but a change in code to get the state and apply it each cycle might be better aswell with the current groups feature
supporting this i know its annoyed me a few times
this is a small change that carry a great improvement small changes are the best changes
same here
its especially fun in a close fight where you misclick when trying to overheat something
freaking supported hah
hell yes and ill harass a certain csm to raise this
support good idea
yes earl grey please and ill have the chocolate cake with custard if you dont mind
allowing you to reactivate a mod while it is flashing red makes sense to me maintaining cycle time of course
i would like to see this
supported
great idea i know ive wished it was implemented many a time when my macs keys got stickyed
im kinda split on this its a minor annoyance at worst but eh i ran into this last night with my active hardeners so ill support assuming its a quick and easy fix
makes sense to me
yeah it can be screwed up at times

hi folkshere is a proposal to increase involvement in militias create a stickier eve community and probably have an incrementally positive impact on ccp revenueit is a bit of an extension to the tax changes recently enacted1 impose a small maybe 3  5 minimum tax on every corporation2 player corporations then optionally choose to send that tax to one of the 4 militias if they dont choose a militia the tax goes to concord npc corporations are associated with their own race3 divide each militias tax receipts on a periodic basis perhaps weekly among the participants in the militia pro rata based on the value of ships each player has destroyed plus the value of ships that player has lost over some longer period of time like maybe the last month4 give players recognitionrank based on their individual financial contribution to the militia please note that a player corporations choice of race to support or choice to remain neutral concord is important because it will have an effect on all members of that corporation as they are taxed and recognized for their contribution to the corresponding militia5 allow players to donate to the militia and thus the players fighting again earning rankrecognitioni believe this will accomplish the following1 move some players toward active pvp militia community play since they will get some financial reward for killing and being killed2 create some anthropological sense of purpose and recognition for mission running support of the cause3 ultimately this will also increase asset destruction via pvp which should in turn increase demand for plex and ccp revenuecommentscoffee wired
why not allow me to send my money to a 00 alliance of my choicethey also need money to fund their fightsor to the red vs blue corpsall in all i cant see why fw should get feed money from other players outside fw while the rest has to work for their funding
im all for better rewards for those who participate in fw however imposing a mandatory tax on all player corporations isnt necessary along with being a bad idea why are you imposing a mandatory tax on all corporations whats the justification corporations that arent involved in miltia warfare a fairly small portion of the game in whole shouldnt be required to give up some of their money in taxes to a cause that doesnt relate to them at all
not supporting
no this is a terrible idea
not supported socialism obama
no supportinstead improve fw
this and ive been in fw for around a year nowi dont want to tax other peoples game experience for mine i just want the mechanics of fw fixed
whi the hell players outside militia should pay to make players in militia have more fun
the way i see it the only arguements that people in favor of alt pocketing as i like to call it using another character to perform a houdini to protect a supercap is that it is already hard enough to fly a super cap and that if people arent ready to dedicate themselves to the super cap they arent fit to fly itnow is that an elitist opinion or what it should take support from other players to own a supercap it should be a team effort nobody is doubting that people who have super caps have their own worries and woes but it is entirely out of the spirit of gaming to have such a massive cop out and you heard me right that is some major crap that somebody can just make a ship disappear i dont think that it punishes super cap pilots to make their caps actually exist in the game when theyre off a newb pilot can dock in a station in empire to protect his ship while hes offline i dont see why a supercap pilot should be afforded the same luxury simply because hes willing to dedicate his money to an alt its metagaming there are risks and rewards to a supercap and if ccp wanted it to be so easy to store supercaps theyd be able to dock in stations if supercap pilots dont want to be dedicated to flying their supercap 247 there should be meathods in the game to allow them to do this without having to warp their cap into a nonexistant pocket of the time space continuumaltpocketing makes storing a supercap far too easy its like a legal exploitthis is a load of crap if super cap piloting is anything like you describe it is then not ever casual pilot can fly one using alt pocketing is exactly the same as storing a supercap in a pos that is 100 safe and i dont agree with either nothing that valuable should be 100 safe anywhere whether that is behind a pos force field or in a non existant voidat least storing a supercap behind a pos would make sense
i dont see how anyone can seriously use the nature of 11 fights as an argument against the arena idea if you dont like 11 do teams or 00 blobs anyway depending on how much effort ccp will put into it notice i did suggest the option of combat rules to be agreed on whos to say it could not include ewar or whatever else you fancy
all you need is an area of space that prevents the use of remoteassistance modules and the ability to rightclick grantaggression on any pilot you see
im spliton one hand duel systems implemented in some other games have been amusing as they allow the masses to watch two people go at it in 1v1 combat it would also be an easy way to gain some pvp experience lowsec roams are currently worse than fishing as you tend to run through a dozen empty systems before getting wtfpwnd by a massive gangon the other hand seriously just go to lowsec if people would stop taking cans then those losers would have to go to lowsec for their fights as well this will only further depopulate lowsec as instead of roaming for fights people will just sit in the arena also as has been said it will be one continual whinefest of he didnt fight fair when someone just brings a well fitted ship eve is not about being fair which is the basic idea of thisso overall not supported if it was just some sort of feature that allowed a 1v1 fight maybe a contract that allowed temporary aggression agree to fight they go red for 15 mins or fight conclusion anyone that reps them goes red as well just as in a wardecs but a full arena or complex system no
i dont really support this one as someone else said the option to be dishonest is part of what makes eve special and taking that away just feels badthat said though can fishing is stupid to me and all especially from an rp perspecitve maybe what would be better is a similar matchmaking system to the ops suggestion only it supplies both participants with a bookmark to a random spot in the system thatd keep the crowds from loitering around stations pointlessly and preserve the possibility of interference
i think your conserns are valid however i do not think improvements to one area of the game should be held back because it would be so much fun people would not use other parts if low sec need more people either improve it or increase the isk reward of low sec
this comes up once a week no thank you you can already do this on the test server
support this is game destroying the other day in dg we had hundreds of pilots wait up to 45 minutes for the grid to load before giving up and logging out many got kill mails the next day saying they died 30 45 even 60 minutes or more after the logout this is insanely brokenthing is aaa did not appear to be effected by this at all they were able to finish killing the station then warp to us and kill us before we could kill the sbu which has far fewer hp
see you here i guess
idea update and restructure the market so that visibility and availability of player tradable items will be higher to the eve communityexample removal of all t2 blueprint items in the market ie recon ship blueprints addition of bpcs to the market addition to higher meta level items to the market ie faction and officer modules cap boosters was a good start ectreason to decrees the learning curve for new players with respect to item procurement and to spur more supply and demand with respect to the secondary producer market qen and end consumer itemspros creates new markets for player trading increase the availability and visibility of secondary producer and consumer items for new and old players alike decrease the reliance of the contract system and increase the visibility of price history for statistics and trading purposes cons price fluctuations within the market system 3rd party programswebsites will need to be updated ie evecentral
removing t2 bpos i can support on the condition that we get an easy item search feature its absurd that the best way i have of looking up stats on a hictor blueprint is to type in a chat channel something like abroadsworda and autolink the broadsword bit click my link and then delete the whole thing and repeat it again for anything else i want to look upthe as are there as padding so that the link goes away when i delete the text instead of attaching itself to whatever i type in that window next but yes assuming we have a way to search up the blueprints taken off the market that isnt idiotic i support that change nobody holds a packed t2 bpo any more addition of highermeta items to market sure ive supported this for a whileaddition of bpcs to market lol no its completely impractical do you have a market for each meperun combination possible or do you throw them all in together and have a meaningless hash this needs to be done through contracts as do rigged ships full containers and the like
easy make all in game items searchable in the market finder but dont show the normal market interface for contractonly items instead a link the contracts for that item
what i see happen in my corp and i am certain that this happens in corps all over new eden some one logs on for the first time that day and they proceed to ask around what everyone is doing unless the other corp members are not involved in fleet actions they wont be keeping a close eye on the chat windows other than what it mission criticalwhat i propose is an idea that borrows from a popular social networking site a concept called status update an extra tab in the corp window that automatically or manually updates to what everyone in the corp andor alliance are doing location of fellow corp members can be updated automatically but i am thinking that other actions can be updated automatically by monitoring what the pilot is using and what kind of enemy they are up against whether their enemy is pirate corp 09 security rats or glacial asteroids this is just a rough idea of course
similar ideas have been proposed in the past im all for it myself that said i expect itll be part of ccps planned social networking upgrades which last i heard are coming in over the next year or so
corp spies best friend
sounds good definitely make it optional maybe since youre basing it off social networking allow the person to manually change it this would also allow you to put up extended away messages ie rl stuff wont be logging on again until  while youre at it use permissions like allowing people on your buddy list or certain subsets of it to see it as wellas to spies better be careful in recruiting and dont broadcast anything too important
i thought i did a thorough enough search for similar suggestions i apologize if i sound like a broken record as for it being a corp spys best friend mechanics can be implemented into the feature to keep your updates to only certain people corp members that have been with the corp certain amount of days or have it turned off completely i am thinking that there will be controls on the corp director level as well at on the pilot level
i see what youre saying but it just looks like a straight up intel feed for spiesthis is easily accomplished by answering a question understanding the environment of the corp through corp bulletins and evemail ie wars mining schedule etci think the tradeoff here of convenience for exposure is just not worth itnot supported
csm has recently raised and passed an upgraded account security proposal in fact it is on the iceland summit agenda for discussion with ccpplease take a look here
although i would support noobs being able to get their hands on a procurer at very low levels i couldnt figure out anyway to alter the skilltree to get less days to the procurer without it becoming too complicated however i did just think that it might help the procurer if it had a reduction in cycle time bonushonestly this suggestion was just sort of this doesnt make sense way take so much to train to procurer to really make the procurer useful it does need bonuses
i like this idea i really do just needs to be more refined as a bonus to gas mining it makes me support this idea even more
lost meme
so basically people spammed way to many make outpost selfdestructible qualifiershave sov for 100 days cost 1 billion isk to initiate selfdestructselfdestruct takes 30 days to complete  can be aborted during self destruct phase docking is available to all of new eden  save tears over omgz im gonna lose my stuffsfeed it into the eve api system so it can go out to dotlan etccreate a news section on the main page of the eveonline site that shows what outpost are currently slated for selfdestructless donges and buttes please
nobody will ever blow up a station they own if theres a 30day timer this is just a waste of time to code outpost destruction has to be at the attackers discretion not the defenders to be meaningful if youre going to do this at all go back to the proposal csm1 passed
with the amount of outposts them being tied to sovereignty in a way where they are at the focal point of sov warfare and the fact they are also permanent this also leaves no real option to just go through a region burning everything either you conquer and use a station or have a petrenter use it or it eventually gets retaken by its previous owners in short i support any and all possibilities for outpost destruction
sov for 100 days suredecommision timer suredocking rights 0ocost 0oinstead of a selfdestruct id like to think of it more of a decommision no cost and you get back 50 of the materials used to build it so you can sucessfully pillage a region during this 30 day count down i think stuff in private hangers should be automatically moved to the nearest station regardless of it being npc or not goods in expired corp hangers can dieeither way still like to see a feature to take down some stationsoutposts
disagree with the first part if you dont want to own so many outposts dont claim so much spaceas for the second part this was already dismissed by ccp as too hard during csm1 as herschel has already pointed out therefore no point in supporting this even if i agreed with itben
heh you guys really dont want to pay for all those stations in providence
there have been better proposals and ccp has stated they wont allow full destructionoutposts in itself dont cost any upkeep
such a new totally new topic the linked thread has other threads linked with dev replies on the topiccva asked ccp before dominion if they can add something to get rid of outpostsoh and not supported
why the node doesnt place a player on a grid after all data has been processed and sent is one hell of a mystery eh these instances are actually server failure not lag as the required information seems to end up never getting sent to the client formulate petitions as such lag is a keyword quickly picked out of the petition and given a default response by the bot ccp uses
see you here i guess
so youve got 2 options1 as it is now and as it was ever since beginning of eve  you either jump into system risking black screen where you can do some steps to minimize the lag effect and accepting that you can die before you can do anythingor your proposal2 every time you need to defend a system you jump every man and his dog onto a node until it crashes and ccp reimburses all your loses while doing soits a widely known fact that you get lagged out even to a point where you cant do anything if you try logging in or jumping into a system thats already overloadedits been like that since day 1 it got a bit better in last couple patches but then something broke again in dominion but its also been a ccp policy that they dont reimburse losses in large fleet fights as if you jump into one you should know that the server may not handle that and you may end up lagged out
while eventually i would like to see the eve gate opened it should not be until the jovian story is played outi feel eve gate is almost the end game to the eve universe jovians will start showing up eventually which will add a rpg element back into the game with thier effect on the empires new tech trees and new missions within faction warfarewhen earthterra reopens the gate it needs to be an invasion of a capital i by a race with unrestricted tech growth and the resources of a unified universe behind itempires unite some die  betrayals based on out comes of player interaction within the gamei want to see sec statues shift as a war rages through out core 01 jita anybody have null sec alliances be affected system gates and infrastructure destroyed if not defended massive mobile hostile outposts worholes appear in the middle of delve etc spawning armadas requiring fleets to destory unique tech drops

hmm your stats are bad because sniper fits have 3 dmg mods and aimed for 180190km range not 150kmalso nobody realy tanks now as dd is the past
rokh and mega already have 3 damagemods rokh and apoc are already at 180190 mega isnt going to get more damage then at 150 for sure too at 180190 mega will be left way behind others and you still dont want to go under 48000 ehp on lowest resist because of bombers
does not amke a difference you can just as well compare ships with no magstabs since they increase dps of all ships by the same amount
imho it makes a difference because he used 2 for apoc and tempest and 3 for mega and rokhthe range makes difference also the rokh needs 12 tc just to able to use iridium at 190km while the others will just change to t2 ammo
so let me get this straight you agree that when using fittings that let all 4 bs have an optimal of 180190 optimal 3 damage mods each and a buffer or roughly 14k we are using the proper benchmarkdo you also agree that the numbers for dps at that range are the following all are t2 ammoapoc 372 19333 146k armortemp 370  14072 139k armormega 351  18358 135k armorrokh 321 19430 139k shieldalso for referencezealot 299  9313 aurora 21k ehpmunnin 312  8122 tremor 25k ehpdeimos 235  8437 spike 20k ehpeagle 235  7925 uranium 195k ehpafter benchmarking the ships it is obvious that the numbers support a 1015 damage increase for railguns id say 15 is closer to the mark because the mega could do with a dcu ii and the only way to get it is to drop a magstab bringing it in line with the rest on that note i also believe that apocalypse could do with an extra 30 cpu by the way munnin is absolutely sexy after the projectile reengineeringif you look at eagle and deimos they badly need the damage increase
yep agree 3dmg modes and 180190 range is a good benchmark althou i like to use ehp more than bufferyour stats seems corret more or less and i would bring those snipe hacs to 100110km as 8090km is for snipe bcsit is obvious that rail ships are way weaker and need a boost especially the eagledeimoswhat i dont agree with is that 15 dmg boost anyway it is ccp who should balance them out not us we only need to present the issue to csm then then will hopefully present it to ccp thats allimho hybrid shipsweapons should be redesignedchaning 12 stats wont fix them at all for example your 15 dmg idea only would bring their dps closer to amarrs while still having so many more disadvantages over themand matars have other specialties like no cap use and doing huge alpha

i dont expect them to ignore the importance of armor and ive repeatedly stated the point in fact the entire reason why 15 is reasonable instead of 2030 is because armors more important and maintaining beams as the higher damage dealing weapon as previously explained the difference in damage between is 65 which is huge and if rails were expected to be an equal weapons system youd need to boost their damage by at least 32 38 actually if youre including reload times in your dps calculation were asking for less then half of that in respect to1 armor tanking is more important then shield tanking2 tachyon beams have heavier fitting and cap requirements3 rails have greater rangemy damage calculations are all worked from my original guns focused setups since they provide a more consistent benchmark to work from and as ive already pointed out the rokhs range bonus ends up becoming a fitting bonus thanks to its ease at reaching long ranges with as much damage as it can muster also as previously pointed out the apoc can sell down some of its ample damage to achieve ehp parity with a tier 3 ship with a bonus to resists thanks to the potency of 1600mm platesunfortunatly iridium does less damage then spike unless you get into faction ammo t2 ammo is really the bane of the rokh and while it needs less tc is needs more damage mods because unlike range you can never have enough damageyou can mark that one down for 401 dps  188km with the same armorapocalypse full tach damage 58k ehp3x heat sink ii1600mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates itracking enhancer iidamage control iireactor control unit ii2x sensor booster ii targeting rangecap recharger iiquad lif fueled i booster rockets2x tachyon beam laser ii aurora llarge algid energy administrations unit i2x large ancillary current router ihow many high damage decent range andor ehp setups do i have to come up with for the apoc anyways
has anyone mentioned that the original bonus for the drake was going to be a 5 rof but ccp changed it to a 5 kinetic damage as they deemed the rof bonus was excessive
if you think that using one type of ammo is the optimal way to fight in a cmb then im not surprised you dont get itsorry  but thats a nub attitude and shows a complete lack of understanding of the game
if you think that armor active tank is the optimal way to fit a brutix then im not surprised you dont get itsorry but thats a nub attitude and shows a complete lack of understanding of irony and hypocrisy

lets change the topic to change minmatars dmg bonuses only for explosive ammos  because that is their racial
it already is
running out of arguments are you then lets go off topic for a while thats the right way how to win a discussioni have a proposal for you make a topic in which how the switchable damage type makes minmatar overpowered how is proposed change justified from balance standpoint if should be proposed change applied to caldari gunboats too and finally how the change wont turn minmatar to utter or rather not we dont need another troll topic in assembly hall
running out of arguments no not realy  it is just a one liner commentwhich comes from your point of view why kinetic bonus is fine  how the switchable damage type makes minmatar overpoweredusing the your thinking this shows that current matar bonuses dont encourage to use their racialy dmg type and they will be fine with explosive ammo bonuses only how is proposed change justified from balance standpointwe already posted many times how the porposal is justified  caldari kinetic bonus only gives 8 dmg at lvl5 if you average out the target resists if should be proposed change applied to caldari gunboats toowhy caldari gunboats relevant to missile boats or matari realy dont understand how you brought this into here and finally how the change wont turn minmatar to utter so you think that changing matar bonus would turn minmatar to utter  rightor rather not we dont need another troll topic in assembly hallit is you who are trolling  all arguments you came up are this caldari kinetic bonus is fine because thats their racial favour dmg type strange using the same reasoning against minmatar finnally is wrong why is that i tell you why because you are an anticaldari matar fanboy thats it
 running out of arguments no not realy   it is just a one liner commentwhich comes from your point of view why kinetic bonus is fine then explain to me how you came from my changing kinetic bonus would make cmbs overpowered to your how about ner

challenge gladly your homeworks or op is to figure out whats wrong with the math there are 6 mistakes there i wonder if you find themfirst1 lets assume you come to equal distribution of enemy target types op makes same assumption2 lets assume you have you dont have to deal with secondary tank op makes same assumption ignoring fact that best damage against t2 amarr shield is em3 lets assume no resist holes were filled op makes same assumption plugging exp hole on t2 gallente armor makes worst resist em4 lets assume highest t2 resists op ignores fact that there are t2 ships with lowest kin resist other than minmatar5 lets assume you exactly know what your target before engegment so missile user can preload missile as does opresists areemthermkinexp engagement type according to op75504060 minmatar t2 shield503565580 amarr t2 armor50675837510 gallente t2 armor0807050 caldari t2 shield0204050 t1 shield50352510 t1 armoraccording to op using average value is correct statistical method to evaluate performance over different engagementson average missile user able to switch damage type faces 15 resiston average blaster user faces 51 resistiirc heaavy neutron blaster ii at max skills with t1 antimatter deals 42 dpsheavy assault launcher ii at max skills with any t1 missile deals 30 dpsso on average blaster deals about 21 dps to different targets while ham do 255qedthe actual math behind40  35  10  0  0  106  15505  407  355  6557  6755  83757  805  707  205  407  355  257  12  6  5155  thermal damage of antimatter7  kinetic damage of antimatter12  total damage of ammo6  number of different engagement types
ive seen this argument getting thrown around quite a bit and ill respond to itits quite obvious really of the ships your proposed change will affect the drake is the most popular in fact im going to wager that it sees more uses than all the other ones combined doesnt it seem very stupid to ignore the ship that will be affected the most
if thats true then your forgetting one thing  the drake originally had 20 more shield recharge which got nerfed due to whiners saying that the drakes tank could not be broken by a solo bs  geddon most often quoted iirc the drake has been weekened since it original conception and bonus assignationso no that statement if true proves nothing about the current state of playa rof bonus as jt pointed out is 33 more dps at lvl5the drake now in its weekened state with 20 less tank could and probably should get its fp increased to compensate for its loss of tank  something that was not done at the timea dpl on the drake would be better than rof as dpl is only 25 at lvl 5essentially a 15 increase over current performance to make up for the 20 tank it lost to whiners
oh i see you completly ignored the rest of my post and went with the oh i can post something totally irrelevant because that would prove that davs calculation is wrong  kinetic bonus is fine somehowfirst it would only proove that davs initial assumtions are badi can agree with that but it wouldnt proove that he is wrongthere has to be some terms or there would be just too many variables and you couldnt get a clear view at the end at allnow about your postso you agree that blasters are crap d nobody said weapons are balanced thats nothing newthats why balancing are made with ships  fits used not lone modulesso if we add 5lvl kinetic dmg for ham and 5lvl dmg for blaster the result will be differentlets see how if i dont use kinetic missiles i loose 20 dmg right so lets add as 20 for every non kinetic resist and what type of missiles would be the bestblaster will remain the same40 kinetic minmatar t2 shield48 thermal amarr t2 armor28 explo gallente t2 armor20 em caldari t2 shield20 em t1 shield25 kinetic t1 armorbase missile dmg with lvl5 boni 42125525base blaster dmg with lvl5 boni 30125375now the average resist against missiles  30166the average resist agianst blaster is the same as in your post  515from that the ham edps  2562 from previous255 that is 266 dmg increase at lvl5 it is worse than davs dblasters average dmg  2546 from the prev 204 that is 25 dmg increase at lvl5see one race gets 25 dmg at lvl5 the other gets 266 at lvl5 if you use the initial termsthere are a lots of other variables which could be addedor you could bring chart table about ships used so we can weight those resist to get a better resultbottom line  we should compare fitted ships like cerb vs zealot or caracal vs vexor
o hey dudethanks for all the support along the way i do appreciate itsomething you should be aware of herethese are not my calculationsthese numbers are from lumy and any assumptions he is making are his owni have never made assumptions about people hitting against base resiststhe guy is just trolling at this point it seems making  up and trying to pass it off as related to the op
yeah but i havent seen any vagabondingsabreing when projectiles were boosted also no geddoning or what was the favourit ship for them when amarr was boosted those changes affected those already awesome ships aswell still those changes made most caldarigallente ships obsoletealso the drake is a special caldari ship because it works it is fittable has many slots can spare some for tackleand launchers  has drone bay and its bonus is not kinetic dmg 10 missile velocity lvl as the other missile boatsif its resist bonus would be changed to missile velocity it wouldnt be the best bc nor would it be the 2nd bestand in eft it has good dmg and good tank compared to other bcs oh any most ppl use eft more often than their brains that is saidthats all it is good at fighting other bcs solo or very small gang with ham fitwith hml fit it suddenly isnt that good due to missile delayits tank is still nicebut look at the other cmbs  those are crapnone of them realy does anything good or great except aml fitsdav yeah i havent looked at the whole thread as it is already 18 pages long i have taken what he wrote as granted
i do agree that some of the caldari ships listed need to be buffed however the only ship that i have problem with is the drake i think i have made my position clear in a couple of posts a few pages back you yourself have said that drakes are already awesome as is additionally some people find them to be overpowered  you are advocating for a change that will buff drakesdo you not see a problem with that i do drakes dont need to be buffed periodoh and im about to give up on dav becausea he doesnt concede points that he losesb he blatantly ignores our strong argumentsc he cherrypicks his data setd he throws up smoke and screams troll to just about everything
a points conceded so far of the top of my memory you were right about rof and dpl not being equivelent  conceded straight away in my very next post drake may be too powerful  you may be right about thathowever thats not a reason for keeping the kin bonus  as stated in the op the issues with kin bonus are not just about ship balance  but the other issues with it as well if a rof is too powerful for the drake try a dplif dpl is too powerful for the drake try explosion vel or missile velas with any post its not up to us to state what the fix should bethe op recomends rof or dpl as those are the most equivelent to other races damage bonusesplease remember we are just interested in rasing the issue for the attention of the devs they are the ones who will look to see if the issues raised are correct and what the appropriate fixz should beb i blatently argue against counter arguements that use lies  half truths or misconceptionsmisconceptions such as  firing only kin  is the optimal caldari combat tacticc no data has been cherry picked as far as i am aware  would you care to elaborate d when people such as yourself post stuff attributed to me or the op that i have never said  you will be treated like a trollyou yourself did you not in a previous post  take both sides of the arguments pretending to speak for me how is that supposed to be treated as a constructive serious response i know why you did it of course  you have become frustrated by your inability to trip me up5 or 6 of your posts have attempted to garner a phrase from me that you can point to and go lol i am well aware of the tactics you are trying to use to rubbish this topicthe reason you have failed on 5 or 6 occasions and had to resort to making up a conversation for me is not because i am good at ducking issues or am some kind of linguistic geniusthe reason you counter argements keep failing is i happen to be right and the op happens to be accuratein fact you know the op to be accurate  if a rofdpl bonus was not more powerful than a kin bonus you would not be here argueing against the kin bonuses replacement would you 
the rofdps bonus is more powerful than a kinetic bonus but that in no way makes it ok to give caldari ships this bonus yes the bonus is more powerful but it would make some caldari ships too powerful and wouldnt boost other ships enough the issue isnt the bonus the bonus is fine caldari dont need a stronger bonus they need some of their ships to be rethought outwe arent frustrated with our inability to trip you up were frustrated with the fact that you seriously think youre 100 right and cant possibly be wrong and to support your 100 correctness youre fabricating averages and using facts that are in no way facts but opinions and often factually incorrectyour cherry picked data is that you only get 8 averaged at level 5 well our cherry picked data says that missiles do more dps averaged out than blasters boost blasters its not fair were not the best and we cant choose whatever damage we want and we cant do full damage at any range wtfffff no fair  your also cherry picked a fact about your less dps than other weapon systems the fact is that dps varies with range blasters short range get more dps missiles relatively long range get slightly reduced dps but the comparative dps at their range is probably greater than other ships would get at same rangewe are not makeing misconceptions that kinetic is optimal damage type were just saying thats the only one you should get bonused to kinetic isnt optimal damage tpe for blsters and neither is thermal tbh i want explosive ammo for my brutix and thorax hut we cant even choose to use unbonused ammo caldari has something special you can pick to fire whatever pure damage you want to and you do quite a bit of damagesooo all your friends like naomi who are struggling to provide solid arguments and not just spewing out incoherent words and babble with zero or false reasoning are trolls al the people who are on your side of the argument but dont use arguments stated in the op are trolls
both lumy and james are finethey make arguments not like you you are just trolling go away stil harkonnen nobody needs you and nobody wants you here
caldari do need a stronger bonus8 is not enough to compete with 25  33 and 50 handed out to other weapons systemsthe bonus is not fine for the above reasonno one said you were frustrated i was talking specifically to jtno dude you have it the wrong way round i have brought analysis and maths and stats to the table it is generally the ops detractors who waves there arms around and make unsubstanciated claims youve not supplied any data whatsoever  again all youve done is offer unsubstanciated claimsgrow upif you think i am wrong about the 5 kin being equal to 8 dps at lvl 5 then what do you think its worth and why no one here  not me  not you  not anyone has claimed that there arnt differences in the damage envelopes of different weapons systemsit is irrelevant bonuses are assigned as a percentageto keep things in balance across skill levels the size of the percentage needs to be the sameyes go back read previous posts  argument to rubish my claim that the kin bonus is not compatible with cmb tactics were built on the premise that cmbs should always fire kinetic which is wrong
couple of quick replies to some unanswered stuff i missed pagepostnumber if applicable175101  because in current neither minmatar or caldari can switch damage type perfectly for short range ammo minmatar can deal only 833pp833f75emp of optimal damage and only 166  of kinetic midrange its only 75 for kinetic and 375 thermal or explosive long range its 80 for kineticexplosive and 60 em t2 are only expkinetic long range variants are exceptionally important for anything but blasters  so dont speak about minmatar like they are some kind damage switching masters pure 100808080 of caldari is imho much better option175102  kinetic bonus doesnt take away anything same as brutix active tanking bonus doesnt take away its ability to buffer tank175106  wanna examples drake compared to any other bc cerberus compared to sacrilege175107  there are several issues with caldari ships kinetic damage bonus is not one of them18513  buffing a ship just because it got deserved nerf at some point thats hilarious argument maybe we should increase speed of minmatar ships to counter nano nerf or we should increase damage of lasers to counter stacking penalties look up gankageddon we should also increase tracking of all ships because at ancient times times there was no tracking bss could hit anything within range 20 tank it lost to whiners 185141 fixing now as you see18514rest so even at level 5 with lousy kinetic bonus hams have average damage higher than blasters supposedly highest damage weapon on top no cap need longer range no tracking problems giving 20  damage on top is totally justifiable18514bottom line yes please do so dont ask for overall buff without examining the issue case by case do you remember what happened after last amarr buff18515middle then explain to me how are you dealing with all those anomalies in op just because you dont mention them doesnt make them cease to exist how do you guarantee equal distribution of engagement types over long time hint you cant18516end yeah im a troll alright maybe i should call you raving caldari fanboy wink at naomi18518b thats your misconception no one but you ever mentioned caldari should fire only kinetic missiles18518d funny you say that i have opposite feeling b18518rest nope youre just being ignorant you are arguing a claim no one but you has made nobody argues that kinetic only damage is weaker than all around bonus or rof bonus our major points are not every ship has to use its bonuses at all circumstances proposed change would make several caldari ships overpowered especially drake185211 wrong185212 brought analysis and maths and stats to the table do you have any verifiable data sets to support your distribution of engagement type 111111 to back up your claimfor those who didnt have even a single lecture of statistics even if you rmethods and math are correct without verifiable data the result will be always poo you can polish the poo as proved on mythbusters but it remains poo nevertheless185214 bonuses are assigned to ship case by case if the ship is strong the ship doesnt need damage increase maller apocalpse sometimes the bonus is associated with the weapon system  rof for projectiles dmg for hybrids sometimes even 666 percent damage increase doesnt guarantee ship superiority tempestspin it all you want but your claim kinetic damage bonus is weak is irrelevant as long its not associated with specific ship

as convenient as this would be i have to say i vote no t3 subsystems are not the same as swapping modules youre actually cracking open the hull and making major modifications i see the need to put the ship in a hangar as similar the putting an ocean ship in drydock to do major hull work maybe if specialized pos facilities were created for this including temporary housing for the crew who cant stay in the ship while its open to space and if it took a lot longer than just swapping a module
sweet jesus do this please
this dont need to be in gamethere should be some sacrfices made when live in wormhole and not being able change subsystem on easy mode ship is one of them

its these insignificant things that in numbers make the difference between a good and a bad game espeshially in something like ui every little thing matters
feels good man
second this
yes
yup
something like this
not supported
yes ill have prince of wales please oh and i wouldnt mind some of that apple crumble to go with it
i cann see a few occasions where the system could cause problems however this the only actually workable proposals i seen and as such i support it
do you understand how fleet bonuses workyou would still need exactly the same amount of skilled players for a fleet like this except one more person would be needed with a new skills ie there will still be 25 people with fc5 skill if they are in this new heirachy or not bonuses cannot be passed down the chain without a pilot in the sc  wc  fc below him relvant ly skilled this arbitarry limit needs raising as the eve population raises
this be stupidityblobs grow larger and your solution is to throw ever more resources at it increasing the fleet sizes solves few of the real problems with large battleswhat is needed is interfleet coordination tools ability to share cynos targets warpins fleet channels and more
players decides how they want to play not you if they want large fleets it is up to them and then ccp need to solve the problem not to trow it away
youve obviously never been in major 00 fights the last thing we need to do is encourage more blobbing in 00 and more tactic based fights the ops suggestion caters right to this if you get everyone in that fleet youll basically be able to move fleets very quickly and efficiently in blob formits fine asis
reducing lag goes through reducing fleet sizes in a natural way or splitting them in different solarsystems with a mechanic that gives and advantage in doing so this proposal goes weak against what is urged to fix lag in big engagements
please dont mix up different intentions from what i understood this propposal is in no way related to lag instead it just attempts to solve a rather organisational issue or inconvenience with fleets nevertheless i wouldnt be surprised to find this if implemented being able to reduce lagjust to add another interesting point to the discussion today a colleague of mine old 00 citizen and major ally member objected and pointed out that already today fleets of 200 would be pain to keep in line and having multiple smaller fleets instead would be more feasible however the proposal doesnt force anyone to set up such kind of giant fleetstill supported btw
you obviously havent been in 00 in a capacity other than the wideeyed noob sneaking in with a few others to try to rat it most definitely is not fine as is fleets larger than 256 are already being formed using tools outside eve the cap placed on fleets in game does nothing to prevent this raising the cap will not change the size of fleets it will only remove some of the artificial annoyances created by shortsighted coding
so in a year we are going to be having 10k v 10k battles and asking for fleet sizes to be increased to 20k
noeven from a scifi point of view it doesnt make much sense to have a module located on your ship that increases the tracking of a missile that you already fired and is in space moving toward its target target painters already have the role of aiding in the successful guidance of your missile from bay to target

if you want to compare ships maybe compare ships of the same tier for amarr gallente and minmatar you used tier 3 but used tier 2 for caldariand i would like to see abaddons and hyperions with 3 dmg mods and still having a reasonable tank
frankly i always thought of the idea of capsuleers possessing crews absurd a way of generating false pathos in the rp fiction on these forums one that has obviously spread to the back story like a cancer stuff like saying a silent prayer for the gallant crew as my ship erupts like blazing thermite or crap like that absurd for several reasonscapsuleers can get their ships insured before anybody compares the situation to rl concept like life insurance or employee loss notice that rl warships which are what what we fly btw are never offered insurance why because its kinda morally repugnant in addition to impractical from the insurers standpoint to insure combatants that are meant to die any selfrespecting minmatar or even some gallente should really object to any situation of wageslavery desperate enough for trained crewmembers  whose lives are obviously cheap enough to not be offered additional insurance for next of kin  to put their lives on the line for mere private enterprise which is what most capsuleer activities should be considered crew pay maybe the spacefarers union goes on strike after your third ship loss in as many hoursthe whole concept of the capsule was to enable the kind of efficiency and response crew cannot offer and if you want backstory it was developed by the jovians who arguably dont even have the numbers required to staff their fleets otherwisebuy hey why not i could see new weapons centered around maser technology or neutron bombs designed to kill your crew plague ammo maybe as soon as your ship gets in structure crew starts dying  
definetly supporting
you sir are a god damn genius
yes lag ensures that there is always a gap in activation  this would ensure that isnt a problemalso 1 for the guy who said we should also be able to insert an ammo change ill raise you the ability to activate your guns before they finish reloading thereby causing them to fire as soon as they are reloaded not before
not supportedi neither see any usse nor advantage of it youre flying ships not batched requests and your ships as well as its modules want to be operated do so pleaseaccidentially deactivating a module is not that much of a problem since you can reactivate it without any loss right after its activation period ended represented by the white circle vanishing with the module still blinking red use this second or two to click on it again and itll be instaactivated as if it never had been deactivated at least thats the way i dosounds very much to me like an empire carebears request for autolockandshoot modules 
this i hate thisinsert fleet lag and instead of overheating your dreads guns you are left with the guns that will not stop cycling red unless you warp off unfortunately youre in siege so you have to wait up to 10 minutes before you can warp out to clear the guns so you can fire again
insert fleet lag and instead of overheating your dreads guns you are left with the guns that will not stop cycling red unless you warp off unfortunately youre in siege so you have to wait up to 10 minutes before you can warp out to clear the guns so you can fire againif implementing this proposal would help with this kind of issue id go for it but as i doubt it i dont instead i take this a being a missing information at the client caused by the database or the node or whatever actually does this job not being able to send it due to its massive utilisation if this should in fact be the case all youd get from it would be the ability to compose your own disco lights  still boring just two colors

supported for surespeaking of making the module interface better please note that the overheating stuff is an awful mess and could use some of the same good sense that this proposal hasedit forgot my thumb
yes this is another one of those threads i havent really flown a hulk in a whilebut having actually developed tank fits and such ill just say wtf is with its fitting ability its a t2 barge designed for deep space but its impossible to fit a tank for 00 rats without a deadspace boostermy proposal1 mid slot for increased tanking ability hardeners etccpu 300  500 for fitting additional tanking modulespowergrid 35  250 so it can fit lses and medium shield boosterscapacitor 625  1000 to increase available cap to run the boosterof course these are very rough numbers and could use some discussion but basically the hulk and other exhumers need to be looked at if they are to be used more readily in 00 i dont know about you but i wouldnt want to buy a 150mil brick with the tank of a cruiser unless you spend more isk on deadspace equipment which makes you a flying pinata anyway
drop 1 mlu and fit a dcuvoila your hulk is much harder to gank
i must be very tired or something because i cant find the spot where op writes about ganking i did however read a comment about tanking the deepspace rats that tend to show up in the deepspace belts that its intended to mine inso yeah
if i can reasonably tank rats in 00 then theres something wrong with you guyscourse you sacrifice mining ability for the tank but i dont think this is a smart movesorry not supporting
if you carry more than a bil in a ship that costs 100k and dont bother tanking it then you deserve to lose itships can survive the jita gank ive seen a badger ii survive two tempests volleying ityou just have to tank it out well enough  transport ships are a good startwhining on the forums to give you a super resist mod is a bad start
for those who like to risk the isk there is gambling which is done through threads on the forums why not have gambling in a station that a player could set up themselves add a possible fee if they want then choose the game some games could include crapsi partake in it daily heads or tails rock paper scissors poker blackjack and probably many more
i support
i think this would be a great idea as well would keep the players safe from scams and help people make a quick buck sort of like an in game casino
i think this will be one of the features implented with the walking in station patchwhich will come eventuallyUFFFDand the whole concept of gambling is that it should be player driven nevertheless it could be a nice option although i dont think it should take priority
if it comes up once a week i would say its popular demand ps some of us prefer not to play on the test server
super duper idea
i will support my own idea  duh
1 no
i think it would be cool if your could use the arena to do tournaments maybe pay a fee and have ads placed on the billboards around the region ad time could be auctioned away to highest bidder would certainly make it more fun to watch those
it could be a intresting way to deal with suiside ganking and hulkageddoni have nothing aganst someone who wants to play cops and robbers or rescue someone from pc ratsmy idea is symilar to what marcus henik said but make concord like a faction milita that only single pilots not corporations can joinconcord members would also be able to attack outlaws but not clame bountys fly concord ships but only keep them as long as they are in concordether that or creat a way for concord pcs to arrestdetain someone
it sounds like the op wants to fly a concord ship more than anything else that said i think it has been suggested that low sec should get a new treatment before i think the ops suggestion works well with the the corruptionvegas idea which is to say give lowsec a purpose beyond being between high sec and 00
supported this is getting redonkulous ccp
supported in principle but is there anything worthwhile in a gsc spending 5 min hacking for 5000m3 of veld does not sound that great
not supported i smell 10 battleships remote repairing a tanked cov ops who is hacking the can
the feeling of distance will not be a stake by shortning travel timeyou will never want to travel from one end of eve to the other but by reducing travel time those in 00 will spend more time actually figting and those nice people who move stuff around our mutual benefit will move even more stuff and furtherpersonally im a litte bored with following the fc around looking for someone with the balls to fight it takes too friking long
if anything they should do the pure opposite the eve universe is by far to small since warp to zero was introduced
not supportedi dont see a point there fly a smaller ship instead
wow u might wanna try getting outside your home system eve is huge
if youre having trouble finding people to fight this really isnt because it takes too long to warp between gates i suggest identifying the root cause of not haivng anyone in your neck of nullsec to shoot at
stop flying battleships on your hunting parties and you might find things go smoother and faster

yeah it also takes four moons of capacitor to fire one volleymake rail guns take massive cap and sure thing bro enjoy capping outall you whiners are biased and dont take everything into consideration
quoteyeah it also takes four moons of capacitor to fire one volleymake rail guns take massive cap and sure thing bro enjoy capping outall you whiners are biased and dont take everything into considerationhavent ever used rails on a rokh before have you it actually has as bad if not worse cap issues then the apoc yeah caldari railboats know all they need to know about capping out cap issues arent a unique feature to amaar perhaps more severe in some instances but certainly not all and in the realm of sniper boats its not a particularly strong argument
obviously you havent flown a rokh in a fleet fight fact is that it is the bs that caps out first of all the others id guess you usually fly a tachyon apoc so you are obviously comparing apples with oranges once again if you are going to benchmark the ships you have to use megabeams 425mm and 1400mm turrets doing otherwise is plain ignorance and inability to learnthat means if you want your opinion to have any value youll post the amarr bs fitting you consider consumes too much cap so we can tear it apart at leisure and have a good laugh by the way if you have issues with capacitor try training energy management i think it helpsremember you have to give us numbers not empty words that means the capacitor duration and the specific fitting that you are talking about instead of the continued inanities and obvious attempt to troll so far
t2 425 rail activation 30 duration 9563 315 caps per gunmegabeam activation 65 duration 9 72 caps per gun 36 with amarr bs 5tachyon activation 95 duration 125 76 caps per gun 38 with amarr bs 5apoc cap 7500 recharge 1155s peak 162 capsrokh cap 6000 recharge 1250s peak 12 caps so t2 rail on rokh takes 26 peak recharge on apoc with amarr bs 5 megabeam is 22 tach is 235so as you see using lasers on apoc takes less cap then rails on rokh
id propose a rof increase over a damage increasethis has drawbacks cap and ammo usage increase but will bolster the dpshow about doing something like what the projectiles got but not on quite as large a scalereduce base damage but increase rof appropiatly to increase overall dps but lower alpha strike then the weapon has its flavour too extreme range high rof good dps low alpha poor trackingim also against all weapons performing similarly at the same range 180190km rails are supposed from what i can tell out range everything else
i would be content with an rof increase instead of an outright damage one so long as some of the cap issues related to rails are also delt with namely that for the boats theyre put on they use an unseemly amount of it especially given they already eat through ammo at a heavy rate also rof increases would likly need something to be done about reload times andor clip sizes to keep reloading from hurting dps too extensively im also in agreement in wanting to avoid having all weapons become uniform and i think the proposed increases in damage would keep intact the damage peaks around 230212188 for laser weapons over rail weapons however insuring that rails are actually competitive will mean shrinking the range where lasers are best simply due to a lack of space to inhabit otherwiseideally i think i would have pegged rails as preforming more like tachyons do in having high damage but rediculous pg and cap requirements while lasers focused more on flexibility in range instead of pure damage leveraging their ease of switching crystals and their common theme of working in middling ranges to engage at a wide variaty of ranges without hesitation of course this would have required either some leveling of t2 ammo with t1 ammo or an entire set of t2 ammo to play with to allow switching from aurora to radio to provide an increase in damage however given the current state of the game it seems lasers have occupied the high dps role in ranged combat and rails will have to be positioned more towards dps at even higher ranges

nice try lee daltonbut your fits are lies themselvesfirst zealod doesnt need anciliary router and then you can add 2 rigs just change the stupid typed attenuation signal augmentation to a reactor control changing the anci rig to a locus rig and change ammo to imp microwave and you will get 89km opt 250dps no ammo change and a tracking 00489muninn same 1 te  1 dc and add a locus rig optimal will be the same 23k ehp it has dronesboth of them far out perform the eagle deimosso 15 dmg boost for rails  and 15 pg for eagle is the minimum
wait zelot has everything better than deimos  only alpha slightly lower and you think its ok 
it is fine because he uses zealot not deimos 
actually i fly a muninn ignore the zealot  look at the other 3 the deimos does more dps than the muninn the eagle does over 90 of the damage of the muninn with over 25x the trackingthe problem here is not railsthe problems are1 the deimos is not a sniper2 the zealot is very very good

your post quality is getting worse and worsejust because a ship isnt the best ship in its class does not mean its useless
then clearly youd be in support of a nerf to amaar then right
the zealot has no dronebay no utility slots and cap problemsits a tradeoff each ship is best in a certain role for example the amazing tracking of the eagle with lead at 100 km kills frigates in a way that the zealot and muninn cantthe only bad ship in the comparison imo is the deimos and thats because its a ing blaster ship rails are fine the eagle is fine gallente just lack a lr turret based hac
more lies no drone bay eagle has it neighter cap problems where it can be made cap stable easily only needs 1 rig sloti have already showed you that the muninn is much better at anti frigate job so is the zealot just change the ammo to blood microwave and you will have better dps slightly less optimal and much better tracking than the eagle  also 1 sec ammo change allows you to choose your ammo according to your enemy typedistanceeagle is not finenor railguns
so caldari rail ships dont need a grid boost but they do need multiple fitting mods when all their counterparts from other races need only one
ive changed my mind lets make everything identical no more variation in eve no more differences between races each race should each get identical ships with different skins thats a great idea
i have not looked at any numbersbut i have from time to time shot at stuff with an eagle and shot at stuff with my deimosand shot at stuff with a sniping rohkthe result always seems to be the same  some slight scratch to the enemies paintworki give up on rails mostly and just use arties and arty bonused ships if i wanna snipeso supporting this  me thing rails need some luv
this is why you are a trollyou lie about what you have said when you are proven wrong
ill deconstruct your points from the top starting with point a since it is relevant to what you are discussing right now i wont bother quoting that big block of text since it will further clutter this postyou didnt concede that you lost a point on the previous page heres the relevant parts of the conversationdo you concede that you have made a baitandswitch fallacy during the course of that conversation heres the outline of what you did you said the bonus on the brutix is fully useful and not ignored because there exist brutix fits that have armor repairers on them  when faced with the response that cmbs are able to fully use their bonuses as well by loading pure kinetic missiles you rebut by saying it will not be the most optimal way to fit them however you failed to account for that of the active armor brutix fits none of them are popular and no one would call any of them the optimal way of fitting a brutixtherefore a bait and switch fallacy is committed heres an outline of ityou first implied that the criterion of a fully usable bonus is as follows  if there exist a fit for a ship that can utilize the bonus to its fullest potential then the bonus is fully usablehowever you later changed it to  if the optimum fit for a ship utilizes the bonus to its fullest potential then the bonus is fully usablebait and switch
a brutix has a bonus for active armor repsa brutix is a ship designed to fit armor tanks  active or passive a brutix can be fitted with an armor repperif fitted with an armor repper the brutix will get 100 of its bonus 100 of the time while in combat and using its combat tacticsa cmb has a bonus for kinetic missilesa cmb is a ship designed to fit missile launchersif fitted with missile launchers the cmb will not have 100 use of its bonus 100 of the time if it uses its combat tacticsin fact there is no fit available for cmbs that enable concurrent use combat tactics and bonus at the same timelumy had incorrectly assumed that firing only kinetic missiles was the optimal way of flying a cmb ie there combat tacticsi hope that clears up the difference for you
yes it does it seems that you are committing the special pleading fallacy instead you have created the criterion out of whole cloth namely if a ship has a fit that will get 100 of its bonus 100 of the time then the bonuses are not uselessand then created a loophole that only allows the point that you are arguing to escape the criterion missiles are not included in fits because they are not modules thus missiles themselves cannot be governed by the previously defined criterion for useful bonusesspecial pleadingin fact the general consensus is that the armor repairer bonus on brutixes are less useful than the kinetic bonus on cmbs also i would wager and im sure youll agree proportionally to their own class there are more drakes that use kinetic missiles than there are brutixes that fit armor repairers
the brutix bonus is useful for solosmall gang workactive tanked ships are faster than plated resisted setup and this is important for a blaster boat which must be able to close range and maintain optimalso an active tank bonus is very useful for small gang work espthe brutix bonus is not useful for fleet work where plated resisted setups are besti am not aware of any general consensus on the brutixs bonus and consequently do not no what that consensus is if indeed it does existi agree with you that there are far more drake firing kin than there are brutixes wearing armor repsthis i base on the fact that there are 10 times at least as many drakes in game as brutixesare there proportionally more drakes firing kin than brutixes wearing reps  i have to say i dont knowlets assume you are rightwhy do you think there are so many caldari pilots in game firing sub optimal ammothe kinetic bonus is misleading to newer players and even to some older ones i had been debating whether to add that to the op or noti think i am going to add that to my op at some pointyes i still remember the day that my 5 years old corpy came over ts and saidflying a nighthawkcorpie  i have this iskur scrammed in belt 3 but i cant break his tankme  your firing scourge at it arnt you corpie  yeah of course  i get a bonus to itme  try some havocs on itcorpie  i dont carry themme  hold on ill come and save your sorry ass true story believe it or not 
i take that you didnt address the first part of my post because you dont want to admit that you in fact committed special pleading this is what i am talking about you dont concede points explicitly
the sentence you quoted merely implies existence of such fits it doesnt say anyhing about their effectiveness or if its optimal fitimplication it exists  they have to or should use only it is your constructplease stop failing at englishfun fact little bit off topic there is only one ship im aware of that can never use its bonuses to 100 typhoon 5 bonused launchers 5 bonused turrets wtb typhoon with 10 high slots
haha not off topic at all given davs specious lollogic that ships that cannot use their bonuses to the full must be boosted regardless of game balance his solution would be to boost the typhoon by removing a launcher slot and a turret so it could fit 44 again and receive its full bonusespeople might object to this nerf but dav would tell them that this was nothing to do with game balance and that they should troll elsewhere

showing that your argument is fallacious is not ad hominem get your facts straight im demonstrating what your entire point is based on a logical fallacy and thus is flawedand yes a debate involves making points and making others concede your points or it will never end the fact that this thread has lasted 18 pages should be a clear indication of that
ok here goes the tacticfit mwd fit nano fit cloakuse scout or  mwdcloak  when necessary to avoid anything other than t1 armor tankers and t2 minmatar shipsis this answer good enough for you
this is your 5th post in a row that does not debate the opis it fair to assume that you are unable to come up with the required cara fit and therefore by default have lost stils argument about brutixs bonuses being lost in combat the same way that cmb bonuses are lost in combatare you able to concede lost points to borrow your own terminology 
wowwowjust wowyou have no grasp of logic your viewpoint is fractally wrong no wonder everyone else have stopped responding to your posts
loli think what james is trying to say is that you have made a logical fallacy while constructing the premises of your argument instead of addressing his objections you simply pointed at the conclusion and said lol you cant disprove this well no  dav if you assume all the premises to be correct you cant disprove the conclusion but the point is the premises are fallacious and thus the argument is not sound you are failing to grasp this concept dav it seems like you are suffering from the dunningkruger effect
ok fine thats your 6th post in a row that does not debate the opi take it you have conceded defeat on the brutix bonus objection to the op please stop trolling this thread with personal insults
lol you area really oblivious arent youim p sure that everybody who has a shred of knowledge on how to construct a good argument is laughing at you right now
youre doing it wrong you cannot argue someone using logic who defies logic the best way is to use their argument and turn it against them and enjoy the showjust copypaste the tacticfit from my post because dav decided to ignore it for some reason response should be amusing i wonder if he finds any other loopholedav pointing someones errors or logical fallacies in their argument does not matter if in the op or in subsequent ones is not personal attack accusing them of being troll is
my parents  on my face last night so couldnt respond to your reply davand now that argument is basically irrelevant after reading recent poststhis is exactly what ive been trying to put into words this whole time hes using facts that he says are true to base his argument off of but in reality these facts are wrong so the argument is wrong this is wry i dont even know where to start because the problem in your arguing is at the very beginning of your argument so i dont what to debate against your argument which isnt even factually correcttheres no point
if jt does not want to continue the debate  ill pick this up with you tomorrowdebating with multiple people at a time tends to lead to the situation of discussions cascading out in multiple direction at a time ending up in slanging matches which makes the thread very hard to follow in my humble opinion
there is really no point in continuing when your opponent thinks logical fallacies are debating styles and thus should not be criticized just in case you call me out on it heres the relevant quotethis is what you said when i demonstrated that your argument is fallacious
support on some faction ship would be interesting to but probably wont happen maybe make newer ships that are bound to lowsec
i will trawl through here and put any goodpopular ideas on the main thread at some point get it all together
good ideasi particularly like the idea of a black market and lowsec borders between the warring factions makes complete sense though would have to be plenty of possible ways through so that permacamps are rarehow about overcharged versions of modules that are illegal in hisec i htink there need to be some things that hisec people really cant have to compensate for the relative safety they live inand i live in hisec i just think there needs to be some lowsec boosting so fully suppported
some good and bad ideas all around i like this discussion lowsec has needed an overhaul for a long time now zerozero has received its massive boost i think its time lowsec gets the same a few things herefirst of all in order to understand the problem with lowsec you need to give a reason for people to come to lowsec who wouldnt normally everyone is happy just running l4s all day because theres no risk at all how about making all l4 agents with positive quality ratings 1 to 20 available only in lowsec on top of that no more lowgrade item drops from killed npc ships during missions the current mineral market is terrible because you can just reprocess a bunch of junk from mission pickups and sell the mineralswhen you eliminate item drops the price of minerals goes up this means more incentive to mine the lowsec and nullsec ores because it will mean more iskhour for those minersif theyre carefulincrease the value of scanned plexes in lowsec make some systems hold more valuable ore that sort of thingccp has talked for a while about being able to mine planetary rings and cometsasteroids that zip around in space perhaps these can only be mined in lowsec you could say hi sec rings have already been stripped of their resources and thus it would give people an incentive to minespeaking of miningat risk of sounding like a carebearwe need a new class of mining ships something that has a good solid tank maybe the tank of a battleshipthink about it you buy a hulk for 150mil after fitting and rigs yet most people will never take it out of hisec why because it can be popped by a t1 cruiser or a t2 frig i realize mining ships arent meant to pvp but for the love of all things decent why are they so easy to kill these are supposed to be big heavy tough ships they work around asteroid fields youd think they would be built to take a little punishmenti propose a new class of mining ship which brings in less ore than a hulk but has a much stronger tank that way it wouldnt be so scary to the miners to venture into lowsec to get more valuable ore pirate markets a black market like has been said before make the buying and selling of things like boosters certain implants npc goods pirate faction ships etc only available in lowsec more criminal factions not just guristas blood raiders etc im talking about the lowsec version of hisec corps maybe theyre associated with certain normal pirate groups and thus they determine your rewards but you wouldnt have to worry about killing say a guristas rat and being denied a mission by a corp that is associated with them or at least be able to buy your way to mission status with them after all everyone wants more money an a corp made of dirty pirates is no different i like the idea of buying your way around things perhaps you can find a crooked member of concord who will negate your 15 minute gccfor a price so if you paid them say 60 million isk you could negate your gcc 3 times gate guns would still fire on you if you engage someone within their range but once you warp away they act like your gcc is upor maybe you can buy your way into a hisec system a 05 or 06 without police harassing you it could last a few days or a week or a month depending on how much you pay i think it would give people who want to try piracy a boost especially those who dont have hauler alts this way they could still make trips to the closest hisec system without fear of being attacked smuggling smuggling smuggling who doesnt want to be a dashing smuggler ala han solo make ships that have concealed cargo holds so you could run illegal goods around without attracting the attention of authoritiesi love being a pirate its the most fun ive had in evewe just need some piratey lovin yarr
i love the sound of all this yeah som good some bad ideas here but overall yeah lowsec needs this to be donehmm hidden cargo holds maybe just small holds that cant be scanned make a low slot that can only go on t2 transport ships that is a hidden hold maybe just a few hundred m3 so cant be abused just used to carry smaller illegal items like drugs and illegal implantsthat also allows for hisec missions that require a trip to lowsec to pick up something illegal without the authorities getting you and also for personal smuggling of course
sounds like a nice idea allroundlow sec needs some love  and war  supportedbuffering high sec with low sec is not a really good idea i thinkmaybe a single point of high sec to high sec between races would be a sollution then its either be suicide ganked or taking the risk going trough low seccheckpoint charly i would love to have some sort of overlord like sov system in low sec sort of the ghettos of eve  this system would make a lot of the battling between low sec occupants that is going on relevant an upgrade system like the current sov system could be used to make low sec income a bit better risk vs rewardhaving a way to make decent isk with professions in low sec would be nice being 10 does limit the options quite a bit as to regarding smuggling to high seccreating a market for illigal and pirate faction stuff limited to low sec sounds nice but i have no idea what the impact will be given the fact that everything can still be contracted i am not sure the market would be used that muchbuying your gcc partialy off would be nice depending on the offence the bribe could be lower or higher for example shooting a bantam with your mega should incurr a higher bribe than shooting a mega with your megahaving pirate faction agents in low sec would be very nice a full yes for this i definately would take the risk involved with missioning in low sec to get access to slave implants for instance
nice ideas me likesopening up lowsec to actualy make it worth going to can only be a good thing in my book
bump have you hugged a drone today
interestingid prefer the proposal to specifically state something like the following just my suggestion thoughadd a function to reconnect to drones as long as1 player was disconnected or warped out2 player didnt abandon them3 player attempts to reconnect to drones within say 10 mins to stop people with larger drone bays leaving sets in strategic positions round gates etcthe only issue then would be getting back to the drones within the 10 mins if you happen to have warped out different to dc of room 5 of a mission  but in that case the rats probably got them anyway
i like the suggestions i think one way to implement 3 would be to give disconnected drones a countdown in the realm of the suggested 10 minutes sort of like a signal decay after that they become abandoned and reconnection is disabled i also think its fair to make the countdown activate regardless of disconnect or playerinitiated warpjust to simplify it and account for the potential abuse as you suggestedill update the proposal shortly to reflect this
i agree the timer should start from you warping out or disconnectingwhat i meant by dc being different from warping out is that iirc and it has been a while if you dc in a mission you warp back to the same deadspace pocket but if you warp out from say x extravaganza you would have to warp back to the first gate and then through all the pockets in between within the 10 min timerbut in those cases ive not had any drones left to come back to so ymmvill keep an eye on this thread or ping me in game once it is updated edit i see it has been updated already
issues that have been fixed since first posting this proposal  long range turret and launcher sound effects stop working after a few minutes when zoomed in too close on your ship because various close range modules with looping sound effects  like hardners and resistance amplifiers  are overwriting these sound effects there are desync issues where turret and launcher graphical effects are not in line with the sound effects and alot of the sound effects get skipped often most of the weapon sound effects go silent after a while when mission specific music is playing all module sound effects disapear but targetting and other sound effects keep working when using close range turrets and no hardners or other modules with looping sound effects the sound effects work somewhat better with around 80 of the sound effects coming thru but with alot of incomming enemy fire this can drop to around 50 incomming fire is not always audible jukebox stops playing randomly after which one has to restart it
support for fixing the sound issues some of us actually do have the sound turned on when we playps what the fUFFFDuUFFFDcUFFFDk who makes a new interface for something the jukebox that broken but doesnt fix it why dont repaint my car that doesnt run
i like playing with sound on but never when im in combat the sounds dont necessarily work in the first place and not only does having sound turned on lags the game it makes the game more likely to crash too its a matter of how soon rather than will it
supported as its pretty annoyingi like the sounds jukebox off and it feels pretty random how they come and go 
do you think they will actually listen to us on this does ccp hate gallente  
as close range battleship pilot im much more tempted to use amarr bs  pulse laser than gallente  blasters one exception being the dominix since it has powerful drones that offset the blaster disadvantageas far as pure damage output goes blaster vs pulse advantage is too small to be seriously considered the most influencing factor in weapon choice becomes optimal range  where 1015km is the best range to have for close range battleship both in terms of average battle distance and tracking considerations the niche for blaster advantage is too small ccp like to balance stuff by making everything the same but its rather boring whats the point of having wide variety of choices if all the choices are essentially the same but then its just a matter of principle
yeah gallente need some fixing across the board while i understand that some of the recommendations in the gallente mkii thread may be overpowered the themes and ideas behind the improvements seem sound enough to be considered as a basis for an overhaul to gallente ships which are outside of a few drone boats are all in need of some work largely connected to the issues with blasters and rails
gallente dont suck your guns suck its okay as a caldari dude i feel for you as we use the same crappy gunshybrids make the angels weep with sadness
problem is that as a backup mechanic caldari have missiles  and while they have a few issue rockets they fill nicely where hybrid guns have their issuesgallente as backup mechanic have drones and drones have been nerfed to oblivion for really good reasons they should be nerfed even more imho mostly in pve just bring on sleeper ai and goodbye afk dronemissioners  so they arent a fallback mechanic as good as missileshybrid love is needed but wont be enought to bring gallente on par with other races would just fix caldari problems
id rather that they started off with making the csm meetings more visible and less a complete pita to navigate 
couldnt have said it better myself
i think its a good idea to translate the meeting minutes csm interest is really low and anything that can get people more involved is welcome in my book
supported
yeahwho cares that they are invisible to anyone who does not speak english as there native language right
any suggestionswe know the forum isnt the greatest way to raise and comment on proposals and that it is pretty much a pita to search but that isnt news to us and we want it changed as much as other playersbut any specific issues and potential solutions are welcome
to start with move the whole csm documentation into the game accessible through the ingame ui this means the ccp graphical designers are responsable for its layout and workings theyre professionals and id expect a good result from that
your point is notedin fact weve discussed this off the record within the csm and i hope something will be added to cosmosnew eden to be used via the igb i prefer this option to using the eve ui for many many reasons we have some time set during the iceland summit to discuss csm issues and this will likely come up thenwe now return you to the discussion on localisation
thank you and sorry for going off topic on localization are the meeting minutes enough or should the election process also be translated
no worries it is a related issue because if localisation is added it will need a new ui to be able to link it all together as to what should be translated that is down to what the players would like you could for example translate the wiki proposals and the minutes but it could become a fair bit of work also if we still use the wiki there is a chance the translation will get out of date when the proposal is amended which leads back to needing a better uiportal for csmso in essence assuming an updated portal you could haveraw logs english onlyminutes english  localisationstldr voting results english  localisationsproposals discussed during the meeting english  localisationsas long as people are aware the localisations are volunteer supplied and that the english versions are the official releases i dont have a problem with the idea in fact i welcome the chance to reach more of the playerbasethere is also the possibility for people to raise proposals in other languages and have them translated to english for the csm to vote onit all hinges on people putting in the time though i assume people know tldr is too long didnt read but i add the footnote just in case
translating the campaign process for all candidates would be a logistical nightmare though itd make the campaign integrated into the ui a bare minimum requirement really not that i oppose that idea i promoted it when i campaigned for this csm
this shouldnt be that much of an issueof course this would have to be pointed out appropriatelyas with the ui integration im a slightly afraid of unwillingly creating a deadlock situation where both ideas wait for each others implementation id like to avoid this in favour of giving localisation a chance at all who knows maybe it wont yield the results desired more attention of the playerbase etcand yes i support my own idea 
i dont think the translation idea requires the ui to be semi functional just not anywhere near as easy to implement without ui support but they do need to be brought to the csm as seperate issues though i doubt they wouldnt bei dont think youd have to worry about the translation idea waiting around for the ui idea besides the translation mostly doesnt even require the csm to support it as independant translaters can translate the meeting minutes whenever they want to but the csm backing the idea would be better ofcourse
im all for quality of life features individually they appear insignificant but the annoyances do add up over timeas you say there isnt really much to discuss here so if there are other related chat issues that could be added that would be better if not i can submit this as is
ive got a chatrelated issue that might be added but im unsure if its technically feasable id like nonalphabet writing to be converted to alphabetic for those who choose that option in other words in japanese for instance for those who tick the option kanji would be converted to romanji latin alphabet same would go for russian etc is this possible

supportedpersonally id like to play in an eve without jumpclones jump freighters and jump bridges id like to play in an eve where 00 entities could disable gates build new ones stabilize wormholes and otherwise change the essential terrain in their spacebut i doubt that ccp has that vision the velocity of conflict and markets makes accessible fights and logistics a desirable thing and now would be a good time for a skill to reduce jumpclone lagperhaps by an hour per level so you could jump back at the beginning of a play session the next day rather than the endi would add however a concurrent iskcharge for clone jumping of some amount related to the clone grade quality and perhaps related to how much prior to 24h you are jumpingkrum
or perhaps distance
surprised at so many naysayers were talking about a few hours off of the 24 hr jump timer that isnt going to create any universe breaking gameplay changeswould also accept 1 jump clone per day more time playing rather than waiting out my timer is a good thing
1 from me the amount of times i have missed a crucial fight because i had to jump to empire 20 hours before is annoying and some of the suggestions presented here are very validi dont agree that it needs to be a freeforall it does still need some k
supported for the double jump within 48 hoursits bad enough my old corp barely did any pvp ops at all because of inactivity and lack of numbers even worse is when i jump clones only to find out they cancelled it at the last second leaving me stuck in a noimplant jump clone til the next day for no good reason and im sure no ones gonna want to stay up 24 hours to maintain the focus situational awareness energy and reflexes needed to pvp for that long or even close to itand from the looks of it most of the ppl who disapprove r just trolls just want to make the game less fun for everyone including themselves
i dont think this system is going to work however it is one of the best ive seen the part about being able to bounty people based on standings is where it goes wrong ive written an idea on the bounty system myself which was simpler but in my opinion more effective scrap the bounty system as it is currentlyfollowing give people the ability to contract their killrights to others inside this contract you can if you want also add a bounty which is eligible to the person that bought your killrights on a privatecontract this way you can award certain individuals that you trust for killing your targetextensions to this idea would be that the killright could also be sold perhaps to a corp
and therein lies the problem its currently too easy for people to congregate from all over the map to join up with the uberblob of the day all that results in is people staring at black screens for hours and whine threads in general discussioni agree that it may well make things less annoying when it comes to larger scale fleet organisation but my beef is the fact that other mechanics allow such large fleets to form to begin with and so as i believe this idea would only further enable that trend in the wrong direction if enacted i cannot support itben
i can see where youre coming from but training a rank 16 skill should have its benefits rightmeanwhile i also like marlonas proposalthis could be the cue for introducing t2 tier three bss limit command ships to giving bonuses to a single fleet branch and below while these new command bss can do so for the whole fleet superstructure other than that give them awesome tank and low dps like fleet command ships also with cost similar to a marauder and without the backup of insurance it sure is a nice risk vs reward balancei really hope that improved game mechanics will decrease the incentive for blobbing and just fyi the next fleet step size would be 6406that is a technical problem not related to this proposali already said id also favor game mechanics that didnt give incentive to blob but in keeping with the games sandbox philosophy the tools shouldnt be the limiting factor for emergent gameplayi like this but once you do that the effect will almost be the same as having one large fleet
sure
i agree with thisi suggest the skill be namedspace marshal
i think the title is self explanatory however just to give it some more teeth main reasons are well firstly you decide that your original name was a bit naff and now its time for a change secondly you bought a char and still think the name was a bif naffsee where we are going hereand thirdly your original choice was not available and hey you just found out it isquick let me get itoh waiti cantccp can charge their usual 10 for this  extra revenue which im sure would be constantccp can implement a name change history log just like employment historywill this have an impact on ingame no not at all if your not sure about someone then check their historyeither this or remove the checks for char corp alliance names that cant be the same i still cant undertstand why the hell ccp did it this wayi mean why cant i havea char named fred and an alliance named fred or infact even my corp
not supportedif you would have used the search in doubt
and you would have found that a lot of people support the idea
second this thanks for necroing if plastic surgery services are offered by ccp name changes should be supported as well
sorry for not being a geek and reading every eve forumhowever be nice to know why you felt it wasnt supportedhowever supporting my own idea
absolutely notone of the things that makes eve so unique is that your reputation sticks with you take a look at the joe phoenix story missceo or pretty much anything that nexa necis has written abouteven with the name change history i think that this would be still not be a forward enough indicator as to who that person is  its not their identity its linked to their identity but it wont carry the same weight and wont be nearly as visible if you want a namechange reroll and try again
no its hard enough keeping a track on corp thieves and spies asis your proposal has been discussed to death no no no
if it was a one time thing per account and if on your show info somewhere it showed your previous alias so yeah why not 
not supporteddisposable alts trials etc are already too difficult to keep track of and manage giving many idiots easy ways to do what they please with little if any consequences now you want to be able to escape your past on the idea that when naming your character that you will be investing hundreds of hours of time developing is something you did on a whim read your original name was a bit naff and now its time for a change if you couldnt come up with a decent name you could live with why bother playing it isnt hard picking a name that isnt crap like fdg8kds so you wont ever need to change it all a pilot has in eve that is constant is their name and you want to remove that no no a thousand times noeven adding a list of previous names wont help you can just change your name every month or week or day or whatever interval they set if they even set one you still have issues with standings ally lists out of game lists cause ccp hasnt upgraded the max in game how about when i search for fdg8kds is it going to show him as robert039 now that he changed or show hes gone can someone else become fdg8kds now that he has changed his name to robert039 if so theres a new headache cause that person is always going to show that is their first name if not youve just increased the database entries of items that can never be used again you didnt like darthvader394 well now no one else can use it ever againyou made a decision to name your character deal with it if you cant handle the responsibility of naming a character in a game no one can help you quit playing computer games buy a goldfish and rename it everyday

ok i was going to post something negative on this idea but you had me with the propaspeak and russianaccent typing or if you want ukrainian bravo next we nerf moose and squirrel on to useful commentsas other respondents have pointed out any modules that increase the attribute of missiles need to come with their concurrent ewar counters the way the races are distributed im not sure who you would assign such technology to but for lore purposes i guess it just be invented by gallente scientists or somethingin the interest of fairness it should be pointed out that there is a module that effectively boosts missile explosion radius and velocity its called a target painteryou just use it on the enemy ship rather than your ownkrum
well after having a corp member with far too many rights make an expensive mistake id like to propose the followingif you win an auction put up by a scammer you should be able to simply hold it never claiming your item and at the same time never letting the scammer get your iskyeah were out the isk since theres no way to retract a bid i can live with that but we should be allowed to deny the scammer the proceeds of their scam  by simply refusing to complete the auction freezing the isk in limbo forever
so youre not supporting this request because you hate carebears and think pvp is the only way to play eve got itsupported and it might help to be able to queue stuff up while a mods still cycling such as an ammo swap
no no no please lets try to get them to do one thing at a time although a one move que would sure be nice
best idea ever supported
hulks would definitely be awesome if they didnt have to rely on deadspace mods for tankingallowing shield extenders is probably overkill highsec ganking of hulks will become harder but an increased tank wouldnt affect the gankabilty all too much

not supporteda gistii b type small booster and dread gurista specific hardeners are cheap investments for a hulk pilot in 00 at least when i was mining out there i was permatanking 3 battleship rats without problems
eve is supposed to be a dynamic not a static universeproblem of both 00 tanking without expensive modules and ganking with cheap t1 ships  practically 0 costa 00 ship is a 00 mining ship if the first ship into 00 blew up there would have been no deadspace gear then the ship would never have been flown and it would have been redesignedboost it and boost it a lotmackinaw is quite frankly insulting as it stands wtf am i paying my subscription for while ur at it boost rorqual so it can toe to toe with 5 bs or at least tank for a prolonged period
i wonder how much a basilisk or two would help tanking with the mining fleet op
it would help quite a bit but thats not the point the point is that the hulk has a horrific tank for what its designed for as does the mackinaw and the skiff
25k ehp tanks 82 passive with purger rigs 97dps tanked but only 21k ehpthe extender fit has enough buffer and resists to have maybe an orca rr you reps from a single medium shield transporter gives you wooping 298 dps tank large puts you at 500your shield buffer should last long enough to kill eventual scrambling frigates and warp out if the dmg gets too muchimho expecting to be able to mine without support in 00lowsec is funny 
i actually included that players make it what would this game be if npcs ran the gambling hah
no no no im sorry but im going to be a trollthis will not happen eve is about doing it like it should be not give care bears their free pvp safe havenyou want pvp go to lowsecnull theres tons of it
this idea is bad and you should feel bad
the funny thing is ccp did try this at some point but the code was rejected by the server and ships where lost or something anyways they put it on hold for the time beingthat isnt to say that they abandoned it all together anyways im in favor of this and always have been i think all the people that are against it are afraid of a fair fight tbh and are afraid that if fair fights are available then they cant engage in unfair fights anymore i think that fact is as long as there is something to fight for real pvp will still occur regardless of how fun or great arenas are if world pvp stops its not because arenas ruined it but because there is something fundamentally flawed with world pvp
this
there used to be a lot of unsolicited pvp on other online game and one measure that was introduced  was the duel a player would click on other and select the duel option to invite himthe other could accept or refuseonce accept  they would enter a new mode called duel when ones hp would get to a certain point the duel mode would end with 1 point victory to the winner and no loss of ship for any of them except the ammo and used itemsthat feature seemed to amuse a lot of different players either the ones that liked pvp  and the more shy ones or the ones that have other things to do and would be willing to tryno player would lose the hp in that mode and no concord on thempossibly that mode could only be available to high sec and not among wartargets to prevent escaping like that as the target was rendered invulnerable take damage but not die to others wile in that mode
larkonis is an idiotbut then so are are half the people posting in this thread so why should he be centered out in particularwell id say its because his idiocy caused him to over step the boundaries placed upon all of us by whats acceptable in game and out he broke the rules like rmters and ebayers he crossed the linethat he wasnt permabanned is boggling enough but to leave his name and any rewards he received as some sort of twisted memorial to his deeds would be the flip of the bird to the vast majority of players that do things by the rulesnot supportedmr epeen
why would we reward an insidertrader with a medal for service from the body that he betrayed
if i recall correctly the ships themselves have pretty lousy stats and it is special modules or code that give them the super abilities so if paleyrs had the ships they would not be all that valuable other then looking cool
so this sounds like a bad idea concord is supposed to be your god
implementing this to losec as a human police is the only viable optionit could be actually interesting
for previously mentioned reasons the core idea isnt usefull against gankers concord is too efficient there atleast in 00 space they are in lowsec its a different story might be a fun mechanic there and i also like the idea of people who work for concord being allowed to kill people with low security status who venture into nullsec there are ballancing and abuse issues that might pop up but the general idea seems interesting
looks like what you are asking for is bounty hunters or a bounty hunting system that works id like ccp to look at the bounty system and fix it maybe with a little bit of the flavour of the op here however the way you framed the proposal im going to have to not give it a thumb
you cant even jump a fleet of 30 people through a gate without it taking upwards of a full minute just to drop from the current system you click jumpyou see the notificationand you just sit there after a few moments the notification disappears and you are still thereso you click jump again again the notification shows up and you might even get the jump animation but you still arent leaving the systemits getting so bad that one cant even trust that clicking jump once will actually register with the server fix this  already
sleepers are made to make pve combat resemble pvp combat a little bit better than normal npc combat does and for pve players looking to get into pvp it can be an interesting stepping stone aswell as that its nice for pve players looking for something more challenging because of this i think ccp would do well to introduce special agents that give out missions against sleepers the reason this cant be done by normal agents is because mission runners should be able to choose between normal missions and sleeper missions without having to decline them from normal agents leading to standing lossesprosan extra challenge for pvpers who dont want the added risk of being attacked by players in a wormholea step inbetween pve and pvp for players looking to get experienceconsif the risk reward ratio isnt right then people will have no more reason to go into wormholes or to do lvl 4 ordinary missionsyour input on how to improve the idea would be very welcome
1 sleeper missions in normal space no2 ccp said they want to move the ai to belt rats and mission rats later
id rather they kept mission ai the way it is so that you can choose against which ai type you want to pit yourself in missions hence the seperate sleeper missions id imagine youd have to adjust the salvage and loot if those missions are to take place in normal space but just like you have acceleration gates leading to generated missions why not introduce the same for wormholes
sleepers were introduced as near pvp encounters but time has proven they are farmed just like any other npc  ai is very limited and its still scripted for the most partnspace  wspace missions is a good idea if done right one agent per empire attached to one of the research corporation located near empire centre mission involving killing x amount of y sleeper pilot will have to find an appropriate wormhole to actually complete the mission mission involving scanninghacking a sleeper structure again appropriate wh neededetc etcwould require players to first travel to possibly 00 should be random perhaps with a tilt towards lowsec whs to locate the right whgather allies to assist if a nstier one and then risk life and limb in wspace complete with possible owners and gankersto be really evil the missions cannot be remotely completed so one has to get out as well after completion lowsec whs are frequently camped in certain areas difficulty should be same or higher than l5s which are also designed as group encounters even those are solofarmed now though 
not exactly the effect i was after but on the flip side it might send more people into lowsec which a lot of people seem to want
not exactly the effect i was after but on the flip side it might send more people into lowsec which a lot of people seem to wanti know its off a tangent in relation to yours but if you look at it then it is merely a fleshed out version no amount of ai scripting will ever be the same as a person in combat npcs would need access to every moduleeffect in game and have semirandom ship statistics in order to emulate pvp  just not possible until quantum computers are common placereason i went with lowsec is not only the starved nature of those areas but also since one must assume that the empires control a majority of the whs cropping up in highsec and send their own survey teams similar to the billions of people moving around between planets in invisible shuttles or do you think we poddies are the only ones in space
for what i had in mind i was aiming for wormhole space that couldnt be occupied by other players like mission space that noone else can get to unless the wormhole was scouted out during your mission doesnt that sound appealing to you
not really if i want that i can do normal l4l5 missions  same general effectwspace was introduced as a wildcard containing forces outside the control of humanity with holes appearing and disappearing at randomif they were to be used as just another dedspace instance for missions then the whole thing loses meaningccp have been putting some effort into making the arc missions less grindy by having different branches and enemies to shootwhat i would like is a combination of exploration dead easy with new probing and teamgroup oriented missions a place where smallgangfleet skills can be honed complete with use of rr ecm et ali cant really say that sleepers pose much of a challenge after a while they become just another rat to be blasted  very simple ai still but better than the vanilla versionwhen i do bother to farm isk to fuel my pvp i want it to be done with as fast as possible since the only real challenge is against human opponents ref previous ai scripting comment rest is a timesink
well when im looking for a bigger challenge than lvl 4 missions im not always also looking for cooperation with other players thats a different thing alltogether if i want to solo pve and lvl 4s are getting boring lvl 5s are in lowsec what do i do for an extra challenge thats the underlying issue that spawned my idea
solo exploration in class 2  class 3 wormhole systems
what i am looking for is a pure pve option those wormhole systems are 00 and tend to be occupied by wormhole settlers
sorry thems the breaks eve is meant to not have private instances for a reason no superduper pve only content should be available
true thats the design philosophy by the makers and yet the pve playerbase is growing steadily how much longer will ccp insist on having a design philosophy that differs from what the majority is after
can i have a capital mining ship that eats entire belts at once and can be used in highsecthanks ccpimo pve players do not need more loving right now especially not iskwise
correct the playerbase has been growing steadily why change what has been an obviously successful approach
it depends on how the different types of player populations are growing in relation to eachother if the ballance is shifting slowly then the circumstances change accordingly and the playerbase demands of the game on average will also alter as a result
there are things in eve that have been neglected for yearsmissions have recently got the epic mission arcsjust because missioning is a huge part of many eve players daily routine shouldnt make it top priority constantly
im not aiming at increased income really just increased challenge if the missions i proposed didnt give isk rewards just medals for completing them id still be satisfied
if you want increased challenge step out into real wspace the challenge is already there waiting missions that send people off into wspace would be fine a good addition that could encourage mission runners to spread their wings a bit missions that provide sleepers within the boundaries of safe space would be bad its not additional challenge its the simulation of additional challenge within a secure environment the ultimate increased challenges are already there why not take them
pve gameplay is a controlled designed experience pvp is not its just an entirely different type of gameplay that im not looking for at the same time when im looking for pve gameplay i go to fw for my pvp experience which i enjoy i have nothing against pvp but i like keeping my pve and pvp seperated
ok to get things straight am i seeing that the idea of missions against sleepers isnt being opposed as long as its not a pveengine but a way of getting more people into the normal 00 wormholes and also into lowsec im not opposed to the idea it just wasnt what i originally had in mind
sure i think missions that sent people off into wspace could be a nice addition the agent could even provide coordinates for a wormhole and then a specific objective in the wspace system
sounds good to me and what about the exit to the wormhole being in lowsec so the player has to travel back to the agent through lowsec or is that a bad idea lowsec being as unpopular as it is amongst pveers i doubt players would do these missions if lowsec was involved
i think some of each would be fine even going directly from highsec jumping into an unknown system brings a new level of riskinteractionchallenge to the mission that wspace system could be completely empty or there could be active pilots in the system even if its empty the possibility that someone is in the system without local giving it away adds a psychological challenge i find that most wormhole explorers end up in hybrid pvppve fit ships designed to handle multiple and unknown situations simply getting away from the optimized pve fits adds another level of challenge do you fit a cloakthe mission wormhole will only stay open so long is there a risk of getting trapped do you fit a probe launcher these are mostly new questions for the pveonly pilots to consider good stuff
what if you got shot get killrights want the agressor to suffer but the place you got shot was hulkageddon the only thing youre actually good at is shooting asteroids and building the ships that kill you you have the killrights but you cant do anything with them so who do you conctract someone who can shoot your targets for you contract your killrightsthe whole point of this proposal is that you can sell your killrights through contracts its pretty straight forward you get shot you sell the killrights to whoever wants to buy them it allows you the peace of mind of knowing that someone probably hunts the target you earned money on getting shoton the other side of the story you want to kill people in highsec but you dont want to waste your sec status as a missionrunner youre at 19 and if you kill someone now youre not able to access your mission agent wardec is also not an option as youd be camped to bits and cant earn your isks while you got 4 hostiles trying to shoot you up what do you do buy killrights 5 mil for freddy youve seen him buying new guns in your system so lets just wait till he warps in and shoot the spine out of his back bountieswhen you contract your killrights to someone you will have the ability to add a bounty you deem fit to killrights someone might pay 5 mil for your killrights but you attached a 15 mil bounty which will be given to the buyer when he kills the target this is meant to encourage actively hunting the person youre allowed to killalso please note there also exists something called a private contract you can choose who you give your killrights  bounty to i wouldnt add a bounty on killing freddy if i know the first thing that freddy is going to do is buy the killrights with an alt and earn himself the bounty bounty hunter professionthis idea in my opinion gives people a lot more room to create a dedicated bounty hunter profession if some bounty hunters are specifically efficient in killing their targets people might trust them and start giving their killrights to this group this group in turn makes sure that the targets die everyone is happy and more pvp emerges further ideas could be being able to contract killrights to corporations or sharing your killrights with your corporation killing people through contracted killrights could give a slight standing loss which could be reduced or removed with a few skills being able to see who has killrights on you through skillsanyway discuss
you know you could have basically the same system without having killrights involved at all all youre trying to do is privatize the bounty system which could easily be done with a bounty mail box people apply for the hit you allow them the chance at the money personally with a click of the mouse first one to collect erases the contract no killrights needed this way i can put a bounty on someone for cutting me off at a gate if i so please the way it should be if theres a bunch of bounties on one target the hunter has the option to apply to all this is 1 of the only 2 plausible bounty systems the other being the random target generator ran by npc corps id personally like to see both employed sometime in the near future
im afraid that calling the thread a fix to the bounty system might have been misleading for you your part about currently not needing killrights at all not really have you ever tried shooting someone with a 10mil bounty in highsec i daresay you havent if you shoot someone in highsec that is not flashing red youre either suicide ganking or you havent got a clue what youre doingprivatising the bounty system i suppose its added as encouragement to hunt your targets if everyone can indiscriminately claim the bounty without the contract its just as broken as it is currently you just kill yourself with an alt to get the bounty that has been placed on yourself you get rewarded twice when you kill someone and when he places a bounty on you which is the core problem of the current systemmy system basically allows you to sell killrights if you get shot by someone this system primarily allows you to sell the rights for retaliation to someone else the chance for pvp is worth something in eve online especially in highsec this system would be worth less in nullsec or lowsec but its worth a lot more where it counts namely highsec the bounty attachment is just a subfeature to encourage active hunting even through lowsec or nulsec
perhaps something along the lines of the fw system where you join in a station you could join the bounty hunters which would require a high sec status since a person has to have a negative status the bounty hunters would be allowed to kill anyone with a bounty against them and collect the bounty perhaps a way for the outlaws to defend themselves from bounty hunters as well such as a special flag for bounty hunters on an overview and perhaps a way for outlaws to fire first in a highsec system perhaps based off their negative sec status and the sec status of the system that they are in similar to how fw folks can fire on one another in highsecat least i think they canso if a outlaw has a high bounty he can still run to a high enough highsec and be safe until he is chased out of highsec by raising his negative status as he is chased out of highsec he becomes a target for bounty hunters wanting make a quick buck since it takes a while to grind to a highsec status this could slow down the amount of meta gaming for isk that comes from the current bounty system though probably not eliminate it completelybounty hunters would have access to high end agents able to sniff out their bounties in highsec alsoi know it has some holes but i hope the idea makes sensealso before you say that this would just allow people with lowsec status to be attacked in highsec if you have a negative sec status you have already fired upon someone else and lost status so you have already agreed that you want to pvp you might not just like it being consensual for a change
not supportedwar dec them or can flip them in current system that or go to lownull sec and just shoot them
not supportedop and supporters clearly are targeting miners because they cant mine themselves and need precious ore to sustain themselves but are not capable of training mining skills if you need to steal from miners so bad you need to try to introduce a change to play that makes items and their method of use moot you are a failure

variation is sucking hybrids on caldari ships or much more sucking hybrids on gallente ships
i think hes convinced that eagles arent supposed to be snipersalso if you look at the suggestions offered thus far instead of just reflexively rejecting anything you didnt immediately like you can see more then a few suggestions that would maintain or even increase the flavor differences between weapons systems rof suggestions for example would be acceptable for me at least so long as the cap issues related to rails are also dealt with
the eagle has no dronebay no pg to use its one utility slot and cap problemsits a tradeoff each ship is best in a certain role for example the amazing tracking and damage of the zealot with radio at 100 km kills frigates in a way that the eagle and deimos cant even dream ofsorry to see that noir has someone as misinformed and bad at fitting as you mate stop being short sighted 15 raild damage increase does not even come close to the zealots performance it just stops caldari pilot from crosstraining because they are fed up with doing piddly damage by the way i dont see how that  10 pg increase will make eagle op or change its flavorsuch a fix would just make railboats suck a bit less vs the other turret ships plz read my proposal and all the comparisons i offer as well as the justification for my numbers before any knee jerk reactions thank you
anything that makes rails more even in the game
1 if a zealot switches to blood radio it does less damage than an eagle2 its absurb to suggest that balancing ships around the zealot is the right approach3 the eagle has almost identical damage to the muninn  hence why i said that a 10 damage buff would bring it in line remember that the eagles other advantage is in being able to outrange all the other hacs  with that 10 buff itll do reasonable damage with spike past the 200km mark4 i already said that the deimos is a terrible sniper read the ship description and itll be obvious whydid you even read my posts
i read your posts twice you are misinformed or havent done enough research on sniperhacszealot 299 740  9313 aurora 21k ehpmunnin 224 1966  8122 tremor 25k ehpdeimos 235 824  8437 spike 20k ehpeagle 235 824  7925 uranium 195k ehpi get these numbers from eft and it could be screwd up but they are consistently so and are based on the same premises they are as similar as possible shield buffered and 3 damage mods for each ship with an optimal of roughly 80km but lets see what patterns emerge from themeagledeimos alpha  112  zealot alphamunnin alpha  24 eagledeimos alphazealot dps  127 eagledeimos dpseagledeimos 104 munnin dpsso even if we disregard the huge difference in buffer we can see that the ship performing the best atm as a sniper is the munnin with a huge alpha advantage even with a 15 increase to the damage of railguns the eagle and deimos do not even come close to being as good as the other two sniper boats the 10 pg increase for eagle will allow it to fit the same buffer as the rest of them with one fitting mod and not twofinally you mention the fact that the eagle reaches with spike out to 200km however it hasnt got enough targeting range to be able to do so so that argument is null and bringing it into the conversation when the operating range for sniperhacs is 80100kms denotes ignorance unless you propose to increase eagles base locking range so it can hit out to 200km or add another mid slot for the 2nd sensor booster do you really think that is a better attempt at balancingi really expect more from noir
those numbers have nothing to do with the fits i posted try againrun the fits i posted  then add 10 more damage to the eagle which i indicated i would support and then see how they match up at this point the eagle will have more dps than a muninn and 2x the tracking the muninn has a dronebay more alpha and 1 more utility high the eagle has the ability to snipe at far greater distancesheres what i have a big problem with  your suggested changes to rails dont solve the underlying problem theres nothing to make rails unique as a weapon system lasers have more dps artillery has more alpha rails have  what i reckon itll be reasonable to give the eagle 10 more grid but not all caldari railboats the rokh is already one of the easiest snipers to fit and does reasonable damage
then support the notion conditionally my numbers are an estimate based on what i have encountered in game if ccp decides to change the railguns they will implement their numbers anyway i am just hoping to prod them in the correct direction the important concept here is that railguns do need a damage increase be it through rof less cap or damage modifier or ammo changes to say that you dont support the notion because of the numbers is kind of lame since you agree that there is a need for changeas far as flavor goes i think that rails do stand halfway between projectiles and lasers throwing mass using electromagnetic fields to do so instead of explosives however apart from game flavor they need to be able to fulfill the mechanics of the game so the numbers really have nothing to do with flavor thats already there by the nature of the weapon system the numbers are there as a game mechanic so the flavor will remain because of damage type and cap consumptionwhy not add your support with a provisionthanks
agreed on the rokh  needing one rcu is not unduly onerous for a fleet sniper however lack of grid is a general problem with battlecruisersized caldari railboats  the moa and ferox are nearunfittable with rails the raptor and cormorant are also very short on grid but id rather see the cormorant addressed as part of an overall rebalancing of destroyersedit in terms of rails flavor in my ideal world rails and beams tracking would be swapped arty  alpha beams  dps rails  trackingrange not gonna happen though v0v
i think that the rails are quite aptly fitted as far as the qualitative nature of their characteristics their issues lie within the exact quantitative attributes for them thus the proposal is geared towards a generic increase to the damage rails deliver not how they do so as long as the dpscost increases by 15 by what ever route is deemed as more appropriate be it higher rof less cap ammo changes or straight damage modifier boost then well see a better balanceas far as the 10 pg increase it is tied with railgun pg requirements and the ability for caldari boats to field the higher tier and an adequate buffer if ccp considers that its better to reduce the pg requirements for rails by 10 that would be acceptable too although it would make gallente railboats a bit more powerfull than i think they should beanyway it would be interesting to hear the opinion of the csm on this
heres what i hope will develop sometime in the future to provide all the long ranged guns with a suitably large nicherailgunspros best damage at 160180 fairly low cap used longest base rangecons burns through ammo quickly reducing its endurence and minimzing ammo types high pgcpu requirements more then currentbeamspros best damage at lower ranges high tracking quick ammo switchescons high cap useartillerypros super high alpha no cap usecons lowest base rangerailguns would excel at fixed ranged engagements of somewhat limited length beams would excel at engagements with more varied ranges or shorter ranges that can last a long time and artillery would excel at providing shock damage in ambushinitial engagement situationsfor me this change is a baby step in the right direction that at least makes rails viable if not particularily flavorful since viabilityflavor it will at least provide some semblence of balance until another attempt to overhaul is made
medium rails dont need as much of a damage boost as large rails large rails have big problems about 5 more damage is the most they should getdeimos is midrangedamagealpha  comfortable enough below other ships that a small boost really wont make it shineeagle has silly range low damage and slightly low alphahonestly the silly range of an eagle balances out those other two pretty well 5 more damage would bring the eagles alpha out of last place dps would remain at the bottom though
do you realise that a sniper hyperion has the same dps as an apoc at 190 km
so a ship with 5 damage bonus only gets equal dps to ship with no damage bonus
i dont have any logical fallicies  what you are having are accuracy fallicieseither accidentily through error or misconception or deliberately to try to misleadin the off topic post where you were critisizing my argument you failed to mention anything about combat tacticscara fits can carry multiple missile types therefore it is a base ability that has to be taken into account when judging what are and what are not optimal combat tacticsinstead you went of on some rave about me not assigned module status to missilesnow this is the 7th post you have made in a row where you have failed to debate the opstop debating the debate and debate the opthis is the point we were at before you had to resort to evasionas you have posted and not replied to my brutix answers  i was waiting to see what you had to say on that  i will continue and bring the debate back round to the kin issue of the op brutix fitlows2 x marplayers choice of resist mods and mag stabs  tesmidsscramwebinjectormwdhighs cloak for solo low sec roaming only best blasters that can be fitted with remainining gridcpurigschoice of  as required for fit resist rigshybrid rigsgrid rigsthis is a brutix fit for solosmall gangpirate gate camp workcombat tactics requiredload am  close to short range on enemy  apply scram and web  blast them to bitsororbit at optimal of ammo  any choice acceptable   applying scram and web  blast them to bits a bit sloweruse scout or  mwdcloak  when necessary to avoid blobsnow to the bonusin all engagements the brutix will enjoy full use of its armor rep bonusthe brutixes bonus is 100 compatible with its combat tactics 100 of the time when fitted as abovenow jt your turnplease show me the caracal fit that can use its kin bonus 100 of the time when usings its combat tacticscaracals combat tactics include using optimal ammo for the targetif you cannot do the above then you concede the point that brutix bonuses are not incompatible with brutix combat tactics in the same way that cmb bonuses are incompatible with cmb combat tactics
you are just plainly asserting that i have shown that you made a special pleading if you object to that you have to demonstrate it not just assert that its not
you never demonstrated anything about my argumentall you did was make an accusationaccusation  demonstationthe only thing you have managed to demonstrate is your inability to back up the claims you make about the op in someway being innacurate9 posts  2 pages and about twelve hours have passed since you latched onto stils mistaken comparisons of bonusesand you have still not been able to come up with the required fit to prove the link between brutix and cmb bonusesi therefore claim victory on this issuefurthermore this is the last time i will be replying to any post you makei am not going to debate with you any further as its clear you only wish to derail this thead with meta arguments about meta arguments about meta arguments about meta arguments110 for trolling prowess this is now what your 7th failure to disrupt this post 
how is that not a demonstration you created the premise that if a ship can be fitted to use 100 of its bonuses then the bonuses are not wasted you used it to show that brutixs bonuses are not wasted because it is conceivable to fit an armor repairer on it you later created a loophole saying that missiles are exempt from this fitting rule because they can be fitted and unfitted during combat ie using combat tactics thus from the loophole you conclude that caracals bonuses are wasted because it is conceivable that it wont stick to 100 kinetic missileshow is it not special pleadingand preemptive dodge much
i have not created a loophole  or stated that there are any fitting rulesevery missile launcher fitted to every ship in eve has the ability to fire any type of missile designed to fit that launcherthis is not a situation of my creationit is the game we play as designed by ccpyou are accusing me of doing things over which i have no say or control
do you mean that cmbs were designed by ccp to fire fully bonused 1 optimal 2 ammo in every situation3 or have i misunderstand you
active armour tanking a brutix stop its too much btw dav you didnt reply to my idea that you should propose fixing the typhoon by removing a missile and turret slot otherwise it cannot benefit from its bonuses id be very interested to hear your stance on this
25 rof bonus everyone wins
you seems to have lost ahem i mean flew quite a few phoons what are your thoughts on it or do the followingget eftfix out a phoon with 4 siege  4 acrun a dps report for hull training 0  if thats possible in eft run a dps report for hull training 5then do the following calculation  dps5  dps0   1   100thatll give you the dps increase of the hull of the joint bonusesdo it again for 53 splits and see if its any differentbe constuctive for a changecome back here and let us know what you have found outid prefer if you did this  as i dare say id get accused of cherry picking  making it up  suffering for x number of syndromes etc if i did itof the top of my head id guess that youd be looking at a number around the 25 markthen ill be more than happy to comment on anything you have found
ive read this twice and it still doesnt make any sense i have no idea what you are talking about or why it certainly isnt relevant to what i wrote it just appears to be your normal move of ignoring peoples comments and blathering on regardlessso we return to my point you have a problem with ships that cannot make full use of their bonuses the typhoon is one such ship since it cannot fit 55 projectilesmissiles the only solution to this problem by your logic since we cannot add highslots is to remove a missile slot and turret voila it can now make full use of its bonuses and is therefore fixedthis is of course absolute horse thereby demonstrating that your rationale for changing these ships is completely moronic not to put too fine a point on it
so you have just stated that your phoon problem argument is horse i agree you are talking horse  as per usual
are you dumb or what if you dont see what gypsio iii are talking about here you have already lost this discussion because of stupidity
he didnt asked whats the overall percentual damage increase of the typhoon but how to use its bonuses to b100b every single one of themyour post suggest this if you dont fill all available weapon mounts of bonused type youre still use its bonus to 100practical example 1 typhoon with 3 turrets uses its projectile bonus to 100practical example 2 drake with 3 launchers uses its missile bonus to 100extreme example drake with signle launcher uses its missile bonus to 100so unless you come up with idea how to fill both missile bays and turret hardpoints your argument is moot and has absolutely nothing to do with his questionalso i could argue that percentual dps increase does not indicate how the bonuses are used using prophecy as exampleyou could counter stating that prophecy is tank modded ship and does not need damage increasei could counter that drake is tank modded ship and does not need damage increase too even it actally does some damage increase as plusyou could then accuse me of trolling and do this dance foreverand now could you finally stop dodging and address my caracal fittactics for page before
what i offered to look at the phoon bonuses and give him my opinion  which he had requestedwhen i asked him for some numbers for a starting point  he started to cryi dont know what the dudes issues are i more than happy to take a look at the phoonsure dude id be happy toofor people who may just jump to the end of the topic and to keep it all in contextwould you be so kind as to repost your caracal fit in as much detail as possible pleaseand also restate what the combat tactics arewe were trying to achive optimal combat tactics and 100 bonus usage at the same time right to refute the claim in the op that this is not possible with cmbs
jeez looking one page backwards would require too much effort from you rightlet me add to to refute the claim in the op that this is not possible with cmbs under the same terms you made available for your brutix exampleok here goes the fitfit hmls with kinetic missiles cloakfit mwd shield tank sensor boostersfit nanoand here tacticshave a tackler to keep target at placetake out target from distanceuse scout or  mwdcloak  when necessary to avoid anything other than t1 armor tankers and t2 minmatar shipsis this answer good enough for you
noone of the other main objections in the op is caldari woeful soloabilityits been there from the starti am not trying to dodgebut the brutix fit i gave you was solosmall gangyou have not giving me a setup i can use if i have no friends  and i dont please fit tackle and we can start from there
oh sorry my mistake i always thought gallente were geared for solosmall gang at short distance warfare and caldari for larger fleet engagements and range silly me i guess all those range bonuses confused mealso you didnt say anything it has to be for solo i assumed i should use optimal tactics long range is for caldarianyway keep the hmls scratch the cloak no slot for it anyway   replace sensor booster with scram rcu ii to actually fit it 1 low slot for whatever fits and 3 rig slots at your disposaltactic doesnt change much except you have to rely on scout moreactually the best fit would be to fit drake since youre using brutix as example but thats another story
having a scout is not solo either dudeyou can keep the tackler if you really want to  i just dont want you in 30 posts time turning round to me and saying i am doing a bait and switch or whateveryou can play for the removal of the whole phrase in the op or you can play for an  against it  with the asterik stating whatever we work outif the requirements of your combat tactics require a second player or account then asterisk is the best i am willing to offer you  i can tell you that right nowok lets start hammering out the details  mostly tactics if you are going to keep a second player  scout or tackle  then that is going into the requirementsrequirements for a caldari missile boat pilot to fight optimally and keep his bonuses at all times during combat1a obtain the services of another player or1b obtain a second account and a second monitor and graphics card if your current graphics card only support 1 monitor2 obtain a ship for said character to fly3 obtain and supply modules to second characterok so we can only engage targets with week kinetic resists otherwise we are not fighting with optimal ammo read tactics or we have discarded the kinetic bonus ans therefore failed in out goalt1 armor tankers and t2 mini are a good place to startbut there is the possibiity that the enemy player has fitted a kin hardner  this is especially likelly with t2 who quite often like to patch that holeso we need a ship scanner to see what modules he has fittedwhere would you like to put the ship scannerwould you like this on your scout tackler or would you like to fit it to the cara kinetic must be the lowest resist orno more than 5 higher than the next lowest resist if we are hull skill level 1no more than 10 higher than the next lowest resist if we are hull skill level 2no more than 15 higher than the next lowest resist if we are hull skill level 3no more than 20 higher than the next lowest resist if we are hull skill level 4no more than 25 higher than the next lowest resist if we are hull skill level 5
in the original post of this argument you usedto evade situations where your fit is not optimalthen suddenly im not allowed to use scout to evade situations where mine fit is not optimalthis is textbook example of special pleading fallacy please read the articlealso i would recommend to you read at least definition of fallacy to understand what fallacy isps1 i wonder your solo brutix without scout will perform in drag bubble campps2 on scout does it matter even if i should reduce my engagements to ganking t1 haulers the situation you described exists therefor i proved my argumentps3 edit not using scout is not solo thats mental deficiency
can i remove use scout or  mwdcloak  when necessary to avoid blobsbecause in the case you actually get into the blob your fit is not optimal 2 mars simply wont have time to repair amount of hp provided by single plate therefor i proved your argumentwrong
sucks to leave your drones behind
only on a disconnect and reconnect to drones should be automatic if you are returning from a disconnect emg warp outsorry if you leave it too late and have to warp out to save your shipits your own faultplus all sorts of baits  exploits are possible with off grid safeslots of sentries left at a gate anyonewarp onto grid well out of range and reconnect to start fighting now that you out of harms way 
you raise a good point but i wouldnt call that an exploit id call it tacticsand bad tactics at thatso they drop their sentries and then warp offgrid now they have to detect a target jump back in reconnect target then engageall while micromanaging the proposed 10 minute countdown by warping in reconnecting and warping back out againthats not really any more effective than just jumping in and deploying the sentries straight off it also isnt really a good baiting trap since the sentries will be ongrid when someone shows up kind of a giveaway if you see that the drones are still active
showing my sincerest support for this noble cause
theres sound in this game
hardly that is why we want it fixed p

supportedi turn the sound off now cause it sounds too choppy and the station  gate sounds are too loudi would like to hear eve again
this is exactly what needs to happen shields get ehp and increased regen while armor get ehp bonus this is balnced because armor generally has a larger buffer to start with and the bonus is percent based

please fix this
i fully agreeill support this idea
thats true but it could render it way easier to usetechnically spoken true again but id like to see it getting some kind of official touch maybe even a little support by ccp i guess they have also some professionals in the team that might be willing to lend a hand but the latter is more of a dream than a real wish 
this will be dealt with
welcome to the part where selfcontrol and personal responsibility become importantits not like you didnt have to actually type the words in and hit enter swear all you like outloud  yell and scream if thats what floats your boatbut youll have a hard time convincing ccp to change their stance and lose that teen rating since that will severely limit where they can sell those nice boxed editions of the game
ccp have absolved themselves from responsibility with the warning that states online interactions are unmoderatedccp themselves said  many times at the fanfest keynote address not to mention the htfu theme songso ing what if i have a poor  of a ing vocab get the  over itany ban from ccp based on language is completely hypocritical when compared to the culture that has been fostered and the freedom that has been given to players
please visit your user settings to reenable imagesonline interactions not rated by the esrbindeed eve will instantly lose the t rating when the rule is loosened on something that isnt rated in the first placei am not proposing the rule is removed entirely changing the particular line toyou may encounter and converse with people who are rude offensive belligerent and who may use indecent obscene andor threatening or harassing language while playing the game you may report any extreme instances of such behavior to ccpwould be enough to stop blatant abuse of the system for the sole purpose of getting someone in trouble for utterly meaningless infractions of a rule that very few people adhere to in the first place a large portion of the subscriber base  in particular victims to corp theft scams and such  swear in game is it right that i could petition every instance of swearing of these people causing even further backlogs in the petition queue and having them unfairly warned or banned bluefaced gasps
you have far more faith in the good nature of humanity than i do obviously
fixed that for youbut no not particularly if i did this thread wouldnt exist
heh a matar just lost a fw fightso now the amarr that killed him has to wait 2 days without any skill training while his frivolous petition is dealt withvictory through petitiongeeeeez this is stupid
i do agree that this is stupidif anything ccp should make a toggleable profanity filter like seen in most other mmosmost people ive played eve with dont seem to give a flying rat about whether you swear a little although i realize that theres probably some people who gets scared and go hides under their bed when they hear hear anything worse than guys that was the most poor performance ive ever seen
that  is ing ed and needs to go the  away right ing now
simply put if a paint shop was put into the game the lag would not increase except for those with bad graphics cards and horrid computers as the models would stay the same as they are now and the server would only tell clients computers what color to make the ship just as it does when you change your ships name or when you fire your turrets all the coding would be almost identical as long as its setup correctly
i dont see why not though i can only imagine how common black ships will beanyone remember navy megas before dominion people bought those just because they looked coolthough yes i would like to see gawdaweful paint jobs like space forest camo be done away withthis has my support i see no reason why this shouldnt be allowed
im all for the subject getting the go ahead im in my target sorry hulk painted in yellow and red not to be funny about it but who the hell wants to paint a flying brick in the traditional colours of a target redyellow i know wouldnt make me invisible or such like but if im gonna die in my mining ship please let me not die looking like a bloody target lolpswould be cool to see whole war fleets painted up in similer colours and if possible with thier corp logo printed on the ship somewhere

may i draw your attention to this linkagewiki entry rejected issues categorythis proposal was rejected by csm3 and wasnt updated since so why give it another shotnot supported
you can draw attention all you want that was the last csm there is now a new csm it was not proposed to ccp and therefore ccp did not reject it
i support fixing the bounty system i would like to add the following suggestions1 make the bounty system similar to contracts players have to spend isk to setup bounties and they have time limits they are also better organized and regulated2 allow players to countercontract bountiesplayers that have a target bounty posted against them can then setup reverse bounties against others this would help limit the obvious harrassment bountiesjust ideas
what makes this interesting is how this would interact with a gang or would it just limit it to one solo hunterid say having kill rights as a prerequisite for a bounty makes sense and also helps limit exploitation ie if the freighter pilot isnt going around blowing up ships a bounty couldnt be placed on him in order to secure gank rights
i think this needs revising and editing before it can be raised take in account the comments so far rewrite it and i will raise it for next meeting
do what i do and disable forum signatures it makes the forums much more readable it isnt the size of the file its all the people that feel a deep need to have 34 lines of pointless quotes plus an extra 200 vertical pixels of epeen
this a very good question as long as they dont allow blinking gifs larger files should be allowedhighly doubt it would take more than a few minutes of time to make the change  that would hardly impact anything else the programmers are working on
i remember the days when a 10 person fleet was called a blob  oh wait that was today people use the word blob for any fleet larger than their fleet or any fleet large enough that they no longer feel special this is a multiplayer game  it is designed and marketed as a game where you can join a big fleet and shoot at another big fleeteve isnt going to stop having large fleets limiting a fleet size to 256 clearly does nothing to stop people from forming large fleets fix the shortsighted fleet limitation as to the question of will we ask for the limitation to be raised when fleets start rolling out in the thousands rather than hundreds  yes if ccp invests in hardware and need for speed to allow even larger fleets then boasts about the size of fleet fights because of their work it would only make sense that they would put a few man hours of programming into increasing the ingame fleet max to correlate with all the other effort and money they put into the issue
the fleet limit as is dos not reduce the number of people turning up to a fight it just makes things awkwardsupported
good idea
been discussed to deathi said no before im saying no nowyour name is who you are in eve online if you picked a stupid name thats your own problem if you dont like the reputation associated with your name that also is your own problemthe only time i would approve character name changes is during the character sale process and even thats iffy to me
i would quite like this implementedthe term i would add though is that the new name has to in some form reflect your curret namefor example my name is fu22 fuzz if this came around i would be on it like a shot and change it to something along the lines of fuzzeh or whatever is free near thatafter all my time playing this game i seriously regret having numbers in my name as it is read as f you twenty two 
thisin a reputation based system identity is key
which would have made sense if people didnt have 10 alts and could sell and buy new chars whenever they feel like doing it as it stands now there is no reason not to implement it although of course it should be easy to find someone when searching for his old name and the other way around
i guess we shouldnt allow employment history then i guess youll have to stay in the same corp foreversame thing isnt it i mean is it because you cant be bothered to click on a char name history tab seriouslyyour not hiding from anything the history is thereplease think before you postta
no way if you mess up your reputation you have to live with itand choose your name wiselyin eve actions have consequences this is not wow
well im against this name change system for the main reason has anyone looked at the news lately that goonswarm fell apart due to their one of their leaderships who is claimed to have taken billions of goonswarm assets and your wanting to allow name changes would then give that player who took away all them assets to just change his character name and restart with billions of ill gotten assets  no i think not if he has indeed taken all them assets away then he should have to face the music of several hundreds of angry players who where part of his alliance there must be accountability of some sort if name change idea gets implemented then i believe lots of players will just give up playing eve altogether as whats the point if actions as bad as these go unpunished just by changing your name 
if implemented properly with a onetime cost and a rule like no more than once per year or per character i will support this
in all honesty thats why players have alts and religiously protect the identity of their alts the only situation where changing a characters name would be okay is if it was being traded to another person as there really wouldnt be a way to prevent people from changing their characters name trade to a friendalt change name trade back i dont think this proposal is a good one even if you allow the old name to link to the new character characters would end up having a string of name changes and it really would cease to serve the purpose of protecting the purchasing player from the selling players actions with the character anyway
yes bagehi the use of an alt allows them to transfer their ill gotten gains but doesnt allow them to keep their ill gotten gains on a main with several years of training under its belt if you give them name change abilities not only can they steal vast fortunes but they get brand new identity also this idea has so far proven that those with bad reputations from theft scams etc can now just effectively delete it with a simple name change not a good plan imo
allthough id like this a lot to avoid getting primed in fights due to my name i dont think this is a good idea as some others allready mentioned you have a reputation and thats a very important thing in eve
so then link accounts to each other when they are from same person sure not always possible but still as much as possible and remove ability to buy and sell chars since otherwise it doesnt make any sense at allwell even if all those things would be removed it wouldnt make any sense how would it have any effect on your reputation when you can just see your previous names just like corp history and apparently this isnt wow and everything should have consequences also the name you decided to take when you started so why are you allowed to leave a corporation being in that corporation could have affected your reputation yet you are allowed to leave it and you made the decission to join it why not be stuck in it for the rest of your eve career
as an avid drone user i agree with this post give us a way to work out which drones in bay are damaged and i seen a simple idea post by someone about putting damaged drones to last of the que that idea is good also
10
most drones are destroyed before they can get back to the drone bay so perhaps the drones could be repaired in the drone bay right away so when you have docked up drones they are always full health might be overpowered though so maybe make it a skill or a module
i agree yes and noto increase to much the power of the web is not the solution the problem its the same race minmatar have bonus on the speed tanking and web if you include the new ammunition they are some problems ccp need to nerf something perhaps to make a new module like web  with extra range about 20 km but with web strength 30 or to add some bonus and each racial interceptor on the range of the web
webs are in near perfect balance with the overall ship performance all we really need is an amplifier to broaden the fitting options  the godweb is dead and buried thank goddesslow slot modules fashioned after same principle as the sig amp used by ecm boatsweb amplifier increase web strengthdampener amplifier increase dampener strengthwarp disruption amplifier increase scramble rangemake bonus t1t2 5751015 with similar fitting requirements as sig ampsgives ships something to fit other than bufferspeed while allowing for highly specialised setupsnbtracking disruption does not need more power so intentionally left out perhaps decrease bas mod stats and add amplifier
except on the hugginrapier this would be complete useless to the ships that actual would need stronger webseven on the hugginrapier it would reduce the options for nano or tes to get some useful range the only thing this will bring are more effective cheap thrown away t1 tackling frigs for gangs that already have zero issues to throw more than just 12 on the targetalso lol at godweb most nano fits where still kicking around 400600ms after a single web and i have not seen anybody that fitted a tank instead of nano complain about web range back in the days

the close button needs to be moved towards the right while the accept buttons are on the leftits likely a fair portion of these purchases are mistakes in clicking buttons which are too close together
let me get this straight you mean to tell me you got scammed on an auctionsounds like you didnt read the fine print that or im not quite understanding what your getting atclarification
nodont petition it you will not get your isk back from a scam and youll only be adding to the time required to fix real problems man up and accept the consequences for your actions
yeah i got rooked ill stand up and eat my crow on that scoreccp needs to let me get back at the choad by never completing the escrow tying up one of my contract slots and one of his until he cancels or recycles which ends the auctionanything to deny him the profits
you want to deny them their profit enable your brain before clicking
profitting from others stupidity is one of the core principles of eve imhoi like the old goon saying if you have more isk than braincells well equalise that would you sign a contract irl without reading the fine print inb4 nda reference btw
causeing people pain and grief is also one of the core principles of eve iircso supporting this on the principal that i will be able to tie up virtually unlimitted numbers of contracts on the contracts market never intending to pay any of themhow many people will i be able to honk off with this new super powertotally supported
i guess this is probably aimed at caod forum but in reality can be used for all forumsi know ccp have all these isds and all these other volunteers well why dont they create a mod one for the forumswith respect the forums are infested with absolute crap especially caod its terribleso anyway this isnt about discussing moderators so apologies if it sounds like that but more about helping them and ccp im sure alot of people would love to moderate the forums properly and clean them upmaybe caod can be used as a pocthanks
ah yes allow me to just moderate the posts of people i dont likeleans back
let me just iterate matey this isnt going to be another shc where moderation is biased this is about having trusted mods if they cant do it right then they get that priviledge removed
well swarm moderation can work the question would be do we have enough people active in the forums to support it
allow for loyalty points to be traded openly in the markets or via contractsor you could make the loyalty points available to be sold back to the corporation for isk many of the items are not cost effective for lp trading with the npc corp
supported this would have some very interesting effects on the market and i would finaly be able to get rid of the remaining 58lp here 120lp there and so on for corps i no longer work for
no allowing people with atrocious standings standings to a corporation access to its lp storeit would completely invalidate the decisions made by individuals resulting is poor standings to factionscorporationsmight as well scrap the entire standings system while you are at it
with a system based on your current standings say you have to be 3 with the corporation to buy lps it could work but it would still devalue faction in theory as disjointed chars who run missions as a duo read 2 corpies not main and alt to be able to buy that faction bpc faster and thus make it much easier for the item to be bought not increasing the amount on the market just how quickly they are available
i dont see a need for this not supported
it would be an interesting touch  but isnt the point of loyalty points that theyre restricted to a single character that is well loyal
thisthe items that are purchased via the loyalty stores can already be sold on the contracts market i see no reason to change the way lps are currently handled
they could put a belt worth of regular high sec ore into those missions most of the mining missions used to have a load of veld  scord asteroids similar to some of the ore in combat missions at the worst all youre giving the miner is a semi private belt of low end ore to mine
its hard to believe ccp has found another way to make mining dissatisfying i know the market is complex and putting rare ores in missions would mess with the prices but whats wrong with putting largerthanaverage rocks in mining missions it doesnt seem a little weird to them that all the good mission belts are in combat missions anyway i think a good idea would be something similar to the ge and ae bonus room in some mining missions ie get a certain tag get access to a private belt with a couple jaspet or gneiss rocks that require killing some battleships just a thought
they should not requre killing too much though its for mining not for killing
is their any reason the isk reward for mining the alternate oregas cant be tied to the median price for the sellable oregasthe lp and standings gain would be the extra benefit and a reason to do missions rather than just mining missions ore should be based on the sec status of the mission location highsec ore in highsec locations lowsec ore in lowsec locations keep the riskreward for mining missions on par with actual mining now to work on balancing combat missions the same way easy lowbounty frigates in highsec more difficult higherbounty rats in lowsec
id go for the make it fun part remove them only in case this doesnt work
this is my first time posting in the forums so here it goesi dont know if this has been brought up yet so im guuna i think there should be a ship based around the salvaging profession this is just something that i thought about and thought it would be a cool idea for pve players this is just an example of one that i thought up real fast i dont know how it would work but i guess thats why im putting it up in the forums role bonus50 bonus to tractor beam range and velocityskill bonus5 bonus to salvage chance per level5 bonus to cargo capacity per levelfittings high 8med 2low 4cargo 200 m3drone cargo 25m3speed 200 mscpu 160 tfpg 80 gjskills required to fly these would be something like just a thought on skills tier 2salvaging 3electronics 4science 4for the style of the ships i was thinking that cruiser size for the bigger cargo the higher cpu and pg and the ability to carry a little bit of drones just in case something goes wrong i was also thinking to tie it into the role play factor of the game that the hull design of the ships would be minmatar because of the way the rest of the minmatar ships look how they look kinda salvaged together like how the mining barges are gallente based and the orca is caldari based
imho the profession only needs one ship it being destroyer class would fit perfectly perhaps an ore destroyer hmsupported either way im a salvage monkey at heart
i would prefer a science vessel with a bonus to hacking salvaging and analyzing like the covopss big cloaky daddy
i support the idea but not the ops implementation 1 ship a destroyer class is enough
while i dont see any such salvager profession its interesting however today a destroyer or some cruisers do the job fairly well but this is still some kind of abuse to the ship so why not add a single ship type to the game that is specialised on salvaging hacking and so ona huge cargo bay it should have and pretty fast and agile it should be as well which in turn would probably make it it very fragile that could be fun to fly still looting is rarely fun d
you dont where do you mission ill stop byall kidding aside nice proposal op
fair deal buddy up mkay i should have put the emphasis on profession as well as i should have added but i may be blind of courseid support this proposal once the shipyard in it has been shrinked and some more details added
what would caod be without goons ushra kahn derek chu trigrams edge and that guy with the green font just some boring forum imoi say remove all restrictions and only lock  ban isk sellers only

absolutely not supportedas already stated no one is being forced to read its posts to me its often enough plain fun to read d
i cant speak for null sec but as for the low sec i have to disagree there is allot of running with blobs  shipping up and down ganking at gates and stations games but fights even approaching something closely matched like we see in the alliance tournaments are extremely rare those fights are what we are often looking for but they are extremely elusive if you like running with blobs and gate camping this wont prevent you from doing that the proposal can only win because it simply gives players another option instead of getting 1 good gang fight for every 10 hours of play time and arena would provide 10 good gang fights in one hour arenas will be good for that of course there is a certain adreniline rush that you get from roaming in low or null sec without knowing what will jump in this wont exist in an arena however the proposal is not to make all of eve an arena so you will still have low sec and null sec pvp as it isif you dont want an arena you wouldnt have to go in one
very much not supported
no fight is ever fair thats why one side loses and the other side wins if it was fair both sides would kill each otherthis is also incorrect the more fair a fight is the more of a rush it would be as you would have a greater chance of dying unfortunately i think the idea of a builtin arena will sidetrack players from the game as a wholei will point out that arena events have been conducted before with success i personally ran some of these back when i lived in low sec  1v1 frigate fights and 3v3 cruiser fights the local pirates and antipirates worked together for these  to defend and participate in them the problem is that it is hard to spread the word about such events if there was a better way for players to advertise events more events would occur and you wouldnt need a builtin arena as players would know about existing playermade arenas and when and where they were happening
in eve you can go everywhere and kill anyone please dont ruin this by making instanceswar tried the same with battlegrounds instead of true rvr you know what happened after half the players left mythic nerfed battlegrounds and boosted world rvr and people loved it still they never recovered from the damage it had doneso no dont mess up eve with arenas or battlegroundswow is that way 
it seems you dont mind the idea of tournaments you just want players to be forced to take the time to advertise where they are and set them up etc i would rather a faction do that ie ccp i would say it may be something that a pirate faction should doif ccp ever really develops them thus it could be done in low or null sec this proposal is for high sec so i guess i would disagree slightly and say it might be better in null sec or low sec perhaps a sov mechanic could be used to put an arena in a system or just put it in low sec or maybe all three when you say unfortunately i think the idea of a builtin arena will sidetrack players from the game as a whole i wonder what you mean this game is a sand box there is no game as a whole that you should be pursuing you can for the most part only play one part of the game at a time so you may run missions or join fw and do plexes or pvp etc etc etc the idea that there is some sort of game as a whole that we shouldnt get sidetracked from is foriegn to the idea of a sandbox why not make it a bigger sand box i think you may be thinking if they have an arena allot of people will have fun doing that and those people should be playing eve the way i want to play eve this is bad thinking and bad for the game the notion that if there are few things that are fun to do in eve  less competition for the things i want to do doesnt really work when your talking about leisure time its not like people must play eve for me i am not interested in walking in stations but its not going to detract from what i do in eve so there is no downside i can still fly ships the same is true with the idea of an arena or arenas there is no downside
i agree the arena should definitely be in the same universe world and on the same server other pilots in the same system at the actual arena location could interfere but there should be concord or something like that maybe sentry guns i dont know maybe concord in high sec arenas and sentry guns in low sec and whatever the sovern holders want in null sec the null sec sovern holders could make it even stricter than high sec concord if they wantedi think there should be televisions in the stations so people could view the arenas from around the universe they should be able to see the ships shieldsarmor and hull damage etc perhaps when they have walking in stations you could go to a bar and see whats happening in the arenas the bets could be listed and you could place bets you could tune into different television channels and watch the various fights in different arenas you would be watching real time fights that are going on in the eve universe
did you flip a coin or do you see a disadvantage to having arenas
there is no reason in a sandbox game for the game to run arenas when players are running them already this is the pointand again the game as a whole is a sandbox the more the game does for players the less of a sandbox it iswhat you suggest is not making it a bigger sandbox it is replacing some of the kids playing in the sandbox with robots yes there is you take the fun of coordinating events away from players and into the hands of some game mechanic simply to cater to people who would rather click a button in a station than participate in player driven events this would take away from the eve community
bagehii agree different corps sometimes do this but it is haphazard at best to say we already have this is really a stretch if you want to do it right ccp should step up and do it right or at least give us some tools to set it up right including ways to set up different types of point systems like they use for the alliance tournament ui ability so certain ships can be included or excluded from a side etc set places on the map where the arenas are so people know what systems they in are the map should also indicate what sorts of events they have there advertisements for how to sign up for events etc there is no effective way to set up sentry guns to police this etc none of this exists in the game now if we had the tools to set up decent arena events we would have them players dont want to go through the logistical headaches of organizing this stuff nor should they have too at least not unless ccp gives them some tools to set it up you claim a disadvantage of this is it would take away the fun people have of coodinating these events well first it wouldnt do that if they still want to get pilots together and say lets meet at planet five in system x for our turnament and just hope our enemies dont show up and gank us they can still do this after the proposal but those sorts of tournaments have pretty big limitations the reason no one would do that anymore is because that way sucks compared to what it could be if ccp gave us tools to do a decent arena style tournament secondly the players who want to coordinate events in an arena still could it wouldnt have to be ccp run some could be run by npcs some could be player run in null sec
an option to right click on another player and challenge them to the death would be fine as long as it also came with an option to block the requests from people not on your address book jita would be even more hellish than it is now if you couldnt block such a request another potential exploit would be to spam a personcorpalliance with such requests to slow down their client or a nodecontracts would also be good but there again need them to be blockable based on address book or standings or something id support this as long as you cant make open ended contracts for anyone willing to fight and this should not spawn an arenadeadspace or some other such thing
i have had an idea for eve ambulation to make the game more player active my idea is an evolution of the current bounty systemat the moment bounties are collected by simply podding the pilot in low security systems which results in a security status loss my idea would eliminate this status loss and is to have a police station in one station in every system in high sec space these stations would be distinguished by having a blue tag pilots with bounties on their heads would be captured in low and high sec and transported in the players cargo hold or even bring out some sort of mechanism where you can lock on to and drag their ship to said police station where the pirate would face trial and prosecution as would be in real lifethey would then recieve a sentence based on the severity of their crimes they will be locked in the station for an appropriate length of time based on their sentence and crimes and during this lockdown period would not be able to do anything other than deal with their character sheet they could however pay a fine based on the courts decision to be let free on the same basis as being caught smuggling illegal goodswhen ambulation comes out to stop pirates from being safe by docking in a station you would have the ability to dock in the same station and capture them by going to there ship or walking around the same station and outting handcuffs on them then transporting them to the police station and collect the bounty
at the moment changing your orbit radius or keep at range distance is a slow and painful process requiring selection of a submenu then typing in the desired value changing the dscanner range is only slightly less painful here you have to remember the au  km conversion factor and then type in the appropriate 9 or 10digit number this is unneccesarily tedious and inconvenient particularly when heading into a pvp encounterproposed solution add dropdown range selectors next to the orbit and keep at range buttons and the dscan range selector these selectors should have three or more values that can be specified by the player in the case of the dscan the player should have the option of specifying the range in km or in auadvantages eves ui becomes a little less painful to use and it becomes easier to adjust your combat tacticsscan range on the flypotential drawbacks aside from the extra work for ccp none afaict

i thought the medal was given to him for getting elected not for serving a full term he was elected so if that is what you get a medal for he should keep it i mean should we also erase all his kills from the killboards if he worked out a deal where ccp said they would take certain action against him in exchange for his stepping down ccp should honor the agreement they made and not after he does his part of the agreement start taking his stuff again just my two cents
agreeing with this

nah thought i would get that response of something to that effect but trolling from an alt would be tardedthe fact that you so obviously asked one of your buddies to start this thread rather than starting it yourself is funny enough its even more hilarious that its about some irrelevant ingame crown that you lost for breaking the ndai voted for you with my two accounts for the csm i liked what you stood for i even gave you the benefit of the doubt when the scandal broke and you got kicked off but the fact that you chose to attempt to run again so early looked arrogant making this thread either doesnt help and leads one to conclude that you are resting on your laurels righter than taking your licks being humble about it and waiting at least one interim term to run againnot supported
this is ment more for lownull sec than high sec and yeah i just found wear the concord ships were listed and they would need a boost to be inline with current faction ships
supporting because yeahi empathize with your situation with the gms the customer support in eve seems to be on the wrong side of terrible unfortunately i doubt this thread will change the situation with the grid loading bugi had a very long back and forth with several gms in which they told me my pod had received the command to warp and then got scrambled 2 seconds later according to the server logs it takes my pod a little over 06 seconds to enter warp from a stand still according to the approved evelopedia article was spamming warp while loosing my ship in low sec to save my pod eventually i just gave up because they just repeat the same crap over and over without even reading your replies
with some tweaks i vote yes i would like to see the total per 3 mins equal to one mining harvester so somewhere in the 1200 range
i think people with higher sec status should be rewarded in some way for their efforsseeing as a war dec is basically a bribe to concord it would be seinsible to make this bribe more expensive if a corperation has a higher security statusso wardec fees should becorp sec status x 1 million isk  2million isk a corperations sec status is made up from an average of their players similar to faction standingsthe current mechanics are not broken in regard to war decs and i think that they should remain the same it should just cost more to dec a corp that has high sec status to reward people for having higher sec statusmograph
yeah i can support that it sounds nice

as im digging my way through the csm pages at evelopedia which tends to be a tough job looking for ideas of mine that already were possibly proposed already and dealt with by ccp i wonder why there are so many pages in the issues in process categoryevelopedia csm main page descriptionsince there are quite some proposals that were discussed with ccp already during the 3rd csm but still present in the issues in process category i wonder whod be responsible of moving the pages to their appropriate category revisit rejected or resolvedunfortunately i was unable to find a description of the way these pages are being dealt with so id assume the csm being responsible of it some pages history entries seem to allow this assumptions while others know a csm representative only as the creator of the page while all subsequently following activities were done by isd membersi find this situation especially unlucky as a the assembly hall rules ask us to avoid thread necromancy by checking for possible past proposals but b virtually everyone complaining of the csm wiki pages being a pain to browse this simply doesnt matchas i well might get it all wrong id be glad to see anyone explaining me how these pages are meant to be dealt with

you are trying to base the bonuses around the way you think the ship should be flown  what you are terming optimal combat tactics the problem is that in reality combat tactics should be based around the capability bonuses of the ship youre doing it the wrong way roundif i say now that my optimal combat tactics for a caracal are to load up with pooploads of scourge heavy missiles and go around shooting people how are you going to tell me that your combat tactics are any better than minea ferox can fit heavy missile launchers and carry scads of various types of missiles but optimal combat tactics for that ship dont involve heavy missile launchers
calm downwe are just working out your rules for cmb combatyou do not have to have a scout if you do not want oneyou said you wanted a scoutmy brutix fit does not need one because it has mwdcloakyou can have mwdcloak and not have a scout too if you dont want a scoutyou decidei am not placing any restrction on youdo you want a scout  tackler or not i am happy if you want to show me a fully solo fiti am happy if you want to show me a solo fit with scout dual boxi am happy if you want to show me a small gang fit  not solo capable 
dude you have logical fallaciesyour brutix stats are interestingall level 5 skillsfirst how do you manage to get that slow ass thing into range of anythingfitting damage rigs and electrons so as to get the most dps you get 779 dps at a whopping effective range of about 4 km any ship that wants to stay out of your range will you can get out to about 7 km with null and still have 653 dps but thats not really using the ships bonus using lower damage ammo on a damage bonused ship isnt really optimal now is it but regardless of that fact anything that wants to stay out of your range will not to mention with that fit you will tank a staggering 170 dps frigates can break your tank not so great of a bonus now is itfit for tank so that your ship will not get into range to apply dps but will have a stronger tank using one of its bonuses to its fullest while putting one in the backseat yields this result 404 dps tanked better but stilll very very weak for a solo ship in my opinion going 160 ms 982 with mwd and 530 dps at around 3 km 454 dps at aroung 6 km you will likely never get into optimal range as you are way too slowso this brutix using the tactics with 7 guns not counting in the cloak which would lower dps and cause many many ships to run since your lock time is  is not so great as you thinkyour stats make it seem like this ship is pretty good and its so easy to get into rangereality check getting a brutix into range is not easy brutixes are extremely easy to kiteusing the armor bonus is not compatable with using the tactic of getting into range as armor rigs slow you down yes plate slows you down as well but thats a compromise pilots make however from your argument you seem unwilling to make that compromiseedit i guess what im saying is that the brutix ignores a ty bonus and is still considered a good ship so caracal can toooh and the tactics you posted are false skeletal and dont usually work
we are not trying to work out my rules you already laid your rules in the op im just adhering to them pick the fitting pick the tactics pick the fighti dont care about having scout or not if there is no scout your argument is false simply because you wont be able to evade every unfavorable situation no mwdcloak does not save you from everything i already gave you the example which you gracefully decided to ignore drag bubbles or any bubble camp in matter of fact but i guess youve never been in 00 or something therefor your argument is wrong that your fit is optimal in every fighteditin case youll go blah blah blah only lowsec blah no bubbles blah how do you know without scout the target is not a bait and there is no hostile gang in next system again youre fit will not be optimalif there is a scout i can pick any target i want ill make sure those fights adhere your rules therefor proving my argument i can use my tactics with kinetic missiles in every fighti already give you lots of leeway trying to make me close rangesolo fit which is in most cases gallente speciality im not even trying to make you a optimal fit for eg rr gang
keep the lowsec love coming in
1 what criteria would be used to tell who dominates a system how would you also make it lucrative enough to encourage dominating but not enough to get the 00 people coming in2 so pirates can be probed out and ganked in lowsec too3 problem is you need to agree to have a neutral trade hub in lowsec so a market can exist this being lowsec good luck4 you want to nerf pirate ships5 i support this6 what is the point more rats but ones you can bribe7 youd get bottlenecks camped to hell and an end to cross region tradeneeds more work
yep it needs more work alot more work thats why we want ideas and feedback1 occupancy could be a factor sheer numbers but yeah its hard to figure how it would work out2 pirates probe each other out and gank each other all he time most combat in lowsec is actually outlaw verses outlaw anyway3 doesnt have to be a neutral trade hub teh market exists everywhere in hisec the black market wouldexist everywhere in lowsec hubs would eventually evolve and probably be by some bad ass big alliance who may keep it neutral4 just an idea not very popular but better than no ideas here6 as above just ideas to get an immersive feel7 yeah this ine while realistic is not popularif theres something youd like to see in lowsec and no not safety to make isk get an idea up here
not really realisticwe have a cold war the low sec areas where fw fight are equivalent of the bush wars in nations like vietnam afghanistan or the other 3rd world countries where wars were fought by proxy during the cold warhigh sec to high sec gates are the equivalent of moving from west germany to est germany or from italy to yugoslav passages full of frontiers guards and were breaking the law will get a ton of bricks on your head currently we dont have a direct war between the empires
pirates do missions in low sec as it isnow they would be able to do missions forpiratesitd be much coolerwhat are you implying ccp dictates where trade hubs aretrade hubs definitely naturally black market hubs would develop in populated areashigh transit areasetcas for neutrali assume you mean safe anyone can dock anywhere in low sec anyone can also undock and not get ganked if they have more than half a brain hint instawarp undockinterregional trade would have appropriate riskalso ideally there would be a dozen or more chokepointsoh and boost to regional markets hurrayi think the idea is to generate ideas and support

my favourite topic of all time children swear a lot adults much less  what changes answer societychildren live a protected existence sequestered from the real world with very little obligations commitments or accountability children swearing ultimately comes down to poor parenting with no limitations or rules they invariably turn into obnoxious punks when adulthood hits they are a lot worse off than those who were eased into the rules governing society as a wholeeve is ccp baby and as any responsible parent they have chosen to set down some groundrules which just happen to include treating each other with a modicum of respect and decencyif you are unable to communicate using a proper tone then think of eve as school youll thank ccp when you find out that the job interviews loanapplications and so forth go a lot smoother
i did not even know this exists this is stupid
i would say that there is a significant difference between say getting wtfpwned in eve and being slightly annoyed and then going to a job interviewmost people dont swear for every 3 word when they are chilledso if you hit your finger with a hammer you say gosh mylord my thummy sure hurts nowmanners should be subject to the area and people you are working with and not regulated by some outside source i thought independence from the devs was what eve was all about
to the people who are supporting this topicstfuseriouslythere is a reason i enforce a no smack talk rule in my corporation its because peoples big mouths tend to get the better of themthe solution is to really stfuso dont say anything at allmild attempt at humornot supporting
there is a huge difference between the reallife death threats and derogatory language i see in local on a daily basis and an outbursteither way what is saidmuttered privately and what is typed in public are not even the same ballpark i sincerely doubt anyone will petition a dammit outburst or that a gm will do anything other than smirki think it is safe to say that the eve player base has failed miserably at policing itself even with devgm interference most threads sounds like something my 7 year old nephew says when he doesnt get his waywatch some interviews of janejohn doe on the news while language should be subject to area it most often is not  once a person gets used to speakingthinkingacting in a certain way they will fall back on it when they meet resistance few people have the willpower to fight this natural responseps if you are able to remain chilled at a job interview you either dont really want the job or you are on drugs  interviews and exams are the most stressful situations modern man faces there exists an entire industry whose sole purpose is helping people cope with them
i personally report any foul or abusive language i see in public chat channels and im a big fan of ccps decision to keep ingame language moderate if i see over use of such language in private chat channels i will ask the offending person to tone it down or if im a guest ill just close the channeluse of vulgar  obscene language creates an environment that alot of people dont want to be in considering that theres absolutely no reason whatsoever to use that sort of language makes it a no brainer that it should be against the rules if vulgar  obscene language were allowed then instances of abuse and harrassment would become more common you could argue that one doesnt necessarily lead to another but even my 7 year old has enough common sense to see the correlation
people in this game need to grow the  upyoure reporting someone for swearing really the response from ccp should be what are you some ing  or something get a spine
yes i have reported people for swearing its against the rules see how that works
import a swear filter ingame that you can switch on and off at your choosingthose who dont care about swearing can see it and the delicate flowers can get them filtered problem solved edit for more on topicness and by importing this if you have it switched off and try and abuse the use of gms they can simply come along and say well you have the filter turned off so you obviously arent bothered by swearing and those with it turned on cant even see the swear words
cant support thisccp shall expressively encourage people unable to deal with their emotions in an appropriate wayno
in that case i dont think it can be reraised
take your own advice corp history is different with keeping tabs on a player character since the characters name does not change and has nothing to do with the issue being discussed herechecking a players name tab is an extra step where there was none before if we have standingdata on a player by name it now has to be researchedyes show infoaliases in order to identify the player because you want to hidenot supported
supported know so many people who hate their names and dont want to remake cause it will take a massive amount of time
if done properly like remaps this would be goodpeople whining about keeping track of people etc honestly the employment history still existsthis would just be a sanctioned method of removing a 13 year old childs attempt at leet speak when you buy a characteror if you were drunk during character creation

while i doubt ccp would allow this due to the mechanics of the game i would personally like to do this even if it could only be done once per character i have a few names that i wish were something else so it would be nice to dosupported but i dont think its gonna happen
lolwuta name gives instant recognizability allowing name changes weakens the identifying property of names even with the traceability given by a historythis is a forced comparison there are some big differences between a corp and a char for instance you can define every property of you char during creation while the persons playing chars in a corp are out of your control if you dont fit in its natural that you go somewhere else not to mention that typically a char is a more long lasting instance than the bond between players represented by a corp and like you said in eve everything has a consequence the act of joiningleaving corps is noted permanently in your historyevery system i saw where users were allowed to change their userchar names was abused and brought annoyances with it
only supported if there is a name history like the corp history and that it is viewable by every player ingame
how does adding options become a reduction current dualweb is about equal to old singleweb by increasing strength using lowslots or rigs for that matter you open the door to much more varied fittingsthe problem rapierhugginn pilots is struggling with is of their own making they insist on having buffer damage range tracking stopping power etc all at once and scream when they realise they have to forego one or twofrigates and cruisers to some extent have sod all lowslots to spare it will always be much better to use twinwebs and tankspeed the lows screw nanos webs were never a counter to them at least not on their own needed neuts drones et al on topi was referring to the effect of 90 speed reduction allowing ships to kill anything they wanted of smaller size can still do so but it actually requires skill and presence to do as you wiggle around to minimize transversal and what not
amarr can reduce incoming damage by tds and neut down ships that need cap to attacktankfalcon can shut down 100 of the damage a ship can doarazulach can prevent getting locked at rangeyes it is poor atm since damps are crapyhugginnrapier cant do this they have to relay on range and speed plus some buffer to tankit does fail pretty quickly against ranged dps like missiles lasers and aks in most of the cases already there is not a reason to diminishing this any morethis is the reason why i stated it would be useless at least for small gangsolo where the better web would be requiredit was good true but you had to commit to a fight if you chose fighting in web range if you engaged at this range you had to accept that the fight will end there in one or the other way the ability to avoid this was in my opinion the most powerful ability the nano fits offered and made them this popularit was actually around one ship size downno you didnt hit frigs in close orbit with bs turrets plus the unnerfed drones and pre nerf nos you got 2 options neuts and drones to work with at point blank atm minimize transversal or chose range is a odd statement since a mwd ship without mwd moves nowhere and you have not the option to control rangetransversal if you kill somebody with turrets only he screwed up or you managed to kill him at rangein general i only miss the powerful web only on a few ships so giving a role bonus to them for it would be fine to me something like 37560 webs turning into 75 webs  a proper tracking boost would fix most of the damage qr did to blaster pvphugginnrapier also need something like this to add a proper force to her niche roleplus something that helps tps or make them more useful as ew

i remember one of my first largeish fleet battles i was flying a rifter as a new pilot and much to my surprise i actually survived the encounter my poor rifter had sustained heavy damage straight down to my hull i found myself flying that ship around with a small portion of hull damage unrepaired in future fleets it was like a battle scar from the previous event why not have something that rewards the experience of a ship and its crew after having survived many battles together something that separates it from a ship straight off the assembly lineid propose a new mechanic in which modules such as weapons systems repair systems and others would gain a small bonus over time from being active similar to rigs any bonuses would be lost if the module was removed or the ship was repackagedof course it is possible for a ship to orbit a station for a week with its repair modules running or shooting at an asteroid for countless hours to gain these bonuses i dont see this as an exploit howeverthe point of the bonus is to reward time in your ship fitted just the way you like if you choose to spend weeks in training before taking the ship to battle that is the pilots choice either way the ships destruction and loss of the bonuses will be just that much more painful

i like this post in particular because it brings up a good point for all of you hardcore evers who are all about keeping this game so pure and perfect like real life eve shouldnt lower itself because blah blah wow blah blah eve is about what it would really be like and it isnt fair i agree it should keep its realistic tone but what i wantt all you haters to consider is that it can be both things wake up call  it is still a game some of us well alot of us play to just play sometimes we are casual players rather we ty to play casually the one thing that bugs me about eve is how you pretty much have to be in it for a long time to get into pvp and survive and have fun the old joke in eve is you get sucked in and cant get out  thats not only because eve is immersive but because it takes immersion to be any good at certain areas and people like to be good at stuff but its a game and some of us dont have time cant there just be an option like duels which is a great idea as mentioned that makes eve a little more like a game and not emo real life vampire that causes chcauss people to lose hours of their day mining to afford a shipi realize this would hurt the realism of the economy so that i am against to an extent  but there are always to do both that is what eve is about  possibilities   just a little bit not alot and if i offended anyone overdramatizing my point i apologize but basically it would be nice to have a more casual yet fun pvp being the best fun in game mode if that take a whole nother care bear server then fine or where you can only designate one time ship for duels per month or you have to pay a fee to duel or something fine either way this post has merrit and i support it where there is a will there is a way is my point this one is worth looking into and i encourage all future posters to consider what others want and offer suggestions on how to make this work instead of it wont yes it wont right now but i bet if ccp gets good ideas from us they will find a way

the only csm members that did it during the 3rd csm were the ones who took the initiative to do it i saw a lot of entries of erik finnegan fixing my evelopedia entries before we sorted out a real template di think that page is for the csm issues that have been approved by the csm before taken to ccp at least that is my explanation for the variety of issues that are there since there dont seem to be any that have died in committee and there are some there that ccp have said no to hur dur wikipedia is hard i am probably just misunderstanding what the page is supposed to be for but thats what the page is right nowthe reason for there not being any csm 2 or 1 issues is because they did not use the evelopedia at allisd is supposed to take care of the nuts and bolts of wikiing though between them and the csm both being made up of volunteers hmm well good luckit is very late at night i hope my post vaguely addressed at least one of your points
yes noticed is as well loads of name changes involved this csm at the end of the pages leading to the quite annyoing effect of older csmccp minutes links pointing to blank pages now causing confusionthats the way i understand the official description quoted in opthere are lots of proposals in issues in progress that had been brought to ccp as well as there are some that id expect in rejected revisit or in the backlog all taken from the public csmccp minutesguessed so already and it will probably a real pita to dig for the old threads to create appropriate pages in evelopedia so i can understand it oh yes it did thanks a lot  at least it shows that im not the only one confused about these pages intention hmm think ill give it a try then and do it on my own initiative evelopedia is moderated anyway so it shouldnt have any other effect than a heavily swearing isd member rejecting my changes if i should unwillingly of course break things edit i learned of the discussion feature of evelopedia today and that its supposed to be used for inquiries regarding protected pages which i guess the csm pages are curious about the replies i am now o

i think it was already mentioned caldari are kinetic just the way the game is made if gallante and amarr didnt get damage bonus to their guns then any ship with a eanm or even 2 of those could out tank our dps pretty well most ships have a good range of kinetic and therm and em damage resistance in armor and its the kinetic therm and explosive for shields so in case of gallente your basically shield and armor tanked if your whining about drones then dont drones are not exclusive to gallente since every race and their mother can use drones if you ever bothered to look at the different ships the only difference between gallente and other races for drones is that the dominix is one of the few ships that can hold more then 5 heavies thats only hold doesnt mean we can use themanother case in pointmissiles dont miss there you go you want to nerf gun damage fine ill drop the damage bonus for a rate of fireif my guns didnt ever miss if your in range the missiles will hit everytime even if your in range guns still miss so how do we balance that out oh yeah the damage bonusi know where your coming from but unless you want missiles to have to same tracking disadvantages like guns then stick with what you have i would have no problem with yall gettng a damage bonus if missiles missed as much as guns did
i disagree with this  blasters are rarely more effective damage dealers than missiles as a deimos pilot i can tell you that a caldari pilot in a cerberus will almost always beat me unless i find a way to close the range gap that he can easily exploit every race has upsides and downsides  the gallente one is drones not railsblasters which other races can use anyway though to a lesser extent the caldari one is ammo that does 100 of one dtype and on average better range capabilities than comparable dps weaponry
i like the idea of a towing array especially if they come in different sizes so as to meet the needs of lowerskilled people whod like to change mission agents but who dont want to spend their playing time for several days piloting each individual ship 20 jumps then podding back ccp wants people to spread out rather than concentrate around mission hubs and market hubs why not make moving our stuff easier
yes except for 4 as well one way to get pirate items is by killing pirates plus if empires were like that you would get attacked for flying a domi in caldari space
supporting general idea of rework of lowsecsome of the ideas mentioned need a great deal more thought and should only be implemented with a high confidence it would actually get the result desiredfragmenting high sec is actually the best idea of the bunch yes it would apply pressure to high sec citizens which is what they need to start solving their own problems it would have several side benefits too not the least is breaking the jita strangle hold on the marketperpetual gate camp at highlow border gate why dont high sec dwellers organize and smash the camp in the teeth more because its easier to whine or go somewhere else than to organize highsec pockets would create more incentive for interdependence and cooperation among high sec denizensi only hope that ccp carefully weighes any lowsec boost carefully against 00 so that it doesnt become just as attractive or nearly so for large alliances to get territorial in lowsec would ruin the flavor of lowsec im in lowsec for solo and small gang fights fw has brought enough blobbery to lowsecon the whole as a lowsec resident since my second day playing lowsec is fine in my estimation not really sure it needs anything but willing to see ccp explore tweaks that wont break itps  i very rarely have ever camped a gate and never used smart bombs some of you whiners need to buy a freaking clue about what life is really like in lowsec
except that you have to actually make that instawarp undock and its not hard to gate camp in lowsec if you can tank the guns look at suicide gankingwhen the means and targets exist people rise up and do ittrade hubs only rise when there is safety and safety requires neutrality if you have an area where everyone is shoot on sight people will shun it even if a few people take the risk you wont get the critical mass of transactions to reach true hub status unless some type of pirate cva existsthats the whole problem with lowsec i dont see how even with a black market it will change thatmaybe its the ability not to be dependent that people find attractive about it maybe they dont want to have to constantly smash blockades to let people get through or ask people to do so i think this is more about you wanting carebear targets though if hisec dwellers organized a huge blob and swept amanake till all the pirates gave up and quit that wont really benefit you all

that is similar to the first points i mentioned what i mean with your quote is that we dont hear explosions from ships we have destroyedwell the fact that you hear exploding your missiles is a bit differentill test that out a bit more myself and also make my op a bit more clear

children swear more than adults i dont know what kind of children and adults you know but that is not my experience at all seriously though this isnt a problem the rule is in place for extreme cases but most people arent so analretentive that they report the occasional bit of foul language were mostly grownups here we can handle a few naughty words and if youre stupid enough to treat local like a rap music singalong where it might offend random people well you probably deserve a petition
with the prevelance of buffer tanks across all spectrums of pvp and the current uselessness of ships with active tank boni i propose the followingall ships with a 75 bonus per level to repair mod effectiveness have it increased to 10 per levelcurrently even in solosmall gang situations the 75 rep bonus is very nearly equalled in effectiveness by a 5 resist per level bonus in terms of raw damage tanked the ship with the resist bonus however has the advantage of being able to should he chooses buffer tank his vessel and take full advantage of this bonus in rr gangs the rep bonus vessel does notprosships with an active tank bonus will be utilised more in solosmall gang warfareconspossible slight buff to pve boats
yeah active tanks really need lovesigned
im all for this
m8 you need to check the support boxsupporting my own topic because its cool
i agree with this i dont even active tank sleipnirs because active tanks are completely useless

i dont know that itd go far enough but its a step in the right direction
never understood why these werent already penalizedop supported  these awesome penalties
yeah the improvement over a resist bonus is far too marginal asis
agreed even if i hate the active bonuses on the brutix and hype with passion at least at the brutix completely useless in most fits and the hype could be so much more of a blaster ship without it
i agree active tanking is completly borked especially amongst battle cruisers i never active tank my brutixmyrmidon i always shield tank them and squeeze as much dps out of them as i can 
while i am not sure that the proposed solution is the solution active tanks need an hand so cupported
agreed bring back active tanking
this is a small change in the right direction it might not be enough its definitely not too much
sounds like a patch job to methe tanking paradigm in eve needs a rethink a move away from buffer towards local repair for solosmallgang engagementsthis requires modifications to buffer modules rr modulesships active repair modules and tweaking of ship bonusesadjusting only the current active tank bonuses will merely result in nigh indestructible myrmidons maelstroms and cyclones  patch job no thanks full revamp yes please
my experience tells me this  usefulness of active tank goes down proportionally with ship size frigates are the least likely to benefit from active tank while battleships are most likely usefulness of buffer tank increases with the likelihood of encountering blobs basically active tank is better than buffer tank when damage received is under a certain low number while buffer tanks perform better when damage is certain number up to infinity factionofficer quality active tank increases much higher than factionofficer buffer tank  so thats 1 advantage of active tanking however its not good for general purpose pvpi do want ccp to address this issue but not in the way this thread suggests i dont want tanking to be increased any more in eve as increase of tanking vs damage favors blobbing you should be able to figure it out if you think i would recommend a nerf to buffer tankingspecifically 1600mm plates and large shield extenders need a small nerf maybe 10 specifically core defense field extender and trimark armor pump rigs need to decrease from 15 to 10 bonusit is the existence of these rigs that shifted game balance significantly in favor of buffer tanking some time in eve history
im sure some of the huge alliances might start making fleet only pvp ships manatory corp or alliance colors but lets get the colors down then we can fight for symbols 
once again i support thisthat said many proposals have come including one or two of my own for pretty exactly this support usually is rather short and then someone will always state that the proposal had been refused by the csm before and that ccp has said it will cause lag  both of which is then never substantiated but heavily repeated by a swarm of lagphobistsgood luck this time around 
1 would vote againprovided that the ability to not load custom paintjobs in an effort to reduce lag is available
beats the walking in station waste of dev time p
that is ridiculous i hope youre wrong what kind of moronic bureaucratic and pointless clause would that be if an idea could never be revisited even in a different form even if it has merit simply because one csm group with perhaps different priorities rejected it for who know what reasons if that is so there is even less point in voting for the csm then there is currentlyplease note i avoided using the language i would have enjoyed praise me 
praised you are jin nib i suppose the point is that the proposal wasnt updated after it had been rejected if all the cons that lead to the csm 3 decision would have been addressed id expect it to be legitimately raised against csm 4however as pointed to in the minutes a similar issue had been brought to ccp already and was answered in september 2009while i take this as a clear no from ccp feel free to get in touch with the op and ask to have the proposal updated
i followed the wiki link but there was no info there from what i can tell this is referring to a different matter entirely jonah having to pause training inorder to jump is inconvenient but not a big deal also its not part of what we are discussing herein addition the suggestion to jump 2 times in 48 hours is a pretty good option in my opinion and wasnt raised in the earlier minutes presented as well as the fact that those minutes had quite a few references to the good old days which is not an acceptable reason

not supported read the not supporting reasons then read the supporting reasons you will see valid reasons why this is bad vs i dont like my name which was picked by them or if a character was boughtsurprise you bought it as it was this is eve deal with it
not supported in its current form but i am willing to support this as an extra option for people who buy characters
yes i ran into this just the other day got some drones from one group damaged in one pocket some drones from another group damaged in another pocket and had to dock to repair drones since i couldnt select only sound drones to deploy in the third pocketthis  an inbay drone repair module would be just the thing for the drone carrier ships that substitute drones for turrets
would be very handy
i disagree since dronesfof will allays work while other recons still hold the advantage to prevent other ships from killing themalso the point was mostly directed at you can spare this slots easy since you already have all things you need what is simply not the case on huginn or rapier
you can still dictate range with a rapier iirc you can get up to 60k web range that is not enough to negate dmg or gtfo
60km with a faction webalso most of the time you will be within point range of your targetif not you give it a free instawarp out of it

given the current mechanics of ecm as a strength vs strength many smaller ships even if they sacrifice slots to eccm find themselves utterly curbstomped by ecm boats even an unbonused t1 multispec will jam most frigate class vessels 20 of the time and a skilled ecm boat pilot with approapriate mods able to lock down virtually all cruisers with a single racial jam so i give you thislowslot eccm will not increase sensor strength but allow the targeting of 1 ship while under the effects of jamming ecm bursts remote or otherwise will still be effectivegiven that the pilot is sacrificing a precious lowslot in order to give himself relative immunity from jamming and that the module is useless when not faced with ecm this is not unreasonable within an rr fleet the pilot then has the choice of repping his mate or dpsing the target this can be circumvented by sacrificing more than one lowslot but then the pilot will find himself mocked by his peers when he explodes because he has sacrificed tank or damage for this bonus
logging in just to support this
i think that is a fairly balanced solution for group fights which is where most ecm sees use id personally say make ecm a targeted effect that reduces the dps of drones and missiles from the jammed ship in a fashion that is comparable to the way tracking disrupters work against turrets but this works too
i agree with this 110 an ability to at least shoot back or keep their compatriots alive while jammed would be a tremendously good idea
1 2 3three three bitter people whove lost ships to ecm boats hahaha
responding to troll youd be hard pressed to find anyone that actually pvps in eve that hasnt lost ships to ecm boats
i think this might be too strong a nerf to the ecm boatsnever thought id hear those words out of my mouth lol
you dont know the half of it mate
let me put it to you this way presume you engage a fleet of twenty battleships with no eccm whatsoever with a group of falcons and battlecruisers sayno more than four falcons there is enough ecm in there to cripple the rr of the bs gang and essentially kill every single ship yet you propose that they cant even have a single opportunity to lock each other to keep each other alive lets change the scenario lets make it a small bs gang versus a small carrier fleet your bs gang needs literally no extra backup to kill the carrier gang if there isnt even a way through the ecm eccm mods only work some of the time but if theres a module that could be equipped to save maybethree or four of the carriers out of five im willing to consider it a fair change essentially what were suggesting here isnt a way to render ecm boats completely moribund but instead give a second alternative to an eccm midslot mod

i agree too strong not supported
nice damage bro even by fitting two you are unable to split tackle while maintaining rr and shooting the primary so even if your zero damage bs gang is curbstomping the enemy a few rounds of jams should still allow most of the enemy to escape couple this with the fact that you are wasting two lowslots on these things which are rendered absolutely useless if you dont run into any ecm
not supportedthe defensive of the ecm boat is jamming adding a module that would leave one possible lock on a frigate means everyone will swarm ecm boats with frigates to kill them and they become essentially useless unlike most other race recons which have 2 bonused ewars each they are basically one trick poniesthey arent as common as in the past so i seriously dont see a need to nerf them further
far too powerful ecm ships would have no means of escape if a tackler fitted one of these things not to mention it would essentially make rr blobs invulnerable to everything except for highly specialised counters mass bombers sniperblob dd etca much better solution provided that ecm mechanic is not revamped entirely is to have the lowslot module add a fixed number to sensor strength based on ship signature radius  the smaller it is the higher the boostwould give the slot deficient frigatedestroyer class an actual chance at preventing a jam without making the larger classes impervious to ecm
heaven forbid that remote rep gangs should have any viable counter
qq more falcon pilots i dont think you appreciate how hard it would be to operate in an rr bs gang with the ability to lock one or two targets coupled with the fact that you are compromising your setup considerably meaning that in the absence of ecm an equal or lesser sized gang of similar composition will utterly steam roll you the falconrookscorp still has the option of an ecm burst and a nifty drone bay to protect him from being swarmed by frigates coupled with a brain which should have him aligned out ready to warp if something tries to get on top of him and yes ecm would still counter rr bs gangs maybe not quite as well but as i said theyd be sacrificing a large number of slots to become immune and thus easier to defeat conventionally and theres still always the option a much funnier one i may add of warping half a dozen buffered ecm burst scorps onto the enemy gang might even make damps coupled with ecm more useful again as it stands the standard ecm boat is still very much a faceroll class of vessel requiring very little skill to utilisewhat this does give is small frigatecruiser gangs the opportunity to not be completely nullified by one or two ecm boats how about this as a suggestion then each lowslot eccm protects againts 1 successful jamim throwing this out there this isnt a direct falcon whine there are other classes of ecm boat around you know
not supported rr bs gangs do not need a boost
yeah however if your flying a 20 man battleship fleet 1 shame on your fc for not setting up a sniper amarr bb to deal with the ewar boats i mean you only need one sniper fit apoc with dual eccm to negate most ecm and since your using lazers your damage is gonna hit that big huge hole in the tank of those nasty caldari ships and they will pop in 12 vollys 2 cordinating 4 pilots to shut down 20 seperate targets under a combat situation is a realy nice acomplishment props to the fc wo pulls that off
yes your also goig to be eaten by anyone with 5 wairrior 2s in the drone bay dead caped by anyone who gets a neut on you especially a curse and have your targeting range cut to nothing by anyone who bothers to fit a dampener guess what your flying a frig thats your place in the food chain of eve
not supported this makes ecm pretty ineffective as a whole as in combat most of the time you only really need to have one ship targeted in the first place  the one youre shooting ecm would only have an effect on ships that need to switch targets quickly  logistcs and um  logisticsthis is a terrible idea
actually this would have relatively little effect in larger battles where as stated before youd be a fool to not dedicate a tachabaddon or two to anti ecm work even if you are only capable of targeting one ship there will still be significant time lag between switching from primaries to secondaries etc etcit would however give gangs of smaller ships a chance vs those who roll with lots of ecm and promote the use of different types of offensive ewar in fleets instead of the stereotypical facerolling falconscorprook pilot
yes
i am for boosting eccm but this is too powerful as it technically gives total immunuty to the effect as you will have ability to put full dps on to one targetecm and eccm need to be more balanced generally if you are willing to use a slot for eccm it should give a good level of immunity to jamming however if a determined ecm pilot wants to use all his mods to jam one pilot it should be damn hard to counterwith your suggestion even if you had 8 racial jammers hitting you you woild be able to target 1 enemy and direct all damage on himalso one of the biggest uses of ecm jamming is to disable the already too prevalent logistic ships with just one module they can make ecm a non issue to them as they could still rep someoneso yes eccm needs help but not this way
sounds good to me
cool story brooh waitnot supporting
one thing i can stand behind
grarr you are using enough falcons in fountain yourself 
at present logging off while flying a supercapital makes the ship disappear after one minute it is common practice to have an alt for the sole purpose of piloting that ship and is kept logged out when the ship is not neededthe problem with this is that the ship is unable to be attacked making it invulnerable this bypasses a large amount of the risk that was meant to come with owning a supercapital my proposed solution is for supercapitals to remain in space when the pilot flying it logs out requiring the pilot to park it inside a pos as was originally intended
your proposal already falls short on a very basic game mechanicyour ship enters emergency warp when you log out voila you are outside of the shield but for a moment lets assume your ship stays in the pos shield what will stop other people to first kill the pos and then your supercapall in all your idea is just stupid sounds like someone wants easy supercap killslast but not least you havent been able to find this thread on the first page of the assembly hall which basically covers the same topic
that wont work with a tower that has stront in it supercaps shouldnt be invulnerable most of their lives isnt that why they arent allowed to dock fewer would be built if they cant be made to disappear when its convenient im more concerned with keeping supercap proliferation from getting worse than i am with getting a killmail
you make it impossible to hold any supercapever imagined not every super cap pilot has time to log in every day because of real life issuesnot docking is dedication enough for me making it worse is not needed
what do they need to log in for their corpallianceetc should be helping to defend the ship supercaps are corpalliance assets not solo ships
many players are wealthy enough to fund their own personal supercaps if you want to prevent supercap proliferation then grow some balls get out there and pew pew them dont go looking for cheap ganks by popping towers while the guy is out of town for the weekend
i find myself agreeing with lark fail idea is fail
there should be a compromise the log out timer is way too small right now for pvpid say log out timer should be extended to 2 minutes  which would mostly harm farmer ravens that like to use jump  log trickthen the log out timer should extend more for capitals  5 minutesand for supercaps  15 minutes
when is the council going to tackle a very large base of macro miners macro miners infest asteroid belts and is a clear violation of the eula belts are steadily cleared out in high sec due to eula violaters im sure people will claim it helps the economy etc it doesnt the only economy it does help is the wallets of those people using them if actual real people miners could mine isk would be spread out more among the masses rather than eula violations increasing those folks wallets this needs to start being enforced go to 00 and mine then is also not an option it is simply macro miners using their own type of damage control to keep illegal operations intact will this be brought up or not i looked at the list of csm topics and this wasnt on there if you are for macro miners you use it plain and simple this needs to be brought up at the meetings or are the meetings only for 00 holding alliances
ccp has banned something like 25000 accounts in the last 8 months for eula violations accusing them of idleness with regard to this issue merely displays your ignorance
eula violations so they banned 25k for macro mining screw you punk 
macro mining isk selling which is the root for the firstnot supported
you heard him csms go out in your frigates and tackle macro minersthanks for bringing this up as im sure that nobody at ccp was aware of the existance of macromining until this thread
obviously not ive delivered them several names yet they continue mining 237 try to play it down all you want macro mining is a problem
this isnt a proposal so much as a requestquestion to have the csm grill ccp about their efforts and according to the op why any macro miners are in the gamefirst it is a problem but ccp cant just ban people because they appear to be macro mining they have standardsprocedures to follow what those are i have no clue i think as i believe the op does that once it is brought to their ccp attention it should be pretty simple to check logs attempt making contact etc to see that no one is home on the character but it doesnt seem to work like that part of it may be ccp dragging their feet feeling they want to see what the character does to uncover other macro accounts or follow isk transfersthefthack it may also be ccp has this as a low priority or is bombarded with user reports or their own information that they are investigating ie a queue of people to investigate etci have given up on reporting macro miners as i did so 4 or so times on the same people and only once did i see one of them vanish for a month perhaps they were banned temporarily or perhaps they took time off from running the macro i also feel ccp is much more interested in rmt than simple macro mining players who use macros to mine and never engage in any rmt add to the fact that reporting a macro wastes one of my petitions id rather not bother when to me it seems ccp isnt that interested or takes so long to do anything if the actually do anythingop needs to come up with a thought out proposal with expectations ie have the csm inquire as to what standards or procedures are used by ccp when investigating user reported macro accounts rather than a general rant about the csm not stating their intentions to grill ccp about macro mining
it might help if ccp gets rid of static asteroid beltsmake miners scan for active belts in their system we have to for wormholes etcit would also get rid of all those 30 day gscans
ccp has been and continues to reduce macro mining the macro miners simply create new accounts train them up and continue as long as rmt exists macro miners will existi do not support this thread for asshattery but i would support means of further discouraging rmt
yes ccp is aware of this problem and indeed recently initiated a very bold measure to provide a stopgap during my term in the csm i was given a very brief overview of what came to be known as project unholy rage and waited with baited breath for it to be implementedas the blog i linked above states it is an ongoing process in fact a lot of rmts have stopped macroing and started hacking accounts to get the iskif you want to help the problem petitions are fine but its better to tell people about etc trading one of the reasons rmt occurs is that a lot of new players dont realize they can conduct the isk for rl money trade legallyi hate macroers every bit as much as you do being a miner and industrialist mainly ccp is doing more to combat it that any other gaming company i know of and i even know of some who have stopped fighting and permitted it its a constant game of catandmouse but i have faith that ccp are doing their best and even talked to people in the group responsible for it which i will not reveal their names or identities

they heavy interdictor has a role tackling supercapitals with the current titan changes this vessel can not perform this role anymore heavy interdictors are getting simply dd or shot by the other guns and dying under 5 min the current dictors are fine however u can not see when u have put up your last bubblemy proposal is to give heavy interdictors a special role vs titan dds a 80 resistance bonus to incomming fire of a dd and a bigger bubble radius 25 km at l5 skills this to make the hic interesting again my proposal for the normal dictors is a timer on the interdicter spherelaucher so u can see when u have dropped your last bubble
if a titans guns are able to track your hic youre doing something wronga titan can only dd and thus kill a hic once every 10 minutes if there are multiple titans on the field then you should scale accordingly and bring more diktorsyou are able to check if youre ready to bubble or not on a normal sphere launcher by attempting to activate it
yes but a bubble stay up for 2 minuts and u can only activate it once every 30 sec im talking about the other 15 minhow fast can u kill a titan assume the enymie has 3 titans on the field and killing a titan by a big blob  dread fleet cost around 1015 min how many hictors do u need to keep 1 tackled untill it dies
hictors got more roles than tackling titans

i care because the resources that went to maintain and update it are better applied elsewhere which is why ccp made the decision in the first placea big thumbs down
yeah a better interface for the lp store would be nice

i like this idea a lot have caldari towers give 100 cpu instead of a dpsrof bonus and balance them postbonus give missiles a fair bit different an approach than turrets but make it so the towers balance and you have an interesting choice to make if you ever want to mount nonbonus weapon systems on a tower for whatever reason
pos missile batteries are just about useless currently they need major rethinking to make them worth putting up on a pos an armor rr battleship blob usually tanks a missile fit pos with the passive shield recharge i dont think that anyone even bothers incapping the missile batteries
like this idea except for the floating around with repairers going thing if it was tied only to kills of npc and players or roids i might support that way someone would actually have to be actively engaged in something to make it work whole new sub profession crew trainer also repackaging or renaming the ship would kill the bonuses that had been built up this would create actual legendary shipsebeneser scrooj and his infamous kestrel cacaw i know
this has been proposed like four times in the last month the problem varies with the implementation but in general its too complex not really meaningfully different from modules and in your case leading to an xp grindwhich nobody wants not supported
and it is so abusable that it hurts
this had been brought to and answered by ccp in september 2009csmccp meeting minutes see  657 pp 14i understand this as a no
not completely opposed but i really dont see a need
this has been specifically listed as an intended feature when walking in stations is released soontm no need to request it
ummm all of the csm2 issues are on there i know because i spent a ridiculous amount of time putting them all there as to who is responsible i felt it was the secretarys job as it fell under the publish to the eve public area
isd is pretty unobtrusive and they wont get in the way unless youre spamming  i dont know how the page protecting works but im sure that if you speak to the isd that controls that they can help you i dont know who that is though anybody willing to help would definitely be accepted since it seems not many people want to do stuff like organizing the wikipedia
cmon ccp designers this is the 21st century i know you can do this while the programmers are busy fixing the lag
i gotta go with ophelia you used a reactor control ii and a macr yet on all the other fits you only used a macr and your trying to claim caldari rail ships are not power anemic get out of eft
did i missed something or where is the point to compare tier 2 bs vs tier 3 bs when you compare a rokh vs an apoc or megathon plz keep in mind that the rokh is tier 3 an this must have an advantage vs tier 2from my point  boost railsrokh or nerv some sorted tier2 battleships in damage
proof please sure the minmatar ships have less dps but they have more than twice the alpha strike per guneft displays the weakness of large railguns quite vividly it is easier to increase distance than it is to increase damage damage has a heavy stacking penalty on modulesand this is what it boils down to a rokh costs more than an apoc but has similar tank similar range and less damage more noticeable when comparing the apoc and the mega which should be in balance not to be confused with the same as each should have things they are good at yet the apoc is better in every way than the mega
great 100 support so far this has got to mean something right

tason lets think about thisfragmenting highsec will mean 1 there will be more entry points into lowsec 2 there are very few semipermanent gatecamps on these border gates now a lot less than highsec huggers imagine3 more entry points through lowsec and ways to get from point a to point b will mean less chance of running into these camps less rookie and newer pilots will have their first experience with lowsec result in a nasty explosion4 more ways to enter lowsec will spread the traffic meaning that the relatively few professional campers will see less profit for their time spent camping boredom ensues more professional campers rediscover joy of solo and small gang pirating or pvping ard rejoices5 true many highsec denizens live in highsec because they are crippled with risk aversion this will never change they wont cross 3 or 5 lowsec systems to get from rens to jita no matter what 6 this will strengthen other markets at jitas expense it will free the other lesser hubs from adjusting their prices so much based on jita it will improve whats available around eve instead of such a high concentration of goods in jita good traders industrialists and miners will rejoice those willing to travel through lowsec to get the best prices will thrive while the risk averse will be penalized 7it will encourage entrepreneurial traders to stock lowsec hey i gotta go through there lowsec anyway to make 10 more in jita i might as well just put my goods on the market there and reap 25 to 75 more profit off the ebil piwates8 oh yeahmacroers and afk autopiloters will cry rivers of tearstldr fragmenting highsec creates more edge this will reduce predation by spreading the wolves out further fragmenting highsec will take our gloablized market back a step or two which will be good for the smart small businessman fragmenting highsec will likely strengthen bonds between highsec corps by making their perceived universe a bit smallerps  i get plenty of targets as it stands you wont find a post on eveo where i have ever complained about targets despite living in lowsec for over 2 12 years and making my living almost exclusively from piratingwhen i comment on these types of threads its from a perspective of what would improve the game and not my own narrow selfinterests dont mistake me for a highsec carebear again please
i would love to see lowsec get some love the black market in particular seems interesting one possible way to further this idea would be to have factions in empire space impose a tax on all market transactions a tax that is not present in lowsec this would further encourage players to buysell in lowsec as the increased taxfree gains could offset the inevitable ship losses traders would suffer
so no trade hubs exist in npc 00 i think you might want to take a closer lookand if the black market is made to be the only place piratedeadspace modules and pirate ships are able to be tradedyeah hubs will definitely formi love when people make assumptions like this check this character and the ceo of the corp neither are pirates nice try though also the day hisec dwellers mob through low sec pirate hubs will indeed be a day to behold
lowsec needs some loving and any number of these ideas would help
increasing lowsec participation hasnt worked it didnt work with factional warfare it hasnt with the gallente mission lines and it hasnt with pirate missions fragmenting hisec is just going to be one more failed initiative because it just will reduce secure space while keeping current pirate activity the same or moreunless ccp creates new star routes or systems we wont see an increase in routes large enough over distance to enable what you want ard a lot of the exits to empire systems lead to culdesacs of space and its more or less constant in terms of route potential people wont stock lowsec for the same reasons they dont currentlythe places with the best markets have the highest risk and theres only so much you can mark up goods without pirates stocking themselves its not like we dont have lowsec areas with market potential alreadyyou are also going to drop mining and missioning production as the amount of harvestable systems decrease and thats going to be reflected in cost regional markets are a bad thing because making the travelling hard makes systems insanely vulnerable to predatory markups the game works as is in regards to security space in my opinion if you want to make lowsec sort of a 00empire hybrid thats okay but trying to carve empire to force people into lowsec is not going to achieve any of the aims listed
and this is where your stupidity showsregional markets bad markups bad wtf someone doesnt like the concept of free tradeif you have nothing constructive to add stop posting in this thread your posts screams leave us high sec guys alone i want 100 security and dont care about if low sec gets help we get it you dont like the ideas unless you have some alternatives stfu
lets not make this an argument thread pleasethere are several misconceptions about lowsec that hisec people make the main one being they think lowsec people want hisec people to come there to be ganked this is pretty much totally wrong some pirates wouldlike to get more kills on gatecamps yeahbut for the most part lowsec entities are fightin each other on a day to day basis mostly we dont give a rats ass if carebears dont come downthis thread is about creating a better environment for those people the people who live in lowsec i also have lived in lowsec for years i am a pirate but if you look at my corps stats 99 of the kills are combat ships pvp fitted by other lowsec entitiesso lets keep this on track and not make an argument thread
maybe but probably true only in a very limited way ie where 2 usable routes are more than 1again only a half truth there are semi permanent gatecamps in almost all systems that see a decent level of traffic the frequency of gatecamps increase with the frequency of passages remove the high sec routes that connect then empires and add a few low sec routes and those routes will be campedand again a half truth rookie and newer pilots will follow the autopilot ie the shortest route making it the most used guess where the gatecamp will be and again the same half truth little interest in pvp is different from risk aversion maybelol you have a very strange idea about how trading worka serious trader will not block 30 sell orders to cover a low sec station where he will see at most 1 of his orders move every day to make a hub you need a location where at least hundreds of orders move every day in your dreams macroers will not care afk autopiloters with a little experience will simply select to always avoid low sec lolno we take you for a low sec gankbear get me more easy targetswhat is best for you is not automatically best for the game unless your definition of trade hub is very different from mine no there arent trade hubs in low sec
venkul you continue to post a lot of words on these forums to say the same thing over and over again i dont get evecarry on
read again moron i implied there are trade hubs in npc 00 which there are i understand a high sec pubbie like yourself would not know this i then went on to imply that if there were a dedicated black market the only place for pirate shispmodulesimplants to be sold hubs would form in low sec nowhere did i say there are hubs currently in low secnice try at reading comprehension though keep on whining about how scary low sec is
make npcs fight like sleepers and require pvp fits to fight both plexes and belts means pirates dont get a free ride whenever we find someone in a beltas much as i like the idea of pirate shipsfittings being illegal surely there will be so many tears in highsec when carebears get concorded for having a dread guristas fitted golemboosting the income from lowsec finally would be good alot of exploration sites that are almost of the grade of unupgraded nullsec need more level 4 agents aswellcorrupt corporations also would be interesting with a high enough corp standing they would ignore aggression near their station and should give benefits for continued base in their station agents availible to all corp members reduced cost for manufactureresearchofficecontracts however navy sentries should never ignore aggressionedit removing highsec links between at war factions would also be a good idea dont know why caldariamarr to gallenteminmatar would have safe links to eachother links between friendly factions should be few but present hopefully this create a more empire divide than their is now
i support this idea
corrupt corporations hmm maybe some of the corps could have ties to some criminal corps maybe creodron could supply serpentis lp rewards at a higher price that kind of thing too and yeah paying off a corporation so their sentries dont fire at your alliancebut i agree navygate sentries should always act properly
this is what highsec humpers actually believe
classic oh and supporting boost to low sec fo sho
so your definition of trade hub is a station in delve with 30 costumers in a dayyou see i have spent 1 year there and know very how trade hubs in 00 work translation for your intellect those arent hubs they are very small local markets no i am saying i dont want to play eve your wayand find pretty fastidious your attempts to force me to play how you want
how is this an argument against trying to stimulate the low sec market so that it develops trade centers way to mangle a sentence youre idea of being forced into anything is a simple diversion with no basis none of the ideas here are forcing you into to low sec and donUFFFDt affect high sec except for the pirate ship limit which was pretty much thrown out as such your continued presence in the thread is somewhat baffling this thread has absolutely nothing to do with highsec
well to make a living off piracy youd need a few of those once in a while living off t2 droppings doesnt work all that well if you lose a ship now and then

adding my input to the thread
not the issue being discussedthose that want to stop all activity when an account goes inactive start a proposal clueless as you are the issue is getting something for nothing ad infinitum stopping market orders manufacturing invention research when an account goes inactive is stupid for the simple reason that those activities will end naturally add in to the fact that market orders will go out of date by the simple fact that they cant be updated while the account is inactive if they are not made obsolete by other players it is the failure of other active players to respond nearly anything else is simple greed about 01 isk wars and a competitors orders researchmanufacturing those slots wont magically open up as nearly every job is tacked onto the back of another one so you have to wait for them to clear out first you also put your job in the line so you know it will take x time for completion there is no need to accelerate that because someone else didnt keep their account active either you accept the time quoted for your job or you dont period when you consider that people make mistakestake breaks from the game you are telling them that if they let their account go inactive everything they had going on is crap and go to hell when they comeback to find everything canceledstopped that is not a way to welcome back a player to pay for their account again ghost rp as it has been dubbed is about gaining while not givingpaying market ordersrd jobsetc are paid for and set to end ghost rp is not paid for and does not end ever furthermore ghost rp allows players to farm an account that they activate only once or twice a year to collect the data cores to sell and pay for other accounts all other activities you want to stop dont give that kind of huge direct benefitthank you for readingtldr hello

what do you expect from a giant rust bucket that said op is correct in that the hel does not follow the same trend as other super carriershowever considering the hel has the second most shields and the second least armor it should logically be shield tanked unless of course we are broaching the topic of capital shield tanks not being on par with capital armor tanks again
the need to sort this ship out has been going on for sometime personally i taken the time to train up for triage seeing as this ship will be responsible for helping to keep other momscarriers alive with what is effectively half a tankthis makes the hel an expensive waste of time this thread really need to be taken notice of and something finally done
i agree

i have a feeling that ccp will not be willing to switch the hel to an armor buffer layout but it would be nice at the very least could you give the ship a worthwhile bonus

the point here is clear as day the hel compared to others has an imbalance that really needs to be balanced as per the trend of others

i like this chart there is a maximum income in eve for most people you earn the same amount of isk no matter if you are 10mil sp or 100mil you might do that mission 10 faster but its not 10 times faster which the current clone system wants you to grind for no suicide roams for old players it seems
this if you really think about it 30mil is peanuts compared to what you could make on any given day if you really want to roam in t1 frigs factor in the cost of a potential new clone and plan accordingly
a small step in the right directiondont nerf passivebuffer tanking buff active tankingdefinetly supported
supporting his topic because its cool
ive been suggesting changing rep bonuses for resistance bonuses for a while but buffing the rep bonuses instead is also a viable ideaif you want to go further also give the effected ships a rep cap usage bonus
brutix says yes please
i am sure this will surprise everybody but i will say no th reason i say no is the simple fact that in my personal opinion the problem is not with the bonus but with the vessels themselves there characteristics for example take britux a blaster boat must havea gunsb some sort of speed mod lpreferably mwdc a repper since it has a repping bonus now britux does not have the powergrid to fit these modules neither does it have the cap capable of supporting mwd 7 caphungry guns and a repper now in case you whant booster or dual boosters thats even more need for power grid pretty much the same goes for hyperion i hate to see these ships being shieldtancked these are suppose to be highdps ships with active tank and yet they do not have the slots to support a powerfull tank and damage mods they do not have the powergrid to fit the stuff they need and they do not have the cap to sustain the mods to explore this situation further i will give you an example abaddon and hyperion are both 8gunned battleships with damage and tank bonus both designed to be the heavy argument on the field for their race imo hate bricks for short so let us explore why abaddon is successful and hyperion is not after you fit 8 highest caliber guns on an abaddon them being mega pulse laser 2s 8 of them you still have 6450 units of power grid left those are t2 guns with maximum advanced weapon upgrades skill after you fit 8 t2 neutron blaster on hyperion you have 2670 units of power grid left therefore hyperion has almost three times less resources avaliable for utility slots such as mwd with hyperion having a grater need for one since it has shorter range cap boosters and plates not only that but hyperion has to fir armor repair units that consume 4 times the power grid of an anmor plate because if you do not fit it with reppers you are not using the ships bonus so if anything hyperion should have more power grid left over after you fit guns on it surprisingly lasers also consume less cpu then blasters do leaving abaddon more cpu for ewar and other utility modules hyperion natively has much weaker cap then the abaddon does yet it has to support mwd and the reppers 1 or two two if you whant a powerfull tank when abaddon only needs to support lasers again giving abaddon pilot grater freedom in fitting utilities i have compared hyperion to abaddon as abaddon has the closest role to this batlteship and as we can see it is inferior in every way i ofcource understand that some ships might not be as good as others but in this case it is the ships that need fixing not the bonus there parameters and slot layouts hyperion at the moment is broken yes it can be used for different applications but it does not exceed in anything it is outtancked outgunned and outperformed by other battleships in every area domi is more flexible megathron has more dps abaddon has greatly better buffertank maelstorm has better active tank apoc and rockh are better snipers it does not have a niche currently nor can it compete on even terms with its opponents the only reason i am supporting this is because it will improve the situation over what we have currently however i would like the ships to be looked at again because when an armortancked ship with a bonus is outperformed by the very same ship shieldtanked without any bonuces that indicates that something is wrong
managing your cap makes you a good pilot mismanagement makes you a bad pilot
i phail to see how that is relevant to my post
it was relevant before you edited it a second time not my fault you are so undecided what you actually want to write
this doesnt make the transfer of hacked characters easier if your character was hacked youve got other issues this isnt a nerfbuff to transferring but a transparency issue if anything youd now have a timedate stamp to point to and say this is when it was transferred to someone else in your petition to ccp

1 this is not your idea youre more like the 76783402nd guy who had yaaay i got me a pink ship of doom how cool is that idea  use the evesearchcom if you dont trust me2 off all the games mentioned how many supported massive 500 vs 500 fleet fights on a single grid or how many of them were mmos while were at it3 the problem with loading additional color info is not on the client side but on the server side although you cant see drone models when you launch them the server sure sees them4 in how many situations exactly can you see other player controlled ships to justify the additional load on the server that must process the color information for all players that are trying to load a grid in a fleet fight5 would you really like to see how other ppl painted their ships or you would rather like to see your ship paintedthe questions were rhetorical if you havent noticed so far the solution for your problem would be client side custom paint that only you can see on your ship so it doesnt make additional load on the server but somehow i know that well see another 23452348 threads about the same topic in the future and that this post made out of pure boredom while i wait for my connection to become stable enough to get back into the game will be lost so im just going to say that your idea is bad  not supportededit your statement that all textures are sent to the server already could only mean one of the two things a you dont even for a second think about what you are going to throw on the forum b youre a simple troll
it would be silly if a proposal could be infinitely reraised without any changes simply because one person wants it to
unfortunately the wiki pages do not contain any information regarding the progress of a proposal at all one has to find and dig through the corresponding minutesreports to gather additional information  thats why i provided the additional linkagedont get me wrong i dont want to keep anyone to reraise an issue formerly rejected by a csm however i expect such proposals to be updated appropriately to reflect the reasons that led to its refusal thus removing points like sokratesz below above thats my point im trying to draw your attention to
a few things first it would be in a different sitting of the csm and a different person would be raising it its hardly one person doing so infinitely second given that the csm is supposedly something supposed to represent the rest of the players they may want to take a bit more time and give a more in depth consideration of things which have a lot of player interest look at those minutes those are weak unsupported arguments for the most part its hard to give a good argument in one line admittedlyas jonah suggests all that need to be done is to refine the idea which one assumes these sorts of threads are well suited to doing part of the problem of course is those tiny one liners that may be invalid arguments entirely but in any case may be near impossible to address because theres nothing there to go onlets just have a closer look then shall weum ok any specifics anything at all she might as well just have said no and be done with itvoted forbeing raised and having failed is not a valid argument against an idea unless appeal to authority is your thing travel time really is the purview of warping and gates but for the sake of argument does eliminating a few hours off the clone jump really drastically reduce travel time indeed it might even be considered to be in keeping with the games direction if using the second suggestion it doesnt change travel time at all objectively i dont understand what this is referring toso eric is really for it just not in this form either that or he has no idea whats going onshe voted forim of the opinion he has no clue what going on the game has moved on from those days we need a reason that has to to with the game that exist now not the one that existed 5 years agoagain supported but without a votewhat has this got to do with new players if its a skill then so what new players also cant fly battleships who cares if it was granted to everybody then they get it too just because its not as useful for someone new as opposed to some long timer is weak reason a frigate is also more useful to an old timer then a newbie could happen depending on how it was implemented could also make things more interesting this is very vague speculation at best63 against 2 of those were unsure or would have voted yes in a different form and we dont have zastrows reasons for saying yes
the difficulty is there is no way to limit it to a player selling it to another player what is to prevent a player from trading a character to a friend changing the name then trading back
not supporting because i dont see any good acceptable reason to change a characters name you pickedbought it live with it that justifies the trouble of doing this and making other players deal with your aliases

and here i thought that all warnings could be turned off
bump for implementseriously
this key would only give out km information useful for public killboards to autoupdate as well as an idea that i have on the md forums link here player made insurance
as much as i despise and abhor killmails and killboardsthis would at least prevent me from having to hand out more than what is necessary to appease my alliance or some suchi suppose it wouldnt hurtcausal not so serious support
i support this idea  useful for automated services where you dont fully trust the system you are providing access to
supported because its a good idea also it helps streamline the process and minimize the data harvest
im sorry just wanna ask you a leeetle question here have you ever tried to tank a hulk seriously assuming strip miners included without mlus i can get a good 30k tank if i use faction gear nonfaction 24k w no mlus including mlus barely 13k the proposed module would take up a lowslot so lets look at one mlu huh 22k im a bit shaky but is it fairly easy to alpha strike through that with 23 catalystsi find it laughable that youre pointing at haulers for your main beef ive been burned by that exact scenario myself but there is no real way to protect a 160 mil ship from an essentially free catalyst unless you have friends who are bound not to defend you until youre fired upon and even then youre usually screwedi cant see how you can look at hulkageddon and hulkageddon 2 and still say that miners need no real boost
dumb hulk pilots not paying attention to local is no reason to get a super mod that will protect you from anythingand yes ive flown a hulk with a tankits good for killing afs  destroyersand yes my tanked hulk would survive 5 dessies suiciding it wouldnt survive 5 thoraxes however and nor should it you should never be 100 safe anywhere
sounds like that would be a good changepage 2 snipah
get out ecm doesnt need another nerf
i like frigsi hate getting perma jammed by unbonused multispecs
ecm may not need another nerf but it is still by far the most effective form of ewar and by far the most popular which suggests it is unbalanced unless i am missing the target painter and damp whinesthis proposal effectively strips away the jamming ships ability to get out of situations by jamming and then warping away taking away using its ewar defensively is a huge nerf and does not balance with the other ewar as both tds and damps can be used to get out of situations a fair module would perhaps make a ship immune to 1 ewar module not counting websptsscrams so a ship is not immune but still much more resistant to ewari see no reason why a t1 trash frigate with one of the proposed modules should be practically immune to a t2 highly specialized jamming boat changing the low slot antiecm from a percentage to a fixed number would solve your problem but frigates are small and should be easier to jam that is how it should beno support for this but would support a well thought out proposal boosting eccm or limiting ecm in a slight way if this proposal went through we would see a 34 month killing spree of ecm ships and then ecm ships would be rarely seen again i would love it but it wouldnt be balanced or good for the game
current proposal would kill ecm an alternative the length of ecm jam is halved for every eccm low or midslot fitted as well as they recieve normal sensor strength boost they curently give
lower cycle time for ecm will be a buff especially against larger ships as their scan res is so small that they will be mostlikely jammed again before they aquired a lock after a failed cycle
you misunderstood meyou eccm will work like normal but in addition to the sensor strength boost you will be jammed only for half the time you will normally be jammed for the time is halfed with each eccm module that means thst not only will you be ahrder to jam each jam will have less effect on you
i like this idea but then again i dont fly ecmwould mean people will stop brining ecm drones to 1v1s though as just 1 low slot will make their drones useless
not really as you still can get jammed by a 2nd drone 2 drones  jammed again just the likeliness dropped
watsecond drone jams and you still have 1 lock which is your main target
as far as i understood it the module would just protect against the first jam not against every the way you describe it is even more overpowered and moves the idea close to the trashcan
problem summary inactive unpaid accounts continue to be able to sell goods this means that you can set 3 monthly sell orders on three alts giving you multiple thousands of sell orders able to sell over three months this had a similar issue ghost training which was resolved a few years backproblem impact done on a large scale a person could have numerous accounts loaded with 3 characters each that produce a lot of isk in itself this is not a problem the problem is that the person could stop paying for the account and still continue to receive the income typically these accounts are dormant for around 9 months to a year at which time the owner reactivates them every three months earning billions of isk for the cost of a single gtcthis means that with a relativelly low amount of training a char is self supporting by making 100k isk every three months per sell order which of course can be far far beaten furthermore ccp loses out on revenue by allowing this to continue the solution freeze sell orders for inactive accounts in the same way skill training is frozen
actually freezing them wouldnt solve anything unless by freeze you mean delete and even this could cause issues what if they delete a market order in the middle of someone buying or selling on that order data integrity violations are bad mmmkaywhat they should to do is update the expiration date to reflect the appropriate date maybe give them the same three day grace period that training has and let them expire as normal at downtime on the supplied date this acheives the desired effect with a minimum of fuss or disruption of the normal flow of the marketimplementation aside supported as was said in the ghost datacore production thread i shouldnt be competing against characters who are in game terms dead
that sounds reasonable i guess having them stay in space forever is a bit overkill
i seem to be under the impression that it takes about a minute 40 seconds for a titan to get up to speed for the emergency warp from a standstill it moves at the impressive speed of 15 ausec so the current 1 minute situation allows pilots to log off and they will only be at the emergency warp destination for seconds before disappearing it really does not take long to scan them down as they have an enormous sig so the current time is fairly perfect adding another minute to the timer wont help you though titan pilots will simply resort to finding a distant ss warping to that then warping to the pos while in warp they would log off thus adding more warp time to burn off the additional minute there are some extremely deep safe spots that i have seen which would add several minutes of warp time to a titans log offthe point is that adding another minute or even several minutes of time to the log off will change nothing for a titan that is not aggressed
this idea is dumb if you want easy supercapital kills go work for them like every other reputable group out there next
seriously eve needs more more symmetrical ships and less of the hey look at me i took a pile of scrap metal welded it together and smoothed it out and this is called a shipalso fix the ships that are nearbutnottotally symmetrical like the megathron and the rokh
obsessivecompulsive disorder
this does not change the fact that it seems like most game devs seem obligated to annoy the living c out of some people
why what is this compulsive need to have ships be symmetrical whats next you want all the stations redesigned so that theyre all symmetrical too
fire the artist that makes nothing but symmetrical ships please fire him on both sides evenly
not supported ships dont need to be symmetricalnow gimme your stuff
ccp hey youre a good artist nice portfolio well hire you design us an unsymmetrical shipartist hey cool alright here you go check that lopsided baby out sexxxyccp youre firedartist  symmetrical artist wtfccp quiet butterbean youre next
for this idea you deserve to be bannedingame
i personally wont mind if they fired the  of an artist after that fiasco of the ugly green jungle camo on the gallente navy shipshell that ugly camo is the reason why the megathron navy issue went down from 550 million to 425 million on contractsif i met the artist in real life i would make art out of his face with my fists

it is time capital gunslaunchers and repairers were introduced edit forgot to mention t2
uhm  can you provide some more details for your proposal
ummwhatcapital guns and launchers already exist capital reps already exist this is a confusing thread
do you mean anchorable pos mods or something
edit forgot to mention it was t2
just so we get more whine how useless t2 ammo isthanks noand what do you want with scorch pulse revs more whine about amarr being fotm thanks no again p
you have got to be the biggest troll on the forums you are in every thread flaming you should try playing the game you claim to know so much aboutas far as ammo goes i dont know but because you are worried about people complaining about capital t2 ammo we should dismiss t2 capital repairers you are nothing but a troll and your opinions are totally worthlessbut thanks for the free bump
i like to challenge ideas especially when the proposal is as thin as this one just in case you missed it there are some ideas where i just hit the supported checkbox have fun finding them 
this is a small suggestion i have and i havent seen it in the assembly hallwe have a shortcut for locking onto targets shouldnt we have a shortcut for unlocking as wellalso it would be convenient if we can select multiple objects on the overview by using alt or shift so we dont have to consistently click a thousand times to loot a whole bunch of wrecks or cargo containersi support my idea
i 3 shortcuts moar please
definitely supportmore shortcuts please
i think the paladin should have its bonuses fixed at amarr bs5 it does 25 less damage than the abaddon and the nightmare beats it out at its relative bs 5 if you look at the other maruaders they have their battleships skill give them a damage related boosts so at bs5 the kronos and vargur has a 25 boost the golem has a damage boost in regards to its 25 explosion velocity makes torpedos more viable the paladin has zero it it only at marauders level 5 that it receives the same bonuses which requires more than a month and a million sp to do so not to mention ccp seems to have given all the maruaders the same amount of cap 5625 gj without factoring in for the ships themselves the paladin has 33 less capacitor than its tech 1 counterpart the apocalypse 7500 gj and it does not match up to it even with max skills 7032 gj and it also does not even have reduction in cap use for laser than the apocalypse does it may not be as much of a factor since it uses half the guns but the kronos also has the same advantage and golem and vargurs weapons dont use cap at all the paladins capacitor should be increased to 7500 gj like the apocalypse and have its cap bonus replaced the other marauders have had their capacitor increased or stayed the same it should be replaced with a tracking bonus that all other marauders receive the golem gets a bonus to target painters which is like a tracking computer both the kronos and the paladin has a fairly useless bonus to stasis to webifiers blasters are not viable for missions which leaves only railguns for the kronos and the paladin is meant to use tachyons and perhaps mega pulses in which webifiers will do little for the ranges that they operate in i propose replacing the stasis webifier with the bonus to range that both golem and vargur receive currentpaladinamarr battleship skill bonus 5 bonus to capacitor capacity and 10 bonus to the velocity factor of stasis webifiers per levelmarauder skill bonus 75 bonus to repair amount of armor repair systems and 5 bonus to large energy turret damage per levelkronosgallente battleship skill bonus 5 bonus to large hybrid weapon damage and 10 bonus to the velocity factor of stasis webifiers per levelmarauder skill bonus 75 bonus to repair amount of armor repair systems and 75 bonus to large hybrid weapon tracking per levelproposed changepaladinamarr battleship skill bonus 5 bonus to large energy turret damage and 75 large energy turret tracking speed per levelmarauder skill bonus 75 bonus to repair amount of armor repair systems and 75 bonus to large energy turret optimal range per levelkronosgallente battleship skill bonus 5 bonus to large hybrid weapon damage and 75 bonus to large hybrid weapon tracking per levelmarauder skill bonus 75 bonus to repair amount of armor repair systems and 75 bonus to large hybrid weapon optimal range per levelthis will create a better balance between the marauders and allow them to get the same damage bonuses at the same amount of required skillpoints and time
the webbing bonuses are good
get out
does the kronos really need to be even worse it still would lack the range on blasters for most missions and considering i am now already using am 90 of the time extra range on rails wont help either give it a normal drone bay
10 faloff range per lvl could be usefullmaking blaster fire 50 further

mp rihanna yes i do apologize for that to everyone i came here right after a petition was closed again after i reported a 237 macro miner and had the tude loli dont really have a solution and thats why i listed it as an issue but was hoping some discussions could help bring out onenice link bunyip ty
this issue is somewhat misunderstood in this threadccp found that the isk seller macros were in mission running and ratting not mininginstead most mining macros are players who are only semiafk while most players you identify with your super powers as being macros are just people with a lot of timethe simple solution is to remove superfluous mouse clicking from timesink features such as miningtimesinks in eve have often revolved around extra clicking and mouse work usually in a very repetitive way that is conducive to repetitive strain injuryadding the ability to setup a flow for mining including automated jetcan mining would vastly improve the usability of the feature
could you provide us with a reference to this what i understood from bunyip this is not the caseplease tell me that im totally wrong  you want to have mining fully automated so that it takes a single button click to empty a belt

might be in a fanfest video or somethingthis isnt an absolute eve can have timesinks that dont involve constant clickingi count myself as an idiot i mine in highsec manually from my experience doing this i can tell you that anyone following this approach is obviously masochisticyou then have the many players that have 3 hulk characters for the occasional mining op who obviously dont manually control eachthere is a difference between a subscriber who cant keep up with the nonfun mining proceedure and an isk sellereve has a mechanic that keeps the casual macro miner in check if someone is macro mining near you if you believe theyve taken it too far if you believe they are mining too many hours on too many days if this upsets you gank them
this isnt an absolute eve can have timesinks that dont involve constant clickingi count myself as an idiot i mine in highsec manually from my experience doing this i can tell you that anyone following this approach is obviously masochisticyou then have the many players that have 3 hulk characters for the occasional mining op who obviously dont manually control eachthere is a difference between a subscriber who cant keep up with the nonfun mining proceedure and an isk sellereve has a mechanic that keeps the casual macro miner in check if someone is macro mining near you if you believe theyve taken it too far if you believe they are mining too many hours on too many days if this upsets you gank themit is also against the eula so when i report a macro miner they should get investigated and if found to be guilty banned saying im supposed to lose security status and my ship suicide ganking a macro miner because ccp wont do their job which ive done part of it for them is plain silly besides ganking a macro miner does nothing but put a tiny dent in their profits as they often have spare hulks in system after all what is a few hundred million when you are macroing it up 237 i also mine in highsec manually though less and less because it is a pia and im getting sick of it me and my 2 hulks and orca all of which i manually control im playing by the rules we all agreed to why is it okay with ccp that others dont and get to rake in the ore while they arent even suffering through stupid mining cycles oh thats right they arent rmt so it is okay
as far as i can tell they are pretty random though ccp has stated that they will not disclose thier proceduresi have seen obvious macros persist untouched and i have known people who were not macro miners permanent with no resource or defensepart of me suspsects it is related to if alliaces are beifiting the only proof i heard in the second batch of cases was a normal player has no reason to be making this much isk which i am pretty sure if that money was being funneled into alliance ops it would be ok
this that is why i love my hic besides if a titan hasnt already fired its dd and the fleet only brings 1 hic they deserve to not get the titan kill

wtfwhy should some carebearing douche in a player corp pay militia why should some militia douche feel some how obligated towards whatever it is you want from them why should anyone pay any tax outside of his corp at all why should some inactive militia alt get cash why should anyone get cash from a completely unrelated player just becausehow on earth would this help militia i mean beyond making it the most despised entity in the game which would be tres cool imo also what youre suggesting would invariably involve a bunch of silly politics which militia is blessedly free from for the most part and if not politics then exploits pervs would be making billions within the weekthis is a worse idea then the superduper suitcase and thats saying something btw you do realize that the new taxes are only on npc corps right and that they are just about the right amount where they are nowanyone have any idea what a stickier eve community means cause it sounds dirty

hii have resently been granted roles in my corp  trader wallet and hangar access and some things occured to mewhy only 7 tabs in a corp hangar we could use more for sure same goes for wallte divisionsthe reason for this is that ppl in our corp likes to have small operations for smaller groups within corp this is very hard without a seperate wallet division and minimum 1 corp hangar tabalso tabs in pos ship arrays would be awesome for security pouposesand finally tabs in the deliveries so if say 4th wallet division trader buys some stuff 6th wallet division trader cant nick it and leave corp coz right now i can in therory take all deliveries in my corp and transfer them to myselfpersonally id like it to be a new feature but if it was ceo skill based that would also be okregards cm

right now a lar i requires 2000mw this is far too high meanwhile a lrar i requires 600mw this is far too low combine this with the fact that people see safety in numbers and you have an incentive to avoid larsfor what a lar is capable of i believe 1200mw 40 reduction is a fair base fitting requirement following the established rules of remote repair modules requiring 33 more fitting a lrar would require 1600mw 166 increase which would be an adequate base fitting requirement these simple modifications would allow for ships to become selfsufficient while requiring a pilot consider his own resources before blindly participating in an rr bs circlejerktldr  decrease all lar pg fittings by 40 increase all lrar pg fittings by 166 balance is achieved rr bs blobs become less common without real teamwork logistics
most of the battleships that get fitted with lars have enough pg to do it properly so i dont see a problem there also what is this crazy talk about remote reps using more fitting than locals its not true of large armor large shield or capital shield capital armor is a mixed baghalf the cpu but 20 more pg than the local and nobody cares about the others
it took a while but after rereading your post 3 or 4 times i finally caught on i had the idea that you were being serious you even got me rechecking the data successful troll is successful i guessanyway i still find it funny how every noncapital rr module uses a fair amount higher cpu and pg collectively than its local counterpart except for lrar which not only has less requirements for both i might add but significantly lessoh and the capital rr proves how ccp dont know wtf theyre doingsupporting this proposal as i know its either this or lrars requiring 75 cpu and 2800 pg
the problem with active tanking isnt that the ships run out of pg local repair modules are far too inefficient to make them worthwhile and also cannot scale along with the fighti dont see whats wrong with an rr bs gang they are extremely slow vulnerable to every type of ewar and attract bomber gangs like fliesnot supported
dominix buff local tank buff
tell that to the hundreds of 00 players in fleet fights
these missions generate more questionssupport then anything elsethe help channels are full of people that cant find the sites have mined the wrong ore cant trigger the objective etc etc
i think this is more of a pebkac problem than a ccp problem you seem to be valueing your eve time over your family time man up and take the hit ccp cant justify spending all those manhours on something that isnt efficient
good rant i share some of your sentiment but i often find comfort knowing that ccp really care about their game and listen to the players i often feel like i dont even need to speak up because others will thanks for speaking upi hope you continue to play eve and learn to appreciate how awesome it is
hiyou can contact us anytime at evelopediaisdeveonlinecom if a csm delegate gets in touch with me we can work something out kind regardseshtir
wow im with the forums and stuff since five years  and still technology gets me sorry i missed the replies here and started a discussion at one of the pages affected which i definitely wouldnt have done if id seen this before as isd salpsan took care of me at evelopedia id like to continue the discussion with him but im not sure which way would be appropriate should the discussion at the wiki page go on should iwe move to email is it better located here any hint would be appreciatedi hope youll accept my apologies for any confusion i caused
hi there is no need to apology however you can resume your discussion with salpsan on the talk pages yes i have also seen them but he wont be able to talk to you on the forumsi posted here as i see there is a need to discuss this exact issue with the csm to find a solution that suits all of us so if a csm delegate discovers this post please contact me via evelopediaisdeveonlinecomthank you
thanks again esthir watch out wall of text aheadhe isnt able to participate as isd salpsan i hope so he could follow this discussion using his regular account id like to keep the discussion going on here as this place is imho closer to both the csm and other players possibly as confused as mei think ill better get a nose of one of them and have it stuck in here  two former csm reps already discovered this thread and replied  indeed im not pleased to seem me left alone by the current csm back to topic according to what i understand from the council of stellar management page at evelopedia proposals have a lifecycle the proposal is raised in the assembly hall no wiki pageits being championed by a csm rep new wiki page in category open issuesits either rejected wiki page moves to category rejected issues implicitly or accepted wiki page moves to category issues in processif accepted its brought to ccp wiki page moves to category resolved issuesas far as i understand this the simple fact of a proposal having been brought to ccp should make the page to be moved or recategorised to the resolved issues category  disregarding any possible implementation by ccpplease let me know if im wrong here alreadywhile strolling through both the pages in issues in process and the published minutes both csm and csmccp in order to verify my ideas werent raised already i found more and more issues that could be found in process already being replied to by ccpas most of them i didnt check all seemed to be brought to ccp by the third csm my first thoughts were like mkay csm 3 probably simply forgot of it or expected csm 4 to deal with it while csm 4 is probably not aware of it but now i have the impression of a more general confusion regarding both the wiki representation of a proposals lifecycle and the responsibility of maintenance of the wiki pagesi consider the current situation as suboptimal as it simply makes information gathering a real pain and keeps players from conducting a proper recherche prior to posting proposals which in turn leads to necromancy and evil and i doubt it being intended at all as i tend to use the tools available trying to make the best out of them and not waiting for others instead i still intend to improve the csm wiki pages by both cleaning up ie recategorisation and adding my own contributions new pages with summaries maybe a listing based on subject instead of status etc however this requires clear and distinct responsibilities not only that i want to know what im allowed and supposed the csm should be aware of it as wellas i couldnt find any public document describing maintenance responsibilities of the csm wiki pages id suppose a decision has to be made  preferably collaboratively while i personally would expect the csm to maintain these pages theyre created by csm so they should be moved by csm as well id also volunteer to do it as itll take quite some efforts i still want to get an overview of past and current proposalsyay ncl
bumpies
the more i look at this the more i seem to think that its not the dpsalpharof values that these weapons have problems with but its the operating ranges that seems to be the major problemthe root of this is that range is capped to 249km and that as someone said earlier sorry no quote it is far far easier to extend the range of these weapons than it is to increase the damage outputperhaps this is something that needs to be addressed yes i do mean nerf the range of beams and artysso in the endartys  ultimate alpha strike but low rangebeams  best broad range dps but only upto moderete rangerails  ultimate range low dpsalphayes no flameedit oh and i agree a damage bonused ship should be able to out damage an unbonused ship at the similar range perhaps shortening the range of beams and arty will reduce their dps output at much longer ranges as they will be forced to fit less damage mods and more range mods
stop right there mate dont you understand that even if you increase the range of the railguns beyond what they achieve now it means nothing the operating range of the fleet will be dictated by the least denominator which in this case is the tempest with 14072 km so its optimal  12 fallof 176km thats where the issue is you have to balance every bs around that range otherwise your efforts on railguns are null and void pun intended rokh reaches 194 km with spike mega does 183 kms therefore both need no more range what they need is to be able to apply equivalent dps and or alpha with apoc and or tempest at that rangefurthermore as far as the tier 3 vs tier 2 bs comparison id love to use a tier 2 caldari bs that is a turret platform the only option however for caldari is the rokh thus it needs to be fixed buffed as well as the mega since it is the bs which bonii lend themselves to fleet engagements
when you mention rails  ultimate range  did you mean rails or rails on sniper caldari ships because comparing with gallente rail fits i do not see ultimate range difference lasers can do 125 more damage at 90 range of rails on gallente shipsmaelstrom 1400  30dps at 10844 tremorabaddon tach  38dps at 11925 aurorarokh 425  24dps at 19430 spikehyperion 425  30dps at 13030 spike
the great part is that even besides the problem of the sniper mega the sniper rokh dosent hold any signifigant range advantage due to the lock limit falloff off and apocs tachs can reach right up to the lock limit with damage competitive against the rokh people seem to forget that if a weapons system advantage is said to be range it must achieve top damage at that range instead of being outcompeted by the falloff of other weapons systems
i think rails need some help but i dont think this is quite right 15 is a bit much and i dont think cal boats need the extra pgthe cal boats need the extra damage but the gal boats need the extra range
when we take a look at shortrange weapons blasters have the shortest range  what if rails have the shortest range aswell but the most damage  the rokh is still the ultimate sniper with lower dam than other ships but more dam than yetgallente are hard to fit with this for 200 km but its doable fewer dam modsrokh in monent 24 dps at 194 km  falloff  i think 29 dps at 160 km  falloff is good enough to stay at the number one of snipers there is no poit to get 50 more range then amarr or minmatar but 50 more range than gallente because of the same weapon systemraise dps 20 and lower range 20 could be usefull for thisgallente have an advantage from this aswell with rails without become uber
my first point was that range is capped to 249kmso we want to homogenise all long range weapons all long range weapons will operate similarly at the same rangesame dps at same rangemy point was that you cant have more range because of the range cap 249km although you seem to have only read the first line of my post which said no to more dps and had a hernia so reduce the range of the other weapon systems to create that range advantage and force laserprojectile users to fit less damage mods and more range mods ergo less damage at matching range and rail guns have the advantage at rangeyes gallente pilots have no real sniper boat but that is gallenteim just offering a different solution to more power which is what people only seem to want but no you cant have ships perform exactly the same under exactly the same perameters range the game is designed so that ships perform better at different ranges not everyone does the same as everyone else in different shaped hulls
personal insults i can do that too but your suggestion denotes a lack of understanding of the engagements in which ships take part so i will let that pass as ignorance instead of malice i did read the entirety of your post then went and checked your engagement history battleclinic i realise that you operate primarily in low sec using blasterboats and have little experience of sniperhac and bs fleets what i am trying to do here is to impart my experience in the use of long range turrets bs and hacs in the environment they are primarily encountered thats 00 fleet fights and roaming gangs guess thats called balance rightbut to forestall you i dont want my rokh to be another apoc or tempest with different skin i want it to be able to compete to the apoc or tempest damage wise be that in dps or alpha at the moment mega and rokh lack in both those attributes when compared to the other 2 turret boats so naturally i will push for a buff in the area they are falling behind not in the area they are on par with the competition 250 km locking range is 1 enough 2 an issue ccp wont even consider touching and 3 not a limiting factor due to the performance characteristics of the ships in gameyou are not the first one to do so it was shot down repeatedly and the consensus was the 15 damage increase 10 pg increase for caldari boats would be the most comprehensive balanced and satisfying solution so nice of you to bring this idea others tried it before you unfortunately its not going to work my previous post gives all the reasons why it so thank youif you however believe that railguns do need a buff do support this proposal
i apologise tagami for my minor flaming i just thought you were getting your back up over my suggestionhowever i disagree that weapons performance under similar conditions should be the same to create balance my idea of balance is that one weapon system can do something another weapon can not but sacrifices something in returnthe formular appears to be long range  low damage  poor tacking high dps  shorter range  good trackingso in my view the balance would come in nerfing the range of lasers  projectiles to give rails a range advantageyes i do not have experience in sniper fleets my experience lies in the close to medium range combatif the sniper fleet must fall to lowest common denominator of range that would be the projectile users then the longer range rail users can use better damage ammo at these shorter ranges or the projectile  laser users can sacrifice dps to get upto the range of the rail gunwould that not be balance with variation in game to play with or do we all want the same size stickj to hit each other with
apology acceptedyou do realise that would mean that rokh should be able to cn lead to the same range that tempest reaches with tremor thats 50 increase in railgun range which would be interesting to say the least however it would mean that eagles would only use am to snipe with and i doubt thats in favor of balance but ill take it saves me the time to switch ammo 300 dps with 0028 tracking  80km sign me up oh wait that leaves the short range part of the engagement profile lacking because you know sometimes fc calls for short range ammo tracking speed scripts and fleet goes toetotoe how does your proposal cover that situationas i said i am glad you understand that there is an issue i am thankful for your suggestion but as it does not take care of all the different scenarios while the one i am putting forward does i believe should not be consideredthe thread i have linked at the beginning has a whole conversation between me and liang where i explained the above to him in detail he came to the table with the same suggestion in the end he did capitulate and stood behind my proposalgo read the argument just ignore the troll that tries to nerf everything down you will also see the reaction to nerfing what is already considered balanced there expressedcheers
first for railguns to truly be of value they should do something well sure people keep pointing out range this is true for hacs which is why i see no reason to boost mediums much if at all large guns however are in the situation where most guns do damage at max locking range 250km at issue is the rokh only does more damage than other ships in the narrow 230km250km range the gallente ships on the other hand are bottom of the barrel outside of their 010km blasterringodeath this includes rails at any rangeso if all railgun bss are subpar it would be reasonable to assume it is the railguns that are lacking somethingwould it be nice to lift the max locking range sure would that make the rokh and apoc dominate all other ships in a fleet fight yes that would be worse than the partially balanced situation we currently find ourselves in
ive scanned through that thread and my head hurts why use am charges at 80km in your eagle when you can sit outside the range of other sniper hacs deal current dps values in a range envelope outside of other weapons systems i believe range dictation and control is the real ideology of combat in eve short range weapons cant hit outside of optimal  falloff and long range weapons struggle to hit targets moving with good transversal at short range so most of your strategy is to dictate the range you engage at and prevent enemy fleets manouvering out of your range envelope interdictionyou should still be able to perform at close range toe 2 toe no quater as rails will not have any of their stats changed the only change made would be to beamsartys range in the form of a well placed nerf bat and the only reason i say nerf is because of the 249 km cap on targeting range which i dont think should change
you are missing two major components to fleet warfare that make it significantly different than solo or small gang warfare1 because a local tank is meaningless in a fleet fight all ships have to stay in range of rr usually this means 8km rr bs unless your fleet is blessed with an abundance of logistics pilots who have taken the monklike vow and forsaken the way of the killboard for the path of nearthankless selflessness which is to say sniper bs fleets stay in a tight ball 99 of the time slightly different than a sniper hac fleet which requires logistics but even then an eagle is never really going to be pushing range much simply because even a logi has a max rep range that you have to stay within2 fleet warp a longer ranged platform will constantly have to burn further out to get to your optimal range of course the fastest ships have the shortest ranged guns however there are more of them because they do more damage so fleets are dictated by the range that is best for most people and that means 180km
and if beams and rails have their ranges nerfed they are forced to fit more range mods which sacrifice damage mods to get to this magical figure of 180km and then dps will start to look the same would it notalso if you want your longer ranged weapons to operate at their longer ranges after a warp in instaed of burning away to get to this range why not have them in a different squad and squad warp instead of wingfleet warp give the squad commanders a bit more to do than just being a massive blob
because it takes 3060 minutes to pull the fleet together as is organizing it further by range would leave the fleet at the undock point for another 30 minutes while the fc moves people based on their ship  because you cant rely on the pilots to get into the right wings when they only have capital and support options let alone capital 170km 200km 220km not to mention the range distribution is not even  leading to inefficient usage of the 256 pilot cap on fleets means even more fleets to make the fleet if fcs could move everyone flying an apoc in one move this idea might be reasonable but they cantso it takes too long and is less efficient than the current method for forming a fleet
always think of the lowest denominator if you nerf ranges the new operating range of the fleet will be the nerfed one because you need a good number of people to break rrfor example if the enemy jumps in our hac camp with 8 guardians as support tickling him from 150km away does nothing our gang needs all ships at approximately 80km doing max damage hoping to break tank before rr settles in being further away gives no advantage damage is needed all the theoretical stuff you talk about have been put to the crucible of real game engagements and all data converge to the view i offer if you want to see where i got my experience on fleet fights you are welcome to come to 9uy4 please do not view this as a flame but it is not constructive to go up to a guy riding a gsxr1000rr and tell him ive never riden a bike but i can tell you how to ride this one you are pretty much doing the same thing here sorry to tell you ride tight mate
sounds like a fellow gixxer rider i would tweak the analogy a little though just because you own and ride a sport bike even if you are a weekend track rider does not mean you could race on a superbike circuit there is a huge difference between ridingracing by yourself and fighting for the apex through corners in a tight knot of bikes that all perform and are ridden differentlyjust because a mega is a wonderful solo ship doesnt mean it functions well in a fleet
less then that actually at best 240250km at worst 248250km falloff from a 230 optimal apoc covers up all the less then optimal usage of railsno it wouldnt as most fits already include 3x damage mods and reducing range alone dosent change the base characteristics of the weapons beam weapons just do more damage then rails its sorta their thing also assuming theres no change relative to one and other rails would still have their entire damage ramp up to spike covered by tachyon falloff only at optimal ranges would they have and advantage and then it would be marginalwhat were asking for here is that for 10km in either direction from its optimal for their t2 range ammo both beams and rails should have top damage over other weapons systems fallofft1 ammo currently that exists for lasers through the entire gamut of ranges and for rails right around the lock limit this has to come earlier and the only way to do that is some sort of damage increase be it through rof or damage mod
this whole topic is a fascinating read i applaud dav for calmly debating the topic in a logical fashion i do agree with his argument and support the idea for a change at least the kestrel gives a bonus to nonkinetic missiles if all cmbs had that the problem would be solved the rest of the caldari ships should either get a generic missile bonus or the rof bonus listed in the op such as with the raven makes sense to me
except the good caldari ships would become overpowered and the bad caldari ships would still be bad the problem would not be solved more changes would need to be made to balance the newly and in case of the drake already op ships and also changes to the actual ships themselves would still need to be made to make them worthwhile
you lot must really enjoy arguing just for the sake of it 25 rof bonus
it is a reply about using 00 trade as an example of developed trade hubsclear nowso breaking the high sec connection between empires has nothing to do with high secremoving those routes is not forcing me to use low sec routes to trade at least read the posts to wich i am replying
yep and that is a problem however with the ideas in this thread and so on maybe pirates can actually make some isk in lowsec too and not by ganking carebears though to be honest carebears usually have such failures of boats the drops are rubbish anyway the most isk we ever make is from faction fitted pvp boats capitals and killing poss and that is way out of carebear jurisdiction
actually the idea was to maintain highsec tunnels through lowsec bordersand im not the one with trouble understanding what it is you are replying to you are you cant seem to maintain your concentration past the post immediately in front of youas for what you are replying toin other words this is the way the argument is goingsomeguy it will help stimulate the economyyou no they dont have trade hubs out there because hubs are bigyouve made the same argument with xxsketchxx notice how what you are talking about has nothing to do with the topic at hand notice that you arent actually presenting any sort of coherent argument or case what so ever
false the post was about fragmenting highsec and that dont include high sec tunnels jib maybe you missed it but it is already possible to sell in low sec simply for people that trade more that a few pieces it is not interesting as the buyers are too fewmaking it a bit more difficult to move between the empire will not change that in any wayno one will stop in low sec to buy the module he desperately need pirates will still use alts to buy stuff in high sec at low prices maybe in a regional hub instead of jita but that would simply increase the size of the high sec regional hubs00 people will still buy from a hub in high sec and cyno the stuff to 00 as ssoon as they leave high sec can you give a real reason why fragmenting the empires would increase low sec trade
drop the discussion this isnt an argument thread there are alot of ideas here sop concentrating on the one that you dont likeit is an ideas thread lets keep it at that im not goingto delete out ideas because a few people dont like itthe idea here is to talk through ideas you have had your say on what you do or dont like now drop that and move on
the whole point of this forum section is to do just that nitpick at proposed ideas particularly bad ones that need more workwe both know no one will drop it
improving low sec is a good thing making it a middle ground between the miningmissioning of high sec and the sov wars of 00 would be perfectthis is a good idea as long as the flip side is also true whereas outlaws can build their empire of drugs sex rocknroll and piracy the cuddly carebear lovers affectionately known as antipirates should also be able to build up something similar but opposite to the piracy boost
venkul you are a moron there are a market hubs in npc 00 obviously they dont have jita prices thats what you pay for by shopping in 00stop posting
amusingly enough many 00 market hubs have prices that beat most high sec prices it has to do with the number of players per station 00 simply has a lot of players per station except in cva space

when a patch or expansion promised sound improvements i turn the sound back on however the longest ive played with the sound on is a few weeks the sound is off currently this is the only game i have ever played with the sound off if ccp is only going to halfss sound theyre better off ignoring it entirely as most players just keep it offthat said sound is a key part of movies and games there are other things more important but at some point i would like to play the game with the sound on

many good ideas in this one
the hel seems to have been overlooked when the slot layout of the nid was changed some years ago from 565 to 556 meaning those nid pilots looking to upgrade have to train shield skills although any minmatar pilot at that level who doesnt have them already should probably end his lifeeither give the hel more shield hp and possibly revert the nid to its original slot layout to give minmatar a full line up of caps geared towards shield tanking or do as the op suggested
agreed
then ccp can at least switch the slot layout to 666 hey if minmatar really are supposed to be the flexible race doesnt a 66 midlow setup make a lot more sense than 75
if you want a super tanked aeon  buy an aeon i agree that the hel needs to be looked at  but in the slot layout that the op is proposing your saying that it should loose 1x mid slot in doing this it would take the hel away from being an shield carrier to an armor carrier why are we changing every ship in the game to fit the flavor of the month and not actually fixing the problem that they have maybe just leave the hel as a shield carrier and give it a better bonus  leave the ratio at 2x shield taking super carriers and 2x armor tanking ones maybe just bring shield tanking back in line with armor as has been debated for ages minmatar are a bit of this bit of that race as i was always brought to believe look at their other ships one armor tanked one shield why shouldnt the carriers be the same  and if its the whole debate of oh well i trained armor repping for my carrier so if i get a hel i cant be assed training for shield now thats just crap one less slot to main tanking ability from carrier to supercarrier the slot layout seems to be correct with your formula considering it is a shield carrier  current slot layout for the niddy is 6 lows 5 mids 5 highshel is 5 lows 7 mids 6 highs so givin that the hel is shield tanked  and the niddy is armor tanked  the slot layout looks correct givin that it has 1x more slot for tankingi guess short is  i own a hel iam happy with most everything with it only thing iam not is the bonus which could be way better i think i remember seeing when they first wanted the change that it gave drones a 5 bonus to hp that will do id be happy with that
fyi hel is a shield tanker the 8 fold increase in shield is kind of a dead giveawaybut nonetheless the minmatar and caldari supercaps are in need of some work because they are severely lacking in the ehp department
thisi dont mind minnie being shield tankers 2 armor and 2 shield tankers is how it should be imo 
in theory there might be some reason to worry about the minnie caps splitting their tank types between shield and armor but in practice the skills are dirteasy ever since they took off the tsm 5 req for cap shields i see no need to sync up on either shield or armor and it seems more minmatar to be weird and confused the one area where the hel does need a boost is in the bonus a rr bonus is fine for the nid because the nid is a pretty cheap shipat least by capital standards that will get used in fleet for its rr the hel is quite expensive and its high slots will generally be dedicated to things that definitely arent rr thus it ought to lose the rr bonus and gain something more useful i dont know exactly what  drone speed ecm burst cooldown bomber explosion radius shield hp  but it needs a useful bonus other than that i see no real need for a change simply because op doesnt understand that its a shield tanker
thank you sokratesz we now have a very firm grasp of the obviousbut just because something is the way it is does not mean it should be the hel is vastly inferior to its peers and incomprehensibly uslessviewing supercarriers as two shield tankers two armor tankers makes sense is so flawd on so many levels its painful to comprehend that someone might even concieve or heaven forbid begin to entertain that idea too many examples exist in eve where same catagory ships do not have a similar split of armor  shield tankers across the four racesthe nidhoggur is used for as an armor tanker why if the hel is branded as the burlier version of its carrier counterpart niddhoggur is the hel not an armor thankerif the prospect of the hel being a dedicated armor tanker is too alien then as someone else stated earlier minnie are supposed to be flexible but not the best as such maybe the idea of a 666 layout with equal armor  shield hp would be a suitable middle ground at the very leastand in closing apologises for the roasting but i do thank you for taking your time to read and reply to this postregardsgroot
its nice to see the discussion started with a objective comparing between the super carriers im in favour of the hel being changed and support the 666 layout as it gives room for shield and armor tanking but no excelling in either like the aeon and wyvern
yes
viewing supercarriers as two shield tankers two armor tankers makes sense is so flawed on so many levels its painful to comprehend that someone might even conceive or heaven forbid begin to entertain that idea too many examples exist in eve where same category ships do not have a similar split of armor  shield tankers across the four racesi personally would like to think that the idea of 2x armor and 2x shield tankers is part of something which is eve  i would like there to be 2x titans that shield tank and 2x that armor tank  not sure if there is this already as i dont have one  what i like about eve is the fact that when i first started playing the game came across to me as nothing was so super powered and something could beat everything kind of a rock paper scissors mental  and instead of making everything the same make it strong in its own right  a 666 slot layout is interesting tho i dont think that would really advance the point of your original topic making it a tiny bit better at armor tanking but a lot less worse at a shield tanker  making it worse overall to make a good tank in a capital i will step on a ledge and say you need at least 7 slots for its respective tank to give it 1 less in both means it can do both but none gooda shield tanking hel brings out what the minmatar are known for diversity all their ships are not both armor and shield tankers but are a mix of both instead of saying amarr are armor tankers  gallente are armor tankers and caldari are shield tankers with those 3 races you can train only armor tanking for amarr and spec up with all their ships without need for training shield and only train shield for caldari with no need to train armor but minmitar have ships for both armor and shield

the 5050 shieldarmour philosophy is fine and ccp has been pursuing it with reasonable success see new nag the problem with shield supercaps is firstly the lack of a slave setequivalent second the lack of decent gang bonuses and lastly the suckage of the hels and rags base statsi dont think making it 666 would help it much it would make it worse in both aspects than if they kept it 576 and fixed its base hp instead id rather have them fix it in its current form than redo it totally for the sake of a few people neurotically dedicated to armour buffer fitting everything in sight
so are you stating here that you fail to see the consistency between all the other caps and how that isnt reflected in the heli achnowledge we both agree on one fact that being the hel does need revamping however we disagree on how it should be doneto claim people are neurotically dedicated to armor buffing everything in sight in the context of this thread is alarming i would ask you to elaborate on this point so please feel free so to doas for the slot configuration 666 would be far from optimum but its to prove a point that something does need to be doneregardsgroot
also boost wyvern it only has as much ehp as the nyx  less dmg and no point
yes to a better hel but no to an armor buffer hel  if there needs to be consistancy across the line arguably itd be better to switch the nidhoggur to a shield tank insteadas already stated the main issues with the hel is that you cant plug in a slave set equivalent to boost your buffer like you can with the armour focused supercaps that the shield bonus from a leviathan ingang has to recharge up on every session change unlike the erebus instant armour bonus and that the other shield tanking mothership has an extra midslot and a shield resist bonus and slightly more base shield hp in exchange for one less lowslot who cares and a remote rep bonus who cares switching the slot layouts of the hel and wyvern might help balance those two ships relative to each other although the cries of despair from the caldari pilots would be audible for thousands of miles but that wouldnt fix the underlying issue of armour bufferstanks being simply better
people failed to shield tank the nid even though its slots were geared for it so they whined and had it changed but still a shield tanked nid outperforms an armourtanked one same for thanny btw hel is made for shieldtank and it needs fixing as such no need to force it into the armour buffer everything doctrine
i was promised manlove in exchange for my support
supported for a more flexible hel
if youve ever been in a spidertanking carrier fleet you know how ridiculous this sounds
like it or not hes right even with five mids a thannynid can go 2x invuln and em a booster and sbpointeccm and have similar resists to a triple eanm fit but with the advantage of being a lot more cap stable hello cprs
wins my vote those bombers are slow minmatar ditch useful things like dps and uniform tank so they can make things faster better agility top speed and alpha strike for quick kills even their drones are faster across the board it should follow that their focus would be to give their fighters the ability to actually get in range to attack mwd bs and their bombers the ability to get to launch range faster
what are you talking about people who want to lose carrier fleets shield tank their capitals
care to justify that

the fitting management window is awesomeyou know what would be even more awesomeif i could fly to a market hub select one of my personal or corp saved fittings and click a buy all button to get the hull and all modulesrigs dronesammo straight from the market without having to dig through all the market categories buying everything seperately youd need a checkout popup to give you the total price before you confirmed the payment i guess but it would make buying and fitting ships so much less hassle if it was a 2click process
obligatory support my own proposal post goes here
the impulse buyer in me just squeeeeeedi like the checkout part might be a good idea to add checkboxes beside each item to deselect overpriced parts or ones you already have on hand
yep thats sensible too might also work to have buy missing items as an option after you click the fit button so that you can use it to fill in the gaps
yes please i can also suggest buying the closest mtalvel item avaliabl
switching to the next metalevel could be a problem as some fittings are often tight on resources and using a different meta level module with say a higher cpu requirement may result in breaking the fitting but yeah its an option too
yes please
the rokh is even worse off than the hyperion when it comes to pg the rokh does have its sniping ability which gives it a nicherole to excell in even though this is debatable with the failure of railguns and the power of frikkin lazorsthe hyperion is a ship that desperatly needs to be revisted and a larger bonus to active tanking would helppeople who say that active tanked ships will become invulnerable please have you ever neutedbeen neuted an active tanked ship they have no buffer and as soon as that capacitor dries up the ship is dead
tank doesnt need a buff weve done that once before thanks buffer tanking needs a nerf
alright now i see what you meant there okalthough wouldnt it make these ships much more powerfull when running missions and stuff although i still dont think they will match up for the raven anyway but it is something to take into account
even with overloaddrugs and full resistance mods i dont see the active tanking bss gaining more than 100150 dps tanked out of this and that sounds like a healthy improvement to mei will support this but i think any improvement to tanking requires a look at station hugging and rring in terms of aggression
i can only support that

the 75 active tank bonuses are useless as you state for rr gangshow does your solution fix this 75 to active tank and 75 to buffer hp would be a better solution imoenabling players to fit more resists and less hp for rr situations rather than simply boosting there soloability which is not the problem for these bonuses
sov bills in dominion is an important factor in nullsec space distribution in order to reduce their sov bills most nullsec alliances only claims systems where strategic upgrades and stations are needed leaving most of their space officially unclaimed but not politically claimable either by another alliancein order to encourage these alliance to either exploit this space or to welcome pets alliance in their space i have a proposalintroduce constellation sov and region sov the dominant alliance of a constellation or a region as displayed in the sov dashboard has officially the sov of the constellationregionthe alliance who has a constellation sov pays for half of the price of the claim tcu onlining on unclaimed systems in the constellationthe alliance who has a region sov pays for the other half of the price of the claim on unclaimed systems in the whole region
not sure how this encourages either of the things you say it would wouldnt it be more likely to make the dominant alliance prevent any other alliance from claiming sov in their region or constellation since the dominant alliance would be lumped with half of any sov bill
the situation now is big alliance owns x regionsbig alliance pays sov for stationsjumpbridgeshubsstragegic systems big alliance leave pocketstransit systems unclaimedbig alliance effectively has influence on the whole region for a fraction of the sov billthey do not need to pay they do not need to let other people live in these unclaimed systemswith this proposal big alliance pays the minimum price for all the systems within their sphere of influencein order to reduce their sov bills they must either exploit these unused systems or rent this space to other people as dominion was intended to workthey can also assume the cost of these sov bills if they do not want intruders in their spaceit is only an incentive and a fix as the intended mechanic of dominion was alliance to pay the more space they have influence on
dominion failed miserably at opening up nullsec to smaller entities and something has to be done to curtail the gunnut neighbour strategy used to claim unoccupied spaceif you want to hurt the large alliances on their wallets make them pay for the unused spaceexample constellation has 5 systems region has 5 constellationsif alliance holds sovereignty in 2 or more systems and no other entity is present alliance pays for entire constellation regardless of presence of tcusif alliance pays for 2 or more constellations and no other entity is present alliance pays for entire region regardless of presence of tcusthat would get expensive really fast and forces alliances to either invite others or occupy smaller developed areascreate benefits to having actual sovereignty in all systems in a constellation to make it even more attractive to develop ones space
of course people can find ways around it like owning the border constellations in two different regions this would cause the universe to shift sovwise in terms of regions even if theyre named differently constellationwise owning less then the cutoff will just encourage bigger alliances to get more space to cover the systems lost in order to be under that cutoff point
if im right im not sure this would workwhy would an alliance want to pay more money on more systems they dont want most dont even want pet alliances or renters anywayalliance would have to pay 50 of a system they never wanted sov in anyway which monetry wise is a loss even if the renter paid half its not going to the alliance and infact the renter would benefit more as they only need to spend 50 of the amount requiredto put it simply most alliances dont want to rent their space anyway they want it for themselves they dont need to sov all systems they just need the stations which effectively gives them control over the region so they are not going to pay for systems and renters they dont wantnow dominion as settled in a little i actually think its a case of the rich get richer big get bigger and others well tough sht
alliances do not want to pay for space they dont use but they do not want people to come in this unclaimed space either as this is a bother they cant have both they must choose between paying sov or have people in their spaceif they let a neutral alliance settle in their space if nrds they wont have to pay for the sov as it is claimed reducing their sov bills if a red alliance settle in their unclaimed space they will probably kick them out because it is a threat but then they should have been claiming sov on these systems and paying bills cf provicatch wareither pays sov or have someone pay it for you
so because you are too weak to claim the space you want to punish others for leaving unclaimed systems
i would suggest  remove local from unclaimed systems so they cant gather free easy intel anymore from space they do not pay forthey want to leave a free pocket of space  security risk
if they are too weak they should find allies or do not claim sov at alldominion is not intended to have your 100 man ally to have independant sov it is intended to make bigger alliances welcome smaller alliances in their space to support the sov bills and it has failed to do so but it has sucessfully pwned goons
thats an interesting concept actuallyon the other point so your saying that every system must be claimed in one way or another the problem is and always has been that smaller corpsalliances wont even venture into that space anyway for the fear of getting blobbeddominion sadly hasnt made it easier sov really isnt that important its about being able to live in 00 without too much aggro i mean if you want to live in 00 build a pos and live out of that the problem is firstly the blobbage to kill you and secondly logistics you have no access to stations and thats important and fundamentally the problemlarge space holding alliances now now they dont need to hold sov in every system anymore people are only interested in the best moons systems and the stations thats it thinking about it im not sure why people claimed sov before in systems they didnt need
this would be far too easy a system to game i dont see it working well at all getting rid of local in unclaimed systems and making it optional on the part of the owner in claimed systems might work but thats only a maybe but an automated method of sticking people with bills for systems they dont own or want to own i doubt it
sort of like the current dominion system is far too easy to game the problem is that even though it is in the best interest of individual players in an alliance to hold a tight corner of space that builds up the infrastructure level in each system for maximum profit per hour of whatever your favorite money making method may be okay it may not benefit scamming it is in opposition to the best interest of the alliance as an entity moon gold remains spread out so alliances continue to hold a wide swath of systems because the moon gold is what they want until there is a money making device that promotes less sov sprawl for the alliance entity that benefits alliances more than moon gold you will always have alliance sov sprawl
great ideamake local an expensive system upgrade for claimable 00 leave local in npc 00
while i dont really support this suggestion i will say if ccp ever even considered this action then there must be a public record associated with the character that the name was changedif for example under employment history there was a name change statement including a ccp notification of the character being transfered to a new accounti still dont think this has much likelihood of occurring as mentioned before reputation is king and i doubt ccp want to deal with a whole lot of previous name entries for 1 character

partially due to the lag issue and partially because it makes a bit of sense my idea would be to create scannable beacon that were placed throughout the system where sbus are anchored these beacons would appear in random location in the system and would have to be scanned down an alliance would then anchor the sbus around these locations instead of at the stargates the sov mechanic would not have to be changed much as there would be equal number of beacons as their are stargates in the system and 51 percent would have to have sbus onlined at them for sov structures to become vulnerable etc etc this would add a few more locations in a system for battles to take place and may help a bit maybe to reduce the problem of the session change lag that occurs when too many people jump through a gate with too many people on the otherside or at least until ccp fixes the problem
wont work for one reason the gates will be camped anyway
yeah having limited and full apis for corporations as their own entities instead of running everything through directors personally sounds like a good idea to me
oh god yes
without any more details i couldnt support the idea no matter that it seems to be a good one additionally i doubt itll make it to the csm that wayop please update your proposal with more details have a look at the csm wiki pages to get an idea of what degree of detail is considered appropriate by the csm
supportedwhat more detail do you need both the api system and the killlogxml already exist we are just asking for a new api key which gives access to only that api xml
now im not one to complain usually but this needs to be addressedsomething i think should be done for hostiles to log in cloak up and go afk for the rest of the day in someone elses sov space yes it makes it a great tactic but sov bills and sov space is for a reason now and so should allow us to either probe them out like a perfect example of a no longer used module that would make this awesome was the system scanner array which ccp has deemed unnecessary now and what this module could have done for instance isenemy cloaker enters space cloaks up goes afkhave a time period that allows them to be scanned out lets say 3 hours of cloaking then a module or something requiring sov can scan them out while theyre cloaked3 hours go bygoto said module scan said cloakerwarp in and remove unwanted personel from systempart of dominion i believe was to make sovable space more secure aswell as enable possiblities for political shiftingcurrently how it isenemy cloaker enters systemenemy cloaker warps cloaks goes afk while heshe has to work or go afk or what everenemy cloaker comes home desides to do a black ops hot drop finds a vulnerable target hot drops black ops fleetkills targetcloaks up againall this and not one thing the defending team can do about itfurther more as when cyno jamming and such was first brought in yes long time ago and then black ops and black ops cynos were brought in they could not access cyno jammed systemsthey changed it now that they are able to access jammed systems but capital ships are notthis is 100 fine but there needs to be something done to make defense in these situations of afk cloakers easier this also will make sure pilots are always active or safe when goign aroung afk and there for making them interact with the game more in my mind this is a great idea and i wanted to bring it up
to support my own topic aswell as add that this was recently brought to my attentionanother fix would be a timer on the cloak module

since supercapitals are now very much front line weapons chances are they will die sooner rather than later  so the whole intended risk bit is moot even though i highly doubt the statements validitynot only do super capital pilots have to pay through the nose to get the damn things but as you said they have to pay for a second account just to park it  i would say that is more than enough drawbacknot supported
the artists are plenty capable of making symmetrical ships they just choose not to to annoy you i dont necessarily like their art direction but firing people for it is absurd
not that i dont support the absurdity of this proposalbut seriously who the hell came up with ships like the imiscus and dominix or how about the griffin there are a lot of really ugly ships in eve
i was ed off after the horrid job they did on the paintjob of the navy dominix and megathronnot only does the camo look ugly and does not make sense its poorly done you can clearly see that a bunch of eve players can make a much better looking paintjobccp would make more money if they got rid of the ugly paintjob on their megathron

i propose that sale of oremineralsgas is taxed at the same rate as missionratting rewards the first 5 of tax going to concord with the remainder going to the players corp including npc corps having 5 minimum tax ensures some value is lost even with a corp tax rate of 0this tax would only apply to raw materials not manufactured producti feel that this tax would offer the following advantagescreate an incentive for manufacturing which avoids the taxcreate more opportunities for corp teamwork through industryenable corps to gain income from a wider portion of their membership not just ratters and mission runners and donationsi see it having the following disadvantagesreducing the income of miners althought i would expect the market will adapt to an extent raising the value of minerals to compensate as miners seek higher prices and as more finished product is sold rather than raw materials reducing the quantity on the marketmakes trading in raw materials unviable unless there is a huge cost differential across regions trading in manufactured products would still be viable manufactured goods can be reprocessed and remanufactured avoiding paying the tax
so basically your proposal is to force people to play the game the way you want them to play no thank you

after the last update i lost all my ship fitting filesa year and a half of game play lostpettion  sorry our fault a adimission of fault i feel that i should be reinbursied for my loss one month of game play seems fair they said to put it in local forum so here it is do you think i should be compensated thanks zarcon3
i was told before if i cant say anything nice not to say anything at all i got it half right i guess
no  theres an export option now if they are important back them up
you did export them rightchanges to rigs and amarr navy  imperial navy messed a bunch of my saved fits up but heh cant say i every seriously used the in game fittings plus i have all my ship fittings  dozens more backed up in eft
you lost all your saved fittings and need compensation how does that even make sensei can understand the annoyance of having to replace the ship fittings but as chainsaw said its always a good idea to have them in eft anyways 
obvious troll is obvious
because he got a undeserved response on his petition because the petitions response said it was a fault on ccps end or because the petitions response did not mention backing up the files
because only an idiot or a troll would demand compensation on the forumsim giving him the benefit of the doubtseriously  he lost his saved fittings and this represents a year and a halfs playing lost how does that work exactly

unfortunately many eve players seem to have developed a strange disorder that i ofter refer to as sandbox veteran syndrome  simply put the balancing and downscaling of skills in this particular game are often seen by veteran players particularly those of us from 0305 as attempts to placate newer players who complain about both the training and learning curves associated with eve but lets face it  balancing is something that every mmo goes through and well probably see a lot more of it here no one in wow has complained that blizzard has made the leveling process faster provided more endgame treats to new players as time has gone on mounts now available at level 20 and so on primarily because wow veterans use these new features to train their own new characters but eve isnt like that  your main if it has been your main since you started playing is usually your only active main and the toons reputation performance political associations and buddy list have far more meaning and impact than they do in a game where you can change your name race faction and server for a few bucks in between mindlessly grinding for better gearso i do understand some of the frustration howeveri have absolutely no issue with training a specific skill at 5 then finding out that the same new skills can be unlocked at 3 why would i no i did not waste my time training that skill to 5 because i have a 5 whereas someone new will only have 3 and will probably never train beyond that thus decreasing their overall effectiveness down the road no level 5 skill is ever wasted in fact only training skills to the bare minimum required to unlock new skills is one of the worst things you can do because you can fly t2 subcaps with level 13 skills  but i wouldnt recommend it same goes for everything scientific and industrial because fractional numerical advantages are what eve is really all about if eve wasnt about fractional advantages loadouts wouldnt be the primary topic of discussion between players approximately 50 of the time and no one would bother with implants or boosters or even expensive faction and t2 modules
shia labeouf speaks my answer on my behalfedit okay aside from my smart ass answer one of the really big reasons people like eve is the fact you dont have to grind if you want benefits to grinding there are plenty of mmos out there that do nothing but grind and frankly i hate them all
while it wasnt formalised categorising the wiki pages was going to have a 2 step approach st step was for the author of the original proposal to categorise their issues after cs or ccp discussion second step was for the secretary to do it or delegate someone to do it should the author forget as the person who pretty much came up with all the categories for the evelopedia and put a huge  of the info on there in the first place i thought that would be the simplest and most effective way of managing the informationa brief history of csm  wiki ankhesentekempahomgwhyismynamesolongitspainfultoread put together a homebrew wiki hosted on her own server during csm1 this data most of which contained csm2 info as csm 1 documentation wasnt formatted into the wiki was then reformatted for the evelopedia and ported by me and tusko hopkins meissa then came up with a pdftext to wiki converter that was used to bring in minutes and a few other things during csm3
i cant give excuses for the rest of the current csm but personally im snowed under at work if youll pardon the pun this week getting everything into a functional state so my boss doesnt end up in a panic should something fail while im away in icelandpersonally i think each rep should update their raised proposals on the wiki but that isnt always happening well try to knock things into shape and we as csm4 will probably become just song li and myself 
jonah salpsan can follow the conversation here of course but he wont reply as isd nor with his player account you will have to bear with me for the time being teadaze my offer still stands you are welcome to contact me to work something out
the more i appreciate it seeing you here  in turn please excuse me tearing your quote apart thanks for the explanation omber zombie thought a bit wrote a lot deleted it all d tldr what about having the csm primarily the reps who brought the proposals to the agenda and if they fail the secretary accepting responsibility of the pages and their handling but allowing the community to actively support them as wellwhile that might lead to additional workload to isd in case of these pages being protected isd would have to approve every single change this would first of all help in the pages being maintained straight from the horses mouth lol found it at dictleoorg and had to use it  hope it matches the context though so mistakes should be pretty rare as well as it would allow to deal with situations like todays with a huge bunch of changes by the sheer manpower of the communityand still the yarr team would have its authority remain unchanged  best case they would get an entire section free of maintenance contentwise however an update on the explanation at the csm main wiki page would be required but shouldnt be that much of an issueedit sorry eshtir was writing while you posted thanks anyway i just wanted to know the link i left at the discussion page would be useful to him

i fully support the idea of having maximum shield hp bonus apply instantly to bring it more in lines with the armor version of this bonusi can understand where the opposition is coming from in terms of the regenernation arguement armor tankers dont get a repair rate bonus from their maximum armor hp bonus i would agree with the followingif my maximum shield capacity is x and the regeneration rate is y relative to that maximum shield capacity prebonuses then post bonuses when my new shield capacity is z then that rengeneration rate stays as yunder the current mechanics no one benefits from the seige warfare skill unless they been sitting in the same system collecting cobwebs for a significantly prolonged amount of time a hotdropped thanny and hotdropped chimera both benefit from the armor hp bonus but neither benefit from the shield hp bonus unless they are untouched for a long long time the proposed change would benefits all fleets regardless of their compositiontry not to think of this as a brawl between armor and shield tankers for superiority but as a way to make fleets more effective in general also think of it as a way to stop the bruising on the backsides of anyone who trained seige warfare v so they can stop kicking themselves for not training the armor version of it instead  the proposed change diversifies the game through balance rather than force people to choose one way to tank or the other because a leadership bonus of one apply while the other does not why not let them choose
this is not specific to gang bonuses everything that adds to your shields be it the shield operation skill shield extender modules or rigs or whatever has always been broken in this way and needs fixed passive recharge is a non sequitur passive tanks are passive tanks  with or without any one specific size add  fleet bonus in this case  hence there is no need to muck with shield recharge time there is also no issue with exploitability because it just needs to work the same way as armor which has never been exploited specifically when you addsubtract x to maximum shields you also addsubtract x to current shieldsim sick and tired of having to wait 10 minutes for the shields to go from 30 to 100 on my shield tanked lachesis whenever i board it and the shield tanked supercaps are just ridiculously hurt by this bug
this and just this the entire hel should be an armor tanker because we want in with the cool crowd argument it flawed and painful and broken in so many ways for one the idea that some exceptions to the rule means that there is no rule is fairly flawed as there are also numerous examples of ccps attempt to balance the number of armor tanking and shield tanking ships in the game mixed success to be sure but theyre tryingi think this is pretty clear you armor buffered a ship with 7 mid slots and 5 lows and more base shield hp then armor hp the ship wanted to be shield tank but you shoved an armor tank down its throat might as well complain about the lack of ehp on an armor tanked drakeso what youre saying is that the hels problem isnt its layout its the shield tank itself that are the problemcurrently the hel is a shield tank and theres no particular reason to change that if shield tanks are having a problem in carrierssupercarriers then perhaps that should be addressed instead of shuffling the hel off to join the armor tankers and just leaving the lonely caldari as the only shield tank
this thread is not a discussion about which is better re shield or armor tanking carriers so stop talking about that heretagroot
no you appear to have already decided that armour tanking is better hence your proposal
quoted because larkonis is making a lot of sense here groot you are trying to force the hel into something that ccp already has decided that its not it doesnt serve any purpose besides being in line with armour buffer fanboi crowd if you want to be taken seriously make a proposal fix the hel and list several ways in which it could be done this way doesnt work
its becoming more and more clear that youve not read the op at allfirstly you still havent addressed the questions  points i presented you with earlier on which require you to have a vague understanding of the basics of my argument which i am putting forwards as such the point you are making here is in no way validi strongly advise you read the original  subsequent posts then rethink as to why i would ask people not to debate if carriers should armor or shield tank
i just read the op and still agree with laconisyour initial post does include a balanced shield and armor tanking setup which you could make a decent argument for being appropriately minmatar however your obvious preference towards the armor tanking one and your continual support for that perspective dosent really serve the balance the game all that better or maintain the flavor of minmatar morso repeatedly asking for the 657 layout over the more appropriate 666 one has reinforced what became obvious from the eft fit you really just want to armor tank itnow ill agree that it would probably improve the hel quite a bit to do so but this merely underscores the fact that shields are that much more difficult to get into high ehp numbers according to your own numbers the nyx has as high ehp as the resist bonused wyvern now in attempting to replicate your numbers wasnt easy and im curious what exactly you did to achieve such high overall ehp as its not just in the fit in spite of how high they were on most ships i found that the one ship i could easily outdo his ehp on was the hel itself by shield tanking it this brought it to about 5 mil ehp more then the nyx setup based on his own but with no bonuses or whatever else he did to it its even within 2 mil ehp of the resist bonused aeon the only one is falls signifigantly behind is the wyvernclearly something about the ops analysis is either flawed or undisclosed to be achieving such different results with the same ship setup and id argue that whatever mechanic the op is using to reverse the trend towards higher ehp lying on the shields side of things may be the culprit over any specific issues with the hel or even shield tankingehpwyvern 36 milaeon 29 mil 30 mil if you switch a t2 enam for another corelum atypehel 27 milnyx 23 milshield setupdamage control ii3x caldari navy power diagnostic system2xdread guristas invulnerability field2xpith xtype photon scattering fieldpith xtype heat dissipation fieldpith xtype ballistic deflection fieldpith xtype explosion dampening field3xlarge core defence field extender iiarmor setupdamage control iicore xtype armor em hardenercore xtype armor thermic hardenercore xtype armor kinetic hardenercore xtype armor explosive hardener2xcorelum atype energized adaptive nano membrane3xlarge trimark armor pump ii
did you take into account slave implants you are able to boost armour by quite a bit with thosesaying that if the hel pilot replaces some pds with istabs and throws in a nomad set and plugs in a skirmish mindlink he can get his align time down to 10 seconds faster than most bs while still maintaining around 25mil ehp thats still a good 8 doomsdays worth more if you overload
the only rationale you seem to have brought up for an armor hel in the op is motherships have had a name change to supercarriers this implies that they are burlier versions of their carrier counterparts in other words youre taking a really stupid name change and interpreting it as a design philosophy and yet when people make fun of you you think the problem is with them
i didnt take that or fleet bonuses into account because even with those i couldnt replicate the ops numbers either somethings wrong with my eft or the ops found another mechanic to increase armor hp also if its the slave implants that push the armor tanks past the shield tanks perhaps its that that we should look at instead of an overall rebalance of the ships based around the assumption that everyone wears slave implants sure they probably should but its an uneven assumption at least
sounds like a quick way to pay 5x above retailits a fine feature if you know what youre doingnoobs however will have their wallets emptied by dodgy orders
newbies wont use fits in the first place
lad
yes please so more people buy my well priced modules
implementation is going to be a concern but i do support something along these lines
1click easy fitting of expandable shipsyesnow i can die even more in pvp wohoo d
definately supported
even better  make it so that you can specify how many of those fits you want to buy from market and then make it possible to fit it into ships without having to wait 30 sec each timei was recently unfortunate enough to have to fit 60 vigils for my carrier ship maint bay it was not pleasant
you would also need a tick box for buying it all in one station if possible so you can see the difference in price from buying in one spot or spreading your order around the current region before you go ahead with the deal
even tho in theory this would be a nice tool there are too many parameters to take into account for it to work or to make it usefull regional or number of maximum jumpspick cheapest price but what if there is only 1 seller ouchset a maximum price too thenupgrade or downgrade to next meta level either you cant buy the full fit if your preferred meta level is not available or if you go up or down in meta level the fit may no longer work on your shipoften lower meta levels can cost alot more than higher meta levels especially if there are only few available ouch againokay this may work in rens or jita because nearly everything is available there so that means even more people in jita and rens growing to jita levels  not all regions have trade hubs as big as rens let alone jita etci forsee this only used by newbies causing their wallets to get emptied rather sooner than laterso personally i feel the time for developping this should better be spend elsewhere
oh god yes please
if it could be made to work reasonably it would be a boon to both the wise seller and the buyer who values time above isk
have wanted something like this for a long time
its something that would be most useful in hubs like jita and rens granted at the same time the ability to dock fit a ship with 2 or 3 mouse clicks undock and leave rather than spending several minutes trawling through the market window to buy every individual module would mean people would spend less time there but people with the ability to go shopping in jita are already doing so and its hard to see why this would make more of them show up there if theyre not already and newbies who dont know better will buy relisted modules for inflated prices under the current system the ability to buy a lot of different modules with one click wont change that
to prevent moar whining in the phorums and as i dont want to support scamnoat least not in the 1click fashion as proposed however if it would appear in some kind of a multicolumn list view containing information like todays average local stationsystem and best regional price it might really be able to make empire life more convenient as it already is
if thisll be implemented i recommend this feature to be systemwide only or even better have a editable range1 click on fit2 press on the buy fit button 3 select range of purchase for example 2 jumps 4  5 profit
id go along with this what would probably work best is if the option initially tried to buy from the station youre currently docked in if some of the required fittings werent available or you deselected them from your list because of a high price youd get a popup that said something like hey i tried to buy this fit for you but the following modules werent available here  would you like to search further afield then youd select the range that you were willing to buy from to bring up the secondary list of the remaining modules at the lowest available prices within that buy range

so you want a ship somewhere between the orca and the rorqual orca like tank but rorqual like ore hold jump drives like the rorqual but can use gates like the orca seems pointless to me as it does not fulfill any new roles
my first thought on the matter is that for any op big enough to justify this ship you can just as easily use one rorqualorca for gang boosting and a second for hauling ive hauled for mining ops before and a single hauler kept up with 6 hulks and 3 retreivers boosted by a mindlinked orcathough only barely  surely an orca that holds some 5x as much can keep up with a pretty big mining fleet that said your ship is welldesigned and if something is added in this role youve sketched out what it ought to look like i dont personally think its necessary so im not supporting the idea but i do approve from a gamedesign point of view
this is exactly the kind of input i wanted and the point about using another orca to haul with was one of my solutions too which is why i love the orca it fulfills so many different roles i think maxed it has something like 170k m3 with gscs and another 50k m3 in the ore hold what im proposing could have upwards of 500k m3 with icss at level v easily twice that of an orca but not as efficient as a freighter in hauling ore through empirewas the 6 hulks  retrievers in a station system i was thinking of this being more for systems without stations i know there are not a lot of them but they do exist and many of their fields have 1000000 m3 or more of materiali was also thinking of this being something that would warp to an orca transfer ore until full then drop it off at a corp hanger rorqual station etc so maybe no role bonimaybe a better name for it would be a glorified ore industrial
learn to fly a pilgrim you orbit at 1000 with tds on the target while killing his cap with a single small neut after volleying it with meds also abstaying at range in a pilgrim is usually a quick way to get popped
this only works when going for a single active tankedarmor buffered turret shipin a recon gang vs some other gang youre the one fighting closest guess what the chance is of being primariedwhats keeping curses from being popped while at range the difference is pilgrims cannot apply cap warfare at range im not asking for a range bonus similar to the curse just outside webscram
both are very valid points the curse usually stays out of trouble due to it being out of immediate danger since its far enough awayalso i have now devoured dinner and am no longer in such a foul mood i therefor apologize for my previous asshattery
yes the pilgrim have some problem because you can not use them on about 50  of the shipif your target its a caldari forgot  the ew doesnt work on the missile and you tanking is not enough against themif you target is minmatar forgot  the artillery dont use cap and and the ew against them is not terrible with the new ammunition the speed of the minmatar is to high to go out your range of your neutra thx ccp for nerfing the webbut its very good ship against the amarr  and gallente if is not a drone boatclearly for me they have some problem with this ship
sir if any one here is a troll it is is you 1 if there are that many ideas and people out there demanding this it needs to be done its just that fing simple the customer is always right the customer wants what they paid for well this is what we want now shut up2 granted most of the games i listed arent huge mmos the point was the tech is out there oh and added to that list is the recently released star trek online from what my friend tells me they have done this exact thing3 as far as server issues go they need to get more anyway cause its getting to the point supporting the basic game the current server isnt support it hell they are buying a server just for walking in stations so guess what time to expand more to just support the basic game4 as far as large fleet flights go thats why i suggested making an option to turn textures off hell i even suggested if ccp wants to disable all custom textures till the battle is over cause they are requesting notice and time to optimize the server to handle the fleet fight which in my eyes is wrong it should be able to handle it with out any special attention5 im a miner i often fly in small fleets with other miners sitting right next to an orca or other hulks while mining sure i would like to see my own ship painted but the fact that when i look down at a mining op and every one looks exactly the same is annoying and honestly eves coloring are growing old and dull cause they have been around foreveroh and i suggest you do a little research because even though the server would see the problem do you know how long it takes the server to process something as simple as a packet of red blue green values less time then it takes you to blink now please tell me if a server can processes 1 packet that quickly how is it going to lag processing 1000 of these packets 2000 of these packets 50000 of these packets oh and think about it this way too sure you might not always see other peoples paint but how would you feel is every car in real life was the exact same color how would you feel if you got on the freeway looked around and every car was blue there isnt even a differnce in shades of color its all one shade with no flames no decals no stripes nothingoh and from now on i suggest you use real logisical numbers there arent 76783402 people that play eve if that many people where demanding this even if you had 100000000 players that still 75 percent of the game wanting this upgrade and if i was a smart businessman running the game id give those 75 percent what they wanted cause losing 25 percent of my player base to a patch they didnt want is better then losing 25 percent becuase they didnt get what they wanted sure not every one who supports this would leave eve if they didnt get it but small things began to quickly stack up to the point the game isnt fun or interesting any more
the best way to get people to use a system or concept is to reward them for doing so in the first place give big alliances a benefit for renting out space to smaller alliances any empty space occupied by a renting alliance should automatically give the bigger alliance a reduction in their total sov space bill the longer a renter stays doing so would help to avoid short term scams so coupled with the having to pay for the empty space mechanic also add an incentive to make it in the best interests for big alliances to rent out space to smaller alliances for the long term by gradually reducing their over all sov bill for the length of duration a renter stays in unclaimed space this would probably give most big alliances an incentive to do what was actually intended by the deployment of dominion and its new sov mechinism
i suggest that the first system an alliance can claim can be anywhere and after that they can only claim adjacent systems
i actually like this concept and when dominion sov was first announced i thought they would so something like thisreminds me of ut4s assault matches
how about the more unclaimed systems is in the way from main system the higer the costless artificial rule  similar effectyou can avoid it by compressing your territory you can do your own way if you rellay want to  at cost  sounds more like sandbox yet it promotes less sprawling
another proposal for each neighbor unclaimed system the sov tax is increased by x x must be quite high 60  75  as it should incitate alliances to claim all the nearby space or allow other alliances to claim themfor example 
when i was in the csm and made my proposal to ccp for the new sovereignty system this is kinda what i included have the price a set amount but make it an exponential multiplier the further away from the highest sovereignty systemfor example an alliance owns one system of sov level 3 and then others of lower sovereignty the cost of the main system would be marginal maybe 100k or something the next systems over might increase that amount by 50 compounded the further you are from the highest sovereignty for this example the cost of the bordering systems might be 150k each the cost of the next systems from that would cost 225k each et althese values are mapped based on the shortest route if the alliance had sovereignty 3 at their core system where the jump bridges are and then didnt have any systems in the intervening systems for quite a ways they would have to pay 1m if the systems were 7 jumps out compounded from therethis makes it far more valuable to develop the space you have i also included other benefits for sovereignty including moon goo defenses and agents in space  which ccp seems to have neglected they went with their own system which thankfully incorporated some of my features but unfortunately not all of themin either case the sov system works a lot better than it used to and im thankful for that its still got its bugs but i feel the current mechanics are an exploit of the spirit of the new rules of sovereignty if not the mechanics itself
so pulling in a cnr every few days say 3 at 3 missions a day and lp change sounds reasonable with almost no riskU02C7U02C7being snared in losecU02C7U02C7 is this what carebears call it its like they are injured rabbits or something
k keep doing missions then
sounds to me like you dont know what your doing as a mission runner
good idea i hate missions but a good idea is a good idea
yepsimply as its consistent have pirate faction items added by the same ratio as with the nonpirate factions lp stores hrhr its always a matter of perspectivethen bring it up to a csm meeting
ok i dont know about this missile tracking computer thing but i deff think that missiles should recieve the skill bonuses to all missiles t2 torps with exp radius of 650 and exp velocity that most bs can even outrun is ridiculous also 30 sec flight time is too much if you are wanting to say that missiles are good for range i would say half the flight time and double velocity as far as defenders goonly some npc use them so factoring them into any missiles vs turrets argument is about uselessas far as lasers being overpowered yea thats true too
t2 damage missiles are generally intended to be used against the ship class above yours so if you are fighting other bs fit a web and painter or bring a friend in a rapier
U02C7U02C7t2 damage missiles are generally intended to be used against the ship class above yoursU02C7U02C7i dont know where you got that from at all and why would this be specific to missiles U02C7U02C7if you are fighting other bs fit a web and painterU02C7U02C7 plus warp disrupt and wheres the tank as far as skills not applying to all missiles

i believe what he is trying to do is encourage a little variety in the sov mechanics while trying to fix the lag moving the sbus off gate grid should allow people to load the system before jumping onto a grid with 300 people on it so hopefully since ccp is very quiet about how their code actually works they have less to load once they warp in on the sbu and therefore reducing lag times plus spec ops tactics and such would be a little more viable since the sbu isnt on one of the few jump in points
would make it more interesting yes please
after some offforum discussion i dont think thisll help in decreasing lag to me the technical issue seems to be the sheer amount of objects that must be loaded by any incoming pilot the grid loading issue having the sbus located at a beacon off the gate would just exchange the gate object with the beacon object technically spokenit wouldnt change anything even if youd allow the sbus being anchored anywhere within the solar system without a beacon or similar structure youll always face the same technical situation n defenders wait with the grid already loaded so far and m attackers warping in while the defending pilots will have to load m additional objects the attacking pilots are forced to load nm1 objects as their warp bubbles collapse

absolutely not supportedthis was tried in sl back in 2005 i was part of the first group of resident moderators spent my month defending the idea and was attacked on the forums inworld and in irc  by people who respected me just the day before that i would be a great choice for it this became one of the main reasons i left that worldlinks are available for my final rant to them regarding moderation i reposted them to my own site since their forum was restricted access send an evemail since i dont check this section regularlyak

hey allsince some of my friends and corp mates have seen their accounts hacked we studied the problem  no malware isk buying or keylogger where involved in this cases  we found that all hacked account have their accounts names used in one or more eve related forumsit appears that accounts names are farmed on public forums and brute force have been applied to find the passwordswe want ccp to implements account renaming to allow us to change our accounts name on a regular basis just like our passwordsthanks
i can see no obvious harm with this
agreed i dont see anything wrong with it
supported
make it so
im sure ccp would rather spend their time raking in  from people transferring characters from a compromised account to a new one than actually doing something about itedit 11 forgot to support
perfectly reasonable
cant say no id use that myself
not supported at all as this proposal is absurdandi recommend keepass for both password generation and storage
policies can be changed too thats just words and phrasesbrute force hacking of eve accounts is on the rise and regular passwords changes isnt sufficient now
yes its the players responsibility yes giving up your account name is a bit dumb that said id much prefer giving the player the ability to fix a stupid mistake than sticking them with the consequences if its practical to do so
i chose to quote the policy simply as it easier to understand  less words less formal than the eula and no even the policies arent just words and phrases they are part of a legal contract that every capsuleer agreed upon and signed hence i doubt ccp will agree in changing the parts affectedin addition youre obviously not aware of the technical and legal implementation details eve became truly international by the time and so ccp has to deal with a wide variety of legal aspects as still every nation maintains its very own jurisdiction this in turn leads to additional development efforts whenever changes have to be applied to the technical implementationsbitfrighteninglymike c described a way to deal with such kind of situation create a new account and transfer the characters from the compromised account to thee new one finally terminate the old one take the fees involved as some kind of reminderthis however wont help at all if the same silly type of passwords is being used and the new account name is broadcasted into the public again and yes people often do silly things like thesethey even do way more silly things than this
not supportedyes itll lead to some positive things here and there small but the bad side of this proposal can easily overshadow the proswhy imagine youre a ceo of a certain big alliance in delve which has its ass whooped by real alliances now imagine you have this idea implemented what im trying to say its simple steal all assets and cash disband the alliance and rename yourself to something completely different and nonrelated to your previous name there now join a random pvp corp and start over with your big fat assetcash chest since no one can ever track you down forever
excuse me sir may it be you mistake account name changes this thread for character name changes that thread
i have two issues that i think need to be looked at and improved1 the marketplace layout is alright as it is now but it can be unresponsive especially when trying to buy multiple items the marketplace updates everytime the window is resized or an item is bougth or clicked and when it does this it can become unresponsive slowing the experience and breaking general flow also the area of the marketplace that shows the items and description shows a lot of text but has a very transparent background that can only be changed by making all window edges nontransparent the marketplace needs to have a performance increase to make it more responsive and so that i can read the description in the marketplace without having to look at a very transparent background2 the lp store is very unintitively designed making filters requires too many clicks and it can take a lot of scrolling to find the one item i want an addition to find the required items on the marketplace i cant just rightclick the item and view market details but i have to move the window to the side open the marketplace and assuming i now where to look navigate through the marketplace and find the item which can be difficult because tags can have long names and similar names so it requires me to extend the size of the lp window to see the full name what im saying is that it requires too many clicks to use the lp store fewer clicks help to make a better game so i would like it if the lp store was either made to resemble the marketplace more or integrated into the marketplace and required items can be rightclicked so that i can quickly view the market details
1 unresponsiveness isnt a quick fix  theyve been making it better for years but its still going to be ugly for the foreseeable future the market database servers get hammered with a really obscene number of queries  lag is inevitable that said i agree regarding transparency 2 agreed fully supporting this as long as you dont really expect a lag fix
i wouldnt mind seeing a wee bit of a boost to the grid so that the cruiser size ship could actually fit one or two cruiser size shield mods but seriously if you cant tank the npc rats in 00 you should just give up and go back to empire and the comment about the rorqual being too fragile tell me that was a joke
while you should not be 100 safe anywhere you also should not be able to use a pair of free  after insurance  smartbombing bs to kill half a dozen 180 million isk ships with no possible way to defend
other forms of ewar need a boost if anythingecm boats are once someone has a lock on you flying coffins unless you can get a lucky jam on whatever is tackling you its over and if there are multiple ships tackling you well theyre also one of the few viable counters to rr gangs and can have half their effectiveness chopped off by a single modulea single unbonused multispec being able to lock out a frigate is a problem but ruining ecm to fix that isnt an option

honestly at least to me these hardware related stories by oveur made up a significant part of eve its always cool to know what kind of stateoftheart yarrdware ones using just by playing evei definitely miss em
just give them a 3d grace period and kill the order at downtime and dunno the way people undercut and also complain about undercutting i have my doubts about how much of an issue this is that and it lowers your ability to react to market changesmight as well support though
not supportedghost training and what you now oh so uncreatively dub ghost selling are completely different the first increased the value of a character through the continued training of the last skill you were training that for many years was a selling point until ccp made a ninja edit about eves history and features by claiming it was a bug unattended selling just leaves market orders abandoned and by the nature of a the market b being unattended they cannot compete with active live accounts furthermore a character can have a maximum of 305 active sell orders so on one account that is 915 not multiple thousands on 3 different accounts that is 2715 sell orders if that is what you meant keeping 3 accounts with outdated orders is foolish market orders that continue after an account goes inactive are outdated by their nature if you and other players are too lazy slow poor etc to react to old market orders and make them all but worthless it is your own fault letting other players who arent there to update those orders sell their items instead of selling your own is just a sign that you dont have what it takes to compete in the market ccp shouldnt give you a crutch by nerfing players sell order because your defects this is eve compete or gtfo for real i dont have inactive accounts and wouldnt farm a character like this but what you want hurts all players who ever take a break or screw up for one reason your own greed and spite stopping sell orders like this is just player anger and greed over someone else and the idea that there are legions of characters doing this additionally sell orders are set to run and end a character creates the order and pays to do so someone taking time off of eve or forgetting to pay via gtc paypal etc is punished because of your greed and spite over imagined billions of isk that any account with active sell orders allegedly has you are incapable of realizing that abandoned sell orders are not competitive in the market and cannot compete with active accounts and players monitoring their sell orders the market takes care of itself it does not need to have players punished by a change like this in order to workusually when people make proposals they try to list pros an cons because they try to think about the outcome of said changes and present reasons why the pros outweigh the cons or form some argument about it you have done neither it is simply i dont want sell orders to continue because some players might or are probably doing something like this and i cantdont also ccp is losing money because they can make billions on outdated sell orders that no other players are competing against which makes no sense
this is really a meaningless complaint who would intentionally leave up gobs of orders for an extended period of time without the ability to change them i bet a guy who cancelled in november feels really good about selling his nanotransistors for 1100unit and buying ferrogel for 50k when he comes back
because the basis of that amount of sell orders would be selling small amounts of goods over a very wide area at a high premium believe me it works these sell orders dont need changing and work on low volume high margin generally the basis of them would be to produce 2 or 3 million a month this would mean that an account of the alts would generate approximately 2 billion a month with three of these you would activate 1 per month at a cost of 250 million for six billion profit efficient use of jump clones and courier contracts would cut down the work considerably making this very scalebale
all of this

this is brilliant
after some thought ive come to the conclusion that all these limited api required for service x y and zservices that are popping up is kind of silly  ive ended up doing manual reports instead on charactersaccounts i dont want to share character datas for  especially longtimers might have a hard time giving out this information  as in its not always trivial to do somy suggestion is adding a configurableaccess api with default set to show by default  pilot name pilot corporation pilot allianceas such no skills no attributes and no wallet content is delivered to offsite systems by default meaning the limited api becomes a simple verification apikeyadding  creating a new apikey system with a per key restrictionset could be feasible doing something like this   allow polling all characters with this apix allow only character named charactername to be polled with this keyx allow showing character name  corporation name  alliance name set to yes by default  allow showing skills  allow showing certificates  allow showing wallet content  allow showing assets  allow showing journal  allow showing industryscience jobsetc etc etc  with rolesettings for both characters and corporations should the queried character be a ceoi already know that the full api is required for most of this though it can however be removed once a rolebased apimethod like this would existitll be autogenerated keys when created as per today but allowing multiple sets where the userid holds information of which character the enhancedadjustable api holds which access the api has done as above with ticked selectboxes  in short it would replace both the limited and full api keysthis would then be able to replace  enhance the following suggestions 
signed at least a basic verification option would be good enough for forumtsvent registrations i really dont want to give out detailed skill training and my current wallet balance to every alliance i happen to fleet up with
i like the configurable option with the basic info as the default in fact im surprised that all that informaiton is provided by defaulthowever how would you handle cases where you may want to provide different levels of informaiton for different purposes eg namecorpalliance for boards and ts but more info for others like eft etc
yeah the system could use some more customization
mark galean could you please add links to the relevant threads the ones that would be rendered obsolete if you proposal would be implemented to your proposal would add some weight to the proposal as such the only obvious caveat i see onn first glance is that itll guarantee a flood of we want moarr keys threads as all those shiny tools and apps require different types of information and youll just have your public key to share eg a killboard asks for different information than inevenet and the other application asks for different information again  this will have you end up with basically spreading all of your valuable information all over the world or makes you cry for even moarr keysapart from that this is currently the best proposal i read flexible and powerfulsupported

bawww theres more to pvp than bufferrr slugfests as i stated in the op theres very little incentive to use these ships over their resist bonused counterparts in an active tanked roleits not perfect ill admit but its a little step and a start
originally way way before the popularity of rr gangs and massive buffer tanked blobs were talking years here 4 the repair bonus was 5 the same as the resist bonusccp at the time realized how superior the resist bonus was to the repair bonus so they increased it to the current 75fast forward to present and you find that larger scale pvp is almost exclusively rr ganga and buffer tanks something ccp did not expect or make plans forbecause of this local repairs are almost dead and the ships with the repair bonus are less effectivethis is an old issue now and has been discussed many times the first comprehensive math based discussion has long since been lost on the eve forums but the basic outcome of that thread was the realization that a repair bonus overtakes a resist bonus in a very small margin of incoming dps after about 2 minutes and then is superior by just 2basically in 910 times an out my butt number the resist bonus is far superiorif the repair bonus was increased however to 10 there is a very real and tangable superiority in small to mid sized engagements where a repair bonus would be superiorthis to me makes it worth fighting for so signed
supporting thisthose who fear that it might be too much active tanking is still vulnerable to cap warfare
i still believe that the main cause of the problem here is overpowered bufferpassive tanking specifically since rig prices have dropped significantly and smallmedium rigs became extremely cheap the 15 extra hp rigs give huge advantage to buffer tankingand i dont like the trend of increasing battle duration with stronger defense vs offense as that makes active tanking more sensitive to cap issues i know ccp has some understanding of this issue since they reduced cap booster charge sizesstop the never ending boosts to tanking nerf buffer tanking

i like this very much as long as the account names are still hidden from nonccp employees
bringing this issue back to the fore for further examinationthe current state of this failure is a major game breaker for industrial types
very badly needed
yeah the time im thinking of i picked the belt specifically to be about an au away from the station to minimize warp times rigged expanded itty 5 warping back and forth with full loads constantlyno gsc though they take too long to fillempty most nonstation systems are in 00 where rorqual compression does the job youre looking for pretty well  run the ore through a compression cycle1040x compression and you can pretty trivially keep several million m3 of raw ore in the rorqs cargoorecorp bays yeah theres a handful of nonstation systems in highsec but thats pretty minor even at minimal rorq compression an orca can get around 2m m3 of raw ore into a load  itd take a pretty crazy mining fleet for that not to be enough hauling capacity
the system that im based out of has like 46 belts in it which i can stripped with 34 hulks each day if i have the time and numbers but the neighboring system has like 15 belts and there isnt a station in itin my home system there are also little independent miners which i know i shouldnt have a conscious in eve but i feel bad when i strip the belts they dont have the logistics to easily move the ore basically no haulers so i figure i would mine in the aforementioned neighboring system though maybe i should try and steal them from their current corporations only problem is even with just two hulks pumping out 5400m3 every 141secs i know my orca pilot isnt maxed each i can just keep up with them with my itty rigged v but then again i do have built in lag due to my satellite internet now if i were to put a small pos in system then freighter out the raw ore that could work but after 46 hulks even then i dont think i could keep up so ill more than likely have that person start training for an orcabut i had this idea for an ore sized industrial p and proposed it for better worst and maybe with the devs hopes of more people moving to 00 with dominion more stations will come too and this idea will be completely irrelevantedit i hate using gscs too but put them in because the inevitable troll would be like noes it holds mores noob just use gscs
i think the balance is in the ore only hold i like the idea of it being larger but i am thinking 300km3 would be more reasonable with no jump capability it is still a mean little ship for its purpose it would also make ore hauling in highsec a bit easier which is always a nice thing since not being able to move the stuff is one of the major problems with the pricei would keep the highslots at 3 but give it a bonus to shield repping instead of the mindlink bonus keep the tractor bonus as it is so all in all a few curbs on the size to help with getting it past the csm and the devs otherwise the tank is reasonable in highsec it should act both as a support for highsec mining ops and as a ore freighter so its tank should be somewhere at about half of a highsec freighter is capable of since it has about half or a third per my suggestion the storage space in null it gives a ninja mining op the endurance it needs if it does not have rorq support and if it does it gives them an easier method of moving the ore while in system to the rorq without the bonus from the orca itself being lost during warp the only question is who is going to go through the extra training needed to make an orca the awesomeness that it is but then end up a large glorified industrial
okay so maybe 10 per level like i originally posted in the fid forum that would give it 375k m3 a nice size it might not be uber popular like the orca is because you are just an industrial pilot but hey think of all the miners out there who train a second account to haul for them they tend to bring them to mining ops as well now if only 14 or even 18th would bring one of these bad boys the others could train their alts up to be hulk pilots too and more people mining is more money in the corporations pocket and more security less time spent in one placei wonder if a devgm can correct me if im wrong on this but the whole freighter needing an online posstation to move things in and out of its cargo hold isnt a matter of being antimining but there where other reasons at the time pos issues if i remember correctly so this ship might be a way around thatthose issues given the new hold specific mechanics we could have an ore freighter of sorts like i said if ccp does have a problem with this can wei get a response to thisedit seplilng

lots of missile threads recently dont see any about defendersa fix in two parts1 alter defender ai so they target objects like fof missiles do only restricted to missiles from hostile flagged ships prioritize missiles fired by a locked ship that the defender launcher is activated on like fof does2 introduce tiered defender launchers and defender missiles much like normal missiles have light frigate assault and medium cruiserbc and siege and heavy bs launchers split defenders into appropriate ammo for each launcher light medium and heavy defender missiles with different base damages alter missile hp so defenders of the same class are at least 11 effective without bcs modifiersresult sensible defender behaviorwith autofire no more rocket launchers used on bs for defenders a reason to split up your missile weapon groups since theoretically the blast from a single defender might do enough hp damage to take out multiple incoming grouped missilesdiscusskrum
i would like more launchers that works like cap boosters they join more missiles in a single fight so you have defender launcher 1 that launch a single defender missile and can be fitted in a small high defender launcher 5 that launch a group of five defender missiles and can still put in a small high but with a fifth of total rounds before recharging obv defender missiles 10 up to 20 in mid high and so on for bigger flights of defenders that can take down enemy missiles with more hp and grouped in larger numbers
yes because what missiles need is even more ability to have the damage reduced with no counter why stop at smartbombs burners and defenders at mediumlong range yes lets finish the job with autofiring defenders that work at short rangenot supported
the only changes id like to see with defenders are as followsa slow them down by half currently their insane speed makes them overshoot the target anything within 20km wont be touchedb a dedicated launcher higher ammo volume rocket launcher rate of fire 2 to 3 seconds this will mitigate some incoming damage but only marginally effective against small salvos but not entire volleysc automatic launch once the bay has been activatedd fleet screen they target any missile fired at any ally in the pilots fleet this will lessen the likelihood of canceling a large degree of incoming damage as the defenders will strike randomly at incoming missiles and might not offer any protection whatsoever to the screening ship
not supportedim a terribly timid carebear with zilch for pvp skills and even less interest i like to mine ore make stuff sell stuff and do a little missioning for a change of pacebut i understand that the tradeoff for my personal playstyle is that some of the most profitable and challenging pve experiences  such as level 5 missions  are unavailable to meop needs to make a choice  either accept the risk of missioning in lowsec or accept the fact that hes advanced as far as his personal playstyle permits and find something else to doits a big game with plenty of options but if you choose to put some options offlimits to yourself thats your own personal choice and not a reason to redesign the game

guys you know ccp have said that they most likely wont do this because of the whole platformnevertheless if the launcher would reset the client and autoinset the password it could worksupported anyways but i think its unlikely that it will happen

i dont know maybe by looking at the explosion radius and velocity of t2 ragefury missiles and comparing them to ships of the class that fire them and i believe its been mentioned by the devs a couple of times just the same reason i wouldnt expect to use void l against similar sized vessels or ever lol because of the terrible tracking all you missile martyrs are constantly sounding hard done by because of explosion velocity and radius how often do turret users complain about falloff and tracking if anything you should be glad that all your t2 ammo is useful across all spectrumsyou have these limitations turrets have their own you say missiles arent viable in long range battles dont use them then or find a different role within the fleet for your missiles protip there are plenty
i dont see how the tempest is a mixed slot ship it has a double projectile bonus 6 turrets 4 launchers and a raven has launcher bonuses 6 launcher 4 turrets so is the raven a mixed slot ship toomissiles have a module to enhance damage its called a target painter last thing i want is another damn module needed to make missiles actually apply damage to things its rough enough as it is
missiles are fine not supported
omg yes please
indeed
so simple yet so much less annoyance

i never have been to a wormhole so far but i heard of the sleeper drones which are suppose to be guarding humans who split from society long ago why not let the next expansion be the awakening where the 5 race wakes up in a first step part of high sec could be claimed by the 5th race which is essential if you want to start with this race also t3 frigs would be introduced and some t3 itemsat first it could be a small group so not the full t3 line need to be introduced later awakenings expansions in whs could lead to the creation of just one stable wh which leads to the other groups owning some systems in a wh this could be 45 high sec systems in wh so the can not be claimedlater on further t3 ships can be introduced
please flesh it out a bit more than new racenew shipsnew stuffterrible iea
i dont think you have nearly any idea how much work this would beif ccp diverted all resources to such a project it would probably still take over a year to complete at leastin addition this new race would be pretty pointless  why would a 80m sp amarr toon want to reroll new race guns and ship skills
sorry i am not so deep into the background stories i certainly wont write a whole essay about just an idea why dont you participate and help to make i great idea instead of just calling it terriblei mean t3 ships where already introduced i dare say that the next t3 ship class wont be introduced so very far in the future but maybe in summer or in a year maybe my idea is to much bound to the background storydidnt you learn new skills for the t3 cruiser you dont have to learn the other race skills as an amarr toon you are not learning caldari either or do you if yes learning more skills wont be difficult the work for this would be exactly the one new ship class t3 frig and x t3 items taking couple of systems and change the factionit would be an effort certainly i may be wrong but your statement sound like that you are fine with the 80mil sp and this status and dont want to put further effort in developing your char
becouse its your idea and as you reported it its terriblewhen you will have a complete idea thats not terrible write it therewriting something so vague thats basically i want stuff that do stuff with stuff and a few stuff its not an idea
where is the rule that an idea has to have 3000 words or 1000 or whatever an idea can be to use corn oil instead of gas i dont have to give you a blueprint how the motor need to look like for thisso either participate by bringing counter arguments based on the info and about the info you have or stop trolling around
unfortunately theyre not trollingbarely fleshed out ideas like this belong in the features and ideas forum not in the assembly hall
thisit is getting really annoying that people throw half baked stuff in and blame others when they challenge the ideas
this idea does failit makes more sense to add depth to what already exists than to add something newthere are 5 pirates factions 4 empire factions 1 nonempire faction and rogue drones all of which can add more content to the gamei must observe that ops first reaction to eve seems to be lets add more stuff eve has a shtton of stuff i dont know what else to sayt3 modules and frigs will probably come in time as well as more t2 modules who knows
this is interesting i saw my idea to be a deepening of the already introduced whs and t3 stuff i mean arent the sleeper drones supposed to be the guardians of some cryosleeping humansyou are right eve has alot of stuff but whs and t3 was introduced already so why not deepening it
your idea is like youve come up with a title to the book but your expecting everyone else to come up with the contents of said bookstupid ridiculousand wholly egotisticalepic failnot supportingps and talking about something you know nothing about is just adding insult to injury get your arse into wormhole space and explore a bit and you just might get inspired
i want to be a freaking rogue drone it could happen the ships already kinda exist replace pod with mind core ai and give them a slice of drone space that suddenly becomes intelligent enough to ask for membership to empirenot that its going to happen balancing the 4 races is already enough of a nightmare and honestly drones tank like well garbage cans but maybe just maybe something like that could happen in a few years honestly its more likely than the jove becoming a playable race
well if you look at the research skillbooks youll see all sorts of funny names you dont see much in eve this is because roughly each faction has a progenitor terran original earthen settlers in new eden race they all eventually die out read return to the dark ages with the exception of the jovians who are dying out anywaysits already been established that the sleepers as in the race have died out and what you see in wormhole space is the mechanical systems living on even after their creators have died outthe reason that i say your idea fails is because you havent really brought any fresh idea to the tablethat being said i dont think a new race is necessary there is enough food for intrigue and politics at the moment a new race would only be necessary when all the current plot arcs in npc space go stale which is probably when the jovians will rear their ugly bulbous headspersonally i like to believe that jamyl sarum is a sanshas nation plant
im going to have to jump in with the chorus on this one your idea is too vague to possibly be taken anywhere this isnt lets use corn oil instead of gas this is lets save the planet man great sentiment zero substance
the idea need to have a goal and a description the bigger the idea the more details needed for something like move this button to the left plz so i dont miss click it would be enough for something as massive as creating a new race thats creating 25 more content there needs to be a very good reason since i fail to see any i do not support
t3 cruisers have a role or somethingwhat i am saying iswhy would anyone who has specialized in one race want to switch to this new one thus wasting all sp youve spent in your current races ships and modsif you have specialized yourself as an amarr battleship pilot what is the reason you would go reroll caldari bs for exampleobviously if you are maxxed vs you might find new ships to train for interesting but realistically you wont really become better if you switch to caldari thats the theory anyways this only works when a thing called balance is applied but making the new race completely opup would just help out new pilots and not do much elsei am aware that ccp  balance  rofl lol but i dont find it relevant
cross training other races has multiple reasons greater variety of ships to choose from can come in handy if you just lost your zealot and can jump into eg muninn right away pirate faction ships usually require 2 races amarrcaldari eg would open up the sansha line up who wouldnt want to have a nightmare
i think it would be great to have some kind of basic help in fiting ships ingame we are all using one well known program out of game but maybe it is time to implement it ingamethanks
not supportedother than the lack of said tools eft is not the only one on the mac side the pc users need only alt tab to where they need to go some work inside the igbnot needing to put unnecessary load on ccp for something already perfected outofgame
drake draconisother than the lack of said tools eft is not the only one on the mac side the pc users need only alt tab to where they need to go some work inside the igbnot needing to put unnecessary load on ccp for something already perfected outofgamei dont think soi agree with the idea but i think the objective is not to implement eft or others free based eve programs anyway the possibility ingame of testing fittings before buying the items will be nicei dont think it will be a source of lag it can be done for example in station only and calculated by the customer computer
i would rather ccp focus on bugs and less on new content feel free to get to the back of the line behind the pilots carrying pitchforks
well here is my opinion if you want to improve ingame fitting windows sure if you want to add something that serves the purpose of eft it would be nice to have but isnt essential sure it would be nice to have just like the browser and jukebox updates we got and probably should be done someday yes true there are issues like the lag that have way higher priority
i didnt say it was a bad idea just that its not earth shattering
preface anchoring modules to posses is boring repetitive and timeconsuming a cynojammer deathstarpos can easily have over 100 modules with about 3min anchor and online timersabstract for example the capsuleer could spend fifteen minutes inserting multiple anchoring commands into a queue and then go do something fun while the pos would carry out the queued commandsby command i mean any of the four commands that can be given to a pos module anchor online unanchor and offlinethe current implementation works as follows when a capsuleer gives the pos a command and the pos is already carrying out another command the capsuleer is notified of this and the new command failsthe new command queue would work like this when a capsuleer gives the pos a command and the pos is already carrying out another command the capsuleer is notified of this and asked if hed like to insert the command into the queue whenever a pos completes a command it would fetch the next command from the queue and start doing that the pos management screen would have a new tab for the command queue where the capsuleer could view and remove queued commands and change their order
yes anything to make working with poses more friendlythat being said the whole pos management no the whole pos system needs to be reworked from the ground up
pos templates are what we need  theyll work a bit like an outpost egg  you drop the pos and all the modules and fuel and what have you into a container which well call a pos egg then you pres butan then you guard the egg while it onlines the modules or you dont guard it and someone comes along and pops the egg before it finishes onlining everything vovi have no problems with a pos taking several hours to online properly thats a reasonable consideration given the difficulty of dislodging a properly setup deathstar but it shouldnt be so boring either allow for some automation or implement a quicktime events minigame where we have to press coloured buttons in order to finish onlining the pos
supportedpos deployment has to be the most unneccessarily boring and repetitive and annoying and time consuming task in this game any kind of queue or automation andor template or something could only be an improvement
im pretty sure this has already been raised its desperately needed of course but no point asking for it twice
i do agree no need to ask for a same thing twiceid very much appreciate if anyone could provide link to any similar proposal
yes pos management is atrocioustry running refinery arrays 3 input  1 output silo for a polymer refinery thats 5 structures per refining cycle that need to be taken offline if youre switching polymer output at 3 minutes to online eachand thats nothing to having to anchor them 20 minutes perpos need to be taken back to the drawingboard and redesigned from the ground up throwing out the old code that was never intended for this degree of stupidity
couldnt find anything similar at evelopedia sono supportif at all id go with diana devils idea of pos templates but this wasnt proposed
numerous threads have been brought forward on the pos issue and every csm thus far has brought it up with ccpthe problem lies with the fact that the person who was behind the majority of the pos code is no longer employed by ccp and theyre terrified to touch ittheyre not about to attempt a complete revamp from the ground up because of the insane issues it would cause trying to have both systems in place until everyone shifts to the new designlook up some of the threadnaughts on the issue there are many that dead old horse should have been reduced to a smear years ago
csm1 and csm2 arent generally on evelopedia the only site i know that had them was a wiki on ankhs personal website but either ive forgotten the url or she took it down one of these days ill get monumentally bored and wikify all the old meeting minutes but for now ill just rest on it being a suspicion
it was csm 3 the article can be found here
applying my first bump for bumps sake
detailed information such as why it would be necessary to have a new api key introduced only for this specific purpose while the current limited api key already allows access to this information stuff like thisas it is now youre simply asking ccp to support your ingame business idea which you certainly would be able to implement using the information available as given today
with oauth they could have multiple scopesthe user could approve access for a 3rd party to access certain scopes with a single clickin a safe and secure way with no need for messy public keyswithout an oauth api for opensocial apps and others to latch onto the coming social network is going to be a joke
well this is eminently balancedif you bid and never pay you lock up one of your contract slots you dont have very many to begin withthe other person can cancel the auction returning your isk and their item but you cannot cancel it as youre the one placing the bid and locking down their goodsonce the auction is complete and until the person claims their goods the person placing it should be able to cancel itgriefers wont be able to do anything to you if this were in place but you could cause scammers no end to grief if you put an item on auction and it gets locked down you can still cancel it and reissue if someone scams you then you just let it sit there until they cancel no isk out of your wallethowever one modification if a bid is placed and the auction left to hang for more than say 7 days or a user selectable period of time after completion of the auction cycle that bid is automatically retracted rolling the auction back to the next highest bid the buyer cannot retract a bid they just have to sit and wait for the automatic system to do so this to prevent people from purposely locking down auctions to cause grief
completely ridiculous
nocloakers are a feature of eve they gather intel and lower enemies morale this op perfect balance atm
i was not informed that 00 could be dangerous surely this is not intended i should be allowed to carebear in peace protected by instant infallible local

if you are unable to defend your space from such incursions then you dont deserve it
himy proposal  edited to add a delivery attached systema expand the market possibilities and bring players owned shops to stabilize the market 1 the actual market system is very good but the corps and ally need an opportunity for fidelisation 2 its done by forum for now but an ingame system can be a benefit for all players 3 shops is a solution to improve politic systems and sovereignityb how make a store system without destroying the actual market system  1 the market will not change itself but players will have opportunity to open stores in the stations by giving isk to the owner in exchange there can be a diminution of taxesexample  i want to open a store in a not much populatedsystem  i pay to the owner of the station some isk for example 5m a month i now have a store open in this station were people can see offers the owner of the station both npcs or player copr doesnt matter give me a lower tax rate for items i sell in this place theyre interested in gaining a good amount of money for the month i m interested of making more profit on sellings or just sell items lower than others and still making profit 2 the possibility to create shopping items like contracts but sold in the store eventually it could replace the actual contract system but it will need another proposal i mnot into destroy the actual system just wanna give a new tool to help corpsexample  i have a store in a system with lot of miners i can sell special fits like a contract but its on the store to encourage players using my store and not buying on regular market i have some options first the guy can afford the fit in the same station he gain lots of time second i can use a system that give some reduction for a fidel customer like with a system of points giving reductions in future transactions c how it can improve the sovereignity system 1 with the appearence of the new sov system and improving owned stations it will be a new way of making money for the owner of the system and also a good way to keep players in the systemexample  a corporationally get the control of a system they begin to populate the system with little corporations and they want to keep them in place and protectedthen if some corporation create store in there stations there will be some good things like an alternate market with more products at low prices an improvment in month taxes but less taxes on incoming transactionsa way to create their own stores and gve reduction for their friendsan opportunity to gain the control on the economy of their owned systemsa possibility of making some system with special economy like in making a real huge taxe on regular market transactions but low taxes on storesit leads us to a system that can bring the possibility for players to create their own economics systems with all goods and bad events their can be a crush on some systems you can try to make a system really attractive of make sure they cant have the goods in attacking the ships that bring stuff in the systems c store delivery system to improve the trade hauler proffession there can be an improvement on stores  the delivery system if you buy some offers there can be bought at the station or can be bought with some extraisk with a delivery contract it can be limited in time and the cost can be higher for long travels or dangerous onethe seller could choose not to use this but for thoose who wanna deliver their products there could be 2 ways 1 they deliver the product by their own members of course only corporations with frequent connected people could use this their can be a reduction for the buyer if the product is not deliver in time2 let the opportunity for others players to accept such delivery contracts with a collateral of course
anyone interestedif no i can close the subject
supported though itd need to be done right to prevent abuse basically bring back the old isd volunteer system but with a couple of changes 1 instead of new isdspecific characters use existing player characters for increased transparency2 give them a hall monitor badge like the csm members have in lieu of blue bars3 limit their powers to editingremovinglocking threads leave the bannings strictly in the hands of ccp employees although volunteers can submit recommendations for bans to ccpim tired of hammering the report button on everything i see what moderation there is is generally good they just need way more of it but under the existing system that means extra expense for ccp so volunteers should be recruited again to make up the differencedeath to posters ingameben
id like to moderate ccp forum moderators some of them cross the line
that
mob mentality ruins this ideaobvious fail idea is obvious
 i think this sums up why this would be a terrible idea though i bet zastrow is an incredibly nice person and all
please visit your user settings to reenable imagesi suggest that the capacitor display to revert to what it was before todays stealth update the new one is very dim and a is big strain to the eye if ccp think it look ok on their monitor and does not wish to change i suggest an alternative that every customers would be sent a similar monitor on their first paymentedit the gloss effect doesnt help either
what did you do to your computer man the before is how it looks for me now ive never seen anything like the now pic
whyd you put your computer in the koolaid
i only noticed a subtle difference in the cap display before and after dominion before was exactly like on the before image now the luminescent orange bars have ugly borders ie the alpha channel got screwed  replaced by a hard edge
due to all pos items being removed on the test serverwe are finding it difficult to test in deep 00 and whswe fully understand that these items where removed to stop tacticalinformation being used while testing but is it possible to leave thecorp hangers and ship maint arrayscurrently we can only test with the ships we are in at the time off the givenmirrorthank you

its not a technical proposal just a requestall moderns operating systems offers users accounts renaming since users are identified by their ids and not by their names i hope eve is not more complicated than that in the way users accounts are handleda lot of corporations and public agencies have regular account renaming policies for high security accounts thats not new and not unusualits just a security feature without any impact on the game mechanics
i too support the bashing of proposals without having read or understood themeve accounts do have an idaccounts get hacked even when the information was not shared in any way there are many ways this could happen you mention legal aspect but if in fact ccp refuses to offer basic security services like account renaming it might get legally held accountable for incidents improving account security and theres plenty of issues is in the interest of both players and ccp
it looks highly unlikely to me that they bruteforced passwords i hope ccp notices when someone tries thousands of different passes on an account
we talk about accounts named used in more than one service including eve even the eve account is used outside the game in multiple places  test server forum login account management login evelopedia login
during character login most of the clients chatwindow data is stored in clientside cached files and will always pop up when a character logs in be it local alliancechat player channels marketwindows fittingwindows or any other windowmy suggestion would be to add a bitvalue on windowstates when minimized so that a windowstate of minimized is stored clientside when logging off thus allowing the pilot to log back in to how heshe left the client during logoutforcing all windows into open state on login makes most pilots have to resort to start minimizing windows if they have a lot of them instead of going into direct playmode from their last stored session clientsidei know programmertime is scarse so as usual this is just a mere suggestion to increase functionality on a clients side while allowing players to get into action quicker not having to minimize all their channels
1 click the settings tab in the market window there is an option to automatically refresh market datai leave mine unchecked and dont have any issues if i need to refresh i do it manuallyno problem2 yes the lp store needs to have some changes to make it easier to use
no waypersonaly id rather see ghost training reintroduced but can live without it and understand the reasons for its removal real and fake
keep in mind they fly to iceland for the meeting between now and then
we do i was told to take a stroll pon a serious note you we are having a 4 days of meetings with ccp in between 2 meetings so the break is not as big as it seems
supported
make black ops the only type of vessel that can scan out another cloaker should make things more interesting ow and give the darn ship a covops cloak so it can move around in enemy space
isnt that always how it is they try to not make a solo pwn ship and instead they nerf the  out of a ship till no one ever wants to fly it and some races seem to get hit even worse than others
did this go anywhere
this is a good post and yes im aware of this too even the magic corp where the magic insurance money comes from probably few people cared to dig this deep thoughthis is not highly illogical in fact ill tell you a true story pandemic legion consisiting of corps snigg and nesw for this example says not to shoot their friends sot or else they will punish me i am a member of snigg and they insure 100 all of my ships i kill a sot member anyways pl punishes me and they kill my ship my corporation however doesnt care about all of that they still pay for my ship because that was the deal they made with me and because they have the right to distribute the isk to their corporation members as they see fittry studying national vs states rights in american history member states have the power to control a lot of their own decisions and provide their own programs and the national governement has no say in some cases makes perfect sense to menice try thoughas for all the other whines i highly suggest you try suicide ganking before you complain saying things like ive heard from some troll on cp that gaining sec status back is totally easy makes you look like a complete imbecile if there wasnt strict rules and punishment for suicide ganking discouraging such behavior high security space would be dead years ago you are just attacking one style of play because you are going emo about imaginary space ships on the internet get a grip it is working as intended as stated by ccp
i dont see how suicide ganking of miners or haulers can be called pvp or combat theyre attacking defenceless ships pretty pathetic reallynow ive never lost a ship to suicide ganking but i wonder what goes through the mind of a new player to eve one who has spent their first few weeksmonths mining away saving up for that hulk of their dreams never leaving hisec only to see it destroyed in an instant im sure ccp looses a few subscriptions over thishisec is supposed to be hisec if people can attack others when not at war without significant consequence and make a lot of isk from it to the detriment of others then theres an issue with the conceptsuicide ganking should be a tactic which costs the attacker not reward them
this change does make sense
if you gank someone your ship will be destroyed the insurance will cover it the security standing hit is fixed you will have to gain it back the only risk is whether you actually kill your target or they get away that is the primary reason you find gate camps with 40 plus kills in the same system in highsec by the same person the person being attacked is risking everything what is the point of recouping your losses when the only thing you have to look forward to is the next highsec gate campwhere is the balance
i agree with removing insurance for concord related events this has actually been promised by ccp in a devblog so if csm raises it again now with the insurance issues it may finally come to passfurthermore suiciding should not be refunded eitherdevblog where ccp fear promises removal of insurance in concord related events 
i fully support this proposalits really dumb to pay insurance on concord kills
currently suicide ganking is free and has no risksand in ccp own words everything in eve should have a riskthe system is broken and needs to be fixed  easiest way is remove allinsurance payouts for ships that are lost to concord  self destructionthen ccp go and fix the insurance ammounts
not even close  currently the system is broken you can suicide for free and only the targetloses no skill there whatsoeverremove insurance and make it an art maybe add a skill for example insurance fraud which give a chance for youto receive an insurance payout
guys guys ive got solution for insurance problemnerf mining and mission loot  mineral prices rise  insurance payout isnt greater then market ship price
okay this was dated december 3 2009
passed 7 for 2 against so id expect it to be on the agenda for the iceland meeting next  week
after reading the entire thread i agree with tagamis proposal conditionallyas a mission runner myself i am curious as to how this would affect the pve aspects of the game oddly enough i actually fly a rohk most of the time because i like how it looks and tanks plus i havent fired a missile since they removed missile aoe back in like 05 casual gamer so i could care less about optimal incometime ratios sometimes people forget that they are playing for fun and all anywayswouldnt this seriously impact the mission community in terms of the dps output of gallante battleship bc destroyer and cruiser hulls not that seeing fewer ravens would bother me but the unintended side effect of this could be even more farming wouldnt this push the kronos in a league of its own while the other marauders would get left behind the vargur already plays little role in the game at all though i enjoy flying it as well the bonuss may need to be ship specific to avoid an unintended overpowering of ships used for different purposesexcellent work so far though
quick answer golem does 900k dps siege out to 45km drones included kronos does 760dps 425mm  3630 km drones includedso a railgun damage increase by 15 will take kronos to 875 i dont think that will make it the new fotm golem will still be the best
also where pve is concerned missiles and drones will always rule without very large damage bonuses being applied to other weapons systems simply due to the importance of being able to pick damage types a 1200 dps railboat  for example  would be quite fun fighting against guristas but would find itself suffering greatly against sansha due to only half of its damage having much of an effect
sounds reasonable enough to me i would imagine the advantages even themselves out between defender missiles and tracking speed
before someone pipes up and says but the kronos is a blaster shipwith blasters fitted on the kronos you have to use null 2 tracking computers optimal and 2 tracking enhancers to get 17km33km for range kill the computers and you have 15km26km either way null does 948 dps with 2 mag stabs at optimal and you have no option for longer range void can get you up to 1123 dps but at a massive range of 88km10kmthe golem rolls in with rage torps and 2 ballistic controls at 27km and 1098 dps additionally it has the ability to swap for range giving it 45km with 819 dpsand this is all without bringing the paladin in to make everyone else feel inadequate
yeah but you really dont want to use a blaster fitted ship in missions since many ships will orbit outside the range of your gunsthe disparity between the marauders is another debate entirely and since i dont really pvp i dont really get involved with that side of the discussion my main concern is that pvp centric players really only care about the isk generated by mission runners and not the balancing issues that could greatly effect that economy by accident and create more threadnaughts whining about mission runnersmarauders are a tricky beast though since they seem to be built for pve but can be employed with great effectiveness in pvp as wellif your willing to risk that kind of isk most mission runners have moved or want to move into marauders or command bcs for obvious reasons and i dont see any issues with the rail boost for rail fit bcs of any type they will still lag far behind the alternatives strategic cruisers are also making a big dent as i have been told the caldari one is better at pve than a golem though i doubt that
this is incorrect my golem has twice the dps and ehps of my tengu the tengus superiority is it can be fit for running missions in low sec but these are missile ships were talking about how wimpy rail ships are in this thread
like was said abovegive it a minimum time per drone that grows based on damage to a drone including shield damage and cost just like youre doing it in a station isk wiseright click on carrier and choose repair drones might need a configure drone repair selection when you can choose to if you want fighters first or another type of dronethen it just goes through the drones on board and starts repairing the first one it finds thats damaged this way there is no storage place needed at all and nothing but code need added to the ships no extra bay or anythingwould need some type of indicator in the drone lists that shows which drone is being repaired and how long it has leftalso drones being repaired cant be launched no brainerdifference between a carrier and a super carriercarriers can do one drone at a timesuper carriers can do three at a timeif you wanted to you could tie it into a couple skills toodrone repair  one additional drone repaired per level in addition to base amountdrone repair reduction  5 per level reduction in drone repair duration base time of whatever base time is decided still appliesjust my two cents
not supportedit would make carriers too much selfsustainable there are all kinds of rr mods in all kinds of sizes to repair drones
agree its a stupid ship bonus 5 bonus to missile damage per level is what it should be caldari will be able to use more then one type of missile for a change
and the lesson from this thread dont argue with idiots they will only drag you down to their level and beat you
full support
what is going on ccp why isnt this problem fixed yet i just checked how long ago it was when i first had a post with this problem 130309whats the point having nice graphics if the sound sucks shield hardeners are to loud missile sound cuts in and out and now i have no targeting soundto leave something for so long just shows how little you care about the eve communityjust fix it
sounds fair
done and added a small additional information on how multiple keys are handlededit doh i should ofcourse support my own proposal not that it matters i guess its not counted anyway
multiple keys are generated and each of them have different accesslevels and being tagged with whatever you want to name them for future reference
pray tell what is this maximum income i assume you intend to imply it is low enough that the cost a 30mil clone would be problematic for a player who achieved this limit
it is affordable the issue is players with about 30m sp have access to the exact same isk making mechanics as 120m sp characters they have the ability to make the same isk per hour as a player with 120m sp but there is a dramatic difference in the cost of the clones for the two at about 50m sp a player can have the same capabilities as a 150m sp player with their choice of racial ships the only difference is how many other races of ships the higher level player can also fly with perfect skills the dramatic differences in capabilities and income happen early on up to about 4050m sp the dramatic change in clone cost should follow that same trend i should be paying the same for my clone as someone with 150m sp whatever the clone price the difference after about 50m sp is how many shiny things are in the hangar
teen rating belongs to hello kitty online or somethingif someone is bothered about my character being rude towards them they can pretty much go stick their tongue in dark places or just push block button
if anything ppl should get banned faster for swearing and smack talk theres enough filth on the internet as it is and though i enjoy part of that filth and even add to it i dont think it needs to be part of eve
well this wouldnt change the process of transferring a character via the web site at all so the person doing the transfer still needs the account name of the person receiving the character unfortunately this is still the ccp approved method but this doesnt affect that process so it doesnt make it more risky all the magic happens on ccps server end between when you relinquish your character and when the new owner takes possession so its completely out of anyones hands and not subject to any 3rd party intervention
i really pray that they get this done in the next expansion hate to compair but stobpother upcomingnew space games are just making me sad at eve effects the planets and moons were a nice step but we really need to go further
i would love to see all these changes
i think 375k is perfectly acceptable i still think the jump capability is a bit much what do you think
well the way i see it if you take away its jump capability you would have to reduce its cost by a factor of at least 2 maybe something around what an orca costs right now the reason being no one would dare take it into 00 as it would be popped at the first gate campwhereas if you keep it jump capable you give it the ability to survive those kinds of traps how about give it a range slightly larger than that of a black ops that would still provide risk with every extra cyno you have to light to get it through neutralnpc space as it travels to and from empirei like the idea of it costing as much if not more than a rorqual because it is tech2 most industrially minded tech 2 ships cost between 5 and 10 times their t1 versionswith the jf you of course give up cargo space for the ability to bypass camps transports give a whole host of benefits over their t1 counter partsalso the price and it being tech 2 aka crap insurance is the only way i see to keep it from being used by isk farmersmarcos with less than 250k ehp you can still gank it pretty easy with cheap fit torp ravens but like i said without it being jumpable i dont know how to justify a 1 billion price tag without jacking the ore bay to an ungodly level

no do we realy need a aml cerb switching to defenders and negating the entire missial dps of a blob 100km no thankyou
i can see the pros and cons of both arguements made here and one thing is for sure there does need to be some changes to the defenders to make them a viable option for defencive purposes as they are the missles do over shoot their target but are so fast they quickly catch up what if like to see is defenders capable of stopping the likes of cruise missles a heavy defender missle variant with slower speed as for the blob issue bring back mines and im sure blobs wont be getting dropped every 5 seconds but i would like to see a diversion for missles too i personally dont use missles as im gallente so im blaster orientated but would be sneaky if they created a missle that when its about to be struck by a defender splits into 3
no missiles already get low paper dps and thats before you factor in the explosion radius and velocity now you just added a tool thats easy to train for and will almost completely erase all damage missiles do without any real work on the pilots partcome on people missiles are ok the way they are and really dont need any fixing
you are confused missiles have solid dps they are also more capable of dealing with smallerclass ships than most other weapons systems their drawback is the launchtostrike lag honestly i dont think defenders are lacking in general they rarely blow up incoming missiles  either the missiles are too fast or they take multiple defenders to destroy and defenders are too dumb to hit the same missilei like the ops idea it would require some serious balancing work thoughedit supporting the idea
ok so who will pay for all these authenticators  you or ccp make it optional so people can buy them on their own also make them a reasonable price at most 7 dollarsalso heck offer them up as prizes and such for contests would be awesome in my book as well
mr professional needs two edits for one sentence cool you should know this already but you can get around security that limits by ip address it is hard but we are talking about super hackers who are apparently hacking machines at will by users that have everything up to date and never click on a bad link or download something suspicious and use strong passwordsalso you must think about the enormous headache this will cause on ccp by what you ask by the people who tick this limit ip option on and have no idea what they are doing and log on at a different computer and can no longer log on even worse will be the people who think they know what they are doing with limiting their ip and wont be able to log on and go crazyim just happy people are wanting the option to be optional and not mandatory that was what the earlier threads were all about and a small victory is better than nothing authenticators even though they can be defeated are good for personal security but having to pay for account security because ccp fails is not cool id rather have account security for everybody rather than having to pay more money to more corporations for something that cannot guarantee security but hey that is just mestill supporting this proposal

no further argumentation needed
as long as this would fix the pos standing bug as well it is never fun to lose a ship to a friendly pos  almost lost a carrier that way once
a thumbs up for one of my ideas
i told you i just question half baked ideas or point out flaws nothing like that found here so thumbs up 
oh my good please stop this missiles are fine and the way they work dont need to changed now larkonis was so nice to tell you missile lovers that there are plenty more roles in pvp than just long range now im going to be nice and post a link a second time this time please have a look at it and if missiles are so terrible in pvp explain to why i se a lot of missile boats as top damage dealer andor final blow on kill mails
you should start thinking in solutions rather than in troll phrasesi would support this if it included a way to make defenders useful for example the introduction of a fastrof high cpu low pg defender launcher that would be reasonably effective against incoming slow missiles hams and above and ineffective against heavy missiles and below but would also require a decent amount of skilling to train for
it hinders are abilities to quickly change ships when a fight is coming or in the middle of a fight more so when dual or tri accounting cause you may be switching screens imo it should have come with the ignore option in the first place

this doesnt change the fact that ccp will most likely not start working on a new race within the next 2 years i think you people greatly underestimate the work thats involved in making a racei just dont see any reason ccp should give themselves even more of a pain that is balance than they currently have 
i never said i want a new race or so i just answered your argument that cross training is uselessbesides  according to the fanfest presentation  they might open up jove this year or the year after
if i stated it in such a way that crosstraining would be useless then that was a wrong way of expressing itwhat i meant was  why would a skilled pilot chose to fly this new race instead of sticking to what he can fly currentlythe only answer i can think of is for the lulz
this doesnt belong herebutan epix expansion where sleeper and jove ships skills and mods are introduces would be niiiiiiiice
it would make more sense to roll out some of the minor factions as playable races they would be more on par with the existing races i mean the sleepers seem to be a group on par with the jove sorry to say but i doubt the sleepers or the jove will ever be a playable race simply because they are conceptualized as far superior races whose interaction with the other races is more akin to toying with them to make them playable would be to make them lesser new characters would start with less skills than existing players or equal to the other races

i support this lock
this not supportedand even if it would be implemented what exact kind of help do you expect from this toolehp a fairly usable cap strain time resistances and repair rates are already displayed in the current fitting window all that is currently missing is dps and the ability to deactivate modules to see their effects written in numbers
i expect help in making fits in game now you have to go to the info tab and look how much cpu and pg module takes with eft in game it would be much more simple
why dont you ask the eft team to implement a local
what should be done is removal of whole sbu mechanics
sbus should be replaced with occupancy based on players killed within the system maybe the higher of player ship kills flags vulnerability
i believe the concept behind aggression timers is very sound and i generally like the way it work im sure many will have additional comments my personal frustration is with the message that appears in the top left cornerif you agress someone in low sec you rightly get global criminal flag the message appears in the top left hand corner of the screen counting down from 15 minutesif you dock or change system  your gcc timer gets reset to 15 minutes however the message in the top left of the screen does not therefore its very easy to think your gcc has finished when it actually hasnt for me either make the message show the correct time or dont show one at all to exacerbate this issue the warning message you get on undock if you have agression is related to whatever timer display the message on screen normally when you undock you receive a warning message telling you the you have an aggression timer running however in this scenario you get no warning on undockonly when the station sentries start firing
i recently posted a proposal that tried to collate all of the concerns listed so far about poses and came up with the best solution i could find its not perfect but i welcome any suggestions to improve it you can view it heredepotsi currently manage a pos with my alt and desire desperately for this to be worked out if done right the need for a queue should be eliminated especially now that poses have been removed from sovereignty mechanics
yes poses definedly need some work they are boring to set up they are boring and way too complicated to fuel yay for them needing nearly million different kinds of fuel all burning at different rates and taking different amounts of space boring to use flying to the different mods boring to shoot and boring to take down
proposal for enhanced api management and multiple keys for several accesslevels would replace this request 
one of the proposals voted on by csm 3  a solution to macrohaulers  received unanimous support among both the csm and player base and was ostensibly taken to ccp for discussion however no mention of the issue or ccps response is made in the minutes of the relevant csmccp meeting and macro haulers remain abundant in numerous lowsec systems clogging up local and the overview and feeding the rmt demonwould the members of csm 4 be willing to reraise this issue or otherwise examine how it has been followed up in their forthcoming meeting with ccp
as has been pointed out several times part of the meeting in iceland is reviewing all previous csm discussions and the statelack of progress on them there is no reason to reraise it

this dont really care about the resist but the rest it seems so obvious
this is a sensible request that doesnt reward illegal activity and id like to support it but i will however admit that accidents do happenive webbed a freighter before with one of my alts forgetting that he was in a different corp i only lost a dessy but essentially mistakes happen and this mistake brought concord i would have been extremely mad had it been a bs and my only solace would have be that it most likely would be insured hi sec war decs happen and an accidental clicks on a frigs undocking the same time your war target does could mean concord comes how frustrating would it be to lose your bs and possible a battle and on top of that not get paid out through insurance i say frig because even if you limit it to when the nongriefer losses a ship you rule out the above insta popping of a neutral frigits definitely a fair idea at heart but the butterfly effect is just to big yes getting ganked sucks but its all apart of eve the lag on a petition response would only grow if insurance was added into the mixax
thing is after the first or second incidents your gonna learn to check before you click for surei honestly have no qualms with that
and you got these facts where i would say 50 is a bit high as law enforcement still solves cases that are considered cold then there are the percent they know who did it and they fled to somewhere the us cant get them or are searching for themactually thats a good idea maybe when you gank someone your sec status should drop to 10 for 48 hours and make you stay in lowsec or a station as the law is still looking for you or maybe if you get caught you should be jailed for a few months play time depending on the crime and the amount of stuff stolen i mean lets put a real life twist on it since you want to do that so badlyall i hear from you is cryingyou admit youre a ganker thus we know you know how to gank you do not go after those low key targets you wait for that juicy fat paycheck to come rolling by and gank it instant payday with no loss as you get paid back for you ship plus what you scored in lootmost of us know how it works and have seen it done or have done it before ourselvesthe way i see it right now and how insurce is paid out for gankers is like having your insurance company come out to your brand new car and torch it and hand you a check for it and say thanks call us when you get your new car and rack up a few hundred milesmost not all suicide gankers and whining little kids who cant hack it in low sec or null space so prey on the helpless a friend of mine got popped by some and got a new ship he was on his way back when he ran across the fools who popped him he proceeded to space them all and all they did was complain because they were in shuttles and it was unfairyou sir need to go get a real life and stop cryingwrong t1 ship insurance prices are base loosely around mineral prices this is why most gankers use t1 and not t2 or t3
i support this inquirysince i came back to eve from a 3 year break i see suicide ganks all over the place its just insane whats happening here and actually it is rediculousif you rob a bank and police shots and ruins your car the insurrance company wouldnt pay for it eitheri mean we are at the point where even without ganking people make money from blowing up their ships insurrance fraudplease adjust proper concord action and please remove insurance payouts for suicide gankers
eve epic failure 327 suicide ganking and getting insurance payout for itdefinitely supported suicide ganking is a crime like any other within eve only difference is that ccp rewards this type of crime with insurance payouts what is ridicoulus please ccp do something about it
heres an ideadont fly a 200 mil mining ship at all if u cant handle the risk of that much afk income use a covetorits an inconvenience nothing more if its too much to lose for u dont fly what u cant afford to lose sound familiar its only high sec not complete secdont get caught and u wont lose it the only ppl who lose their cargo r the ones who r too stupid to adaptif thats the way u see it then u need to get outside sometime cause this isnt reality1 and what do the 10 blobs infesting low sec and 00 qualify as2 gotta love those killrights huh why dont u follow your friends example next time then3 refer to previous quote reply
if youre going to gank me then gank me if you are going to gank sombeody else then gank somebody else but giving them a refund for the ship they used and the lootcargo is as stupid as smelling a carton of milk to see if it is bad when you areadly know that it is
u mad
u gonna elaborate troll
herrs argument fails because we have seen that increased suicide ganking doesnt impact mineral production enough the reasons are because most of the production is outside hisec or isnt made transportable and gankable enough to disruptsuicide ganking is just preying upon one class of ships that cant actively respond with little risk to the ganker if you dont want to change insurance boost the tier 1 industrials and mining barges to have a chance to withstand or escape it before concord arrives
the sec status loss is completely trivial only few hours of ratting in 00 with a stealth bomber can fix that with relatively low risk as im sure every active suicideganker knowsi wonder what would happen if the security status wasnt affected by npc kills but you would only gain it by killing player pirates would make really difficult to pirates reenter high sec and force them to turn more on each other i guess perhaps it would also force them to use alts in getting back the sec status instead of just going for the npc rats by having an alt to become criminal then podding him repeatedly would probably cause lots of tears among the sunday pirates and suicide gankers disclaimer im not suggesting this to be implemented just wondering what would happenalso the problem with kill rights is that theyre broken they dont extend to the corpmates so youre all alone against probably a competent pvp pilot cant hire bounty hunter to do the dirty work either the problem with kill rights relates more to the lack of mechanics that would allow proper bounty hunting rather than suicide gankingpiratism in general so in practice kill rights are rarely excecutedin the end the problem with insurance isnt just that its paid to concorded ships it goes much deeper than that fixing it would probably require at least complete insurance overhaul to include economical risk in suicideganking viable system for bounty hunters to operate to give victims some way to get back to their assailants and some kind of fix to the huge mineral faucet of missionloot to make staying in high sec less profitable all of these have been suggested in various forms and implementing the fixes in some form would probably balance the high sec a lot i cant see it happening very soon though
which equates to effort on the ganker to do so in fact more effort than afk mining or using a lowend hauler instead of training for a better onepirates corpmates and their alts in crime would just kill each other in rookie ships repeatedly which would be a lot faster than ratting 1 if the kill rights were extended that way and the victim was in an npc corp everyone in it would have kill rights on him meaning he could be killed roughly 500 times for 1 gank as amusing as that would be it would most likely discourage player corps that dont have remotely as many ppl2 yes bounty system sucks
and this has what to do with the price of beans who cares if someone loses something to a gank squad the point is that gank squad shouldnt get paid insurance for doing something criminalconcord is part of the alliance that pays insurance got it good so theyre blowing you up and then paying you for it same this as i described00 lowsec and whole space has nothing to do with what were talking about here never once did i said i was tired of getting ganked or anything like that i wasnt the one complaining about reality get your facts right you fail terribly at every single reply in this post go troll somewhere else mkayas another though from seeing the post two spots up before the troll post right above mine maybe if you gank in hisec your sec status should be frozen from improving for a certain amount of time  a couple weeks or so  when you get popped by concord kind of like being thrown in jail
yes please both effects would be nice
absolutely right if we want to do a fair comparison we should use a paladin turret ship and armor tank like the kronos can anyone provide a cookie cutter fit for a paladin i really have not ever tried to fit one and i will take the suggestions of people more experienced in it than methen we can compare how a rail kronos vs a beam paladin performsdont forget this is a thread about boosting railguns
the big difference between kronos and golem is that the golem can select the damage it do the kronos cantso even if the kronos get approximately the same damage of a golem it is outperformed by it in missions against enemies that arent kintherm weaksimilarly the paladin do only emtherm so the golem outperform it when the targets are vulnerable to kinetic or explosive attacks so mission wise a buff to railguns would help missioners against part of the enemies leaving the golem still ahead if you cant cherry pick your missions as lasers and hybrids do split damage you need target with low resists to two kind of damage to reach the same efficiency of the golem that can concentrate his damage against the lowest resist of the enemyagainst sleepers the situation can be different

its not fair to compare the ships using tachyons and 425mms tachyons require so much more pg and the real equivalence is mega beams anyway so to do the comparison i used a paladin with 3 x t2 heatsinks and a kronos with 3x t2 magstabs both firing close range high dps t1 ammo i know that paladins use an multis but kronos pilots cant afford using cn am all the time so i had to make an assumptionsopaladin t2 megabeams t1 multis 3 t2 heatsinks 697  30 20km tracking 001914kronos t2 425mms t1 am 3 t2 magstabs 601  36 30km tracking 001653697601 116  see a pattern here and that does not take into consideration that the paladin can use tachyons which take it up to 753  3325 tracking 00174as a final note you cant really compare rail kronos to vargur cause vargur just screams autocannons 70 km fallof with barrage wtfwhat we consistently see is that as far as turrets go railguns lack by at least 16 to lazors which is the closest ws in relation due to cap usage and rangetrackingi think so far we have conclude that rails really need a boost to their damage by 15 both in pvp setups and in pve once more i would like to see if anyone in the csm has taken note or not and if they feel that there is more justification to be supplied also if you agree and support this proposal ask your corpmates to add their vote
i dont think it would make them more selfsustainable than they already should be carriers are logistical platforms used to support fleets in combat and it would only make sense if they can support themselves in full therefore they should be able to repair drones themselves which have rendered useless after a fight although repairing them inside should always remain less efficient than doing this outside risk vs rewardthere are in fact three capital remote arrays which do receive a bonus armor shield and cap the capital remote hull repair system is completely ignored in these bonuses and will remain at a 15 kilometre range unless something is changed about this seeing that the other two mods are far more useful due to this its no wonder that the capital remote hull is ignored because it takes up a slot that could be used for something more useful take your pick triage remote armorshieldcap smartbomb dcu next to that this module has for capital distances a very short range because it doesnt have a single bonusthis why i suggested a slow repairing system which isnt useful in combat but useful after combat being in a pos far away from a station for example and to add a fast repair system which can only be used in triage but requires a certain amount of fuel
supported though i do think that making it a bay needlessly complicates this just having an icon on each drone in the list that can be clicked to initiate a 4 minute repair cycle which until completed renders the drone unusable carriers could repair say 24 at a time where super carriers repair 510 at a time this would prove especially useful for dealing with incapped drones that clutter up your bay and that often end up being accidently relaunched
bam right in the kisser
yes here have a lollipop
why not just make it so there is a 5 supplementary kinetic damage bonus instead of a kinetic damage multiplier this would allow caldari to remain the kinetic race while applying the damage bonus to all missiles problem solvededit to clarify consider these pseudoquationscurrent bonus kinbonus  kindmg  005  skillproposed bonus kinbonus  alldmg  005  skillthis can also be applied to other ships that would call for racial damage such as sbs and amarr missile boats
great ideas all round some might not be poplular but your nevre going to make everyone happymaking the game a wholelot more interesting is more important than keeping one type of player happyfully supported lowsec needs a big boost and not to faction warfare
one of the things i have always wanted to see was pirate npc stations in lowsec not a lot of them and of course no agents so people can run pirate missions in lowsec without bothering to travel to 00maybe you gotta scan them down or something and then you can dock up and do some stuffi would just like to see more black market stuff going on in lowsec associated with pirate npcs maybe syndicate or angels or serpentis keep a station in placid and sell narcotics to pod pilots who take them to other stations and sell themor sanshas raid lowsec planets for slaves and sell them to pod pilots who have to smuggle them to amarr or khanid or even other sansha stations in 00 for resaleall in all lowsec is becoming nothing more than a stomping ground for fw corps less of this and more of the underworld schtuff that i think everyone wants to see
off the wall ideas to improve lowsec1 change gateguns make several different types each targeting different sized ships the guns hit for different damage depending on their preferred target size frig guns only target frigs and bigger and do less damage bs guns hit for huge damage but only attack bs and caps each gate has a different mix of these guns depending on sec status a 4 system would have a mix of all guns while a 1 might only have 1 or 2 of the frig or cruisers sizes and be heavily loaded with antibs and anticap guns2 make different security levels mean something 4 does not allow cynos 3 allows anchoring of certain sec dependent pos mods like now 2 removes secstatus hit for killing anyone with negative status 1 removes all secstatus hits3 remove killmails 4 remove all market taxes in lowsec5 have several industry centers in each region with 5x the regular number of manufacture copy invention and research slots6 drastically increase wormhole generation in lowsec have wormholes be several times more likely in a lowsec system them hisec or 007 introduce exploration combat sites with decent rewards and the npcs use sleeper ai they may switch targets and attack any incoming pirates instead of the pve player being easily killed because they take all the damage from the npcs and the player pirates
i approve of these suggestions
please ccp listen to us thumbs up
100 support it
supported however i dont think you need a new pos mod there are already ship assembly arrays if you can build a whole ship i dont think reconfiguring a ship is out of the question
yeah this only makes sense if you can build ships from scratch in a pos you really should be able to swap around modular ship parts too
nods
i sincerely support this measure fix the damned problem already 3 of my real life friends and corp mates have left the game solely due to the intolerably terrible audioeverything from onboard to auzentech to xfi  it blows for alli sent in and so did almost every corp member of ours in june 2009 a petition  1 of 2 times their help simply sucked i posted about the go into setup disable and reenable your audio  this generally gets it back for a bit for most jump an acceleration gate and you must repeat pretty game but who cares when an invulnerability field will make you want to cut your wrists after 5 minutes of droning they implemented the alarm for 25 shields in response to the fact that half the time if you were doing say market stuff while in space you may not even notice you are getting hammered by pirates when my subscription is done in september so am i if this isnt fixed completely unacceptable for a 6 year old game i dont want to see a single tidbit of extra content until this is repaired downgrade the audio to preapocrypha if need be but fix it i am enjoying sto in the mean time and have bought a lifetime sub to it not as good allround as eve but the sound works kar

if you want to fly a cheap ship you are going to lose and dont want to replace your clone roam lowsec instead
it is interesting that the forums and the game operate under different rules when it comes to profanity i found this out when petitioning a word used on a station name that the forums censor yet the station name was allowed to remain id support a thread that proposes policies between the two be made more consistent but relaxing them at all certainly notyou dont like it dont swear your lack of selfcontrol is your own problemben

not just the turrets need to be enhanced even the missile system looks like an epic fail to me best example is the drake why does this ship have so many missile bays on both sides for when theyre not used it looks so damn silly when a missile is coming right out of nowhere in the middle of the ships belly not to mention that this is a battle cruiser in comparison to what the name stands for and what is going on on the screen when fighting the drake should be called pong cruisercause when fighting it looks like the drake is the bar and the missiles are the dotjust silly that example matches with every other missile based ship in eve the bigger the ship gets the sillier it lookslord helghast said1 i would like to see an enhancement to the gun and projectile effects as currently the effect really doesnt feel powerful at all were dealing with things up to 1400mm and yet the effect looks much less satisfying as it standsthe problem is the size of the turrets they are everywhere the same on any ship looks silly too on a frig the number of turrets are realistic but they are totally oversized on a battleship where there should be hundreds of turrets if we stick to what the name its standing for its almost the same they are also totally unrealistic oversized rokh fe and they are far too few epic fail in my opinioni dont speak of changing the stats keepem as they are just match the size and amount of turrets according to the class of ship and as the author of this thread said the effects possible way to get this done implement a turretmissilebattery system on bigger ships for when you activate one of your turretmissilebuttons a hole battery of beams projectiles or missiles is firing matching the size of the effects according to the ships class would have the nice side effect that finally fe a battleship wouldnt just look like a battleship it would fight like a battleship and the player could finally feel like a captain of a battleshipplease ccp there is no need in rushing things like walking on stations and dust 514 if there are still bigger issues to solve in eve as they are right now eyecandy for the players is necessary too to keep them sticked to the game if the graphical difference between wos and the rest of the game with all the unsolved issues i mentioned above will be getting the big like weve seen it on the trailers then this wont be good at all im hoping for the bestby the way topic absolutely supported
that would be really cool i whant to see capitals breaking in half upon death and battleship falling to pieces in the epic mission arc you can see several battleships torn to shreds and a minmatar dread broken in half we could use those sorts of wreckscurrently eve is eyecandy while you are in station and orbiting a planet as soon as someone fires a gun it starts looking like a dated game with bad effects
yes to all of it
mo eyecandy
full support
yes yes to everything eyecandy tastes goodalso the engine trails added a lot to the game i really hope this will happen soon
engine trails were always optional with an onoff switch in the client graphics options no reason why it cant be so againas for realism heres a sample justification a reaction engine will always leave a trail of something behind itself so the visible trails are the exhausts made visible by your ships computer to aid in situational awareness with respect to ships heading and speed or some variation thereof
in this discussion i will attempt to look at the most inferior tier 3 battleship and figure out the reasons for it being underpowered and possible solutions in this thread i make following assumptions 1 it should have its specific nitche 2 it should be moderately useful in pvp at least in some circumstances3 comparing it to abbadon is the most adequate comparison avaliable as they are both tier 3 battleships with damage and tanking bonus and are both armor tanks both have 8 turrets and for fill similar role out of all tier 3 battleships hyperion has the weakest maximum achievable tank i do not want to go into numbers at the moment but i will if this point will be argued further on in this thread prove it this is largely due to the fact that although it is a tanking battleship it only has 6 slots available to fit the tank out i suggest that two of its mid slots are switched for two lowslots as that would allow a bursttype active tank running on cap boosters to be used in pvp in smallscale warfare it would also give a slight boost to its pve capability but firstly the boost is so minisque it can be neglected secondly it comes nowhere near pve capability even of the said abaddon not even mentioning the raven largely due to relatively low dps and poor tracking of railguns this will also stop those homosexual shieldtanked hyperions showing up on our killboard because if a ship with bonus to armor tanking is frequently shieldtanked something isnt right about the ship the second goal this slotlayout would accomplish is it would allow hyperion to become viable for pvp in two things tanking and hitting you would have 8 slots for laying out damage mods and tank instead of 6 you have nowadays so it could become a good choice for small scale bs engagements mission runner would not get hut as they can replace their cap recharger for power relays and keep on running missions an i do not think those 8 extra cap would make much difference as you can see i am trying to make hyperion good at what is was intended to do that is soack up damage and hit hard with blasters please note that balance of blasters vs pulces or the acitve tank bonus over resist bonus is outside the scope of this proposal i am trying to make the ship work with what we have the second part of my proposal can be described by the picture below please visit your user settings to reenable imagesas you can see after the ships where fitted with 8 guns each abaddon has 6450 units of powergrid left hyperion has 26739 units of powergrid left that is a 24 times differencethe reason why this is wrong followspulse lasers outrange blasters by the factor of 3 roughly therefore there is a 3 times lower need for a speedmod armor plates consume over 4 times less powergrid then armor repairers those are the reasons why hyperion needs to have more powergrid then abaddon if anything because armor repairers consume more power and blaster boat without mwd is a blasterboat that cannot hit anything the situation is simply rediculous because hyperion cannot simply fit 8 guns mwd and an armor repper and these are the modules that are requred for this ship to forfill its purpose i am not even mentioning cap boosters and dual rep tanks now you can clearly see why hyperion is so inferiour to abaddon abaddon can fit all the modules it needs hyperion cant that needs to be sorted out hyperion must have anough powergrid for an mwd 2 reppers 8 guns and an mwd in order to forfill its purpose succesfully therefore i would like to propose the following changes change slot layout on the hyperion to 838change the powergrid amount on the hyperion to allow it to fit 2 large armor repairers a mwd and 8 guns pros hyperion becomes a valuable ship a ship that has a role cons abaddon pilots will have competition
if you see holes in my proposal point them out and i will see what can be done if you have additional suggestions lets discuss them
1 it has its niche in small gang pvp2 i would rather compare it with the maelstrom as both got rep bonuses3 an electronion blaster fit hyp works rather well with dual repdual cap booster
right gallente fly it becasue they have nothing better it cannot stand up to abbadonmaelstorm is a sniperand then it has less dps then abaddon less range then abaddon and less cap then abaddon
first the maelstrom isnt a sniper in small gang pvp ac maelstrom can make a nice hero tank same as an hyperionless cap than an abaddon lol  amusing i am pretty sure 1on1 the hyp has a pretty good chance of whining

we have an option to control click an item in the overview to lock it it would be equally useful to control click a target icon to unlock it this would be very useful to logistics pilots salvagers and those involved in skirmish fleet battlesnot much more to say about it really
ctrlclick is too dangerous in laggy situations you would often unlock accidently when you want to lock something so shiftclick or altclick or ctrlrightclick would be better

since u want realism in a game yes u do because u cant stop associating a game with real life try addressing these as well1 concord leaving all the belt rats and mission rats alone who r also technically pirates harassing any player there in fact i dont recall any loitering concord ever shooting down belt rats when they come2 isolated low sec systems being low sec even if theyre completely surrounded by high sec systems3 insurance being paid for any ship lossr u saying u want to change this as well as every other realism issue in this game as well how about when one of the 2 pvpers shoot first in low sec loses out on insurance since its a criminal act while the one who did not shoot first gets the safety of insurance to fall back on then again u wouldnt care either way right1 if 00 lowsec and wormhole space were irrelevant then what do u really mean by suicide gankers and whining little kids who cant hack it in low sec or null space so prey on the helpless what would u consider succeeding in low sec00 then blobbing thehelpless prey because they r greatly outnumbered oh thats rightu probably dont even know because ure never there2 and yes u r tired of being gankedu dont have to say it cause as a result u retreated back to high sec to hide behind concord and now thats not enough for u because u dont want to take your own precautions to protect yourself when u finally realize ure not safe in high sec with emphasis on high sec not complete sec u want concord to do all the work for u3 even if its only removing insurance all they have to do is use cheaper ships and more ppl to compensate and there goes that idea4 and yet another reallife reference in a post from someone who claims hes not about realism so if anyones a fail troll its u
exactlythe objections to the sensible logical step of removing insurance for ships that are destroyed by concord always boil down to pirates crying over the possibility that they might not make norisk money by shooting fish in a barrel anymore
i live in nullsec and whole space and i wasnt the one who wanted realism read the whole thread i responded to herr wilkus which is who you probably are and trying to deflect and his whole realism thing i dont think people who go out and gank people in hisec and lose their ships should get paid for their ships as its a criminal act in hisec it doesnt matter if you accidentally shoot a friend and get concorded or what you shouldnt get paid for a criminal act in hiseci have never been ganked hard thing to have happen when you dont live in hisecreferenceing something as punishment as i did when you keep screaming about realism to being thrown in jail doesnt mean im wanting realism i was simply saying a freeze on sec status for people ganking or doing any criminal act in hisec would be a nice punishment kind of like jail its the kind of like part thats the clue hereyou responded to my response to herr wilkus you and his whole realism take again go troll somewhere else please
i have never been ganked hard thing to have happen when you dont live in hisecreferenceing something as punishment as i did when you keep screaming about realism to being thrown in jail doesnt mean im wanting realism i was simply saying a freeze on sec status for people ganking or doing any criminal act in hisec would be a nice punishment kind of like jail its the kind of like part thats the clue hereyou responded to my response to herr wilkus you and his whole realism take again go troll somewhere else please1 u claim to live in 00 and wormhole space yet ure pushing for a buff to high sec with the intention to deter suicide ganking2 and what ure saying is its harder to be ganked in 00 and wormhole space than it is in high sec3 or is it that since u dont live in high sec u think u know everything there is about it4 but since u claim uve never been ganked u wouldnt need this change in the first placeis that right5 and since u say u dont care for realism at all why should someone not be paid for doing something criminal just for the sake of it other than u wanting to deter a game mechanic that u claim has nothing to do with u6 another nerf to sec being kind of like jail is still kind of like realism because ure alluding to realismit doesnt matter what u sugarcoat it with especially if ure gonna dismiss someones realism saying that realism doesnt matter and still make another reference to it yourself7 add this all up and as a resulta ure lying u about living in 00 and wormhole spaceb the fact is u live in high sec with all the proposals u made to make it safer for u so u dont have to spare the effort for a little precautionc when someones lying out their own ass demonstrates hypocrisy and constantly accuses someone else of being a troll it just shows that they have nothing else to back themselves up with
its you not ujust because i dont live in hisec doesnt mean i have never lived there or that i dont travel through there at some pointyes i am you dont have 100 loosers sitting in saftey around a gate all day waiting to gank some guy carrying a nice load a stuff most nullsec and such have escorts and they actually can defend each other while not in hisec so in nullsecwholelosec space you bring friends and they can actually do something other than watch you explode you see someone camping a gate out there and you drop your own fleet on them cant do that in hiseceveryone starts in hisec at some point we all had to learn most people constantly travel to it or through it at some point no i never said i know everything about it but i have seen enough when i used to mission runagain just because it has never happened to me doesnt mean i dont have friends it has happened to or that i dont have an opinion on it or are you saying people arent allowed to have an opinion on it and this is why youre attacking mebecause its a retarted mechanic plain and simple and if you cant see that that is your problem not mine just because it doesnt affect me doesnt mean at some point it wont it doesnt mean i cant have an opinion as im part of this thing called evei made the reference based on a reference by another person and for no other reason i never said realism doesnt matter stop putting words in my mouth using a reference to something real world doesnt mean i want realism its just a reference nothing more stop reading into itoh my maybe they should remove outlaws all together because i mean its realistic we have outlaws in the real world maybe they should remove bounty hunting too while theyre at it roses missiles bullets lights stars planets list goes onagain think what you want according to you im not allowed to have an opinion and as such i get attacked and called a liar while you have no proof of itdo you have proof im lying i have proof i live in whole space and nullsec that is why i call troll because you keep attacking me and making accusations or try to put words in my mouthim finished have said what i needed
so u still had the mental capacity to understand what u means ok then and u think im the troll here because i am so bored atm ill feed your trolling autopilot through high sec in a shuttle then autopilot through low sec and 00 and see the difference and did u ever consider instead of relying on everyone else to protect u u couldprotect yourself u know actually think for yourself instead of letting everyone else do it for uso plz describe exactly what u saw for once instead of just pushing for eve to support your friends stupiditynowhat im saying is ure not gonna know the whole truth unless uve been there yourself did u ever think that maybe he was just being lazy or careless and he just wouldnt admit itwhether or not u somehow think it is it still doesnt compare to the fact that your friends didnt take any precautions when hauling which is why it happened to them in the first place this is just an excuse to cover for your friends inability to think and adaptyes it does mean u want realism because by referring to it u suggest u want the mechanic to become more like the reference only u just want it to a degree that suits only u and your friends who just wont learn from their mistakesure allowed to have an opinion however ure also expected to support it well and that does not include u and your friends incompetence in adapting to the mechanics because u still never once answered my question did u ever try actually taking some precautions all uve done is complain about how ppl capitalize on their stupidity laziness and inability to adapt the reason i repeat this over and over again is thats what this all boils down to and until u do answer that question its pretty safe to assume they never did and never will
please please please
well all the fits i listed work as far as grid goes so i think it is a fair comparison you can try to load them up in eft yourself to check the beam pally is also cap stable without ab and lar runningbesides no matter how much you twist it around the rails still fall short the tiny little bit of extra range just doesnt justify the massive drop in dpstrackingedit all the other setups apart from the rohk are cap stable without the ab running
i am not twisting anything around i say it straight as a ruler rails need 15 more damage and caldari railboats need 10 more grid
i still contend that more range would not hurt my feelings  otherwise i can get behind this liang
supporting though the solution need not be exactly what was proposed in the opsomeone mentioned that by nerfing laserprojectile range those ships would fit more range mods to compensate from my limited sniper bs experience mostly eft at least on projectile ships it wouldnt work like that they already fit 3 or 4 range mods another range mod would give less effective dps than a damage mod most likelyif fleets do manage the whole different ranged ships warp in at different distances then it could have some merit i just dont see it ever working in practice in the 100 man sniper fleets any benefit will be lost to complexityincreasing rof and decreasing cap usage was suggested as well this would increase lag and already in some fights guns will get stuck etc making alpha much more useful than high rof or even dps best to fix lag though rather than balance around it but its worth noting anyway
would like to see this
you want 5 dps increase for all damage types that caldari have access towhy dont you give us amarr kinetic and exp damage dealing crystalsgive gallente and caldari railboats their emp and exp hybrid chargesperhaps a buff for minmatar projectilesonce we get those then you can have your 5 rof bonus instead of your 5 kinetic
so some updatesi sent a bug report with a description of all the problems most of us are having and in their reply they said that they cant reproduce the problems on their computers they also said that my driver was old but the last driver that creative made for my model xfi fatal1ty was in july 2009anyway i switched to my onboard card realtek hd audio installed the latest drivers 22 jan 2010 and i must say that eve sounds a bit better its not perfect but definitely an improvementso if you also have realtek on the mb try downloading the new drivers and pray the latter is the most important one
im curious as to what version of the wwise sdk framework is being used for some reason eve cant load vorbis data so i would imagine itd be pretty outdated wwise has supposedly come a long way in features and quality since 2008whether a current framework is being used or not id like ccp to give a rats ass about the obvious sound issues in this game
ccp should be embarrassed that they cant even the fix sound on their game with everything that theyre doingi think its crap that the player base should tolerate this this problem has gone for too long and needs to end nowwe need more people demanding crap control productions to fix sounds
the fact that your onboard sound card works better is probably because there are no advanced features used or perhaps you may have indeed have better drivers for the onboard sound card than you had for your creativeeither way you encountered a noob gm that was selling you bsi have tested with 3 different systems and 4 different sound devices this does not fix the issuesin the end i am using an xfi music with latest drivers and all advanced features turned off  eaxd advanced features in windows 7 etc this works just as good  read  bad  as onboard sound or a logitech usb headset  which is a sound device in itself previously i had all my test hardware described in the op but i ran against maximum character limit so removed it in favor of listing more sound issues  i edited op to add part of my testing back like i said it is not a client hardware or osdriver problem but a problem with the eve software
i totally agree with you there but having to deal with noob gms is unfortunately part of the processi cant believe that anyone is unable to reproduce the problems on their systems and that just leads me to one of 2 conclusions1 they follow the general line sell a lot of bs when they ask you for sound problems or2 they programmed the sound so that it works only on the specific hardware configuration they use i asked them to give me a configuration that actually works of course no reply there anyway seems that no sound fix is on its way and i thought id give some updates that might or might not help the others
i welcome your efforts for the cause and perhaps i should also file another petition and bug report and keep bugging them until they acknowledge the problem or give me a working speci have quite a bit of hardware at my disposal to test and if they tell me to get some exotic hardware then ill go get it and tell the players and ccp about my findings but i am pretty certain that no one at ccp can give me a computer spec that actually works 99 of the time
back to page one with thisits as bad for the in game economics as ghost training was bad for ccps wallet

i support the op 100 if i wanted to do pvp theres plenty of other online games that were created for thatforcing players to play this game a certain way when they dont want to is just plain wrong and will just force them to quit playing this game insteadccp needs to wake up from their fantasy dream and take a real good look at the game the way it is being advertisedby the way you had better change the eve online ads for this game before you get sued for false advertisement im sure theres plenty of hungry lawyers that would love to get a piece of this
supportedeven if this doesnt affect me in any way as i dont run any missions for gallente but since these new mission were added every gal mission runner i know has either switched to a different faction or stopped running missions all together you would think that after all these years ccp would have learned that you cant force the hisec playerbase into things like thison the other hand i think these missions would probably be a good idea if they were offered as normal missions not storylines that would at least make them more of an option as they could be rejected fairly easily
who ever implemented this idea was clearly inebriated or on drugs i think ccp should strip him of his position for such incompetence
while the core of the proposal might be right i cannot support its current text as its mainly a rant
i think youre wrong 1st  epic mission is for fun the point is not gaining rewards such lps or standingif you want standinglprewards just do normal missions2nd  you dont need a pve ship to do an epic mission all epic need lot of skillsships its a funny story you can do with friends in eve mostly i use pvp ships that are most efficient for this kind of mish and by the way the epic missions are very doable in pvp ships3rd  stop about complaining and return in your secure space play with boggles in mining 
reread the op no one here is speaking about epic arc what we are speaking about are regular storylines for running regular missionsonly gallente and i stress than only have got those experimental missions added at the last moment before dominion not that missions get much testing but those had no testing at all
ccp most likely and csm  for sure  are just ignoring the issue
seeing some of the crucial issues that have been voted in the recent csm meetings i should agree
i live down in solitude so its normaly a min of 32 jumps to get to the mission site for theseso yes i suport this however i would be happy with these missions staying ingame but only if when your given them you are also given a normal storyline so you can choose one or the other
i propose that if and when the intaki system is retaken from caldari occupation by the gallente militia it is taken off the list of threatened systems and given a security status of at least 05 from the standpoint of the games storyline theres no way after all the political turmoil the loss of the system has caused the federation that they would not make a more convincing attempt to secure the system the current situation with the homeplanet of one of the federations founding races containing billions of federal citizens  occupied by an enemy force with absolutely no effort by the federation navy to reclaim it  simply does not make any sense at alleven prior to fw the fact that two systems so important to the federation  mannar and intaki  were left defenceless while lirsautton the seat of the jinmei  one of the federations newest members  was hisec space was exceptionally inconsistent i accept that the federation cannot possibly have the manpower to guard every colony but the fact that theyd make no effort whatsoever to guard the home planets of two of their founding members just doesnt make senseto summariseif and only if the intaki system is recaptured by the gallente federationtake intaki out of the gallente militia zoneraise intakis security status to 05 or higher if those in charge of plot think it is appropriateif necessary for purposes of game balance add one or more other gallente lowsec systems to the gallente militia zone
this is a good idea working it could be intresting but for systems so important it does seem that there excusion from high sec is rather daming of the federation which would raise the question why these races suport the galenti when security in there space hasnt been made a prioritybut yes most definatly signed
agreed the fact that intaki isnt a highsec system is ridiculous
its time the new federal government stops playing there politiocal games and starts funding there navy and tightening security around here as s sitisent of gallente federation i approve this message
i am not hardcore roleplayer but having intaki as lowsec system is bit weird and illogical so yeah i support this issue no matter how caldari i am
valid point though just slapping it 05 would be silly would like to see some ic storyline leading to this maybe have ishukone involved in all thisanyways ive always found it rather peculiar that intaki has been a low security system for the afore mentioned reason that it is one of the cornerstone worlds of the gallente federation
it would be nice to have a highsec island here it would also be nice if more lowsec systems were created around intaki
this would be like khanid prime being low sec or saisio being low sec it really does need to be fixed it seems kinda silly that they would even let such planets be undefended or fall unless the gallente federation really is in dire straights perhaps their position of power is weaker then we thoughtcould we see the entire gallente federation crushed under the heel of a combined caldariamarr fleeti hope not high sec status for intaki please
agreed there are several other gallente systems that can be added to the fw warzone in the place of intaki if necessary for balancing purposes several parts of low sec verge vendor for example
they cahnged the sec status of sarum prime a long time ago so theres no reason why they couldnt do it for intaki
this would be fantastic to see and at long last facwar would seem to have some significance
yep
agreed although i too would like to see a story line about it
interesting idea this has my support
more things like this would make fw worth it liang
the intaki in the back story seem to prefer a lack of concordafter such hostility in the pf and the game i would like to see the intaki react against the external forces over all and change their status to 00 free from all external law and concordkinda like the intaki syndicate and the mordus sov has now
as an intaki i support this message
on really low priority yes this will add some consistency to the game
with oauth and separate scopes the user could choose which parts of the api to allow on a persite basiswithout the need for any copypaste of api keys as the keys are generated and swapped by the code in the backgroundfrom a simple user interface that very basically prompts the user without any complexitythis would bring the new spacebook into line with other social networksthe old api key system should be replaced rather then hacked at
the main idea about this proposal is about extending the api so it can allow for just that  separation of privileges to read specific parts of the users api if its done by oauth or an inhousemechanism is for the user a nonissue as long as the user controls what is given out infowise in oauth this is done using tokens that the user must create and manage or a realtime selector ajax anyone p on ccps site for the restrictions that a calling service external webserver or software should have on their request thus meaning that a selector mustshould exist from ccps side the token creator mechanism which is what i propose above in short the user must first create the token within hisher rolemanager in ccps backend create a specific token and then tell that to the calling service same functionality as the current api givesa calling service will see only the info given out by the grants from the token itself  this is how oauth works oauthtokenthe temporary credentials identifier oauthtokensecretthe temporary credentials sharedsecret as you can see these credentials are close to the same as is active per today where the user has already created a set of tokens fulllimited and given them to sitestoolssoftware that exists with access to poll specific data only again as mentioned in my first post and now clarified if you still think my interpretation is wrong you might read the ietf draft regarding oauth and the examples for google apps with oauthspecifically this example which is very similar to what already exists
yes please translate the relevant information into every language in existence thatll save so much time in the long run
a bit of offtopicabout russian localisationwhat need to be fixedno translation of any names would that be a ship type of the ship a module or just some market comodity the worst problem for russian community after ccp bring second localisation was in misunderstanding between ppl who used native latin names and those who used translated cyrillic names those are not just a names in eve it more like a technicalnames just like as no one ever will translate core worlds in technical language of programming or system administrarion as no one should translate similar names in evealso no translation should be done for missions and plexes names as otherwise ppl simply will fail to find proper info about them and also can experience missunderstanding about which exactly mission you are talkinf about with those who use english language in eve or at least always give both russian and english names for missions and plexes for example worlds collideU043EU043BU043AU043DU043EU043D U043CU043Elastly any translated text that players found inconvenient should be disscused on both eveonlinecom and everucom forums ccp or at least isd members that can contact ccp latter should constanly observe such disscusions and if correction of translation will gain enough of support from other players ccp should fix it asap without any aproval from 3rd side companyin fact i dont even know who is exactly currently that 3rd side company that doing russian localisation what i do know and now only me that those ppl didnt even try to contact everu community to check if they do something wrong seems like they pretty much happy with money ccp pays them for localisation and dont worry about actual quality of itand the quality is still awful
yeah i like this 1 active tanks defiantely need some love
yes pleasethis has kept me up some nights and ive tried to raise the subject earlier in features and ideas
i can get behind an active tank boost liang
two things to consider1 the nonviability of active tanks is related more to the fact that buffer tanks dont need to rely on capacitor to work whereas a couple of curses can tear a hyperions capacitor apart in a few cycles if you want to restore active tankings viability something about capacitor management needs to change neuts need to get weaker or boostersreppers need to use less capacitor or ships that are intended to be actively tanked need to get a bonus to boosterrepper cap usage2 why is this a con
support for all of it
i can not iterate just how much more awesome this game would be with all this cool stuffesp the point on having battleships have heaps of guns but staying the same as they are stat wise that would just look awesomeso dont argue it ccp  do it
i like the idea of an ore only hauler that hauls alot of ore but the jump drive is a bit much to be honest dont know why this should be a t2 orca though i think it would need its own model how about just a dedicated line of ore haulers industry needs some lovesupporting the idea of a dedicated ore hauler
there is no need for this whatsoever it was a bad idea in fid and a bad idea here mining was fine before the rorqual was added and even better before the orca was added now highsec mining is a damn cakewalk by your own admittance the orca is a boni spewing mega gsc with a warp drive it is already a hauler there is no need for a rorqual that can use stargates and a jump drive if you want a better nullsec hauler than an orca use a rorqual to jet a freight container which hulks can mine into and a freighter can scoop from btw rorqual has more ore space than a jf has cargo if you want a good highsec mining hauler for systems w no stationhulks mine into an orcaa full orca warps to a highsec pos in system and dumps ore into corp hangarorca warps back to the belt for hulks to mine into hulks can take a cycle or 2 while the orca is offgrid jetcan if you take too longfreighter flies inbetween the station and the pos hauling the oreits easy eve isnt meant to be a simple single player game make friendsyour ideaedit 12 also if youre worried about camps in nullsec you arent defending your space properly and will get your mining op smashed soon afaikedit 22 also this should have no tank whatsoever its a goddamn hauler
i cannot see any signifact holes or drawbacks to this proposal therefore i am not opposed to it seems like anice little orehauling ship to me jump capability might be a bit too much but does not seem like something to be fought over to me however i cannot see this ship as being something extremely nessesary either so i will not support it either it would be nice to have but it costs development time
supportedwhile i do not necessarily agree with the eft warriorism going on here the hyperion is very lacklustre for a tier 3 bs any role it can fill is filled better by cheaper ships and the active repair bonus is rarely used and pretty niche in its uses see also brutix therechange the active rep bonus for pg or mwd accelleration or  armour amount hell even a shield bonus would be better and give the ship more optionsthe other way of fixing this would be to make armour regen continuously while the repper is active rather than in a burst
i vote for 847 layout abwebscram  1 med is needed for cap boosteralso pg increasing is needed it has almost the same pg as megathron it is wrong
i also vote for 847 layout i like my midslots
you can fit that just with ions instead of neutron blasters you have to note that lasers only get two tiers of short range guns while blasters get 3 tiers you can argue that neutrons are larger than megapulse and thus should be harder to fit or you can argue that they should be equally hard to fit you also cannot compare guns on fittings alone the megapulse has greater range but also sucks cap at an extraordinary rate an active abaddon with mwd and dual rep will probably need both a large injector and med injector which makes it low on tackle and eccm so while eft will give the dual rep setup to the abaddon the hype will be more useful in actual gameplaycomical not only is this unbalanced in the extreme but goes against gallente ship slot layout design philosophy even giving it 1 med and 1 low now its just a lame active tanking mega if any ship needs more slots to tanking it is the maelstrom which has 6 slots for tanking and those slots compete with speed mods and tackle no problems with this would support this proposal if this is all you wanted but 838 is nuts also im not a fan of balancing ships and modules based on unrealistic fits by eft warriorslastly the one thing that stuck out in those two pictures in my mind was the insane range of the abaddon with shortest range ammo iirc the abaddon with short range ammo  blasters with t2 long range ammo this range factor is why blasters track worse than lasers despite more eft tracking and do less damage despite more eft dps would give say 12k more pg and either a 20 tracking boost or optimal boost to blasters
mostly supportedwhile i do agree with some of the critics that giving the hyperion eight low slots would be dumb some people would still ignore the active tank bonus and throw on plate after plate after plate i do heartily support an increase in powergridcpu for better flexibility in fitting i also agree with many here that active tanking is borked and needs serious revisionson another note im a big fan of hyperion however i simply will not buy or fly one anymore as they are expensive frontline battleships that literally scream primary target to any hostile roaming gang with 4 gank battlecruisers
on the other hand maelstrom has a lot of low slots for weapon upgrades without tank sacrificing 
leave my mid slot alone the hype needs more armor hitpoints you could currently think of it like a mega with a low slot required to be filled by a t1 800 plate 1050011000 base armor and 6500 base shield should be sufficient enough grid to fit dual larmwdcap boosterneutrons no other tier 3 bs is so constrained by fittings that it cannot fit its bonused tank  largest tier guns faction mods may be required but thems the breaks maybe increase to 21500 grid and 620 cpuconsider that this would fithyperion dream hypelarge armor repairer iilarge armor repairer iicoreli ctype adaptive nano platingcoreli ctype adaptive nano platinginternal force field array imagnetic field stabilizer iiquad lif fueled i booster rocketsheavy capacitor booster ii cap booster 800warp disruptor iifleeting propulsion inhibitor ifleeting propulsion inhibitor ineutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge llarge auxiliary nano pump ilarge auxiliary nano pump ilarge nanobot accelerator ithis requires a lot more faction modules than an equivalent maelstrom it would also fit easily on said maelstromliang
how to fix the hyperion remove a high slot cut drone band wide into halve reduce lock range to 425kmat max skills add a mid replace the active tanking bonus with a damage or rof bonus profit you have a dedicated blaster bs what is very different to the mega
great so you get a bs that cannot even be used in missions thanks to it having no locking range whatsoever which is currently the only use of hyperion that has even worse dps due to having less guns has yet another midslot why does a blaster boat need yet another one and has even less dps thanks to having no drones ow also if you put on damage mods you have a paper bs with a lot of tackle get out i fail to see in point in plating hyperion in this case you will be better off in a mega because that ship gives you a bonus to tracking if you plate it you turn it into a mega without a tracking bonus armageddon with 8 lows is unbalanced to the extreme as well rightimao hyperion does not need many midslots its a heavy tankdps bs you have tacklers and support ships for the rest of the stuff you have dominix with 5 midslots and megathron with 4 mid slots if you want a bs with alot of mislotsthis is the sad truth however its a little outside the scope we are attempting to fix the ship guns are a separate discussionno it does not xlarge shield boosters server the perpose of 2 large reppers and invuls are more powerful then eanm it can achieve 30 stronger tank then a hyperion in pve in pvp i am not even mentioning maelstorm is the last ship that needs any slot layout changes
switching slots around isnt going to work you cant add any either because all teir 3 bs have 19 hype having 20 would not be fair two improvements are required the first is moar pg a second idea would be to increase base speed a third would be to increase either its armour rep bonus or its damage bonus the hype has no role and for ship that has a base cost around 150mill it should be excellent the mega outperforms it at half the cost whilst were trying to fix the hype all the other armour rep bonus ships could use some love but lets start with the hype and give it moar pg and better bonuses for its costedithowever after reviewing ships in other classes bccruisers mainly a 11 slot for balance is not unheard of perhaps the hype could get an extra low slot but i would prefer a better bonus to armour rephybrid damage
wait whatalso the mega is a lot better at pve with the tracking bonus and the extra slot for the drone link this mostly aims at pvp this slot layout and bonuses would make the hype good at what a blaster ship does providing a high turret focused dps and moving reasonable fast both points where a hype fails in many setups this daysto fit a reasonable shield buffer on top of mwd point and web similar to a brutix
jesus no we are not shieldtanking gallente ships and we are not tanking off a gun thank you could you please expand on that
8 low slots would make it too easy for extreme setups such as pure buffer tanks that ignore the repair bonus it would also make it a overpowered pve ship as the hyperion is pretty decent in that respect even with only 6 low slots and some of us enjoy having a gallente bs with 5 midslots  its not like were blessed with thosei think the following is a much better suggestion

the merely fact that you dont know how to get l5 mission in highsec means you are not just a carebear you are an losereve is all about making isk by thinking by trying and experementing with eve toolsand about riskinggood carebear not just will go to low00wh space it will love to live there as yes good carebear will not let kill himself no matter there he is and even if hell be killed he will take another prepared ship from hanger and will continue to carebearingbad carebear will be killed in highsecs eh no not necessary by npcshigsec carebearing need to be nerfed not boostedno core thing like concord presend should not be changed but income from highsec agentrunning should be greatly nerfed both by reducing lps reward and lootsalvage drop in highsecswhile same lps and lootsalvage should be boosted in lowall lowsec plexed aslo need great boostyoursgod of carebearingno this isnt alt

no actualy even 00 l4s less profitable at max rate carebearing then l5 running even if that l5 running in higsecs like with hysera agent150mh was my normal income then i lived in hysera and yes thats include all the time i use for makinh isk from l5s include manufacruring reprocessing placing anf changing buysell orders logistig to jita and back and time to place and recheck your contractsin some low income possible can overcome 1bhalthough ofcorse thats mean control of nearby lowsecs by aliance or at least big corporationeven if you dont have such luxury solo runner still can hope for about 200m income in lowsecs provide he do know how to care for himself and willing to do that
some l4s not all though at least high quality indeed should be moved in lowsecalthogh moving l5s to 00 space is very bad ideafisrt of all that will mean insane income by doing l5s in 00 which is simply make l4s agents in 00 worthless and will greatly mess with pirate lpshops marketsecond 00 running usualy less risking then lowsec running as agents space usualy controled by an alliance even though they cant claim it which mean not just more isk its mean more isk with less risk which is again complitely against eve stilelastly 00 space is already boosted alot especialy in dominion while lowsec space still need to be boosted ccp tried to boost it with fw but mosty fail most of lowsec systems still complitely empty
even in laggy situations i doubt the lag would spill out from the overview and into the target icons  either way the proposal is about quickly unlocking unwanted targets not necessarily about what keys should be pressed it certainly beats right clicking the target and choosing unlock especially for people such as me who have aixelsydsupporting my own proposal
yes to this this follows the same line of thoughts than my own proposal too we could merge them look for proposal upgrade of orbit keep at and approach functions youll see what i mean
since the overview now freezes when you have the control pressed this should not be a problemthis would be a nice addition
yes as long as it only works when ctrlclicking on the locked image icon not on overviewthis proposal ties in nicely with this one

add 2 slots for brutix every race has bc with 18 slots gallente does notharbinger 846drake 864hurricane 846 myrmidon 656 brutix 745is it fair
for the sake of completeness and a fair comparisoncyclone 854  17ferox 754  16 prophecy 736  16brutix  745  16so to compare the tier 1 bcs 16 seems to be the average so nothing to change if you ask me unless you want to nerf the cyclone for the sake of same slot numberson the tier 2 battlecruiser canedrakeharbmyrm side you could argue that the myrm could use another low but i think the ship does fine without it 6 higs for turrets are enough as it gets a big chunk of dps from drones 5 mids are also plenty and the tank you get out of a myrm is just insane
ok  brutix does not need extra slots because it is 1st tier bc myrm does not need extra slot because it is powerfull enoughwhat about high tier cruisers comparisonrupture 635 14moa 644 14maller 636 15thorax 535 13is there any explanation
50m3 drone bay the real question is why the maller can have 15 slots and suck so badliang
maller works nice for baiting
actually id turn that around and say all the tier 1s need work  the brutix isnt alone in suffering  split weapons on rupturemoa and big dronebay on the raxmallers 6th highslot has no hardpoint making it not really worth a slot and it has no dronebay
imao tier 1 bcs need ot have just as many slots as their tier two counterparts
this must be added asap ingame
sounds good supported playing missile based ships just looks silly
everyone knows that smartbombs used in hisec are risky there are several ridiculous risks though for instance if you blast an asteroid with a smartbomb its considered a criminal act pfftin light of the new pirate ships relaeased with dominion many of which have useless hi slots ie you cant put launcher or turret in them i propose a point defense system smartbombsthis opens up the possibility of new smartbomb skills to increase damage new smartbomb skills to reduce powergrid cpu andor capacitor usagesmartbombs are an untapped and largely ignored resource lets do something with them
the obligatory support my own post post
smart bombs got their role in lowsec and 00if you really dont know what to put into your utility high slots for pvp you kind of fail waves with an heavy neutnot supported
im aware of nos and neut but have found them to be of limited use after reading some of your most recent replies to other posts i must say im disappointed to find the 1st reply here to be from a very dedicated flamerwhile your security status may be of no concern to you there are those of us who have worked hard to keep a good one and there is more to this post than you seem to grasp im not asking for big change in the way smartbombs operate rather id like to expand their usefulness let me use them without fear of hitting a damn asteroid with it or an acceleration gate let me increase the effectiveness as a point defense system by adding skills to improve its performance every other weapon in the game has these skills why not smartbombs
i am not flaming you i just question your proposal neuts are very valuable in pvp
first off hes rightsecondly your security status doesnt mean crap here get over itthirdly read the whole damn topic before you judge his posts just because he spends alot of time giving one liners and saying no doesnt mean hes saying no for the hell of it hes just not taking the time to explain his reasoning and sorry to say he is right as ive said before you should do a bit more researchme waves remote repsyou obviously do not know how to fit your ships as well as you think you dotime to go back to the drawing board kidps i will say that the sbing an rock is a laughable idiocy of this game should be turned off the rock is not a citizen of this game its a bloody rock
smartbombs are plenty usefull im guessing the op has never been baited into attacking an smartbombing bs with 8 wcs in the lows p 
this is fking idioting needs to be fixed asap if i lost a ship due to this i well would be very displeased smartbombs could use some losving indeed like have a faloff range added to the optimal they currently have but by a large they arent bad or overload them for more rangedamagehowever this proposal really has no content so i do not have much to support i am sorrylets do something with them is a bit too vague

i remember reading a while back that the devs never wanted to bring rogue drone faction ships into the game their reason being the roleplay concept that a pod cant interface with the ship i was thinking to counter this minor detail add hard wirings for drones in general which have been asked for many a time before that must be implanted to get into the drone ships this could bring the ships into a different realm with a whole different idea of prereqs besides just skillsanother concept i was working with in regard to skills and being unique was perhaps require any 2 racial skills each with different bonuses for damage and tank and the player can choose with 2 bonuses to use providing they have the proper skills trained to begin with for ex gallente frigate can give either the offensive bonus of drone bay size or a defensive roll like armor resistance or speed this moves into a t3 direction but the same piratefaction prereqs but with hulls already being used like the badass dominix with claws so just prior to getting into the ship a menu would pop up similar to that of the strategic cruisers with a list of your skills as opposed to ship components in your hangar and the player picks two bonuses of choice whether it be double damage like dominix wdrones and guns or maybe dual tank wno dps a concept not covered via any existing ships bonuses most likely because its boringanother idea moving into uniqueness was perhaps make them individually more powerful in numbers for ex having one rogue drone ship present on grid would be less effective than even its t1 counterpart but as more rogue drone ships come on grid the bonus whether it be something already covered by leadershipcommand links like speedtanklock range or something new like amount of drone bandwidthdrones in space increased would increase either linearly or exponentially  depending on balance and whatever the bonus could be worked out to bei envision a heavily droneoriented damage system naturally maybe neuts or another bonus but i wouldnt want it to encroach too much on neut domi or curse roles perhaps address this by gimping its hi slot layout with other slots altered depending on racial skill choices and giving it a droneperlevel for gallente offensive choice but if the player wanted to do a neut idea have the amarr offensive choice be for that specifics would certainly have to be worked out for balance and to keep claimed roles from becoming obsolete
i like this
theres a lot of cool ideas here but its not nearly coherent enough to be a proposal we take to ccp take this thread to features and ideas kick it around some and come back when its more clearly understood
seems perfectly reasonable
um target painter
even with working defenders this proposal wouldnt be needed i would rather see the proposal apply guided missile precision skill to all missiles go through but davs try to bring up defenders as a valid counter was just too funny
i can support missiles being affected by tracking computers so long as the following conditions are met tracking disruptors also affect missile tracking and range smartbombs no longer destroy missiles flight delay is reduced to become something more reasonable defender missiles are removed from the game the raven gets a seventh missile bank rockets and light missiles get a 50 boost in damage output guided missile precision also affects short range missiles assault missile launchers get a hefty tracking penalty the kestrel gets 3 missile banks and 1 turret point missile range support skills no longer give a net bonus of 125 missile tracking support skills no longer give a net bonus of 100 torpedoes are no longer absurdly overpowered the missile tracking formula is replaced with one that wasnt created by ccp nozhin other words missiles would have to be worth tweaking not in dire need of total overhaul a tracking computer would be a grain of sand in comparison to what needs to be done however far too many people like the sorry condition missiles are in to allow ccp to do anything about it
then give armor tanks an xlarge rep shield is different than armor missiles are different than guns not signed
good proposal well thoughtno support though way too complex probably hard to implement ok thatd be ccps job and last but not least i cannot support slavery of any kind
supported
agreed kinda make them only buildable in hisec afaik nothing has this restriction yet so maybe this would be a good startbased on that i give this proposal a big thumbs up
not supported becuase the op is a fail troll and has had the process benefits and problems explained to him multiple times in good language and bad and because imho the op is probably not the brightest light in the chandelieri would sincerely hope that everyone blows him the hell up in game as often as possible for being a complete dork and an entitlement spoiled xp grinder of the worst wow caliber
and as was pointed out in the op there was no mention of ccps response if any or indeed any indication that the issue was raised at all in the minutes of the relevant csmccp meeting so either the item was overlooked or the minutes are incomplete or the issue was subsumed into some broader discussion and is not mentioned explicitly either way the outcome remains unclear and id like clarificationthis may have come off as being more confrontational than i intended
ive been trying to improve communication from the csm and after a bit of discussion with ccp i hope the minutes from this ccp csm summit will be released much quicker than previouslyas to your specific question well see what update ccp give before any next step is taken
couldnt agree more
full support ugly is ugly everyone knows it
things i would change re black ops covert ops cloak  as has been stated ad nauseum why does the leader of a covert ops gang not have the same basic ability as the rest of the gang if you have to balance it somehow remove 75m3 of drone bay from each black ops to make room for cpu banks for covert ops cloak a hiding ship launches no drones should be on a plaque above every black ops command chairjump range  again it has been stated many times before it needs to be able to do its jobfuel use  lowering the amount needed per ship or raising the amount carried in fuel bay would be nice but if the first two suggestions are implemented i feel that either there will be more black ops around to help or folks wont mind bringing along a blockade runner to carry suppliesas far as resists ehp and dps i have no problem keeping them either close to or exactly where they arefor now this ship type is designed for a purpose i do not believe that purpose is going 1v1 or toetotoe with anything ever fitting the covert ops cloak would greatly reduce the ships vulnerability and any need to take or give damageyou want to make it more survivable maybe give it a 2 warp strength he who cloaks and warps away lives to bridge his whole gang outi would like to see it become the support vessel it can be without becoming a ship that pilots would to take into a real battle you wouldnt throw your reppers out in front would you i think the same concept applies here make the ship too valuable and fragile to risk in open combat but not in a monetary sense it should be your ride home take care of itcovert cloak range and fuel first then let the dust settle to see if needs more love in the resists ehp and dps department
somehow i think black ops should be taken in the sb directionmake them paper thin dps machines that can sneak in call in more paper thin friends make a blow then run away unless caught which causes them to die horriblybut in general just the jump range and maybe bit more tought out bonuses should do it for now
so does the csm present this to the eve devs this weekhow long does it normally take to get a response backi am asking simply to try and understand the process thanks
heres an idea before you accuse people of afk anything why dont you get your facts straightwhen i mine its usually with three accounts on three screens  two mining one hauling my two miners fill up my haulers cargo hold every cycle which means that between docking undocking and travel time i have about 30 seconds of spare time when i dont have to pay attention to the screen so bite my asssecond it is not the fact that i cant afford to lose the hulk that bothers me i have two of them plus a mack and a half a dozen covetors scattered around it is the disproportionate amount of effort involved in recovering that irritates me gankers cry about the loss of sec status as if it were something they actually cared about protip  if they cared they wouldnt be ganking and use that to justify their essentially free ships my ass  as i stated before some helpful fellow demonstrated how to recover the sec status loss from ganking a hulk in about an hour thats not a penalty  thats an inconveniencewhy dont you get over yourself
sorry i had to fix that part of your post as it was a train wreck trying to understand what you were saying thanks for allowing me to have an opinion im overwhelmed that im allowed to actually say something with your permission here is what i have to sayjust to answer your question that you cant see i have answered a hundred times or been said as much through out this whole threadim not complaining about stupidity or laziness im giving my opinion about the fact you get 30 people sitting in saftey around a gate in hisec waiting for ship worth hitting to come through the gate you dont see that anywhere else because there is no such thing as saftey anywhere else yes you have gate camps and such but they dont just sit there in safteythen those people sitting around the gate find a target usually a freighter and they vaporize a freighter of all things in seconds concord comes along and then kills them all while their buddies in haulers again in saftey goes and scoops the loot all the while the freighters friends cant shoot the looters if it had been anywhere else the gankers would have died rather quickly and the little looter guys would have been killed toowait maybe they should make damage controls built in on freighters and give 60 resist across the board they have this in the real world i know i have been on a freighter beforei dont even know why i am trying all youll do is atack me again and get off the subjectall you have done is attack me and make conjecture how about you actually post something constructive instead of attacking me for my views youre telling me i have no voice in the eve community based on where i currently live you say i must live in hisec and have been ganked and thats why im saying this stuffyou can believe what you want to believe does it matter where i live or what has happened to me in the past are we going to base what people can or cant vote on or have a say in based on thiswe going to start letting people only have a voice on certain things based on where they live in the world or the color of their skin maybe we can base it on their sex and religion too then after youre done splitting it up that way then we can look at in game stats for those people and again cut the ones who should have no say talk about bringing realism into a game we have enough of that kind of attitude in the real world why would you want to bring it into eve tooevery post in this thread from you is an attack on someone i havent check the forum itself so i have no idea if this is your mo or not
no youre wrongt1 insurance equals base price of all minerals used in production currently mineral prices on market are below that base meaning insurance pays more then market price of the ship increase market price of minerals and insurance will pay less  nerf mining to deal with suicide gank
agreed after they nerf insurance payout for suicide gankingthen the risk is a bit leveled and then you can come back and cry if high sec dwellers still whine about suicide ganking 200m shipsthey risk their 200m ships you risk your 50m outfit and get almost all back  they dontproposal supportedand no i dont live in empire high sec bores me to tears
couldnt have said it better myself
heres an idea why dont u stop avoiding the fact that merely switching from a hulk to a covetor would be nothing more than an inconvenience as well simple as thatno more 200 mil loss since covetors r t1 is it really that hard for u to do really maybe it is why ure just avoiding this because u dont want to adapt just like the rest of them all u did was restate that the loss of a hulk doesnt bother u but just the recovery stage after it which is essentially the same exact thingso cry me a river cause u aint special either why should the game cater to your unwillingness to adaptahh but if the low sec00 camps arent sitting there in safety compared to the ones in high sec that would mean its harder to be ganked in high sec than it is in low sec00 but waitreally r u just talking out your ass nowit still takes a lot of ppl do something like that just like any blob not in high sec and no the low sec00 gankers wont die quickly because its still a blob no matter where it is most likely ull be the one dying if u cant outblob them anyway second did u ever think that there r other ppl besides the suicide gankers that r waiting for someone else to gank for them so they can scoop it and its not like the gankers will suicide the 3rd party waiting to steal it from themagain with the realism only u just want it to accomodate your laziness and stupidity because u never tried anything at all to protect yourself if u actually have plz do tell
as long as there is no agenda set up for the summit we wont know it in advance worst case well have to wait for the minutes to be published to know for surehowever this is off topic and i would recommend to place questions like this either in the speakers corner or directly with your preferred csm rep
skipped this to trim down first post in the process of your corrections u somehow managed to miss almost the entire remaining post which is repeating a certain question for a reason a question u still have yet to answerby debating this im attacking u with words htfu or just stop posting one would think in a game like this words wouldnt even amount to a grain of salt but i guess thats not always the case u can disprove all the accusations u want cause u still havent disproved my accusation that u never took any precautions to protect your cargototally irrelevant i never once said u couldnt have an opinion did i no i didnt u just have to actually support it and that doesnt include not doing anything whatsoever to protect your assets and crying on the forums for ccp to protect u all ure doing is taking something u completely made up and blow it out of proportionrefer to the top of this post and another reason why it feels like an attack to u its because ive had to say something over and over again cause u either just wont listen or u just want to avoid answering a valid argument did u take precautions to protect your cargo if not thats where the laziness stupidity and inability to adapt comes in do u get it now or r u just gonna continue trolling while going back to accusing me of being one im gonna repeat it again just in case did u take precautions to protect your cargofixed
and yet thats exactly what youre saying  that this change shouldnt be approved because gankers dont want to have to adapt to a new modus operandi in how the choose their targetsso let me toss your own question back at you
correction this change shouldnt be approved because u not wanting to adapt is the sole reason for the change thats where the question why should the game cater to your unwillingness to adapt comes in because even if this happens ppl will just use more ppl and cheaper ships to get the same result so in the end nothing that u intended to change will change
show me where on a ship in the world they have a damage control ii that they turn on to increase their shield armor and hull resists you make my point youre a troll im done with you
sounds win if balanced right
i dont think fille was trying to disparage your efforts but no matter how you look at it would probably have been better wording since twisting implies falsifying informationas for the setups listed i would not run any of them except in specific conditions i have explained to mission runners many times that cap stable is overrated your tank simply needs to hold out long enough to kill everything else and since most runners use marauders to salvage missions then you generally just let everything get within tractor range i dont see beams used that often either since you can still get really good ranges with pulses for taking out those turrets placed at ridiculous ranges so the lack of ammo clogging up the hold furthers the ability of lasers to lead the pack imho thats not even taking into consideration that the kronos is the only marauder that got resistance upgrades that were not in line with its tanking typevargur 35 increase to shield resistances 18125 increase to armorkronos 25 increase to shield resistances 24375 increase to armorpaladin 20 increase to shield resistances 29375 increase to armorgolem 275 increase to shield resistances 23125 increase to armorso yeah i agree that a railgun boost as listed by the op will have virtually no change at all other than to make existing railboats viable alternatives to the fotm
actually that statement wasnt aimed at tagami but never mindthe reason i posted those setups was to show some fits that work and that all looked more or less the same that way no one can argue that one was fitted betterdifferent than the other i also included both beams and pulses in order to show how ill the rails perform in comparison to both
its ok english is a foreign language to me as well sometimes translating does not work i was perplexed because you gave support to the idea but used the verb twist which has negative connotationsanyway ive been looking at frigate sized ships and i am not sure how to approach the comparison amongst them they dont scale very well and in a frig fight 1km is life or death do you have any ideas what fittings we should use to compare frigate sized ships i want to continue this proposal and refine it with input from the rest of the players

i always travel around with at least 23 exotic dancers in my ships hold along with a 6 pack of quafe ultra spiced wine live stock  a janitor somebody needs to clean up so to make sure i always have company in my pvp ships i have quite a few dancers in my hangers but when it comes time to move these pesky girls seem to have an issue with getting inside the boxmy proposal is we make the dancers  all the other life forms to be able to be shipped in containers of course like all things in new eden changes should have repercussions so i suggest maybe an hour or 2 time limit that would cause life forms left in there to be come lifeless corpse or in the dancers case maybe a dead hooker corpse because flying around with dead hookers would make for some serious lolzax

this sounds like a great idea perhaps they could also allow us to use the dead hookers as ammunition even if the did no damage they could bring up a notice to the target that theyve been hit by a hooker corpse

simple idea really make it possible to sort the local channel by standings  security statussame as you can set the overview order make it so that local can be sorted to show that you have 5 war targets in the system of 700 people without having to scroll throught the local list constantly

yeah similar the oauth flow is even simplier then that tho 3rd party sitesoftware user clicks a linkbutton to request access to api info user is shown a list of scopes being requested by the 3rd party sitesoftware skillswalletcorppos user clicks approvedecline user is autheniticated sercurelythe user can then manage the linked sites permissions from their account section of the eve websiteall keys are hidden in the background without the user needing to worry about the technical aspectsthis then allows a whole world of social network programming which will be locked away from eve unless ccp adopt some open standards in relation to the api and the new social networkedit oh and yeah youre right the api already uses a token system so going to a standard one wouldnt be too major a changeadded bonus is that the data being passed is encrypted using the shared secret key
ive mixed terminology a littlewhat im describing is oauth  openidthe concept is if you can prove you own this url then well let you into our website without a passwordin eves case the user would be proving they own a particular character without exposing any private infothis openid process then includes oauth tokens which can be used to impersonate the user on the apimaking requests with the same credentials the user would have by use of the token once approved by the userthis has the extra added benefit of 3rd party sites not having 101 different logins and passwords removing the risk of people being phished when using poorly selected usernamepassword
in case you are not aware mining is still pretty much the same as it was when eve was releasedtheres t2 crystals the rorqual compression but basically mining still comes down to enabling your lasers and then go afk 3 minutes and then moving the ore to a canso could the csm please ask ccpwhat exactly are you doing with mining right nowweve heard talk of cometmining hows going with thatdo you have anything that could make mining less of a jawbreaker in boring contests than it is currentlywhat are your future plans for mining and what do you think of the way mining has developed as a careermining is a career for a considerable amount of people in eve and although many are probably happy with their steady stream of afkincome im sure that theres people who would like to see mining evolvednote when i say ask i dont mean ask in a nicely manner with a cookie and cross fingers i mean slap them in the face then continue to electrify them until they give a proper answerhow far they are in the mining profession is somewhat irrelevant but let us know dammit ccp have a very very bad habit of saying hi were doing something really awesome but we cant really tell you about it until its release which will be in at least 3 years seeyaplease

1 first fail its not a stationary tank l2transversal2 second fail and a big fat wtf i can hit and 1 shot frigates 2 shot cruisers at 120km with spike  425s without a tc3 third fail q freaking q cry some more4 because all ships should do everything every other ship can do am i right or am i right5 will not dignify this as im now going to point to 45a        im starting to think you dont even play this game 8 doesnt make a difference mmkay if you say so as for replacing mods for mods refer to 4 again please its called versatility not stereotyping 6 ver sa til ity not stereotyping if you want something as good as laz0rs go amarr7 sigh moan moan complain complain is all i hear let me point out some things here 1 hyperion  abaddon2 referring to 1 gallente  amarr3 hyperion is far from inferior notice the spelling to the abaddon4  where the hell are you getting this crap about the hyperion not being able to fit 8 guns mwd and 2 reppers in one fit hell it can fit those and 2 injectors to boot my friend it fulfills its job just finelast but not least the 838 deal let me say these few things again1 because every ship should be able to do everything every other ship can do right2 gallente  amarr3 hyperion  abaddonin conclusion to my post all i have to say is this quit your complaining about ccps designs and roll god damn amarr and live and let liveplease put some effort into your fits with all v in eft before you post like this ever again murdering my troll sensesside noteccp  blizzardquit crying
feel free to show me a maelstrom that can fit a mwd pt web and cap injector and a tank similar to the hyperion you dont know that invulns take cap and eanms dont and that in pvp you generally want mwdptweb stop efting and starting playing on tq dude glad to see other people backing me up that 8 low slot hyperion is crazy blasters could use a slight buff but the hype is fine it fills a niche and if you dont like it then fly the insanely powerful domi and mega
if you had proposed switching rep bonus to resist bonus i would have supported this thread
so we get what a blaster fitted abbadon vaal erityes shield tanking ships do have trouble fitting points webs etc however they get the benefit of fitting many more damage mofs and tracking computers in case they need any withought hurting their tank magistrate aribeth i just wont comment on your post i dont think there is any need and just for your information thrasher can 1shoot npc frigates as well
i have amarr bs5 and ive had gallente bs5 for a long time i cant imagine any realistic scenario when id take a hype over an abaddon  or hell a geddon the only time ive stepped into my hype recently was to wtfpwn a maelstrom why did i fly the hype because it was in the next system and i started the fight in a crusaderif thered been an abaddon 2 jumps away id have strongly considered flying the extra distance to pick it up instead as a general rule the hype is an inferior pile of  next to an abaddonliang
blasters need fixing and after that still the hyperion would suckin a few days ill have shield skills at 5 and then ill get into my old hyperion thats just wronghyperion needs a large pg boost badly thats a minimum838 slots would be fine since the hyperion is imensly underpowerd so a realy massive boost is neededgalenteblasters are currently only good in eftwars and hyperion isnt eaven good at that
id like to see anyone maintain a dual rep tank on a hype with only one cap boosterhype needs a slight boost to powergrid and an extra bonus to its rep amount nothing more nothing lessturning it into a geddon isnt the way to go and really goes against the grain
yes yes yes make that 2nd bonus worth the massive price tag increase pg and increase rep ammount bonus to 9lvl 9 would only push max bonus out to 45 a mere 75 more than current enough pg to fit a full rack of ions with 2 x lar mwd lge cap booster and med cap booster to keep those reppers running hyperion would then be a fair ship for its price though id love 10lvl but thatd cause too many tears
get out if youre gonna give the maelstrom more mids you sure as hell better give the rokh more mids too we have to compete with speed mods  tackle on a platform thats slow as hell and uses cap hungry guns

yep
this seems useful
this fix would help both in pvp and in pvemissions often blood raiders use nos and theres no way to detect it if you have effects turned off other than by watching your cap drain away please add this feature to the list

i have two words for level 5 mission running natural selection i say ccp ought to allow a few level 5 agents in key systems to bait those who think bigger is better the wise ones will realize that level 4 missions are many times more profitable while the stupid ones will continue to be totally oblivious to having a negative isk flow after all most if not all level 5 missions are garbage anybody who runs them hisec or not needs to have his head examinedi fully support this great opportunity to allow darwinism into the mission running sector
you are very wrong herecurrently i am doing l5 outside of my alliance control zone and i am in greater profit that any 00 citizens can hope for even though it is pretty risky now to do missions at where i aml4s in highsecs cant give even half of my current income yes thats include realy profitable highsec systems like aphendoh realy so you said that 86k lp which can be done in 15 minutes of blitzing l5 and then doing about 170m isk out of those 86k lp is garbage

yes but it needs an enabledisable option in esc menu
sure as long as we can give the ferox 50mbit50m3 and a 7th turret slot
since the conclusion from above is that its not the brutix thats lacking slots but actualy its the myrmidonant thats ok according to everyone including me because the myrm is good and balancedbut brutix isnt ok and balanced its lacking and subparmake the brutix the exception among tier 1 and give it some extra slots just like the myrm is the exception to tier 2 with less slots
myrmidon is a drone ship  traditionally a drone bonusand the corresponding bandwidthbay are worth a slot and the brutix is the best tier 1 bc  yeah its short a slot on the cyclone but ill take seven guns with a bonus over splitweapon nonsense any day
imho neither of the tier one bcs is lacking well flown they are very efficient ships each of them can do around 500dps some even more eg a gank brutix can get up to 900dps and bring a decent tankbuffer to the fieldand seriously saying that the brutix needs a buff is crying on a very high level
its hard to fit britux properly espeshially for a lowsp player however it can be flown very well now there is an issue with it being shield tanked but thats different that is not solved by adding slots
the idea is simple if ccp gets a petition or on their own suspects a bot they can convo the personany player actively playing must answer when pmed by a dev actively playing mining itself is not actively playing but once you warp to a station or jet can your ore or a host of other things that require interaction then you are actively playingthis could work for trade bots too if someone buys a contract and immediately relists it is it a bot or a person theyre now one convo away from knowingyes this would require employees maybe even some new hires im sure they already have ppl looking for such things this is just one more tool they can use

 and this is where it will never happensupported anyways
its not that simple though i wish it werefirst of all because anything can be programmed into a bot and second because they have to err on the side of caution if i am mining and get up to get a beer spill the beer and have to clean up the kitchen floor you would have me bannedif i am on voice with my fleet or corp and have chat minimized you would have me bannedif i am managing by buysell orders and have the chat window covered up you would have me bannednot so simple is it

1there are ships with launchers and missiles just burst out from underneath them i would definitely like to see more missile animations and more hitboxes than just the center of the ship like they do with turretsscrambling what about an effect that l
i do supportespecially the turning off of effects would be nice to have pereffect option for self and othersabmwd effectsanimations and engine trails for velocity vector indication and overall coolness factor
lots of awesome in this thread so no way it happensbeam weapons have such an amazingly pronounced effect and sound compared to the other weapons so can we get a more pronounced effects for hybrids and projectilesfiring a large hybrid sounds like blowing a spit wad through the tube of a ballpoint pen med rails sound great for example projectiles sound like you shot the spit wad at a piece of tin foil suspended from the ceiling and recorded it hitting the graphic effects of both also need to be increased slightly more pronounced streak for both and the firing effect increased in size and duration by about 25little rings from hybrids and fireball for projectiles
face it ccp there are a lot of ships out there that just look butt ugly some hardly make sense even im not saying you should make boring symmetrical ships because we all know how you absolutely despise being symmetrical but could you listen to your user base and give our ships a face lifta few ships i and a lot of people have a big problem withimiscusgriffondominixthanatosmoanavitasdo i ever see these ships in any of your advertisements no and the reason is obvious if peoples first impression of eve were any of these ships theyd cringe and youd loose potential customers you know this that is why ships like hyperion megathron and myrmidon appear in your ads because theyre appealing to the eyesorry if it appears i am only talking about gallente ships for the most part but they are the only ones i really fly and see a lot of

its not just smart bombs that get this problem with asteroids if your shooting a roid with anything but a mining laser expect trouble especially if your in high sec and if you dont believe me get in your mining ship and shoot a roid with drones  see what concord does to your mining ship and your droneswhich can very easily happen if you misclick to engage a target thats already dead and you switch to next target in a miners case 910 its a roid p
im quite shure that i warp scrambled an asteroid by accident once and survivedso how is that not sanctioned by concord and smartbombing a rock isagree with the op and the above posts that smartbombing rocks should be fixeddont agree with the op that smartbombs are useless or that high slots are useless and dont agree that sbs need to be buffed with new skills sbs are very usefull in a lot of situations and work very well hi slots are eaven more usefull than smartbombs
said rock must be in a mission zonego ahead and try it there 
so its made on purpose nice
so what this thread is really suggesting is that concord is a broken warped mechanic and need to be removed from the game asap
agreed smartbombs could use some love new types and uses maybe decloaking pulsebut it is possible to use them to effect in highsec as long as you pay attention to where you are and where people are ive used them in missions for fun smartie vexor in lvl 1s and 2s is hilariousby the way nothing happens when you do shoot a rock even with the warning dont trust me get yourself a noob ship and try it out i assure you nothing will happen funny to have an amarr ship and act like your mining with the corp only to really have lazers good for bait also but only on really dumb people
well i know the issue of insurance has been mentioned a few times however the amount of caps titans etc now in fleet fights is crazy to be honest its just bring a cap and 20 titans and slug it out  cos we can  without really any consequence its ok they are insured attitude is just a bit mental fleet fights should be thought out processes not bring everything you can and slug it out bringing things like we seen 32 titans is just a joke tbh sorry it isremoving insurance removes this we have a billion caps to bring  theres no real consequence to fleet battles attitude especially when you can just go get another if you die
bringing just lots of caps and hoping to win is a very bad tactic there are examples of big capital fleets being slaughtered by small ones im not going to look them up for you but they are out therewhat you do when you remove the insurance of caps is hurt the little man because most carriers and dreads are privately owned not all alliances can provide capitals for all their capital pilots or can they just get another onealso i would like you to point me to one titan or mothership which is insured because this is mainly what your post is about

it sure would be nice if ccp could maintain a list of common game mechanics i cant tell you the number of bugs i have found accidentally which i thought were game mechanics ccp expects the players to know most of the mechanics but no one in the game on either side of the interface knows them all my proposal is for the mechanics to be documented so players and ccp have a reference on intended game mechanics if game mechanics are documented players can make reference to specified mechanicsa long time ago there were assorted posts that explained damage calculations and other nuggets of information but the assorted documents were never updated i am not sure if complexity was the issue or the fact that no one really understands or documented them all
asking for game mechanics is like asking for the laws of physics to be documented and typed up and posted herewith mathematical proofs and the whole nine yardsgood intentions or not not gonna happen
simple idea we got wikieveonlinecom we the players could just start documenting things we know also collecting links to external documentation gridfu egthoughts
ccp long ago did document a good portion of the missile tracking and misc other combat mechanics its not like they are sending a man to the moon they used to provide it and then stopped if you dont know how things are supposed to work it makes it very hard to provide several hundred thousand people as qaqc testers when a baseline is not provided

theyre already pretty paper thin  going even moreso would make them hard to use as theyre 650mil each losing even one of them means that you lost the battle so they have to be a little resilient
dude ure using reallife references as solutions to your problems in a game the thing is in a game u can do things u cant do in the real world get a grip damn
i notice you fixed something that didnt need fixing as its totally missing the point made of course it makes discussing much easierthe main point is  carebears live in high sec to be reasonably safe from ganking  of course you can never be entirely safe in this game but if you are ganked you should either get an insurance of equal proportions to that of the ganker or failing that the ganker should not get a full recovery on the tool used in a criminal actthe other main reason that your fix is invalid is that it isnt really a real choice on the ganked player to play the game as heshe intends ie as a dedicated miner eg you need to get ships of a certain value to make it worthwhile to gank someone you dont need to make the same investment and to add insult to injury they are almost fully reimbursed by game mechanics
it seems to me and this is just my opinion that the only party here that is going to loose by a rule change is the gankers they get their cake and eat it to it is a reward from the game for being a ganker since they get insurance and your loot it is obvious that the game supports this of course they are going to do everything they can to protect that i would
no more riskless suicides this is getting out of hand
10
1 exactlyu cannot be entirely safe in high sec but heres the thingits up to the ganker to decide whether or not to do so all u have to do is not make yourself a prime target to entice him further if u dont fly an expensive uninsureable ship its within reason to say u wont be worth ganking a slight effort on your part makes all the difference to be reasonably safe2 this reimbursement policy should change on the sole reason that the system is 05 sec if it was ccps intention to take the game in that direction u propose they wouldve changed it so u cannot even fire on other players in high sec at all3 fix is valid because u do not need a t2 200 mil mining ship to make it worthwhile especially since ull be afk making it so why exaggerate about the rate if u dont even have to do most of the work ure only letting t2 be your crutch by thinking u have to swear your life by it guess what u dont sure u can gamble the 200 mil for little more efficiency its your choice but think about it u only mine slightly less with a covetor which is practically zero loss if it gets blown up and because of that u dont even need to worry about fitting low slot tank mods and just go for the cargo expanders or even a mining upgrade because it wont even be worth ganking and whoever still decides to shoot u down is either a moron or u did something to deserve it in which case u can either laugh at him or u got what was coming to u respectivelyto suicide someone it takes lots of combat skillpoints which doesnt finish in a day or a lot of ppl who r willing to do the same thing with u and grind the sec status back up and i mean actual ppl not the multiboxing u can do with mining it may be a different investment but its still an investment and it all hinges an unwitting victim being at the wrong place at the wrong time under the wrong circumstances not a constant reliable stationary object u can count on to be there all the time to make isk theres no 100 guarantee that u will down the target or u knowing exactly how much firepower u would need before its a waste and every attempt u make comes with a 100 guaranteed penalty and even if u do down the target theres no guarantee ull get the loot before someone else beats u to it eitherone thing thats constant in eve is the risk u take by using a ship or mod that boosts your efficiency by a degree the higher the efficiency gained by the item the higher the loss u incur by losing it even in high sec the degree of efficiency and risk of keeping that efficiency is your choice

sounds well thought and good ideas i like the black market and the own system idea
i agree 100
im suprised someone hasnt shot you down because youre trying to base stuff on real liferealism id watch the references as its a big no no to some peopleanyway we have several dry dock options ship maint array just because you cant sit in it like a station doesnt mean thats not how it works you store your ship inside the array lots of room in a pos to offload that pesky crew who makes no difference to how the ship functionsi view the ship maintenance array just like i would docking in a station just doesnt have a docked graphic yes you sit in space while you swap things but thats not how i see it working you still dock to get things swapped on your ship i would guess the way the code it written you have to be in the ship to change it same as if youre in a station if that wasnt the case you could choose a ship in the array and swap moduals then board it notice its board as in get out and move to this shipthat is why i think t3 should be just as configureable its stupid that you can build them but you cant put one together in whole space
only makes sense you should be able to utilize the abilities of ships in the area where their components are found

im tornon the one hand raising the security status was one of the early goals of placid reborn back in the day back when a sufficiently interesting group of roleplayers could get enough ccp attention to actually influence the storyline  the plight of placid and the existence of the separatists became canon eventually a more general proposal then involved developing game mechanics so that players could dynamically influence a systems sec status depending on pirate vs antipirate activityon the other hand changing it now would deminish some rather interesting rp angles and might come with unforeseen consequences as the storyline team finds reasons to make that 300 year old request for isolation less unreasonable given the current status of the gallente likewise i think it has a snowballs chance in hell but i suppose its worth asking

i believe your opinion in regards to the suggested 10lvl is misguidedif you compair the cyclone with an active tank vs an ehp tank you would realize that asking for the bonus to become 10 is the bare minimum it needsif you dont understand then perhaps you should ask liangliang had a good understanding of tanking activepassiveehp

tired of coutless posts about why my black ops arnt like chuck norris i would like to offer some more realistic ideas about boosting black ops rolesyes they have less dps then t1 bss as they should they have less tanking capability and so onso no they do not need more weapon slots they do not need higher bonuses for dps they do not need higher t2 resistances or tanking bonuses they do not need covert ops cloak stealth aproach with mwd  cloak for now is unique since even bombers lost it well none of bonuses of black opses should be changed they are fine as they are now not perfect may be but fineif you are so stupid to bring black ops on lame role of gate camper for example and then lost it  you earn that lostso what changes need to be done thenwell changes should be done not to black opses themselffirst of all i do remeber very well that ccp mentioned here on forum that they dont mind to make strategic cruisers with covert ops reconfiguration subsystem able to fit covert cyno they even had that ability listed but it didnt actualy worked and scs realy lack of that ability so if you ccp realy dont mind to give them back that ability and make it actualy working  plz dosecond in highsecs you cant engage cyno field and that is quiet understandable i remeber time then ccp brought in black opses but covert cynos wasnt been allowed in 00 systems with cyno jammer as well theyve fix that latter well i think its a time to allow cover cynos in highsecs as well no disbalancing realy you still cant bring cap ships and very few ships able to travel via covert portal yes i know some ppl will use them to portal blockade runner especialy on hard route jitahek but thats not a bad idea after all it is a blocked runners after all they are very hard to catch even without portals and after all portals wont make them 100 uncatchable as for anything else i wont mentioned what great ideas and oportunites can be achieved those who are realy love black opses will find how to use that feature on their own pretty soon those who wont be able to figure it out should try some other ships drake may be and last allow cover cyno in dead space yes i know what does that mean i know how much whine will come after first practical using of covert cyno in ds and since i am myself belong to ehm caste of players who can encounter of consequences after using cover cyno in ds by other players well i feel disgustingly even by thinking of such thing not mentioning offering that idea on forums but still wish to see that change well and having summed upmake scs with covert subsystems able to fit covert cynoallow covert cyno in highsec spaceallow covert cyno in deadspaceand sorry for my english
no to the cyno in highsec

why nothow does this will abuse gameplay
hot dropping should remain something for lowsec00
some people prefer empire wars because they dont need to fear random hot drops that totally unbalance all strategy and scoutingalso do you really want to see 10 cynos outside jita station with people dropping in and out all the time
hot droping of black opses and ships that able to use covert portal not the same as capship hot dropingblack opses not cheap less cheap then capital ships not supercapital since insurance wont pay you much they are less capable for open battle even then t1 bss and after all even hot droping can be countermeasured while losing gang of black opses will be real pain in the ass for attackerseven ganking are allowed in highsecs so why not hot drop of bos will be something new and intresting in highsec ofwars and not only
hot dropping a bunch of stealth bombers on a wartarget will be devastating enough we should leave that to lowsec00 really
as i said already bos are not cheap ship with which you can easily pick another bo after losing first one you have to pay not a small summ of money to have an oportunity of hot droping in highsecs also i dont think bo will bring unbalancing in combat it isnt even a t1tier1bs equalas for jitawell may be making jita exlusive systems there covert cynos are not allowed this list can be expanded to amarr oursulaert dodixie rens hekandor prohibiting cover cynos closer then well lets say 50km from stations only in highsecs means you can as usual put covert cyno anythere you want in low00wh
and why wars should be safe war is war best you can do durring it if you wont actualy to participate in it is to go to lowsec 00 or even better whspace for a while not mentioning simply leaving the corp for short periodotherwise you will be in dire threat no matter of presence of such hot droping or absence of it
so current empire wars are mainly station camping with rr alt friendson top of that we add neutral covop alt hot droppingyes a very welcome change to the game

i dont mine because its really boring but maybe there are a few ways to make it more interesting perhaps figuring out the mining pattern of a field for instance in the oil sands they have to approach each day and plan out their dig where each shovel will come from or checking roids for composition and whether they are worth mining instead of knowing right off the bat what the roids are and what theyll give or perhaps making the logistics of mining itself be more interesting then targetpointshootwait there are many interesting games dealing with just logistics and planning railroad tycoon comes to mindand it seems mining should seek methods to utilize this type of activity to make it fun
i too would like to hear if and what ccp is actually doing to improve the mining experiencetbh i doubt they are doing much at all atm for some reason other stuff always seems to get priorityshow teh mining sum luv1
well you didnt even get the last news about ccps improvements to mining which will be added to the game why should ccp say it againfor all who missed it we will get planet ring mining comet miningfor both ccp said it wont be doable by macro miners and will involve lots of player interaction hope this helps
well since i started playing eve over 2 years ago i have heard a lot being said about improving mining but seen very little implemented
did you even read my postsince mining interaction have been neglected for so dang long it would be really nice to see the csm ask ccp about what they are actually getting doneif they say that theyre aiming for getting something out next expansion less pewpew crap more mining or its currently in a status of soon which essentially means once everything else is done including all bugs ever well look at itsometimes it seems like ccp are just throwing out random ideas and looking how much player feedback theyre getting through forums perhaps and then prioritizing different projectsessentially what are thier priorities finish planetary interaction launch dust 514 make t3 ships for all sizes frigs bss carriers etc reducing lag rofl adding new shiny crap that no one cares about and then work on improving mining
because the thrasher can shoot up to 120km this was about railguns supposedly having bad tracking not whether or not somebody can one shot something my saying i could was saying that the railguns have tracking that works just finebecause the abaddon can shield tank and the hyperion cant rightif you can find me an abaddon with more than 1290 dps and effectively have 133k ehp let me knowblasters hit hardest of all close range weaponrynot including missiles because caldari are cheaters d  theres nothing wrong with them they have lower falloff and worse tracking because thats what they do theyre not autocannons theyre not pulse lasers theyre blasters each race has its versatility and this is what blasters came to be ccps not going to change anything in this thread as its just a bunch of complaining about things that have been the way they are for 4 years or more alsoccp is not blizzard they wont succumb to unwarranted complaints like they do read above statements last line to see what i mean by unwarrantedhyperion doesnt need a pg boost use rigs838 would make it another amarr battleship would ruin its stability and utility pvp hyperion can be armored tanked albeit rather weak but it would have a web scram 2 injectors and a mwdshield hyperion would have 2 lse and 3 invulns dcii with 3 cdfe rigs giving it a 133k ehp eft tank with 1291 dps with neutron iis 4 magnetic field stabilizers and a relay loaded with cnam and hammerhead iisnow give it 838 impossible now to shield tank only has room for a web scram and mwd or scram mwd and an injector sure it has more lows but you know what most of them are going to be going towards hardeners and relays putting you in the same situation as before because your beloved proposal of removing mediums got rid of its utility so there goes your cap stability out the window and now youre prepared to be neutralized to death by a curse or dominix nice huh i certainly think so 1100 from a lar ii isnt enough while the other ships have to already suck at armor repping times two mind you so 2200
838 is insaneshield tanked ship with armor rep bonus is strange is it847 is more logical 7 low slots are for armor tanking 4 med slots are for web  scramdis  abmwd  cap booster
it isnt uncommon shield tanked myrm can be pretty hard to break
whether its strange or not its doable its viable and people do it just like people that armor tank ravens for wormholes or sometimes even pvp just like people who use blasters on prophecies no it doesnt have a gun bonus i realize this youre probably thinking as you read this so it makes it perfectly fine to use any guns on it indeed and this is also the case for shields on the hyperion despite the armor repairing bonus if its doable then its a viable method shield tanking a hyperions been a way of pvp since revelationsedited out something i said carry on
847 makes it a mega only differenti like the option to shield tank iti like the option to run mwd web scram injector and then have an eccm or another injector or some other ewar
why it is doable and viable on hyperion may be because armor tanking is not definitely better than shield tanking even considering ship bonus imho it is not good
pardon me but 235 and thats all the mid slots a hype has where oh where art thou my mwd simply put an abaddon will smoke you every single time if you bring that shield hype to a fight and in a gang you wont deal any damage to anyone but the first primary if that lets try this again realisticallyhyperion gank hypemagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iitracking enhancer iitracking enhancer iidamage control iiquad lif fueled i booster rocketsshadow serpentis warp scramblerlarge shield extender iiinvulnerability field iiinvulnerability field iineutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge lneutron blaster cannon ii caldari navy antimatter charge llarge core defence field extender ilarge core defence field extender ilarge core defence field extender iogre ii x4103k ehp 1292 dps  5820abaddon pvp abaddonheat sink iiheat sink iiheat sink ii1600mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates ienergized adaptive nano membrane iienergized adaptive nano membrane iidamage control ii100mn microwarpdrive iwarp disruptor iiheavy capacitor booster ii cap booster 800fleeting propulsion inhibitor imega pulse laser ii imperial navy multifrequency lmega pulse laser ii imperial navy multifrequency lmega pulse laser ii imperial navy multifrequency lmega pulse laser ii imperial navy multifrequency lmega pulse laser ii imperial navy multifrequency lmega pulse laser ii imperial navy multifrequency lmega pulse laser ii imperial navy multifrequency lmega pulse laser ii imperial navy multifrequency llarge trimark armor pump ilarge trimark armor pump ilarge trimark armor pump iogre ii x2hammerhead ii x2hobgoblin ii x1134k ehp 1126 dps  1510 abaddon advantages much much better range outdamages the hype past 10km yay falloff similar damage instant ammo switch doesnt rely on a mwd to get into range much better tackle more ehp can reasonably be rred and makes good use of it better implant availability slaveshype advantages better absolute tracking but much worse effective damage at range faster slightly more agile slightly more theoretical dps where it cant really track so welllet me reiterate the hype is a steaming pile of  next to an abaddonliang
nothing wrong here it just gives people the chance for out of the box set ups
i give up lol nobody can accept the reality that the hyperion is not crap it may not be as useful as every other ship with certain jobs because its not meant to be until you realize this i wish safe skies to all of you who oppose reality youre going to need it i will leave you with this thoughgive up this thread ccps not going to look twice at your suggestions because the hyperions been the way it has been for 4 years its design is flawlessmagistrate aribeth signing out
now it becomes a problem when those out of box setups are the only setups that work but it still inst a problem right its a useless ship just live with it sarcasmi agree that having options is nice but first the ship need to do its job powegrid boost is needed for sure then maybe slot layout change or increase in the repair bonus
never really understood why it wasnt this way in the first place supported
supported should have been in with all ewar right away
no brainer
always wondered why these were left out
just make the timer 23hrs it sux jump cloning only to have to wait past the time you did so the next day it follows suit with a 237 eve uptimeeither way something needs to change so supported for change
i also approve however i believe 12 hours is a happy medium
just a 5 hour reduction at lvl5 for a rank 10 skill would be enoughsupported in principle numbers may need tweaking as suggested
i think i supported an older version but so supported
10 or even 15 reduction per skill level would result inlvl 0  240010 reduction15 reductionlvl 1  21362024lvl 2  19121648lvl 3  16481318lvl 4  14240936lvl 5  12000600make it a high rank skill something like 12 or 14 even
there is nothing wrong with blobbing and they will be the same size no matter what the fleet limit is by increasing the size you will simply increase the variety of tactics that can be used and that will make eve batter for all of us honesty atm people just run 4 fleets at a time no one is put off form bringing numbers because of some 256 small man sized game mechanic 256 was made the limit not to limit fleets but simply because that was the greatest fleet size imagined of at the time
thats a good thing btw it plays on what eve can do that no other game can do
this is a great idea and people have been asking for it for a long time i think some of the problems would be a very big jump in database size when all of a sudden every bodies hanger develops six or seven separate divisionswe could probably fix that by making the number of extra tabs in your hanger skillitem dependent say an extra tab in your hanger and cargo hold per level of inventory management skill or however many inventory management nodes you have installed there
excellent
he says it all make high sec areas that are past null sec which would make a diverse and fun marketing environmentdiscuss below how this would be done within eves storyline and factions that could hold said high sec areasif you dont like the idea please explain why
interesting idea in my opinionbtw i think this idea belongs in features and ideashow big would the new high sec area be and would there be a new faction originating there severalthat would make eve bigger and introduce a highly contested piece of null sec space between the high sec areas the holding sov in that new part of null sec could chose to block passage or only impose a small fee on those who want to pass their space
rather than just have more hisec id much rather see differentsec  with different conditions applyingfor example tortugalike piratesec zones where the different pirate factions interact with each other rules of engagement would be very different from empire with no concord as such but considerably stronger more aggressive and more vindictive faction police pirate faction standings would be very important in this space this would make them a kind of halfway status between hisec and losecthese would also be a great opportunity to introduce pirate faction warfareand then of course there are the sleepers
if and when new regions are introduced it could be an interesting idea to see isolated pockets of lowsec or highsec amongst the 00 spacethe question is do we need more space at all considering that most of 00 and lowsec and wormhole space although the lack of local or map functions makes it hard to tell is already deserted wouldnt it be a better use of development time to make those areas attractive rather than dilute the population density even further with more space

hmm so maybe i should actualy try it it never got of the eft fitting screen for me i was too disapointed in the stats also shield tank might work
facepalms thank you for your contribution to the discussion
what about scripts for websleave unscripted webs as they are now but add script so you can increase range but at a lower speed reduction lower range but increase speed reduction in general the current web is a bit under powered but due the ability to stack multiple on one target boosting the effect of one would be imho to muchscripting though would allow a higher variety in engagement distance and fuzzing the simple avoid 75 for scrams avoid 10k for webs avoid 20 for disruptor engagementssupported as a discussion could be health with scripting as option
scripted webs i like pmy 100120km range fleet boosted rapiers especially would love them
scripted webs sound interesting indeed
that depends on a bit of number crunchingeg extending range for 50 but at the same time reducing the speed reduction for 50 would imho still balance the extended range you still couldnt really point something at 60km with a faction web even if you add another 50 to that range so your opponent would be still able to warp out also the speed reduction would be 50 lower than at normal range
your backstory is a bit off here mwd supposedly works by creating a partial warp bubble allowing your ship to slip through space more easily not pulsing a warp bubble on and off the warp bubble is supposedly created by evacuating a pocket of space of all energy scrams prevent warp by filling the space with energy undoing the work the warp drive is trying to do to form the bubblei really like the idea of scriptable webs or maybe a web boost amp module
it is as simple as i put it this idea works best if ccp has the ability to ghost themselves into an area while i dont know for sure id be surprised if they didnt it is practically inconceivable to me that they cant actively watch a specific account at worst they can tell where your at and what you are actively doingif i am mining and get up to get a beer spill the beer and have to clean up the kitchen floor you would have me bannedno because if you are cleaning beer you arent active under my definition you must be actually doing things to be considered active so your lasers are on but your not there fine your afk not a problem you warp away to store the ore well then your active and should be able to respondif i am on voice with my fleet or corp and have chat minimized you would have me bannediirc you get a pop up when someone pms you i always have anyway if not its easy enough to add that to the list of dev powers dev chats supersede any and all options set by the account userif i am managing by buysell orders and have the chat window covered up you would have me bannedno again for the same reasons as the second question it wouldnt be difficult for a dev chat to appear differently then normal pms obviously they would have to implement this in a way that couldnt be blocked and would be noticed regardless of player settings because the dev is actively monitoring your in game responses ie they can tell if your inputting commands any harmful interference risk would be minimized by this i mean they wouldnt be bugging you in the middle of pvp or something of that natureedit to respond to anything can be programed into a bot this is what makes this idea work you can not program infinite responses to unknown questions a 1 min convo is more then enough to determine if its a human or if its a bot
i dont know how devgm chats work but im somewhat sure that its most definitely not just something that goes to be minimized  its probably more like a popup downtimestyleit should also be pretty recognisable of how far the timeout should be  if youre moving ore and not responding obviously youre either not very smart or a macro
talk to me or ill ban youplay this crappy minigame or ill ban youclick 15 more times a minute or ill ban youall nonsolutions
only the first has been proposed here its not something that would be automatic odds are you could play for months or years and not have it happen its another tool to determine with absolute certainty if someone is a bot or not the alternative is what happens now every once in a great while the most obvious macros are banned most trade bots never are the smarter macro miners never will bei would rather have the minor inconvenience of a 13 min convo once in a great while then live with the constant and ongoing effects of a massive macro presence
i can see it now future mutant goes afk for 10 mins and gets bannedwin win for allyep smooth move exlax
i really wish ppl would at least read the first post before deciding goodbad if you had you would clearly see the part about needing to be actually doing things inputting commands before they could declare you unresponsive ie a bot
if youre afk you arent activatingdeactivating any modsand youre not dockingand youre not modifying market ordersyou might get blown up what is it with you people and afkbans
supported as long as the dev could tell if its a good time to bother me dont want to talk to one in the middle of a fleet fight
i did i suggest you read your own writing and take into account the number of things that goes on when people are afkthis is why such stupid proposals will never flylast thing i want to happen is to be mining at a rock go afk come back just in time and some mysterious lag spike kicks in i get convod the idiot at the backbone trips over the ethernet cable and i get banned because of some idiot whose name is undisclosed oh were sorry for the inconvenienceplease think before you go ranting about macros you people make me laugh and cry all at oncebtw you do know you can script responses rightyeah i figured as much
you think you can script a response for an infinite amount of questions id like to see thatsupporting what is the least intrusive most useful tool ive heard of so far
yeahbut your assuming that ccp will use an infinite of questionslook up the various chat clients that have ais programed to respond to questions like its a natural convo real life stuff big time youd be surprised what you could pull off with a bit of programmingso what are you saying were going to get asked questionswhat questionswhen did this get so complicated againis everyone that dense these days when it comes to rational thinkingor is it your just so bitter that you want macros banned any way you can all the while taking it out on the guys who mine legitimatelyyeah i see what you did thereplease people try to get to first gear before you hit the gas pedal eh
you disagree with the idea but havent come up with any reason why other then you think it will effect actual players more no where in the suggestion does it even suggest bothering miners at random if ccp suspects a macro this is a new way for them to checkin your infinite wisdom you try to act like you know  without actually writing anything worth reading at least detail why you dont like an idea other then your holier then thou nonsensetldr ccp already uses measures to ban macros its a difficult and time consuming task this is just one more tool they can use
cause its a bad ideait just is mateas for scripted responses you wouldnt even need any ai with 5 or 6 somewhat noncommittal responses a user often cant turning test a bot effectively many icqmsn spam bots for example just have pause periods and preset responses its easier then ai chatter bots and works just as well for short conversationsits a bad idea the falsepositives are too high and it proves nothing in relation to macro usefails on all counts and doesnt solve anything
i think your overestimating the capabilities of a chat bot that would be usable to the average user but thats a concern at least if used successfully then you would get a false negative not a false positive the only way you could get a false positive is something along the lines of what drak described somehow in between the time the dev convos you and you input a command proving to the dev your online you become unable to respond distracted or dced ccp would have to use their judgment as they do know they already use methods to punish macros this would just add another way to differentiate between a person and a botthis would not be a magic solution to macros they shouldnt punish at the first sign of inactivity but if they convo you and you ignore them for 20 mins while you continue to place buysell orders i would consider that as proof of botting or proof of ignoring the newest rule that one must answer a devs pmninja edit the phrase you were thinking of is turing test
no im saying your method does zero to stop a macroit would however punish those that have never run a macroas for chatter bots im saying you dont even need to code one just need to respond to the gm with im busy  off and let me play my game then when the gm says i need you to respond it says ive responded now  offthat doesnt take any special ai or advanced codingreally mate this is an amazingly bad idea poorly concieved not thoughtthrough and generally lacking in any merit or chance of a positive outcome
check out an aim screen name called smarterchild
suicide ganking is the most effective mechanism to combat afk macros available
even if that was true it does absolutely nothing for trade botschecked out the bot someone mentionedsmarterchild changed his status to offline in may 2009 and officially retiredit was never an installable program while ai like this do exist most are at universities on computers much larger then a desktopthis idea has been done successfully on other games it is not overly invasive and much better then alternatives ive heard i dont believe complacency is the answer we obviously have an increasingly large macro presence and traditionally used methods are unlikely to do more then make a temporary dent but hey show me what a bad idea it is by coming up with one thats better
the bot its based on is alice i believe which is freely availablejust so very wrong there is nothing too cpu intensive about chatter bots while there are thousands available for use in anything from desktop im apps to apis for your own programming you could even get chatter bots for your 64k ram computer in 1979this isnt runescape have you seen how much they butchered that game with an overzealous focus on antimacro stuff ccp has their methods for checking up on people they know what theyre doing unholy rage banned a large number of accounts with limited falsepositivesbetter idea for dealing with macroswork on the demand side with great fast usable ui that gives no one a reason to macroor you could just add a bunch more hurdles to make it even more painfulsolve a captcha each time you put in a market order no thanx
so your way of dealing with macros is not to deal with macros great thats helpful well at least you didnt suggest what you did in another thread automated mining isnt a solution btw thats what a macro isand where do you keep getting the solve a capcha nonsense this has nothing to do with captcha and isnt an automated system at all anyway its not something you have to do before you can do something else
question for the opdev sends me the convo  does that block my clicking of other buttons on the screen iow am i still going to be able to click to activate modules or warp out of somewhere or something like that or is this going to be a modal window that blocks me from accessing the screen behind it while its presentreserving judgment until i get an answer
its a bit open ended depending on implementation best case scenerio they would be able to tell what you are doing and where and would avoid bothering ppl in combat probable scenerio a convo box pops up hopefully stacked with your other convo boxes and not interfering with anything im not entirely sure how pm popup boxes work now if you have to accept or decline before any other action is possible or not i would think it could be implemented in a way that minimizes interference while being impossible not to notice but i cant say how it would end up if implemented
nice trap de hehe gotta love software engineersprogrammerstime for you to go back to the drawing board kid you obviously didnt put much thought into thishell youve ignored everyones arguments on the matter and while i dont particullary like dr battlesmith hes right total waste of time and yes ive seen alice in action freaky stuff had a college mate show one of his chat programs to me freeeaaaaaky stuff
ive ignored you because you havent added anything constructive calling someone kid doesnt make you sound more intelligent it makes you sound like an idiot im sorry your life is so lacking you balance it out with your internet epeen but not my problem if you have anything to add other then wont work then by all means post itas for artificial ai programs the very best can and have be defeated with 10 questions or less even assuming someone comes up with a chat bot great enough to pass muster then it would be a negative result and no harm donethis is by no means a solution to ending botting it simply adds another tool to their list of tools they already have and use i know of many ppl who dont bother to report suspicious activity because as they put it nothing will be done anyway let the players report suspicious activity and have the devs sort through evidence and come to a conclusion in a timely manner one mass ban a year is hardly timely and is nothing more then a baid aid approachstill waiting on your suggestion to the problem at least battlesmith posted his though i disagree with the feasibility of a ui rework its not a bad idea i question its effectiveness in ending botting though bots exist not because the game is hard they exist to exploit the game tldr i get it you dont think it will work reposting the same sorry insults over and over doesnt make you right or me wrong
i guess my point is i obviously dont want to be stopped from performing actions in the middle of say morduus headhunters or trying to get away from a gatecamp or any other situation where a seconds pause where i cant act can result in the loss of my ship and if we cant provide some insurance that this wont happen i cant support this proposal
even worse is that he doesnt understand the nature of the bots at alla bot running a screen sc can be programed to alert an operator to a chat window alert or anything else of the sort hell it could probably bring the client in question to the top as well so anyone setting at the computer could instantly respond yes this would stop the 237 bots if they are unmanned but since a lot of the bots are run by gold farmers its likely that they are manned at all timesthe bots are not that hard to find though even market botsespecially market bots first because a user simply cant be active 237 for weeks on end without sharing an account which is a violation in the eula and will result in a ban second because a bot cant actually be random even a market bot has to function on preprogrammed parameters and eventually you can spot a pattern in their activity if you do report it to ccp and let them handle it the thing is you cant eliminate bots of any kind the trick is to make programming them to appear like actual players so difficult that there is a significant barrier to entry this will reduce the casual use of bots which is what mining bots were used for in the past mining bots being relatively simple are easier to program to be random and are harder to catch the pattern market ratting and mission bots are significantly more difficult to program and thus are more limited in number however the increased difficulty in programming them makes programming them to appear random just that much more difficult this is where you get into the area of people doing it for money and not an isk advantageno poke or prod is going to really going to work find the pattern and ban the pattern because the interaction can be worked aroundso your motivations are admirable but you dont seem to understand what you are trying to fix its like a file clerk trying to fix a jet engine aint happening
bingo
bump
doesnt add value to the game can not handle any task faster than a skilled player can in fact the only thing it seems to make easier is semiafk play which i would rather see made harder than easieri would rather ccp work on another feature any other featurenot supported
time to change that i totally agree maybe it is intended ingame mechanic and not an exploit but it has the same effect as an exploit you have to sit by and watch another player steal away what you had to work for without being able to fight backall i ask as well is the possibility to fight back without being insta killed by concordif the salvage thief has a stronger ship or corp mates who help him in case of a fight very well then its your problem but this way you would have the chance to do something if you wantright now its just durn stupid and without any fun yes its still a game and it ought to be fun or game balance
the solution is simple  run missions in low or nullsec shoot anyone you want to
i cant believe this wasnt brought up before the derailyour argument and basis of understanding the situation is actually wronghere well use your mining analogythe miner shoots the rockthe ore is hisyou are correct about thatfollow me now it gets difficult herethe salvager shoots the wreck with the salvage gunthe salvage is hisexactly like the ore scenario you describedin your own example you perfectly show the parallelsasteroid is to wreckasore is to salvage materialsa miner shoots a rock and any other miner can come up and shoot that rock and take ore off of it faster than he can and therefore steal the rock just like a salvager can use his salvage gun on the wreck wreckasteroid before the other salvager the guy who shot the pirate to spawn the wreckasteroid can fire his gun on it thereby stealing his ore or salvageits completely even and the same mechanic miners have the only difference is miners only have to shoot rats in a belt to clean it out before they can mine whereas missioners have to shoot rats out of the site before they can oh wait its exactly the same
to the opyour opinion has been heared by ccp several times and ccp is not your opinion and youre welcome to try to change their mindstill then htfu and dont try to come up with any logic real life exploit comparison or game ideas just try to find some more support for your cause as already said ccp is not your opinionfor all those who not support this thread there are several more important issues than to try to argument something which as already been argumented to deathbump something important and let this die the death of page 2
if your missions salvage is so crucial to you use a marauder thentractor beam bonus tanking bonus and uses less ammo you can salvage as you go and not lose out on dpslets face it this is only an issue for hisec mission runners so why not use the expensive ship custom built for exactly this purposefor the record not supported
just to get rid off any mis conceptions on the matteryou will never get rid off macro bots or hacks never every file and program is no more then 1s and 0s and can be backwards engineered and will be for as long as there are nerds and bored students just because we can you can make it harder use encryptions put in scanners and so onthis will cost money need upkeeping and possibly make things slower do you want to pay more to play just to make it harder to macro mine or ask yourself do i need more lagg just to prevent a basement nerd from marco mining people that get payed for it will just work around the problem anywayany solution how simple it may seem can be very complicated or take a lot of time to implementand now oke say we get rid of all the macro miners do i really want to pay 2 times more for my pvp ships i dont do youand what is the problem are macro miners really making the game less fun for you or are you jealous that they make more isk being afk then youyou can do all the posting and crying in the world that will not change how people are and that there are macro miners get used to it and move on same thing with antiwar rallies dont be antiwar be propeace se serion
yes please just a minor thing but would help a lot
im pretty much going to support anything that makes eve look prettier
fixdbeauty is in the eye of the beholder
i might not be able to speak for the moa thanatos and navitas but i have heard many people complain about the look of the griffon imiscus and dominix i cant recall ever listening to someone defend the graphics of any of the ships listed
theres a wide variety of ship designs out there yes youll like some more than others no that doesnt mean the others are bad none of the ones you listed are a problem people just like to complain
it seems to me that people are getting more and more frustrated at how the game mechanic of building a nulsec empire and then losing it so easily people love to build things in eve it is a huge part of the game people also want to be able to invade other empires and blow stuff upso how to keep the builders and the destroyers happy idea 1 have an empire capital system and each system from that capital is just a little less defended or easier to take down so lets say you have an alliance like it well their outer systems would be easy to take out but their core systems and capital would be rediculously hard to conquer over a month that way it will also limit the size of empires but allow alliances to at least cling to small ones they put so much work intolets say you are a small alliance and want to put effort into building a well defended group of five systems well it would take a force twice as large or stronger than you to destroy your sov space for example but this same small alliance would have a very hard time expanding into a major empireidea 2 allow empires to lock gate access to systems in their nulsec empire this would limit movement in their empires making conquering them slower and could require a system by system invasion if empires systematically lock down gates also it could be an isk sinklets say it costs 2billion isk a month to lock a gate down this will allow empires who want to protect their inner core awhile to do so by locking the gates to those systems nulsec belongs to players lets kick concord out too pthese are general ideas please add to them or edit them as you think would work the whole point of these two ideas is to allow those who want to build a nulsec empire to do so and allow them to hold a small core of systems longer even if they are invaded it would require a really strong force to destroy someones well defended core systems for example
so i have a nice constellation with just one entrance lock that entrance boom save pocket and nobody can get in even more safe then highsec notice somethingwhat would be the danger of living there then just you farming your upgraded systemsnot supported

will results or an update on the ganking issue be posted in this thread after the iceland meetingi am monitoring this issue for a return to eve if it is sorted thank you cletus
nope results of the iceland summit will be in a new thread not this one this forum thoughfrom previous discussions im certain an outright ban on suicide ganking is unlikely and the probable outcome will be removal of insurance payouts to the gankers even if this is agreed it will be some time before it makes it into game
thanks for the update me and several others have closed our multiple accounts in protest our grievence isnt that ganking be banned but the slap in the face that the gankers are giving the gankee with insurance recouping all of their loss while we donthulkagedon and trade route gate camps proves that point daily our slap back is paying cryptic studios sto instead of ccp if eve is meant to be recreation it isnt from our perspective thanks again i will monitor this forum in the future
i agree let it be able to probe out cloaked ships require astrometrics v 
idea of giving black ops a boost supported but xtover is a tardissue one according to ccp the current databaseserver structuring does not allow people to query the location of cloaked ships everything would have to be overhauled to allow thisissue two even if it were feasible would you really want to break cloaking by allowing anyone to scan down a cloaked ship bad idea and you should feel bad
wow you shoot the messenger too eh how dare someone support a topic you dont agree withcitation neededif theres no query showing how to find cloaked ships however every ship and every item in a system has a coordinate look it up when you make a bookmark its not in place but can be id love to see that quote please find it for meits not breaking cloaking its taking a black ops vessel to hunt down another its a ship that costs anywhere from half to threequarters of a billion isk more than a carrier for example and that currently less people own than own titans in the game less than 300 people fly them and most dont want to train for it let alone spend the iskfirst i love everything cloaky over 90 of my mains kills are in bombersi however also can fly a widow and would love to see it more useful instead of sitting in a station or used as a mobile stargate filled with cargo expanders ozone and isotopes
doesnt work for hulkageddon which was hilarious event btw and similar for the lulzgankers i have a problem with that and the problem is that theyre able to have their lulz for free with almost no penalty the businessdoing suicidegankers also can get away with trivial penalty of kill rights of one individual and minor sec status loss risk versus reward ratio is even better than with missionrunning or mining considering that the risk is trivial and reward is potentially huge as for why the risk is trivial you should know by now but ill address it laterthat would make high sec norisk area currently it isnt that for anyone except suicidegankersso youre saying that miners shouldnt try maximize their effectiveness because an unfair and illogical system is used against them also afkmining isnt any way prohibited actually the way i see it the current mining system encourages to it as theres probably no other equally boring and easily afkable activity in eve if you want afkmining fixed you should ask it elsewhere and yes i think something should be done about mining to make it more interesting and more attentionintensive if done right i might even become interested in mining some dayim pretty sure that its perfectly possible to train a trialtime toon that can suicidegank with great effectiveness against all but welltanked targets like transport ships or hardened hulks destroyers are really easy to get into and you only need the very basic combat skills anyway not to say that highly skilled wouldnt be more effective but lowsp char can be effective enough when it comes to multiboxing im pretty sure that not nearly every miner multiboxes and im also quite sure that many suicidegankers use multiple accounts theres no difference here regarding 100 guarantees you can be 100 sure that even if you fail you havent lost anything except minimal amount of isk and easilyrecoverable amount of sec status while if you succeed you can also be 100 sure to have nice loot and one more juicy killmail in your collection pirates of all forms seem to value killmails above all else in evethats pretty much true and that way it should be also for suicidegankers destroyer isnt expensive even without insurance but its effectiveness is limited battlecruiser or battleship brings much more efficiency also in suicideganking but due to the insurance system the suicide ganker gets this efficiency increase for freeas for the triviality of sec status loss think it this way how long time does it take to recover the lost sec status and how long it takes to gather isk to replace a ganked hulk or industrialload of lost goods or podimplants lost for lulzganking smartbomber i think the first is in order of hours and certainely no more than a day of ratting in 00 if you know what youre doing i dont think you can get more than few dozen millions per day by just mining in high sec even few dozen millions imply highly skilled miner pilot with toplevel equipment which most wont have since you just blew it up sure the miner can also go missioning or ratting to 00 but combat is not his profession unlike yours so hes probably not skilled in it also the lulzgankers are probably blinky pirates anyway so sec status loss is meaningless to them and only way to penalize them is to force them to pay for their lost ships while currently theyre offered free ships
invalid because i dont think its the ship as such youre after but i might be wrong but mostly because of no because the game mechanics are unbalanced strongly in favour of the gankeryour argument is based on the false notion that the hulk is only marginally better than the covetor it simply isnt true which is completely beside the point and has nothing whatsoever to do with the proposal at hand it is  as you are so eager to point out  your choice of using t2 guns and ammo rather than the marginally less effective t1 the key point is that the game mechanics in suicide ganking in high sec is strongly biased towards the ganker rather than the ganked you enjoy all benefits the ganked faces all the consequences as someone pointed out the security hit is easily fixed feck ive gained 1 in sec just by clearing belts in 00 a total of maybe 20 minutes at most mining or come to think of it living in 00 is a constant risk of being shot to itsy bitsy either by reds or by rats its a risk im prepared to take carebears are not prepared to take the same risk else they wouldnt be mining crap ore in a silly place
not to mention you make millions in chaining bs spawns at the wee risk of getting ganked
1 only hulkageddon is broadcasted in advance if u cant do something as simple as heeding the warning its your own fault2 as i told u already the isklulz completely hinges on targets that arent stationary reliable inanimate objects that generate a consistent steady amount of isk it hinges on other ppl who have a brain although not all of them use it its those certain victims that just dont learn from their mistakes that makes it look free if u have a problem with stupidity being punished go to world of warcraft1 nowhat i already said was increasing effectiveness comes with more risks try and put things in perspective for a minute would u faction fit a ship or even go t3 even in the relative safety of your blob would u risk a faction battleship or t3 in a lvl 4 hell lvl 5 ppl do it cause they dont mind the risk for that extra effectiveness its the same exact concept2 u misread because i never said afkmining should be fixed in fact suicide ganking balances afkmining and furthermore its the only thing balancing afkmining u wanna keep badgering about risk vs reward fine advantages 1 tons of free time 2 steady consistent isk every few minutes 3 littleno environmental hazards 4 impossible to screw updisadvantages its obviously boring but thats cancelled by the tons of free time leaving 2 3 and 4 and loss from suicide gankers and thats only if ure flying a t2so if u were to describe mining using the words risk vs rewardwell theres no other risk to it just rewards all ure doing is asking ccp to weaken one profession suicide ganking for the sole reason to eliminate another professions only true riskdisadvantage which u stated u dont even have an interest in making it all reward no riskand if u want to do make isk in a less boring way do missions instead of standardizing every profession into one single uniform game mechanic
1 whats wrong with anyone shooting down a paperthin hauler containing a fortune whose pilot chose to fly a paperthin hauler to protect that fortune2 low sp must be offset by more ppl which takes coordination and teamwork3 theres a big difference between creating alts with several accounts to sink more isk and time to train them as opposed to simultaneously running several accounts at the same time to just generate incomewhile if u succeed u can also be 100 sure to have nice lootwrong i already told u that a 3rd party could be lying in wait to steal it from u and its not practical to attack them in advance eithernevertheless theres still limits to their capabilities which leads to forminng a large fleet which again requires a lot of coordination and teamwork help to this degree is far from freethink of it this way1 how hard is it to switch to a covetor and eliminate any possible losses almost entirely for a slight drop in afk income2 how hard is it to realize that instead of having to replace that hulk u couldve done 13 how hard is it to use a cloaking transport ship4 how hard is it to not autopilot when ure carrying those implants5 u act like a few dozen million daily from an afkprofession is so little considering u can actually afk doing it with no other risks6 so far uve done nothing but ponder what happens when a miner hauler or anyone is too lazystupidcarelessoblivious to even try to protect his assets
so ure saying id attack someone in high sec just becauseso what u want to happen is whoever aggresses anywhere even 00 should lose the possibility of insurance upon losscare to elaborate on that cause apparently u and i have different definitions on marginally yet ppl want to bring up the mechanics of alt training thinking they know everything there is know about it and yes its ones choice to use t2 guns and ammo just like hulk vs covetor everyone has to make these decisions and deal with the risks that come with it the key point is ure looking at this the wrong way its also due to game mechanics that he has to decide whether or not to gank in the first place if ure not worth ganking u wont be ganked that simple rule will steer u clear of any consequences u wouldve faced otherwise and of course u exaggerate sec gains the same way u exaggerate the marginal difference in the ore rate between a hulk and covetor only that crap ore is worth more isk per volume than pretty much any low sec ore available and probably 00 as well all reward no risk were merely instilling that risk
thumbs down mechanics are working as intended you want to be completely safe go play a pve game on a multiserver cluster this one is pvpthis kind of thread has come up lots with very little support for years and nothing has really happened on it at allill make sure to suicide one hulk for every post in this thread supporting it just for lolz
how in fav dietys name did you read that into itwe were i think disucssing suicide ganking in high secno really read haladas mining guide i havent as far as i am aware its still beside the point fixed thative not said dont gank ever my alt would shoot me for it  i couldnt find all the itsy bitsy to put the victims together again anyway so what the fyou basically want to keep your full reimbursment in insurance cool i think its unbalanced nothing prevents you from suiciding you carebears even if you wont get insurance for your ship youll just have to experience how fun it is losing a ship without getting any where close to the cost of a new ship not really no havent got the figures at work so cant check
there is an easy in game fix that has already been implementedminers pay attention to local put on a dcii  shield extenders it wont save you from a half dozen thoraxes but it will save you from three or you can join a corp that mines in nullsecwh and have some protectionthe jita gankeddont carry so much crap in t1 haulers pretty much any t1 hauler can be one shotted by a properly skilled tempest if you max out shield extenders hardeners and a dcii it may take two tempestsif youre carrying upwards of 300 mil in your t1 hauler youre a target max out your shields so it wont be worth it for two people to shoot youanywhere near 500mil and you should be in a transport with extenders and resists ive seen a transport take 3 tempests and a mega and fly away in structure yes 5 tempests will gank any fit you have so make sure whatever youre carrying isnt worth it for five people to lose sec and their bsafter that you get in a freighterits about not playing stupid  not whining to the devs to allow for stupid playif you have a 2bil item thats 5m3 why do you load it into your cargomaxed iteron v put it in a t1 frig no one scans those  and even if they do you can align faster than they can lock and shootif whatever youre carrying is valuable maybe you should get a better ship to carry it  or at least remove the cargo space youre not using and put a frigging tank on i know ive chosen not to shoot targets because theyve got too much tankin conclusion i wish i could contract your tears theyre more valuable than anything else in eve
because high sec is simply only one area of the game the basis for your argument lie in treating high sec as a special place completely separated from the rest of eve that its supposed to be some type of sanctuary guess whatits not or else like i said before shooting other players wouldnt be allowed at all thats why the mechanics favoring the attacker isnt something exclusive to high sec either it applies to all of eveif ure gonna continue to nitpick  and moan about afk income in the first place u might want to try a profession that doesnt allow u to afk as much just to put things in perspectiveits not beside the point if im addressing someone elses argument it is beside the point when as im doing so u think i was talking to u when i obviously wasntu forgot the second part of that then again that parts fine the way it is anywayu dont have to directly say it no one else did what u and the others did was put yourself in a situation where u dont do anything about it well of course its gonna happen and itll continue because u refuse to use the tools and mechanics that r already set yes because like i said before high sec is only one facet of eve not a completely separate area that serves as a sanctuary thats why insurance is reimbursed no matter the location its an intended mechanic and the fun of losing that much guess what uve just experienced what many combat pilots went through when they took the risk of using a t2 ship ure not exempt from this cause its still eve especially considering the nature of your professionnot really no but u cant back that up heres an idea go to the forge region and compare the isk per volume on all the existing minerals notice a certain crap ore on top of that list
ok ill stop here you are taking it against me as a personally so it wont be interesting to feed the trolli never complained about being ganked all times but one chal0ner has been ganked it was due to my own stupidity more or less i have ganked other players in low sec not as this character but as my 2 something alt i dont grief carebears its boringive lived the last several months in wh00space so it becomes pretty pathetic when you argue against me as against high sec living carebears which only shows how much you care about what other people argueive never ever afk mined anything i dont condone and if hulkageddon clears the macro miners from the game i wont shed tears you still dont get the point people are making and you probably never will see the illogical mechanism in killing the gankers ships in high sec and then pay them back in full through insurance and yes high sec is a bit special as that will not happen in low sec unless you are badly tanked near gate guns and such and definately not in 00 if the whole point of eve was too grief miners anywhere there wouldnt be any point in having concord methinksi still think suicide ganking in high sec shouldnt be fully reimbursed nothing youve actually said in this argument has convinced me the game mechanism is fair towards carebears
1 noim just merely clarifying that what ure really doing is asking to being pampered in safety despite your profession being automated as it is not having any natural drawbacks especially in a game where pvp is a major facet furthermore the only measure u have to take to afk in safety and still reap in the isk is a slight downgrade to eliminate any possible losses im not attacking u by making valid points u just refuse to listen2 so uve never complained about being ganked ure only doing the carebears complaining for them3 it doesnt matter if uve never afk mined anythingthe fact is it can be done it has been done its being done and it probably will continue4 wow u cant be serious ure complaining of something that cant happen in low sec00 simply because a lot worse things can happen in there like oh getting blown up no matter what and ure calling me a troll5 ure not convinced more like u just want high sec to be special because u want everything to be handed to u on a silver plattermaximum ore rate complete safety and to top it all off afk time u dont grief carebears because u r one in disguise just like the others if u want everything ull end up with nothing
oh yeah

excellent ideas

totally do it more shortcuts overall would be nice come to think of it
yes
mehmehthis i like except here is the deal tie security status faction status and new skills to getting scanned for illegal goods at the gate and stationas long as its not a pirate faction station then make it so pirate faction implant ammo module etc rewards require the purchaser to have favorable standing with that faction lp and a tier 1 version of the item in question great now you as a pirate have taken a occular standard and changed it into a crystal delta but your sec status and faction standing is so low you cant get through the gate now you need high sec pukes with high standing to haul it to high sec if they want there goodies to pew pew missions once implanted its undetectable but until then you are barred from docking at any nonpirate stations or using gates you want to see people start killing each other for isk make them guard a hauler full of hacked impsnopesee 3mehnot no but hell no this is just asking to kill empire dwellers and not even armed ones
100 support sound has been ultra nerfed for way to long ccp seem to have relegated this to the scrapheap lag fighting is no1 but sound should be close behind
this really could summarize my whole line of thought really i have a wonderful sound system that worked better with eve before dominion than after itand just being able to hear a gun every time it goes off is something that should come standard with any pew pew internet spaceships game
supported came back to eve after a year or so away and really dissapointed to find the sound doesnt work correctly its quite a big thing guys
i cannot agree with that leave that as it is i can disable sound myself where i see fit i still want to have alarms but maybe i want to disable music and world wow thats hardcore i am not near quitting because of that but it is annoying it is very annoying though i mean srsly maybe next time login button wount be working you cant let these kind of things happen this is one of the basic functions that must always work and if it does not it needs fixing asap
have this same issue all weapon damage is invariably missing most of the times particularly during busy scenes and i am not alone in this i know of two other friends of mine with the same issue and none of us have what you would call substandard rigs were running on
confirming sound has been screwy since apocrypha sounds is one of the most important features of a game ccp try to get it right plz
not sure what you meanthe point here is that on some occasions the second client just does not make any sound at all when it does work you can still mute or disable it as you see fit however personally i have only experienced this on few occasions mostly when trying to disabling and reenabling sound then all of a sudden i cant hear sounds from one of the clients or when i am switching between clients quitting and restarting them then sometimes it gets messed upeither way it is a bug but for me personally a minor one because i dont experience this often however some players experience this more often
supported i hear my artillery and autocannons only after they cycle like 5 times and the only real sound that does work and that is extremely annoying are amarr chanting in stations and sonic boom from warping i it really sucks that after the jukebox goes through some certain number of somgs it just stops and i am forced to play every song afterwards manually

not supportedthis proposal is just as carebear as proposing loot rights on salvage ninja salvaging has its place just as rogue looters have their place just be faster or kill them if you are talking about highsec then tough luck it is highsec you cant shoot rogue looters just as you cant shoot ninja salvagerswhen stealing loot you get flagged to the owner of the wreck he can shoot you and that is how it should bego to lowsec 00 or wormhole space if you want to shoot rogue looters just as missioners have to go to lowsec to avoid or shoot ninja salvagerswhats up with all these carebear pvpers in eve these days it seems they want everything for free like insurance on suicide ganks and cant handle someone stealing their stuff 
this idea is truly hilarious everything the carebear ninja salvage moaners said about the hypocrisy of pvpers is true what a load of total  i hope all you who supported this idea diaf in gamehonestly quite pathetic hypocrisy is this actually a very good troll 
try pvping somewhere other than hisec then
i fully support this motion a much more convenient way is need to move my prostitutes around to increase market coverage and profits
totaly supported my nightmare needs dead hookers and make them illegal so i hve t keep the cops from spotting the dead hookers in my cargo hold
yes please
supported this is not hello kitty island adventureperhaps there could be a clientside profanity filter for people who dont care to see dirty words
if you give t3 the option to use covert ops cloak and a cov cyno that pretty much makes bobs even more worthless
makes sensealso another filter blueprint original and blueprint copyalso the ability to sort blueprints by type groups charges ships projectile weapons ect
agreed on the filter but that last one is actually possible asis in the contract search page pick type blueprint and then a big subtype menu becomes available right beside it its too specific if anything  options like cruiser blueprint instead of ship blueprint
dooo eeeeeeeet
yes wth is going on on the mining front ccp as in can we expect anything in lets say the next 2 expansions
it takes up too much space and in one slot you can probably fit three people in if it was text only local becomes easier to read and you can see more people
supporting with addition ofclicked on character would show avatar for as long as it remains selected
we already have a working solution to this problem its called delay loaded chat channelspeople should appear in local only when they say something since most people dont talk they wouldnt appear in the channel list so the list would be kept small and you could clearly see who you are chatting with
is there going to be another keep the players upto date
i dont see the fun or benefit in making islands no one will really want to travel out and from to once im out there i doubt ill be leaving regularly im sure many traderscorpalliances that have power between those islands could do well in transporting things or more likely killing people trying to move around beyond the people who go out to 00 on their own to mineratplex whatever those islands will be largely vacant and perfect feeding grounds to stalk if enough people go out there to exploit the local 00 systems assuming they cannot owned etcit would be an interesting idea to turn a few dozen worthless 00 systems into highsec systems but i dont see the rationale for these systems out there all by themselves why would factions do this why would they reach out so far to make one or a few systesm highsec and then more lowsec or is it just 00highsec
not supported as it doesnt seem entity consistent with what high sec actually is though i would mention have you ever heard of the solitude region it just about exactly what your suggesting theres only two ways in one of through 00 the other at least 12 jumps of lowsec
id prefer to see 36 sec systems on border zones fluctuate and change daily even more than daily if possible allow temporary highsec trade routes that open up but as a result might drop and become hostile territory to an unlucky trader or miner known good routes may end up closed off due to pirate incursions or even corpalliance warsid like to see lowsec pirate agent missions near these zones that with increased activity ie people running the missions affect the sec status of the constellation
this seems workable and fits within the lore as far as im aware
i have discussed a negative security space for pirates that functions exactly like high security space does for everyone else granted there would not be concord intervention but there would be pirate faction intervention it wouldnt be anywhere near as safe as high sec but it would give pirates semisecure bases of operations that discourages them from fighting each other in that area
yes
the sonar fitted in hi slots it allow to catch cloaked ships with the direction scanner you active itscan  we have 4 bombers and 2 recons at 47 km
troll 010epic faillearn to use googlettme thumbs down
you shall not introduce modules that make complete ship classes uselessthank you
and not to point the astronomer finger of doom at you buthow exactly does sonar work in a vacuum anyway
omg now i understand the grade of your minds ok ill answer your question only if you answer this how exactly does a jump gate works why ships have only rear trusters and theres no inertia in eve why can i reach a top speed in space con its a game idiots
love you too
wikipediasonar requires acoustics that means sound there is no sound in space as it requires air the sounds you hear are artificially produced in your pod as evidenced by eve chronicles and backstory if you even know how to readnow hurry off to school your kindergarten teacher is waiting for you dont want to miss snack time and the cookies now
while im still thumbing down the sonar idea for gameplay reasons in an universe where ships fly in some kind of dense molasses and it cant be empty space something that make friction is needed to have fixed max speeds other than c it could actually work
what a dumbass people we have tell me why there are engine sounds and turrets firescon be serious this game far from reality as your brain from intelligence you are pointing a useless detail used in eve theres no sound propusion in space but turrets can brake your ears and engine have sounds too blame the fiction game not me idiot and ill tell you that if i can ear turrets from 100km i can scan with a sonar shut up you monkey brain confusing reality with fiction
wow this thread went downhill quickbtw idea not supported cloaking is fine as it is
omg finally someone who can use the thing over the neckor gimme unlimited trust speed or sonar will work and acceration factor is pointless too a bs should reach the top speed as fast a frigate and the worst thig i dont see minmatar ships roteate like a banana in a wirphool when fire with 100000mm cannons minmatar cannons should lower the ship speed change the route of the ship hahaha think about missiles explosions the blast should move the hit ship at 50000 ms using explosions as primary truster
nojust no
a module would just gimp the minni recons even more no matter if low mid or high slottarget painting is already semi usefullsomething i could see being at least partially balanced is a signature radius and speed reduction relation the higher your signature radius is the stronger is the effect of the speed reduction if you want to have an in game pseudo science explanation the speed reduction is higher because the webber has a higher signature radius to graba speed reduction  signature radius relation would allow webbing small ships with mwds stronger than ships without mwd strengthening the usage of abs more againif this should be on top of the scripted webs needs some number crunching but in general both ideas have merrits without totally overpowering the current underpowered web
the problem with webs that got more range is that you will always have to use the script with the largest range and the lowest strength it gives gangs the advantage to totally immobilize you and the problem with close range is not solvedmaking it based on sig is even worse since it gives smaller ships the complete range control over larger ones and also giving the ships with the bigger guns a drawback on top of it by reducing the befit of fitting a web at allalso it would be the biggest nerf to blaster pvp since qr since you have the ships with the largest sigs in many classeshac bc with the guns that got the smallest range and that will never make it into range since it can be kitted by almost anything
before you go crazy please actually look at the statsdiscussion herethe idea behind this ship is to provide some unique and versatile features for aspiring industrialists no configuration is meant to outshine its t2 counterpart please see the thread linked above for more details and discussionive waited to post this for a bit to see what sort of support i could get in fi and to flesh out some detailsokay flame resistant suit on go for it
im not sure i can support this good shipbut no ones going to approve a cruiser with a ship maint arrayship arrays are reserved for capitals and only capitalsill think about the rest laterpersonally a gas mining strip miner would be better for the sake of gas mining
can a new t3 hulk be added to eve that has 4 strip miner slots with better tanking and 4 low slots this would be a great way to help out the miners in low sec
did you seriously just ask for a solopwn mobile for mining
way i see it if it brings more people into lowsec it could be a good thing
solopwn mobiles are fine as long as they require constant interactionfor instance 2 second cycles with 50m3 cargo baystill macros 
that hulk would just make mineral prices even lower more minerals would come  lower price
such a limited view on supply and demand lets get this straight minerals are a building item not a sells item the reason for the current low mineral prices is an imbalance in the market aka to much of one type of mineral not enough of another more minerals in fact means more ships more ships means more pew pew more pew pew means more ships needed which means more minerals neededi would like some more details i suggested a t3 miner on par with the hulk a while back search for the t3 utility ship thread
these things would never leave the safety of high sec also iirc ccp mentioned some where that the hulk isnt going to be replaced any time soon
i would like the ability in nullsec and ideally low sec to be able to disable a stargate hence allowing you to siege a systemit seems a shame to me that stargates and the sentries that protect them in low sec cannot be disabledmy proposal is to give stargates a nice big shield buffer and allow people to be able to depleat it by shooting them once shields go below 25 the gate is disabled the shields would naturally replenish so to keep the gate disabled you must continue to shoot it i would suggest the sentries would be seperatly powered and hence you would need to disable them independently but work in the same wayas with any shields the gate could be repaired using shield transporters and this would work from either side of the gate therefore enabling anyone wanting to get through the gate to accellerate the natural shield regen process and meaning anyone really wanting to keep the gate shut may have to do so from both sides this of course means that trying to keep a high sec to low sec gate disabled is even more challenging as folk can sit in high sec repairing the shileds where pirates would be fairly unwise to followshooting a stargate would of course be a criminal activity and as such would incurr the wrath of concode in high sec making the disabling of gates a very expensive debacleseems to me that most of the functionality needed to make this feasible is already in place
in theory it sounds like a great idea however you need to look at it from all points of viewi own a system and its being invaded i throw up a cynojammer and then close off my own stargates and keep shutting it down even as the other side reps it so now no cap fleet and no conventional fleet can come in save for covops im pretty much invulnerable
the idea is very cool essentially barricading a system or gatethe 2nd post makes an important point though how would one stop a permanent blockade with the number of alts these daysyou could just set up a few alt moros droning the gates for an easy brick wallmaybe if the damage needed to keep the blockade running increased over time such that eventually no force could keep the warp space rift locked down queue dramatic percussion
no way this would just be another mechanic that makes blobs necessary and nerfs guerilla warfare
the abuse potential is too bigi lock down my dead end pocket and any smaller roaming gang is locked out and i can carebear much safer than in highsec this seems to be so wrong given the benefits you can get out of 00lowsec systemsif there would be an option for thumbs down i would use that
imo i like the idea of being able to disable the guns in lowsec the part about disabling the stargate would be to easy to abuse an alliance or large corp could disable the gate and basically be unattackable that said the pirate in me that loves black ops would find it absolutely hilarious to covops cyno into a system or region like that and kill all the carebears who thought they were safe
they should be doing this already if they arent then they dont care about user reports on suspected or obvious bots which from what i can tell is how it isa gms convo request shouldnt be effected by your settings on blockignore all if you dont respond to them at some point id expect ccp to make a note of it and attempt it again as well as looking into the accounts activity to see if it is a 237 miner or other activity that shows the account is being used by more than one person breach of eula or is a macro program breach of eula i cant support asking ccp to do something they should be doing if they arent all brain dead
youre all missing one important pointit alerts the user that they are being trackedwhen tracking and observing a user you want to do it passively in a manner that isnt detectable to the useryou dont want to have a whole botnet modify its process just because you alerted one of the botsccp understand this do you think unholy rage would have been a success if they messaged each bot telling them they were under investigation
another excellent point if a bot is identified monitor it to find other bots and do a drag net just like they did with unholy rage
what about afk mission running which requires absolutely no botting and is done completely within game mechanics
maybe in a few missions but in almost all there is no such thing as afk mission running because spawn aggro will kill your drones you dont afk through jump gates and there is no auto target and fire feature that is an in game mechanic if you are only using drones even with a dom you are still taking forever to finish the mission where an actively participating pilot will get through that same mission in half the timeafk mission running is a drop in the ocean at best

at the risk of sounding like ccp ganking is working as intended1 nonfreighter ganks and this post are almost always for lols and tears2 concord has nothing to do with the scc at all 3 sandbox player to player interactions is a inherent and vitapart of such system4 ganking isnt risk free 5 their is simple steps you can take to avoid it
see here is the problem even if that one hauler is hauling stuff worth only little the inssurance will reimburse any ganking bs lost in the process and the loss of the gankers will be minimalhell people only gank just for giggles and dont lose muchagain insurrance payout is too high regardless of what the victim is carrying in the cargoholdand once again the inssurnace will cover the loss of ships imnsurrance fraud ppl dont need to haul around 500 millione to make it worthwhile for 5 tempest to gank themin conclusion you did not understand the core problem insurrance payout is too high for gankers making it a valuable business even when ganking empty haulers
i think my torp raven needs a bigger alfa and i think those 2 ions do make a differenceo yea more target painters
for haulers they gank for isk i know because i do itwith a slightly positive sec you get about four ganks before you have to go back and grind your sec that part sucks and i hate doing it so no you wouldnt waste a gank on something that wasnt going to pay off  anything under 200 mil is not a target to me some guys will go for it sure but most wont too big a risk that something will not drop and 200mil isnt worth itthe ones you wait for are the 300mil untanked t1 haulers that undock and theres plenty of those fix the stupid problem first and the rest will take care of itselfim trying to fix the stupid problem by learning these people a lesson but theres just so much stupid in eve i dont think ill ever be done
the issue i have with the suicide gankers is that the whole insurance setup is needing a make over with t3 ships costing millions and the subsys as well and if u go to insure it they insure it for 12mil how can a t3 cruiser be in the same insurance band as a normal cruiser that would be like saying a porsche is the same as a polo they need to insure the ships correctly or do away with it period as it is senceless spending even more isk at it to get less back and as for suicide gankers yes i agree self destruct or ships killed by the police shouldnt get insurance
1 ure not understanding that insurance applies because its an intended game mechanic i already said that high sec is not a completely separate entity that doubles as a sanctuary its just another part of the eve universe2 and no one suicide ganks empty haulers ive autopiloted empty haulers or even with worthless cargo on long trips simply because i had to get something done around the house and ive never been suicide ganked for it so no its not valuable or smart to suicide a hauler thats not worth it those decisions to hold back tells anyone with a brain that the sec status penalties do have an impact despite what the carebears think
t2 and especially t3 r supposed to be better than t1 thats why they have littleno insurance for it to compensatemore power  more responsibility heres the thing in eve to be able to wield that much power comes with a risk just like any t2 ship or faction mod the risk of the lack of insurance if u lose it this is not world of warcraft where ure supposed to acquire all your epic gear for keepsthats not how it works here if u cant pilotfit a t3 or even t2 well enough to not lose it then ure either rich u took a gamble and lost andor ure probably not rdy to fly one

as a primarily gal focused character i would dearly love hybrids both rails and blasters to end up on the receiving end of a little bit of ccp love being less that a year old game wise i get the feeling that getting any of these propositions through the csm is going to be an up hill struggle a fair percentage of the csm represent or have links to large 00 entities logistically these entities are primarily focused on amarr hulls and weapons for the most part changing 00 away from swarms of standard amarr fleet fit bs is not really in their interest logisticallybut then again im a newbie to what the hell do i know
fleet battles do love rain rokhs and megas just not as buchbut they do love them still
a lot of the data and arguments presented in this conversation and a few others parallel that are ongoing at the moment makes me think that as far as fleet bs issues of mega and rokh the major culprit in this case in spike lin general the major issue for railguns is focused on the interaction of the weapons and ammo i am trying to focus the issue to the damage modifier because it is the simplest solution spike will need to be adjusted but the changes seem to be minimal specifically for spike lms if the optimal bonus was reduced to 65  70 while its damage was increased by 15which can be achieved by increasing the gun damage modifier it would balance out and make the rokh eagle deimos ferox brutix cormorant catalyst more usable for sniping while not making the mega and brutix op they would be fighting in falloff with a low tracking ammo which is a concern expressed by manythis approach would also make the javelin lms ammo feasible as an alternative to cn am using current modifier t2 125mm javelin s 24 base shield damage t2 125mm cn am s 2263 base shield damagecurrent modifierx 115 t2 125mm javelin s 276 base shield damage t2 125mm cn am s 2608 base shield damagewe can see that the difference between javelin and cn am will increase by 10 152137110 to demonstratenow nobody uses t2 short range because there is no significant differencerokh t2 425mm 3xmagstabscn am 553  5430 001971rokh t2 425mm 3xmagstabsjavelin 561 2730001478mega t2 425mm 3xmagstabscn am 605 4139 002327mega t2 425mm 3xmagstabsjavelin 614 213900174515 increase to the damage modifier would yieldrokh t2 425mm 3xmagstabscn am 636  5430 001971rokh t2 425mm 3xmagstabsjavelin 645 2730001478mega t2 425mm 3xmagstabscn am 695 4139 002327mega t2 425mm 3xmagstabsjavelin 706 2139001745note for those that will cry foul apoc megabeam3x heatsinksin multi 641 4726 002096apoc megabeam3x heatsinksgleam 651 2426 001572even though the difference between javelin and cn am seems marginal it allows rokh to get over 600 dps and in the case of the mega over 700 which is perfectly acceptable if we also consider the tracking and optimalfalloff it has its a brawler by nature after all furthermore if the tracking of the javelin is amended i havent done any calculations on it then usage of t2 short range ammo might become more attractivetherefore i am refining my proposal to15 to all railguns damage modifierreduce spike optimal bonus to 70 instead of 8010 to pg output for all caldari railboats so they are up to par with gallente ones as far as fitting requirementssuggestion for javelin pending

i dont support a change to spike simply because all t2 ammo should probably be looked at and addressing issues with spike should be done in the company of fixes to aurora as well my own feeling on it is that the tracking penalty and high cap use in the long range t2 ammo at the cost of reducing the exceptional damage and range bonus that has largely ruined the advantage of using the right ammo at the right range for distances over 160km as shown in the graphs of my previous posts theres no consistency in the damage curves as they near the end of range all weapons systems pinning their hopes of being effective on the range of their t2 ammo even when thats impractical as is often the case of a rokh which simply outranges the lock limitoverall i think that a 75 range bonus and damage equal to the longest range high faction ammo 75 would provide a sufficient bonus over t1 ammo to still be considered useful without providing the huge disincentive to switching ammo types as targets move to different ranges not only that but it would allow sniper ships to be more relevently balanced for who has the most damage at a specific range instead of simply worrying about their t2 damage as the only effective option as an example with the 15 damagerof boost to rail guns it would allow a rokh shooting dread guristas iridium to compete  6 less damage with an abaddons aurora  tachs with a little more range bringing into reality the bonus for the rokh of being able to switch to more damaging ammo types at reduced range instead of the current setup which leaves the abbadon with a nearly 50 advantage in damage at that rangeleave t2 ammo alone in a railguns fix as their problems are broader and wont be fixed effectively by a piecemeal approach of one weapons system at a time
1 switching ammo is by design i dont think you should be able to bypass that constraint however unwieldy it is2 faction ammo should not be used to balance the weapon systems it skews the picture furthermore they are not player made thus readily available so they are an exception to the rule if you noticed i used faction ammo to compare their prevalent use over t2 when comparing hacs for example i used t1 am3 spike has 80 bonus to optimal taking it down to 75 is not enough if you want to really balance the ships a to reach same range as the rest mega needs to be gimped 2 magstabs2 te does subpar dps 19 less than apoc and rokh does subpar dps also16 less than apocb if fit the same number of damage mods mega does less dps 75 less than apoc and the rokh is still crap 16 less than apocalthough i am using mega and rokh the ratios hold for the other railboats as well especially hacs although brutix is a bit op i had to pick a number to append to my proposal and i obviously took the average which is 15 taking that into consideration anything less than 15 is just as good as nothing cause it really does not solve the issue t2 is the only real option for mega tempest and apoc the only ship using t1 that can reach 170km and do some damage 281 dps with t1 ammo is the rokh apoc does 232 at 17233 tempest does 232 at 12572 optimal mega does 219 at 15049 its the rokhs only saving grace how much for that dg iridium i use cn am for close range but only when we go toe to toe with enemy fleets when shooting pos mods why should i spend that kind of isk t2 is cheap and plentiful using faction ammo to get high eft numbers should not influence our view of the problem such exceptions just validate the need for improvementwhy not if balance is to achieved t2 ammo must be looked into your approach just ignores a huge factor in the problem widen your perspective or you will lose the forest for the trees
not entirely sure what youre getting at here but it needed to be fixed either way currently theres only 1 ammo type that matters beyond 160km and you could make arguments for that envelope being even smaller switching ammo types should allow you to trade damage for range in a meaningful fashion as is clearly designed for with t1 ammo t2 ammo ranged ammo in particular breaks that relationshipi wouldnt mind comparing t2 to t1 myself but in anticipation of people complaining that t2 ammo shouldnt be eclipsed by high faction ammo i opted for the least contrast comparison that allows people to determine that t2 ammo would retain its advantages in relation to the next most competitive ammo typei could be swayed on the range bonus reduction and opted for a 70 value initially but once again wanted to opt for a minimalist approach to change so as to avoid overbalancing and continually ocillating between two unbalanced points my main point of contention is that all t2 ranged ammo needs to have its damage taken downexcept it isnt i really wish it was though since it would be neat to max out the range on a rokh and use other ammo types to get close to if not equal to the damage amounts seen in other ships at that range reducing the damage t2 ammo does while unnerfing it to retain its usefulness is the only way to give the rokh this muchtoted advantageonce again on the use of dg ammo its to actually show the worstcase scenario for the ships after my suggested changes as balancing around t1 ammo would tend to leave faction ammo with serious advantages over or parity with t2 ammo which would invite a lot of complaintsim not saying t2 ammo shouldnt be looked into in fact im saying it should but on a broader basis looking at balancing all weapons platforms instead of balancing rails around beams with broken t2 ammo imho changing t2 ammo is outside of the scope of this proposal and deserves its own thread for discussion might have to do that tonight
the range problem could be fixed differently by applying more logic to how hits are registered right now we have a system that doesnt make sense but is was easier to program it probably reduces server load as well but it would fix long range ammo and weaponsfor example currently if you have a ship that is stationary firing at another object that is stationary as long as you are inside optimal it doesnt make a bit of difference to your accuracy what range they are at 100m is as good as 100kms as long as its inside optimal in reality the signature radius of a ship should be a base size at 0m which gets smaller from there depending on range then to hit that target further away you would need more accurate guns since the signature resolution on guns is by class and not by function the system is inherently broken before it even beganwhat should have been a system where range was irrelevant became a system where functional balance is impossibleas we all know in space these weapon systems would continue on until they struck somethingfor the most part the trick to hitting a target isnt reaching it but tracking it and having a weapon that can accurately fire that distance the system should besig radius at 0m range x signature resolutionxoptimal tracking speed  transversalx damage resultor something like that the idea being you can always hit your target even if its orbiting you at a ridiculous speed but your chances might be extremely low based on your signature resolutionwhich would be low for blasters pulse lasers and acs and high for rails beams and arty and optimal trackingwhich would be the oppositebut i digressedit because it will never happenstill like the change tagamiedit forgot damage in the equasion
could have shortened that post to dont like any of it except teh balck market would have been easier lolanyway keep it rolling guys agree disagree whatever but get the ideas inwe need lowsec attention
supporting lowsec love in general though im not so sure about the specificsi like the black marked idea like the criminal faction idea imo npc rats should not shoot at players if the player has a high standing with the faction like the smarter rats idea imo all lowsec pve should require pvpfits better fights all around imo lowsec stations should be more differentiated dont allow docking on hostile stations depending on faction standing add pirate stations that will not allow lawabiding citizens to dock  possibly allow docking on hostile stations in exchange for a hefty fee lowsec security status should depend on the actual playeractivity based security or insecurity of the system so 01 vs 04 would convey meaningful information make it depend on number of illegal aggressions per day for example role of local and alternative new intel tools should be considered lowsec can be improved without doing that but i suspect intel changes could have a positive impact on lowsec there could be some flex in the security status assigment some system should be able to flip from highsec to lowsec and vice versa depending on player activities anarchy could spread or order could creep further mechanics are tricky though  neither 00 sov nor fw stuff seems right for the job fixing bounties would boost lowsec ransom mechanic would boost lowsec eg pay ransom into escrow from where it is released after you jump dock or log off for longer than 15 minutes  if you are destroyed before that you get the ransom back
i like the general gist of this teehee
to add in 00 pirate faction sov space the rats should be the empiresand second the notion on border zones fluctuating from just barely hisec to lowsec ie 45 it would make trade more dynamic and also give flashy people something to do other than camp amamake rancer heir or tamayou could also have more of those nice pirate arc missions have missions include incursions that disrupt a systems security status
living in lowsec i fully agree to the op with his ideas will write some other stuff laterdont have time nowill also add this thread to my signature
i agree with qp this is a huge issue i of cause think there should be a limitation on where you can refit the tech3 ship so the suggestion of haveing a tech 3 modular refitting pos module is the best ccp  allowing people in wspace to change sub systems has nothing to do with preventing colonization since we already have conolized wspace not being able to change sub systems only means have have to bring extra ships it makes the tech3 ship fill its role better a ship that can be changed for its need
this has my support i dont have quite as many sound volume variations so much as the sound is just buggy sound over writing other sounds and others not playing at all there have been many times where i have been in a mission and have had no sound from any of the weapons ccp should focus on redoing sound for the next patch since it is very important

alliance wallet  taxthe functionality of alliance management is currently a tedious chore for most in which those that run them spend most of their time establishing logistics and gathering money from their corporation counterpartsa designated corp
while i agree i dont like the prospect of alliance taxation being a percentage potentially 100just a comment at best
yeah this makes sense alliances need some more structure than they have at present an alliance wallet  preferably with a few dozen divisions instead of 7  would be a nice addition then dont join such an alliance it doesnt seem any worse to me than the idea of a 100 corp tax

i think that two sets of armor implants and two sets of shield implants would also be a step in the right direction one set for hp one set for rep amountthe other issue with active tanks especially on the gallente end is the lack of low slots to take advantage of the rep bonus coupled with dmg mods brutix and to a lesser degree the astarte need to have their slot layouts and pg amounts reworked i think both these ships should get either another highslot  grid for gang mod or another low slot so they can actually take advantage of the slot heavy active tank they are bonused forthe other solution could be to decrease the pg needed to fit these active reppers this would go along way in allowing active armor tankers to not completely gimp their load out if they fit the 2 reps these ships are so clearly designed to fit
ok few people here recognize my way of reasoning even tho it is logically sound and no one presented counter argumentsokay so you boost the active tank bonus on a few ships that have it those ships may get a slight advantage that may just may be able to make them competitive against passivebuffer tanks but what about all the other ships for them active tanking will still be the weaker optioni hope ccp unlike casual players put more serious thought into analysis of the situation they could do some serious number crunching first collect a few dozen samples from killboards filter out all pve and noob fits categorize samples by ship type split shield tankers from armor tankers then calculate total effective hp for all ships in case of active tanks calculate effective hp based on battle duration for several intervals 12310 minutesfor each of the 10 battle duration categories calculate raw dps necessary to kill the shipmake a bar graph of the breaking point dps for each battle duration comparing passivebuffer tank and active tankcalculate probabilities of active tank working for each of the 10 battle durations assuming that every active tank ship fits cap injector but has limited supply of chargescalculate probabilities of energy neutralizer to be used by enemy based on the dps such as for every 500 dps an average of 1 medium energy neutralizer is usedcalculate adjusted effective hp of active tank ships under conditions of limited cap and average use of energy neutralizers for each of 10 battle duration categories compare findings with previous datacalculate average number of ships required to produce breaking point dps for each battle durationcalculate statistical distribution of ships in engagement group different intervals of distribution curve and calculate success or failure of active and passivebuffer tanks for each 10 battle duration categoriescalculate statistical distribution of battle durations use it to create weights for each of the 10 battle duration categories and most probable effective tanking method between active and passivebufferrepeat same calculation for every ship typerepeat calculations separately for armor and shield tanked shipsrepeat calculations with modified starting conditions  such as increaseddecrease tanks from sample data increaseddecreased energy neutralizer usagekeep updating sample datayou get the ideatheres literally months of work for serious game designer work that is necessary to make educated decisions on important game balance decisions the arguments people use on this forum are little more than hints at the truth and the signal to noise ratio is low

would be nice to have indeed i am suspecting the filters need a little revamp in this case but its needed
theres already methods in place to do just this the first is delayed local which you were told about in the previous post the second way is another button at the top left hand corner that says show text only
nuff said
clicking show text only wont remove portraits from the channel member list though and that is what the op is on about if im right
do we really want local to give up to three times as much intelligence as it already is
well yes
next thing to ask for is for local to be sortable by standingsallicorpetc and why not its only logical since we see everyone and their standings anyway not supportedlocal should be delayed everywhere ideally but in 00 at the very least with delayed local there should be options for your nameavatar to be always shown to nooneeveryonestandingsbasedallicorp
really no not at allwish there was a thumbs down option here
itd give the same amount of intel with three times less player annoyance since i am vehemently opposed to using player annoyance as a tool for game balance i support thisassuming its an option and not forced of course

currently we have the ability as players to right click a persons name and report them as isk sellers its a special selection requires confirmation and abuse is treated by gms with appropriate harshness alreadyso why do we not also have the ability for us as pilots to do the same rightclickreport with macroratters or microminers in order to allow the player base to help monitor the greater community and protect eve against macrousing iskfarmersit seems that this would also cut down on the rmt ccp has stated they despise while also doing good to the markets by revaluing isk verses minerals by creating a slight deflationary pressure to the majorly farmed mineral indexes in short good for everybody except macro usersoh and before the macrominers chime in to complain my tactical uniform is flame proof and i carry an antitroll device in my utility belt
just how do you prove it 100 without a shadow of a doubt that he is macro mining
the same way we detect micro miners in the field and petition them to ccp nowas it stands as i understand it ccp investigates claims of isk seller to accounts manually already for characters reported as isk sellers using the rightclickreport interface so how they handle this version of it would be no differenti could also see significant cost savings for ccp in terms of support dollars if this was implementedthere is no con to this and people who do not cheat have nothing to fearoh and i support my own proposal of course
thats not completely true that it is no different the amount of to be controlled accounts would be much higher besides if one offers you money you could have logs to show in the case but how do you identify a clear macro miner one can only give a guess but can not be sure 100 say you see a covetor mine lonely and takes all roids veld scor omber maybe even in one cycleis it a macro miner or is it a noob having no clue of the values or is it a guy who needs certain minerals and mines with a reason omberi am still supporting your post as i think ccp can cross reference warnings and already made out systems and other indications it will be more work as ccp might has to watch the characterwhat is more is that other then the iskseller button there cant be a severe punishment for denigration as its not possible to be sure that will undoubtly lead to misuse from people who despise the mining business
no i dont want 20 extra options on reporting someone when i rightclick his name in the game some people actually try to play the game not get others into trouble chat logs prove weather he is a isk seller nothing except watching him playing can prove he is a macro ratterminersmission runner nothing rmt is isk sellers macro miners arent related
quite simple you only have one single option called report player when you click it you can chose what for isk seller suspected macro other forms of breaking the eula etcwhats your point as it stands when you petition a player for suspected macroing ccp will observe his behavior to determine if its true the proposal just simplifies the processthey both brake the eula and macroing is one of multiple isk sources for isk sellers
i support this lets help ccp fight rmt 50000 pairs of eyes is better then staff of ccpbesides we would only be reporting them its still cxcp staff that has to look closer and make final determination if its macro im sure ccp can implement gm intervention in form of popup window gm wanting to ask some random questions now any macro will fail answer to those since theres no player there to answerand since holy rage all ready proved that fighting macros is beneficial remember cpu load went down etclets make macros enemy of us all and fight them
thus far ive seen no one come up with a fool proof totally factual method of catching a macroi find it humorous that its all based on assumption and someones opinionnot supportingthe last thing we need is some idiot asshat reporting me while im afk and miningand im quite sure ccp wouldnt like the massive influx of false positives
well if i am an idiot asshat wanting to report you i can alreadythe proposed system would just make it more convenienti also have to say that between the unholy rage and the option to report isk spam i notice alot less isk spam overallso it works let players help police the game gms still have the final descicion nothing really changes beside making it easier to report
there is a big difference between isk selling and macro mininghow you can equivocate the two is beyond even my capabilities of understanding your foolishnessand again ccp isnt going to like getting flooded with useless reports that are based on total assumptions
ok if you add a bit of drawback for wrong reports 1 wrong report warning 2 wrong report in a row 3 day ban any successive wrong report in a row add another 3 day banmaybe and only maybe that will keep in check the people that will start to report random miners he is mining everything in sight surly a macroa gang mining any kind of roid in range macro macrohe dock when full and jump to a bookmark macroand so on i have seen calling macro behavior every thing a normal miner or group of miner do honestly it would become the more over abused tool in the game becoming meaningless in no time
this i can get behindthis makes me feel better if i get reported by an idiot hell get his butt banned from the game for a few days sounds good to mechange your proposal to what venk mentioned and ill support ito7  venk
which means half the smack talkers and assshots will be getting banned for 3 days that 3 days of eve without them that i approve
would very much like to see just towers and associated structures start as npc sold bpcs no bpo having goods such as robotics via bpo seems too complicated to get the isk sink back incould use an avenue such as this to help out high end mining as wellsomething like a 1 run control tower bpc costing 350mil and then the materials using a large amount of high end minerals and low amount of low end mineralsanother option could be to have a cheap tower bpc say 50mil and then the materials would include 300 mil worth of npc sold goods ie robotics uranium etc
first wrong forum second theres a summer and winter expansion dominion was just released and bugs are still being sorted why do you want another one so soon

im not sure if my eyes are actually bleeding or if its merely my brain bleeding out through my eye sockets but either way it hurts to read what you just wrote

hehehe you i understand and im sorry for my english but a point remain im right
not supported this would ruin an entire class of ships without any way to counter iti cant believe this is even a proposal
no your not right yes eve is a game no its not a simulation but youre asking to make an entire class of ships pointless which means you have no idea what you are talking about no caveman predicted black holes because he made a lucky guess in this case you are a caveman
its not your english even if english is your secondor fifth or whatever language there is no language on the planet where  is a proper construction unless youre taking the tenth factorial of a number also im pretty sure most languages feature capital letters from time to time
since we now have the right to give up the rights to our salvage its only right that people that come into your mission and start looting should be concorded or in the very least the person whos stuff is being tooken should have the right to shoot them
no
gms on salvaging kthxbye
you cant give up rights to salvage because you dont have any rights salvage is free for all
for the umpteenth billion timeno
if you dont want people salvaging while youre doing a mission find a ship with 2 or more utility highs equip a tractor beam and a salvager and clean up as you go but theres no reason thats even close to valid for a game mechanic change on this front
i can seriously agree with the general topic of this thread tier 2 compared to tier 1 bcs has been a point of debate for quite a long while i personally think that the brutix and possibly some of the other tier 1 bcs need to be rebalanced so they are not made redundant by tier2s of thier own race or another races bcsaying that the brutix is fine is quite the stretch at this point people have found that the most effective fittings for it do not even use the active tank bonus at all simply because an active tank hogs all 5 slots and takes a large amount of grid reducing youre armament to that of electrons and a couple ionsi strongly agree that the brutix is indeed in need of another low slot ideally
this personally id go even further and say 8 highs and turrets without the extra drones since as usual caldari go without a damage bonus to hybrids vs gallente ships for precedent look at the rokh vs mega for a similar relationshipif the 900 dps brutix needs fixing then all the tier 1 bcs need fixing otherwise the balance is just fine
additional shipsfor those of you who havent realized already there are gaps in factionships in terms of training for instance there is no such faction ship for a training spec of mini  caldari or amar  gallenteits a hole that forces many to c
what pirate faction would be minicaldari or gallenteamarras there is some rp involved in the whole thing your proposal should cover the whole thing and not just i want more ships
the rp is a pretty gigantic hole in the proposal but from a game design pov i kind of want to see it if only to have an excuse to put ships into the game with two bonuses to tanking still im sure ccp is aware of the idea and im sure they have a schedule in their minds for when to roll out new ships so as not to burn design space too fast i see no reason why we need to push them along faster
gangs are already able to immobilize you when they have multiple webs and everybody just using the long range script version is missing something that makes scripts so interestingstopping one cycle to change the scriptalso immobilizing at range with gangs still depends on the amount of webs on one target hard to balance since blobs are unbalancing everything at some point and the amount of boni the script adds to the range vs the loss of speed reductioni still think that researchnumber crunnching in that direction might result some interesting and balanced resultsi see your point with the blaster boats though the sig radius effect on webbing was just a thought
if you were to script them to have a significantly lower strength 60 or so at moderately increased range 50 so just enough to slow something down for tracking to catch up t2 web  20 speed reduction at 15kmwouldnt stacking penalties make the pininplace scenario a pure theorycraft exercise ie 3 rapiers all dedicated to holding one target in placebasing strength on signature is counter productive since it is the small stuff you actually want to slow down  perhaps an inverse thing where mass is factored in or would that just exasperate the multiplate buffer crap
stacking woulnt be really theory crafting but were not trying to balance 5 carriers repping one bs either  anyway i thought about the inverse thing but that would just gimp target painters even more while my original reason to related web strength to sig radius was to boost the painter with the idea as wellon a rapier yeah minni recon sailor here a target painter could have been an option vs 2nd web fit on a recon if web strength would have related to sig radius the idea behind it was to discouragecounter usage of mwds on small boats a bit a bit not totally while strengthening the ab and the target painteri still like the sigradius web relation on that level but it might need some more thought to take into account the big ships without gimping the target painter in the processa sig radius to mass relationship and then the web strenght effect maybe so big shipshuge mass with high sig radius are effected less while small shipssmall mass with a huge sig radius are effected morethe target painting effect on webbing wouldnt be that bad on a huge mass ship while on a small one the effect would be noticeable
i dont really see the point 80 of those systems are knockoffs of existing t3 just add an industrial option to the ships when the fifth subsystems come in  say a mining offensive and a cargo defensive  and leave it at that
i support some of it enough to give it a support star
so an orca is a capital ship i dont have cap skills and can still fly one also if this is true then i want to be able to fit a capital ship rep on iti can support some of this if its more of a t3 ore mining class vessel though i agree a ship maint on it would be a bit much
i dont like mining but i could be fine with something more plasablelikesetup 1 bonus to common ore yeldsetup 2 bonus to rare ore yeldsetup 3 bonus to ice yeldsetup 4 bonus to gas yeldsetup 5 bonus to cargo or somethingno crazy hanger things just normal cargo hold
look at the blueprint its a cap ship in the same way that a freighter is admittedly i dont think thats quite what drake had in mind but still
do cruisers have ship maint arraysdidnt think soorcas are cap ships just not formalfreighters are capitals but they are a very special nich flying cargo can nothing more
good chance the rapid deployment subsystem will be changed to something with ice mining bonuses didnt care for it too much myself cruiser with sma  but i liked the idea of being able to refit a t3 gang fast also i know you could just add these on as industrial subsystems to the current t3 cruisers definitely a viable option but i like the idea of unique ore ships models
this is an mmo people pay to interact with othersso why does the game even have a ignore all chat requests featurei think this should be removed
the rules say we ca discuss proposals here so here i gocurrently we have the ability as players to right click a persons name and report them as isk sellers its a special selection requires confirmation and abuse is treated by gms with appropriate harshness alreadyso why do we not also have the ability for us as pilots to do the same rightclickreport with macroratters or microminers in order to allow the player base to help monitor the greater community and protect eve against macrousing iskfarmersit seems that this would also cut down on the rmt ccp has stated they despise while also doing good to the markets by revaluing isk verses minerals by creating a slight deflationary pressure to the majorly farmed mineral indexes in short good for everybody except macro usersoh and before the macrominers chime in to complain my tactical uniform is flame proof and i carry an antitroll device in my utility belt

this term tell all of us what you have done about the lag and about the new game mechanics or is that not your deal should be
so far the csm has in the course of five meetings looked at many proposals debated them and submitted the list of agreed issues to ccp the list which can be found in the meeting minutes on the wiki has been used as the basis for the csm  ccp summit which is taking place at the moment well day one is done two more days to gounfortunately we cannot discuss anything at all about the content of these meetings until the minutes are published please note that some subjects are still covered by nda and thus wont be made public at this time or possibly at any time this is out of our handsso whilst i cannot confirm or deny what subjects may or may not have been on the table today and the next couple of days i can assure you for what it is worth that we are doing our best to pitch the player submitted ideas to ccp and to give them feedback on other issuesi apologise for the unspecific answer at this time the good news is that ccp have committed resources to getting the minutes out quicker than from previous summits
this could be great products to produce through planet based factories aka planetary interaction i am always in favor of adding new manufacturing processes when new products have to be introduced than expanding on the existing mechanics gathering minerals and stuff them into a factory slot with a blueprint is a bit too simple in the long run for my tastethe manufacturing and production careers needs new content too
supporting significantly more love for bobs to justify the cost and training to start cocd increased base jump range increased fuel bay reduced portal consumption t2 resistsid also like to see ccp revisit the bonuses and slot layouts on a pership basis but im not going to hold my breath i dont support allowing covert cynos in highsec
id like to retract my support for allowing probing of cloaked ships and reserve that for a new t2 destroyer classhowever i support the above and cynos in hisec the only reason theyre not allowed is because empires have cynojammed every hisec system since they can bypass cynojammers it only makes sense
i agree that makes sense from a rolebackstory basis and tbh it would probably be fun  i dont support it because i suspect it would lead to a proliferation of bobsbased ganks in highsec eventual cries of omg op and ultimately being nerfed to worse than they are now
i would start actually flying a redeemer if ccp did some lovesigned
the whole idea of the topic is wrong so no supporthowever nerf insurance payout and yes that means for miners missioneers and all in general afterall if your stupid enough to endanger your ship to npc pirates you should not get any payment at all just like if concord nukes youafterall its not suppose to be a fluffy lalaland
it happened to me 4 times in the last 2 weeks jita going to amarr forth and back and i had close to nothing 10 million cargo in my ship one time i was sitting in an empty hauler the other itme i had stuff for like 1 million in cargoso just because it didnt happen to you doesnt mean that it doesnt happen at allbtw i wasnt afk and my hauler was tanked pvp bufferedif the insurrance covers criminal activities and even makes it a good business to suicide gank then this game mechanic lacks all logic and realism and before you answer that eve is not realstic let me tell you  and you know this very well eve imitates and mimics real life economics
carebear tears it would destroy a whole way to earn isk on in eve or not really one rupture can suicide a inty 5 rupture  5mill so would be the same
damn that is completely insane this is the best example of why insurance should be removed for concord related eventsi mean whats next suicide ganking newbs in their t1 frigs just for the hell of it
this issue isnt going away at least tell us youre working on it
support thisagain lets keep this on the front page ccp get on thisi hate seeing rain drops instead of the old shock and awe
just to be clear im not particularly concerned with the quality of hits as at the very least those statistics affect all weapons systems more or less equally seeing a more realistic simulation would certainly be nice but is not my primary concern with regards to balancing railguns for rails its a question of having a point where they get competitive raw damage to other weapons systems particularly in the longer ranges where they are in theory supposed to reign supreme
even with another system in place the damage potential of railguns is lacking if you change uniformly how range affects all ships you wont do anything to remedy the damage output disparity
by no means was i arguing for a change but yes you would alter the damage output by altering the chance to hit however using current mechanics i agree that railguns are underpowered and that range is largely irrelevant in their case since the only advantage they have is a narrow band of the engagement windowthe last 12 of 250 kms that isnt realistically operated in anywaysit would be very interesting to see the usage numbers on ammo by type because i suspect that for railguns antimatter and iron are more or less the entire market for tier 1 ammo though interpreting that could be difficult since the rarity of mid range fighting and problems ammo switching are more of a deterrent than dps
it wont but it creates breathing room for rails to preform in one of the key issues currently is that railguns outpreform other weapons beyond the lock limit bringing ranges down in concert with the 15 boost to damage puts railguns in the position of being able to out preform other weapons systems in the ranges after tach aurora this would be made more potent by a reduction in all t2 ammo damage as it would allow all weapons systems to compete using t1 ammo types in the 160km rangesthe only part of this that would specifically apply just to rails though is the 15 damage boost though changes to t2 ammo should be done accross the board to avoid inbalancing them vis a vis each other
actually the ammo most used are amplutonium lead and iridium noone uses ironwhy penalize t2 ammo damage if people train for t2 there must be some reward t2 ammo should have higher damage output than any t1 with the same range or vice versa t2 ammo should have higher range than any t1 with the same damage output
why would no one use the longest range ammo i can understand the others in terms of balancing dps vs cap usage but if you are sniping iron will far out range any of the alternatives
piddly damage the only t1 ammo worth using if sniping is cn iridium and that is only if yu cant fit t2 guns yet the others i listed are cap stable damagefor example when shooting the station there is no reason to use anything else than lead cap
some new ideas from people added to the initial post check em out
i cant express how much i love this idea it needs some proper fleshing out and balancing notions to prevent it becoming a massive isk fountain but it really has some potential

to add to this what the op is proposing is removing one of the drawbacks of highsec pvp  and at the same time nerfing a mini profession the rogue looter  and therefore detracting from lowsec 00 wormhole space and factional warfare pvpwar decs in highsec are about having a way to destroy your enemy without being able to hide in highsec it is not about getting loot imhoit is very much comparable to people wanting arenas andor instanced pvp andor duels in eve detracting from the other more pure forms of pvp which make eve unique

eve online is a great mmo game because it allows the players freedom of choice of what careers they want to explore the game had a very fine balance indeed between the interests of say the casual miner and the hardcore combat pilots each and everyone was allowed its fair amount of time and space in the game to persue whatever they choose to do this has changed with the event or wardeccingwardeccing whatever the fair intentions where when introduced has now become a means to score easy kills andor easy money in highsec at the cost of the peacefull and innocent a combat corp can start a war at very little cost against a miner corp which of course is not equipped to defend itself some people argue that minermanufacturing corp should prepare to defend themselves but you cannot possibly expect that players that have devoted all their time and resources to miningmanufacturing to be a match to a bunch of players who have devoted all their time and resources to combatfurthermore and at least as important those miner did not come to eve to do combat they chose a different path because that is what they wanted and that is what eve promised to be a valid paht when they started out now with wardeccing they are forced into a path they did not choose and they do not whish to followhighsec isnt called highsec for nothing but what wardeccing has effectively done is making piracy legal in highsec my corp less than a month old has already been wardecced three times every time without a proper reason wardeccing has given combat corps that do not wantdare to engage their equals the perfect to tool to just attack the defenseless instead getting easy kills perfectly legal and all that in highsec that can hardly have been the intention of the designers of this game feature wardeccing is disabling the free choice of career paths in eve freedom that the game was designed for and forcing miners to quit player corps and join npc corps instead which eve was not designed fori do not propose to get rid of wardeccing but restore the highsec balance when a wardec is mutual by both corps no problem go ahaed and fight it out and lowsec being lowsec you should always expect being attacked but when the wardec is not mutual highsec should still remain a save place and any encounters should be concorded by the normal rules i know this will also disable to opportunity to start wars in highsec even if there is a valid reason but then again it would also be ridicolous if you could just give the local police concord some money and then can go beat them neighbours up without consequense whatsoever highsec is highsec and should be properly guardedbottom line wardeccing whatever its fair intentions were has now become an abuse at the cost of those who justifiably have choosen a noncombat career in eve and that abuse will have to stop engaging others in highsec should always be concorded even when the corps are at war unless the wardec is mutualregardsgwabakk
no
i cannot support this motion as in eve pvp is not achoise in this case you are getting attacked and you need to defend yourself so no i can see where you are coming from and that might be an issue indeed i would not mind something like increasing wardec fees a little so what happens if some bastard smacktalks in local where we live eevry day and keeps bumping our miners do i need to wait for him to mutualy declare war on me to teach him manners that does not exactly work i agree that highsec wardecs do need to be looked at they must be a more serious decision then they are not and have more consequences then someone having to stay docked up for a while untill the others get bored station games nutral rr alts and other  like that makes them lame its used for griefing 80 of the time where 19 percent is where the attacker fails and 1 when it is actually a proper fight so yes it might need to be looked at but not this way
pvp oriented gameit is already easy enough to avoid war decsno
welcome to eve i see that you have located the forums congratulationsnow that you are here you can take some of the money that you made and use it to pay people to kill other people for you exciting isnt itfor more information on how to defend yourself without a gun go tocrime and punishmentwarn others of the latest scam hire a mercenary to seek revenge or brag about your kills this is the place to discuss the criminal elements of eve
so tell me how can a corp avoid being wardecced only way is to leave corp and become a npc corp member a player corp cannot prevent being wardeccedand as for the pvp argument pvp in eve is not just about shooting each other eve is much more than that eve is not a combat game combat is just one of the many game features my point is that wardeccing is becoming a blockade of all those other featuresgwabakk
you do understand that eve stands for everyone vs everyone rightnever being truely safe is what eve is its why it stands alonenonconsentual pvp combat is something that ccp holds dear
stop being peacefulbe peaceful elsewherehire someone to not be peaceful in your placeif none of the abovejoin npc corp to be wardec prooftopic
i cant support this petition on the grounds that it sounds like somebody who is still learning about what the game is abouti suggest you look into hiring a mercenary corp if you have no other deference
join an alliance maybe
wrong you can certainly do everything in eve with a war active as you can without a war active you may have to be a minuscule bit more careful but having a war against you does not force you to stop what you are doing dock up and log starting wars with no reason or purpose against new players is a problem but not to be solved by making wars useless and making high sec logistics near invulnerable

i will elaborateno  learn how to defend yourself
youre an industrial corp hire a mercenary corporation to counter wardec the attackers you may not have pvp prowess but as industrialists you can fight with your iskwelcome to eve btw
i would support this but i can not because it does not make sense in its current proposed implementation pto clarify an exotic dancer does not put out and thus they can not be considered hookers that is why the prostitute item exists  it is common knowledge that prostitutes do in fact put out  and can be bought via contract in jita if you are lucky enough to find one and are willing to pay a battleship hull worth of isk for herfor this reason replacing the dead exotic dancer with a dead hooker corpse breaks player immersion and makes absolutely no sense i would however support that they be replaced with a exotic dancer corpse if they reach this state as long as that it also an outlawed or otherwise taboo item that will bring the concordpolice down on the player who is detected as having one in their cargo hold this would make perfect sense and would be worth supporting

it would be nice to have an option to buy all instead of having to type in the exact numberamount matching the sellers amountthis could be done either as a right click option when selecting the item from the market window or a tick box in the actual purchase window when buying the item
all itemsso if i click buy all and select trit in jita its going to try to buy every bar of trit in the marketwithout confirmation that you want to use up your entire wallet doing so buying the most expensive first right please elaborate on this more as it sounds i cant support this as it would be too easy to be exploited or erase peoples wallets because they select the wrong option by mistake
something of this variety could be nice yes perhaps just a double arrow or something make that box mouseinteractable instead of keyboardonly
there are a couple of different overlapping probe bubble configurations i use when scanning problem is every time i change the probes range i have to once again manually move them into the preferred configurationi find it difficult to believe that people who can build spaceships wouldnt be able to come up with programming to support automated probe positioning after all its just math rightthus i propose a feature be added to the scanner which allows the relativetoeachother positions of selected currently active probes to be saved in a named probe pattern that probe pattern could then be selected at any future time as the active pattern whereupon clicking a cluster probes button would cause active probes to snap to relative positions as defined in the selected pattern obviously if you had more probes out than the probe pattern addressed the extras would be ignored some limitations might need to be imposed such as all probes need to be set to the same scan rangeit would sure make probing less tedious true it would likely make probing for ships when using combat probes easier for that reason id settle for it only working with core probesbecause tbh its the constant adjustment when scanning out bazillions of sigs in wormholes that drives me crazy

ahh guess what after typing all that crap you failed miserablyeven if the active tanking modules get a buff you will still have the issue that resist bonuses are superior to repair bonusesbasically although it would fix active tanking the repair bonused ships would be still subpar and need a boostsure enough go right ahead and suggest a boost to the whole active tanking system but dont hinder this request just because your a nubresist bonused ships can fit active tanking modules you know so you still need to give the repair bonused ships a clear boon in that field10lvl is a reasonable boon

exactly this already works as the proposal suggest you just have to learn how to use the feature and navigate the ui to enable it this may speak of a usability issue however if people have trouble finding the option to enable thisso no i do not support this proposal on the grounds that it is requesting a feature that already exists
yes please textonly option is good but should also remove the avatars from the channelmembers list

so this topic has been brought up many times outside assembly hall but i havent seen it brought up in the assembly hall so im bringing it up because this needs to be fcking fixed once and for allok the client shows every shot x missed y y glanced off your hull y scored a direct hit on x so the client side obviously knows whether the shot was a hit or a miss or a glanceso fix the client side rendering to match the information if a beam laser misses select a random yet close distance from the ship to render the beam off into the distance of space if a rail misses a ship render it randomly off the ship so that it shows as a miss placed shot if its a glancing blow have it hit the edge of the ship but still go off into the dark if its a direct impact have it impact the ship solidly with a nice big splash effectdebris from the ship surfaceif ccp cant handle communicating misseshits for all the ships in the area at least show the information that i already know about namely my ship and the ships im shooting as my clients already receiving this information and just needs to properly render ittheirs no reason that a frigate should be getting directly engulfed in a beam laser and on top of that the beams stops at the ship if it was a complete missthis problem has plagued the eve engine forever and its one of the biggest experience breaking problems that ive yet to see well that and the fact that the missles come out of no where sometime seven the top of the ship me shakes head but thats for a different proposalthe gun impacts need to be resolved this is a big problem and i would imagine an easy solution since all the datas their the client graphic engine just needs to be tweakedplease remember to check the support this topic when replying if you support this problems need to be fixed

i just went through all the fears and points brought up and i think i have an answer for all of them if not please say sofirsti understand that people who actually do like to mine all day are worried about getting reporting by the paranoid and losing accounts the great thing about this  and i think it has already been brought up nicely  is that if people are stupid and try to abuse this reporting method they will simply lose their own accounts themselves since repeated abuse of the petitioning and reporting system is against the eula already anyway people will not abuse it because they themselves have a lot to lose if they do so this already exists and is a part of this proposal by virtue of the fact that this is how petitions are handled today already so please if that is the only thing stopping you support this proposalsecond as maxsim goratiev stated above it is possible to watch somebody and see that they are looping etc and thus are running a macro it would be wise of ccp to leverage this and allow its player base to help it cut costs in these hard economic times by leveraging its player base to help it fight rmt to keep its good name it is not like the player reporting the abuse has the final say and unless people can prove otherwise i consider that an invalid argument against this proposal as well as an irrational fear that can not come to fruition and should not stop people from supporting this proposal as its simply not possiblethirdrmt is many things and despite what maxsim goratiev stated above they are related i do not know the rules on talking about rmt so unfortunately i do not feel comfortable with explaining the connection here however even if they were not connected they are both actions that are still against the eula and tos and thus both considered forms of cheating and abuse that ccp has publicly stated will result in a banfourththe idea of the afk miner getting reported is nothing but a logical strawman argument because it is not rational to state that you can be both afk and performing actions like mining in the game at the same time without cheating since either you are at your keyboard pressing the button or you are afk getting a refreshing beverage and your script is doing it for you both can not be true and the usage pattern of the guy who gets up for a drink and switches between roids when he sits down and notices it popped is very different from somebody who is running a script in a loop they look completely different to both the players watching the person and to the ccp employee tasked with looking at server logs getting the two mixed up is not possible based on this i have to ask with respect that drake draconis please either clarify or retract his argument against this proposal as his other issue  being reported when you are not afk  is already taken care of by the first and second items aboveepilogueas noted above its cheaper for ccp to leverage the player base in detecting macro minersin the end this proposal is really about just lowering the amount of effort required to report suspected  key word suspected  cheaters and their accounts so that ccp can do a proper due diligence and investigation it is not like one guy reporting your account as a macro will result in an automate permaban and anybody who thinks so is simply ignorant of how things work nowthe end result of this is that if implemented it would be easier to report cheaters while adding no harm or discomfort to innocent people who legitimately want to mine all day because the fact is ccp would not ban an account that was reported for macro if that user was not cheating since it goes against ccps best interest as a company to ban accounts for any reason that is not legitimate and abusers will themselves get banned under the current petition policy so it polices itselfplease support you have nothing to fear
youre aware that mining lasers have reasonably long cycletimesplenty of time to afk  mineall this talk of the eula says while it seems no one has actually bothered to read the eula
yes but that looks completely different in the server logs than a macro does as well to the people watching there is simply no way that a innocent person would be seen as a macro when they are notare you stating that the eula allows macroing because ccp has explicitly stated otherwise please clarify your point
the server logs dont work in this way the multiplayer architecture is such that the logs arent a reliable source of exactly when things happenedif youve ever had a disputed reimbursement petition then youll know ccps response is our logs dont work like thatthe use of macros is prohibited under set circumstancesthis allows for users of hid helpers for the disabled some users require the use of macros to be able to play the game however they gain no advantage over other players with these thus they are allowedthis clause has created some ambiguity and although it has been clarified by ccp in the past different opinions on its meaning have been put forwardalso remember not all macros are automated bots but instead keystroke combinations recorded on gaming keyboardsthere are also likely people that use macros to map keys that ccp hasnt included in the assignable shortcutsyes market bots and 237 ratters are bad yes ccp do what they can no your anecdotal observation does not constitute any real evidencemaking mining more painful then it already is isnt a solution either
not true i actually had them tell me exactly what happened and point out a noobish mistake i had made this tells me the logs work fine and that your argument is invalidand macro mining is one of themyou did bring up some good points but i still fail to see how any of the fallacious arguments you have made have any legitimate stance against making it easier for people who see the same person make the same exact same action at regularly timed intervals for 20 hours straight for days in a row with no deviation on timing to report the obvious macro miner
because your mistake was something obvious that didnt depend on timing of events or client desyncnowhere in the terms is macro mining specifically prohibitedacquisition of items currency objects character attributes rank or status at an accelerated rate when compared with ordinary game playso timing of events is your criteria a the server log times dont match what actually happened on the client due to desyncb any bot can be programmed to add randomness to timingsjust to clarify i dont macro but i wish mining wasnt painfuli have rsi from many years of computer work sometimes just putting my hand in the shape of a mouse can hurtit hurts i wish it didnt i would like to see features in eve that reduce strain and allow users to reduce the amount of time clicking or holding the mouseid like to see macros reduced by the inclusion of fantastic ui in eve itself a level playing field where everyone can play without physical painchasing legit users around because they recorded a few keystrokes is counterproductive to this goal
that does not make your argument valid and it does not invalidate my own experiencenot true they have stated this very publicly so unless you can get a ccp employee to respond to this thread and say that macro mining is ok and allowed by the rules and is not considered an exploit that argument is simply invalid no that was simply a perfectly legitimate example people in my profession call it a test casenot if the goal is to catch the people who cheat by recording these keystrokesyour entire bias against the proposal seems to stem from a misunderstanding of the rules banning macro use in all formseditif you reread the unholy rage and real money trading is bad mkay dev blogs again you will find that they both explicitly mention that macro miners support rmt and macroanything is against the rules of the game clearly ccp has stated publicly that macroing is against the rules and anybody that declares otherwise is wrong
i believe there have been several gm responses but nothing concreteits probably smart of ccp to keep this a lil openended to leave room for people with different style interfaces due to disability or other legit reasonswhen boiled down my objection isnt to the rules but more of a redirection of this approach to the problema report button isnt the same for macros like it is for isk spammers as others state abovewhile other threads have suggested further input from miners to ensure they are at the keyboardi believe the solution cant be anything that requires further input while user reporting of macros is completely subjectivejust like the war on drugs there is zerotolerance and then harmreduction approaches ccp for the most part have gone with the carrot and stick kind of harm reductionfurther harm reduction could be achieved by bringing up the ui to the point where the gap between macro and player is reduced while still allowing higher efficiency for micromanagementsomeone quoted me as saying i wanted automated mining but this isnt the case either there is room for improvement in the system as it stands i often find mining that my hand is constantly on the mouse even in between cycles while jetcan mining adds a lot of unnecessary clickingthis is poor ui which can be improved there is no argument for it being a click sinkid like to see a shift away from timesinks being connected to masses of clicking and mouse work its possible to get these same gameplay effects while maintaining the possibility for micromanagement and the same mix of possibilities when it comes to mining logisticsreduce the clicking and mouse work thus reducing the area in which macros can operate
did it occur to either of you that neither of you know what the server logs actually frakking sayi mean its all good your having a lengthy discussion but you people have no bloody idea what is logged or what is not loggedgms wont even show you the logs they just say if its is or not is and thats not muchwith all due respect stop acting like fools and stick to the topic on handjust think about what your getting at macros by definition are keystrokes recorded and played backand im pretty damn sure they are not keylogging as it would be a severe and very stupid move on the part of ccp considering the various laws in the various countries concerning privacynow its possible they log actions its possible that they may record significant eventsbut we dont know you dont know they wont tell you and likely for a damn good reasonto debate is stupid and foolish at best macro is a problem but dont make stupid assumptions over things you dont knowas to the recent responses to push for support the fact remains i will not support this proposal until the op edits it to say what venk suggestedperiodi have enough trouble with the csm misreading and doing there own little things id like to be accurate with such a dangerous proposal
one of the points of this thread is that people woting for it want a immediate action against the suspected macromost of the time it is the worst solutiona if he is a real macro user linked to a money trade network you want to watch him to caught the whole network and ban a lot of people in one go so you dont want to alert him sending messages on the tune of you are a macro to the character b if he is a player using a macro for personal gain you want to stop him as fast as possible c if he is not a macro but a regular player you want to bother him as little as possibled in every case you want to use as little manpower as possible while getting your goal and checking all the reports about suspected macros with 5 guys reporting the same character so that ccp will act and 5 different gm getting a report about player x is not the way to go to maximize efficient manpower useso only in case b the suggested reporting idea work so non supported
i oppose this only because it creates more riskfree isk for people who stay at their keyboard actual people should mine in lowsec and nullsec with friends
i would think the system should be smart enough to channel 5 different macro reports of the same offender to 1 gm p
that is totally and utterly false please read the unholy rage and rmt is bad mmmkay devblogs again as a head gm said this was abuse and against the rules very publicly and very explicitly and anything you say to the contrary just makes it look like you can not read english and do not know what you are talking about im not going to debate this further with you as i have proven my point and you are only trying to troll especially since the rest of your arguments are outside the scope of this proposalthan support this proposalthat is already in place there is no need to add it because it already exists since its already against the rules and is considered a form of abuse to abuse the petition system please explain why you think its not you should support this if that is your only issuein my professional experience most ticketing systems based on assets in this case accounts are that smart if configured correctly and unless its a funky in house developed system instead of an off the shelf software solution it should already support this so that would not be an issue but lets consider this added to the proposal just in case in order to provide yet more safety to innocent users who get reported by mistake
a lot of the confusion here is about the definition of macro most ppl dont understand or misread the eula or they read one part and ignore the other partfrom my dealings with devs heres some clarification of some areassimple shortcut remapping allowed it can be done from eve through the shortcut menu remapping multiple keys to a mouse stroke or an individual key is not an exploit because you can already do this from the eve shortcut menu shortcut menu doesnt allow mice remapping but in this case theyve allowed it because its trading a keyboard keystroke for a mouse keystrokeif you cant do it from the eve shortcut menu it cant be done within the confines of the rules releasing drones for instance no shortcut for that if you were to create one with a third party program you would essentially be hacking the clientnothing that reads client or screen information and uses it to automate an outcome is not alloweddr battlesmith brings up the point of players with disabilities it hasnt been an issue for me so i have no petition info on this situation i suppose one could contact a dev through a petition and make a request for an exception its not the type of thing you want to point to after a ban as justification for breaking the eula
someone in a orca bumped my mackinow while ice mining along came a brutix and attacked me no big deal part of game he got me about 15th into armor and concord arrived and attacked his brutix i found the next thing interesting his ship dissapeared and there was no wreck just his pod floating there next to the orca i asked if he docked the brutix in the orca and was told no you cant dock a combat ship in one load of crap ok i really dont care about the attack etc i didnt lose the ship but niether did the attacker there was no wreck none i was watching the whole thing it simply dissappeared or rather docked i thinkmy question is is docking a concord agrod ship criminal flagged into an orca to save it an exploit would seem to be as your avoiding concord which is an exploitedited i changed to proposalfix agree that concord agroing the orca would be a fix and yes i was watching the entire event and there never was a brutix wreck
if it is like you described id say yes its an exploitto fix it make ships with aggro unable to be placed in the hangar or for more tears make concord also kill the orca dthat being said you have either forgot to formulate this thread as a proposalfix or you posted it in the wrong forum assuming you wanted to propose a fix to the exploit ill support it
sounds like an exploit to mesupport for a fix
the same got reported for carriers aswell you can move ships into the ship maintenance bay under aggression
i dont think being able to store a ship with aggression is an exploit at least not yetprobably the same flaw in the aggromechanic that allows rr ships to dockjumphowever if done to avoid concord it is a banning offence  doesnt matter if the trick used is new crime is still a crimeaggro mechanics need to be fixed in all regards for this my support
maybe also file a petition about it
yup petition it avoiding concord is also a bannable offence i think
avoiding concord is considered an exploit so yes it is a bannable offense though in reality if its your first offense you may just get a temp ban that would be up to ccpin any case yes i would definaitely petition it and yes ccp needs to fix it
docking under aggro wont matter as you can pop the pod in all eventuality course im sure someone would point out that its still exploitable session timerbut docking under concordescaping concord is an bannable offenseso yes it should be petitioned
if thats what really happened then i support this topick and next time make sure concord kills the orca as well
err no just make them unable to dockstore docking timer should be same as storing ship timer
yeah this needs a fix of some sort
i support this need to be fixed although i recommend not to criminal flag the orca to concord just refuse to allow the ship to be docked if its criminally flaggedproblem with criminally flagging and concording the orca is if a undercover badguy joined a corp to protect them while mining and then attacked a neighboring ship to get concorded drop his ship into the corporate orca and let concord pop the orca for tears thats just wrong lol
my problem is there is no systematic way to occupy systems in fw there is also no reward at all for doing it we rely on some randomisation code snippet to spawnseed plexes in random locations all over the region so even if u do pull of the impossible and occupy some system u get no prize nothing all this hard work for nothing why even bother u get nothing
given that epic mission arcs are now an integral part of the game as highlevel content missions i bring the proposal to create new arcs to fill or transform some of the missing gapsfirst ill like to review current existing arcs so everyone understands for what im aiming forthe bloodstained stars is meant for newer players to present the eve lore and state of affairs galaxy wide i ran through it and albeit entertaining it was just getting your feet wet into the real background and storyline of everight to rule penumbra syndication and wildfire are the epic arcs for expert missions runners with highfaction standing their storylines are filled with complots and highlevel connectionssmash and grab angel sound are the pirate epic arcs meant to allow players running missions in lawless space and fix their pirate standings if desired introducing the player to the life of danger and glory that means living out of concord reachhowever we currently lack a kind of midlevel epic arc with the empire factions something that allows a notsonew player to unlock wider options for missions at level 2 in gallente space there is a set of missions that i dont know if are considered epics arcs but exist nonetheless the circle agents 6 level 1 agents who just ask for courier stuff and bring you back to the starting point and the graduation certificate chain avrue auz  bezan picholen  mamo guerre we also have the old cosmos constellationsthis proposal is to rekindle with these concepts and transform them into epic arcs using existing tools with the integration onto the journal tool and enhancing the storytelling those missions provideevery faction should have a sort of circle agent epic arc that allows gaining basic standing with a varied group of npc corporations of said faction i understand all factions currently have them but the idea would be to transform said chains into epic arcs extend the number of corporations that you gain access to and provide a common starting point in each faction space much like the pirate arcs haveimprove the graduation certificate chain changing the certificate to a token of trust from the faction and enhance storytelling by that i mean we as players run the new certificate arcs but get much deeper info on the lore and background of a single faction understand more the shades of gray in it and learn the origin and position they have in the political landscape of new eden in the end a token of trust is earned after proving yourself to be loyal to the chose faction just a ingame item as souveniralso i would like to see the current cosmos missions chains converted into epic arcs with multiple branching allowing players to get involved with the long gone civilizations of new eden their relics and the current power blocs attempting to seize themfinally the original reason of this post a proposal to build a new set of epic arcs aimed at level 2 difficulty with the interfaction relations say khanidamarr encompassing the fragile but important ties that bind such groups togethergiven that epic arcs tools were designed to provide a continuing experience of mission running within a single plot certificate chains circle agents and cosmos could all be integrated into it and freshen up existing content of the gameplease provide feedback or support depeding if you like it or not
instead of prostitutes being static roleplay items make each one pay you an amount of isk per day equal to the amount of manhours players spend docked in the station the prostitute is in divided by the number of prostitutes in that station perhaps the prostitutes need a fixed upkeep so that you cant clutter every system in the cluster with them maybe every so often one would catch a disease and wouldnt be able to work unless you bought her medicinethis could help nerf highsec mission running by creating more lucrative alternativesiskperprostitute  average number of players in station  number of your prostitutes in stationtotal number of prostitutes in station  costsperprostitutenumber of your prostitutes in station

i support my own thread 
people are always saying that space is a big place rightcontrary to what most people believe this space isntthis specific message is going out to the people that want sovereignty but cant take it simply because the moment they do a much larger alliance simply bowls over them and overwhelms saya 200 man alliance with about 5060 active players with a 1500 man alliance with about 700 active players the simple fact is the smaller alliance simply doesnt have the means to fight back against the larger alliances simply because they all want the same spot the sandbox is getting too crowded to use a ccp termmy proposal is extremely simple increase the amount of space in the normal eve galaxy by a large amount say five new regions with about 125 systems each that total would allow a huge amount of new expansion and the propsects of expanding further outward would be ideal for a large alliance thus leaving the smaller alliances free to simply hold three or four systems out of a constellation the galaxy as it is presents too little opportunity to expand simply because the larger alliances take up a huge amount of room within the nullsec regions more room in the sandbox more people can play comfortably of course im not suggesting that ccp comes up with sayanother five regions of wormhole space i mean in the actual galaxy itself where no doubt more than 90 of the playerbase prefers to reside the additional room would give enough space to allow players to explore other options while not stifling the players that already have a foothold in a certain area of space more freedom would allow the smaller groups to simply be overlooked by the much larger alliances and thus their efforts to build up wouldnt be utterly wasted by the attempt all this said this is simply a proposal so if you have more to contribute please do

this probably has been raised before but ill raise it again for emphasis fw needs some lovei understand the limitations of game mechanics in realistically reflecting an ongoing war but what im seeing right now is outright ridiculousit is a regular occurrence that i warp into complexes of all sizes only to see a single speed tanked sigil fighting there and usually warping out at the first sight of danger apparently all it takes to defeat the almighty imperial navy is to orbit their installations for a few minutes after which the best and brightest of the empire will simply surrender without a shot being fired at themthis can be fixed very easily even if you dont want to balance out the npc difficulty levels which i could live with you could at least make it so that a complex can never be taken so long as there are still npcs flying in the same complexthis would restore my sens of immersion and also make victory all the more satisfying and deserved for the opposing militia
how about just have each major empire be an island of highsec within a sea of lowsec all surrounded by nullsec and increase the number of connections between each empire so that there arent terrible gatecamps and make it so that you can get to any other empire by remaining in lowsec the solitude region has the right idea

cant agree more kinda silly that you gather more info about your own drones when they are zipping around at 5kms than you do when they are sitting in your hangeras people have already stated drones need a massive revamp imho i think that the system needs to be taken back to the drawing board and reworked as a wholebuying drones should be like buying ships i think that drones should have slots and allow for customization beyond the ability to buy slightly faster or slower drones that do less or more dmg of a different type new drone models as well as cool drocking and undocking animations would be pretty pro
also need to be able to fix drones in drone bay slowly

first the problem  with any bounty system alts can and will be used to get around the system there is very little that can be done to prevent an alt of a pirate collecting a bounty and then giving the cash to the pirate in question ergo collecting bounties must be done in such a way that there is an added cost to the pirate for being collected clone fees is one such way restricting payouts is an another in combination this should workproposed solution cap all bounty payouts to the cost of the clone the bounty only reduces by the amount of the clone but is not eliminated completely example someone who has a bounty of 20 million on his head is killed his current clone is worth half a million isk so that is the reward to the one collecting the bounty the remaining bounty drops that half mil to 195effects this would immediately destroy any profitability behind an alt committing fraticide killing off his alt to collect the full fee to remove the bounty all together it would require killing the alt several times until the total pay out was reduced to 0 and therefore incurring the clone cost each and every single time there is no net gain for the player and his alts bounties would be smaller for the hunters as well but they dont suffer the penalty of having to pay for a new clone for them killing off the pirate is almost pure profit other then the cost of the munitions and equipment
supported
while your proposal addresses the exploitability of the current bounty system it makes the system near pointless who is gonna risk his stuff just to get the meager value of the clone as bounty also you dont propose a solution for the acquiringtransferring of killrightsnevertheless i think youre going in a right direction which eventually leads to damage based bounties where you can avoid the exploitability as long as bounties payed out  damage done like with any approach to revamping the bounty system there are many unsolved issues but im keeping at it

the convo popup is exploitable by pirates who convoes targets as they decloak so they cant see what they are doing and cant control their ship to prevent this you have to be able to block all convoes
would be cool if someone has a container in space left behind that has a password on it that you can use your analizer and take some time to decrypt the container to get the passwordit would actually show you the password so that you can retype it into the contain to gain accessthat way you can try the same password on all the containers floating aroundrecenlty i hit a pocket of space where there were about 20 cargo containers floating aroundit would have been cool if i can hack into themperhaps make it a skill to learn or something
i think they shud make a hacking v prerequisite skill called secure hacking and allow hacking of the secure cans at level 1 let 1 cycle to decrypt take 6m each level of secure hacking reduce it by 10 so at best its a 3m hackto make it fair during hacking u are flashy red to the corp you are hacking if you open it and take something from it you get on the kill list for 5 days for the corp hey no one said being a criminal was easy
actually their is a way to do this and not disturb the fact that they need to be transported and thats part of the sov worksoverignty structures are concord based so make them be forced to be built in highsec at a concord sanctioned station highsec just like u cant anchor capital ship buildings in hs make the reverse concord building array only in  04 and make it for building soverignty structures

and your point is you forget that a lot of so called carebears keep eve fine and dandy runnning i even dont get all of this carebear calling this thread is about ppl moving around in high sec not in delve or fountain my friend its decouraging should a newbie lose everything heshe collected due to some kid suicide ganking in high sec without real penalty and even making a fortune out of the insurance payment no risk involved
1 how many times do i have to say this high sec is not a sanctuary2 care to link the lossmails3 by your logic any pvp at criminally flags at all would void insurance but if u wanted realism like that insurance wouldnt exist on any ship it might be to your liking as a carebear but then again pvp is a major facet in eve so thats not gonna happen4 so its the gankers fault some carebears r so stupid5 and what about the fact that its scifi hmm thats what i thought
1 and the pvpers r the consumers that keep eve fine and dandy running as well its not so much the carebears hate any form of pvp cause technically theyre competing against each other to get their items sold its cause they refuse to learn and do anything about being ganked themselves and just  to ccp to hold their hand2 high sec is not a sanctuary3 a newb wouldnt have 100 mil in assets cause at that point he shouldve already learned a thing or two even if its the hard way4 its an intended mechanic with sec penalties imposed as its limitation if u think its so riskless go ahead and try suicide ganking a newb ship go ahead and keep doing it then go rat to get back the sec status and see if it was worth it
suicide ganking is an art but insurance shouldnt be paid to you if concord destroys your ship if you initiate the attack in 00 and are still destroyed yea get your insurance but if concord blows your stuff up insurance should be dismissed
dominion 11 is out tyrannis has been announced and most afs still pretty much suck so le bump ccp please do the following perform an internal rebalancing within the class such that all afs can achieve similar utility to the jag andor ishkur add a fourth bonus either as a role bonus for the whole class or new individual bonuses for each ship consider reducing their massesincreasing their base speeds to match those of their t1 counterpartssome additional and more specific desires in no particular order swap the jaguars optimal bonus for tracking a la the rifter increase fitting room on the wolf and hawk extra mid on the enyo and retribution in fact an extra mid  fittings to use it would be a pretty good addition across the line but its nearessential on these two fix rockets bring back the ab boost it was great 
did you read what i said 75 range bonus and 75 damage bonus over the longest range high faction ammo thats more range and more damage against normal t1 ammo the damage advantage broadens to 35 a very large bonus under any circumstances but still less then the 68 damage advantage that invalidates half the t1 ammo types if a 35 damage bonus and 15 range bonus over t1 isnt enough on top of the extra 2 damage per level applied to the gun isnt enough to be a reward then well just have to disagree all that said i wouldnt mind if t2 ammo remained as it was if there was a full set of t2 ammo at varying ranges like t1 which would at least allow range flexibility to not come at a terrible damage penaltyyou said it yourself iron does piddly damage and it isnt until dg iridium that you get equal damage to t2 after having lost 60 of the range bonus on a rokh thats 75km of range where theres no benifit to switching up for shorter ranged ammo and thats only if you have some of that expensive and rare faction ammo on hand for pure t1 ammo damage equal to spike lies someplace between lead and thorium after weve started to tread into negative range bonuses broadening the distance where spike is the only one worth bringing to more then 100km this is why the rokhs advantage of being able to use higher damaging ammo is utterly and completely laughable
i dont disagree with your numbers but with the method all balancing should be done around t1 weaponsammo since the existent differences already implemented in the ammo tiers ranges will take care of the scalingmy correction to spike ties directly with preventing the gallente ships becoming op wout restricting them to being subpar to suggest modifyng more the ammowepon interaction needs more data which i dont currently have that means fields data from in game engagements and tactical scenarios used until then i suggest we keep the changes requested to an absolute minimumthanks for your support though as well as everyone else it is after all an issue affecting 50 of eve pilots in that light why dont you poke corpmates and friends to come add that support maybe even get some acknowledgment from csm too

problem you can not align to preset bookmarks youve made how many times have you been in lownull sec or even at war in empire and have went through the trouble of setting up a safe spot a spot in random space that can not be warped to unless in fleet with someone at said destination or having the bookmark or being scanned out and if your in a real pickle you set up 2 or 3 or more now when im in a combat situation i like to be aligned to something at all times so if they enemy warps in i can get out at any time but if i get scanned out in my safe spot i have to be aligned to a planet or station etc and the enemy can see where exactly im warping to and can send the rest of the fleet to intercept solution make an align to option under the bookmark drop down tab when you go over the planets belts stations and gates you can easily align to those and i understand that its because it comes up in your overview but why not be able to align to your safe spots ideas and comments appreciatedadded meant to put in sooner just didnt get to it but also the ability to align to fleet members invaluable in fleet warfare

there is no way to avoid being war decced 100 of the time however there are deterrents first you can hire mercs to counter dec your enemy second you can join an alliance for security third you can train up to use combat ships and fight back fourth you can take a vacation from eve and let the war dec reward the enemy in zero targets zero fun and some wasted iskif you know what you are doing on the market this is actually not that badhow you fight a war is up to you but you fight one everyday as soon as you log in
i sympathize with the op because i believe that there is something wrong when cowardly griefers  and they are most definitely cowards or theyd be attacking someone of equal skill rather than shooting fish in a barrel by wardeccing newbs and industrialists  can force people to not play the game that they are paying real world money for i would like to have the ability to take revenge by being able to file some kind of miningdec that would allow industrial players to declare a state of operations where members of the decced corp could undock only in mining barges exhumers industrials freighters  so as to deny them their preferred activities  which they pay real world money to engage in  in the same way that a wardec denies industrialists the ability to engage in our preferred activitiesas the op gains more experience heshe will clearly see that the people who post most vehemently about how eve is a pvp game are the ones who rather than engaging in actual combat with equals like to shoot fish in a barrel
corp is less then 3 weeks old and you expect people to have tons of money to throw away also as an mining corp if they cant mine they cant get money so thats a great idea of paying merc corps
i can only see two reasons that would keep you from joining a 00 or lowsec alliance or corp which would discourage people although not prevent them from wardecing you1 you only want to mine2 you want to stay in safe high secsolutionjoin an npc corp the only downside you cannot have your own pos but you can mine without any more tax than if you were in your own corporation
war deccing is part of eve would be pointless to war dec someone in 00 or low sec eve is a cut throat style game paying isk for concord to look the other way is just one of those risksif your corp is only 3 weeks old and you get war decced all you have to do is either surrender and find a corp that can back you there are way too many corps now anyway or you can stay docked and bore them to deathnot supported
yes thats how eve works glad were on the same page here
the whole point of a war dec is to allow you to shoot people in high sec so no
war declarations in eve are darwins law applied got deced man up and defend your corporation if you cant then you didnt deserve the corp to begin with
short answer nolong answer nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
allow me to stress again my basic argument there are people in eve who prefer to do combat and there are those who prefer to do other things both groups have every and equal rights to play eve the way they like to play it but their interest conflict sometimes and a lot of eve game mechanics is about balancing those interests that is why we have highsec lowsec nullsec concord et all eve has done a great job in that but wardeccing is now upsetting the fine balance to much in favour of those who want to shoot othersand that is why the wardeccing mechanics needs changing to bing back the balance
mimimimimimino
makes war irrelevant because it doesnt matter in who you attack in lownull sec  besides this is where yet another career comes up merc corps  hire one with all the ore you mined 
speaking as a minerindustrialist noeither learn how to avoid people who want to shoot you or learn to shoot back effectively
best reply so far and from csm tooyeah keep posting in this thread i see it going far not really
and you are who
id like to point out contrary to popular belief high sec even with concord in a 10 sec system is in fact not safe simple as that to prove this point someone go suicide gank him to show that you dont even need war to be killed in high sec
now it just seems that people who dont support this are the people who enjoy war deccing indy corps the high sec pirate corps are just the ones that fail at low secnull sec pvp and have to get their anger out on people who cant fight back
in most cases yes but what about an ahole corp who keeps can flipping you indy guys in our corp what then they just sit there and steal your ores or what if you just plain out right dont like them cuz they talk smack or you got beef with em for a legit reason

once again we see the maturity and actual age of our csm at workgreat jobgolf clapsnow as to the opfirst off let me appluad you for not going emoragerant on your post at least you where decent enough to be eloquentsecondly not going to happenive been playing for about 2 yearsif not more and if theres one thing ive learned wardecing as stupid and absolutely ridiculous as it is mechanics wise is not something that needs to be eliminated from the gamethere are some very clear points ive learned from this wardecing system1 80 to 99 of the wardecs ive encountered are all done for the expressed purpose of greifingnot all are like that there are some who target you to make an effort to nerf your logistics pipeline such as 00 alliances or whs operations yet they never really follow you they just station camp there asses off pathetic2 said greifers are typically cowards they refuse to leave the safety of high sec and as soon as you step out side into lowsec or whs they generally do not follow as they are now subject to getting shot at this means they are geared to shoot down carebears and not other pvpers3 wardecs only end when there killboard eff goes down or they get bored as such its never a matter of isk and they tend to cheat the system by ending the wardec and starting it up again to lower the rates when possible wardecs as such are very cheap and cost literally nothingonly gets expensive if they are stacked multiple wardecs on target or its an alliance and typically they wont go after an alliance unless its an soft target4 wardecs as such do not serve any purpose other than to deal out easy kills and make it an overused excuse to say its pvp game only and thats that funny enough the excuse to tell them to go npc doesnt work when you have suicide ganking at an all time high imagine thatso yeah wardec is broken its frakked up its abused exploited dont even get me startedso why do i not support thisbecause there are no other methods in taking action against harassmentso like it or not its here to stayyoull love this thoimho there is absolutely no reason what so ever to be a corporaiton in high sec spaceseriously its stupidunless your pvping manufactureing and odds are most are solo corps or strong enoughintimdating enough to keep out of trouble you have no business being in a corporaiton or being a member of one if your going to be a carebearyou make just as much money more in many cases and do better in npcteams can exsist outside of a corporation a corporaiton is nothing more than a formality with some minor advantageswith mailinglists chat rooms cheap hosting you can get one put together with minimal effortso sorry mate you should join an alliance thats strong enough to deal with it or move to 00 spaceit doesnt remove the risk but the rewards make up for it if your able to hold your own out hereif i end up going to high sec i will not be in a corporation of any kind that i can assure you unless i decide to join one thats strong enough to deal with the problemeve is not pve online or pvp online its eve onlinedont let anyone tell you differentlyso in conclusion not supporting
dunno how ccp is hiring their csms but obviously they anret aware of you no showing any kind of respect for the paying customerluckily you are only a csm not a dev so it is not your call what happens and what doesnt happenid advice ccp to do some quality selection ammong their csms
i will support your proposal if you amend it so that i can choose buy the stuff you sell at a price i think is fair as long as i dont make any stuff myself you see it is not my playstyle to spend all my time making isk and i dont see why you greedy miners and manufacturers should be allowed to grief me by gouging my wallet forcing me to buy t2 ships and modules at far above the price i want to paysound fair
csm are elected by the players ccp doesnt do much else beyond thatmalcanis  u mad
well eve is rated for people to be at least 13 years old if you cant handle a little smack talk in local then maybe you need to mature a little many people i know just laugh off smack talk and try not to antagonize it as for constant can flipping i can see that being a legit reason for a war dec but not random can flipping one in awhilewhat i think would be a good thing would be that each corp has to have a representative after a certain time period when the war is declared then both sides would have to explain why or why not they should be able to have a war the third party would be representing concorddev this person would listen to both sides and decide if there is cause for war in high sec but of course eve devs are lazy and probably wouldnt do this because then they would have to do actual work
you would be sooo dissapointed if you knew what happened today also drake being csm doesnUFFFDt prevent me from laughing at stupid ideas
ye i agree on this i am intaki and it would be nice to visit my homeworlds also it would be nice to do race specific missions in your homeworldsi fear at this point the only way i would be able to return home would be to join the syndicate not that its a bad idea but it is the point that i cant return home without getting pkd so even though the syndicate if i remember correctly is outcast from the federation i am outcast from my homeworlds
so what happens to anybody who has a pos already set up there what about the 2 cadnium  1 titanium moons there will they still be mineablehow ridiculous would it look to have a hi sec system by itself in a low sec dead end constellation i mean 4 jumps from the closest hi sec system cmonnot to mention this would set up a precedent for other systems to have pilots begging for being turned into hi sec i love the idea of the intaki struggle in game but if im correct they dont really want to be gallente all that much so why would it matter if the gals took that space backyou want to make it real interesting open up luminaire so that caldari fw pilots can drop in cap ships to help out that titanax
tyrannisseems like our planetary interaction will be the next expansion so last opportunity to fix the physics of planets
why not more immersion is always good
support 100 this is a very good point
hey kids listen upits a game you are just a fat cola drinking zit faced kid playing a game on a pc your dad bought for you whats the point in ccp spending phd time figuring out graphics for somehing that does not matter and you could not understand anyway and nophd is not short for pretty huge  listen to an educated guy mba just make it look good and yes mba is short for married but available in case that are any girls reading this
signed with enthusiasmwonder ccp power activate and make this happen
supported
sounds like a great idea
another yes idea from the pirate queen this would be a major ui improvement instead of gimping it for combat probes you could make their scan take a few seconds longer than core probes
id kinda like to see this for all probes mainly because attempting to move objects in 3d space using a 2d interface is all kinds of terrible but the point that it might make probing ships too easy does need to be considered
you would have to reduce the number of active probes to the number of probes in the saved config as the game cannot assume what probes you want to use but yes i think something like this should be done also and while youre at it ccp if these ships are so advanced how come autopilot cant fly closer to the gate or all the way to the place you want to go to in the destination system oh right cause it provides for more drama if they stop at the gate hm sandbox
probing is already very efficient one of the few measures to limit effciency is the limitations of the uii dont think its a good idea to have ui limitations govern game balance as is the case with probing currently but without a better system removing those limitations would make probing far too efficienta saved layout of probes would need to be coupled with limitations somehow significantly longer scan times could be a way to do it
would love to see this happening yea here with ya on this idea all the way mynx
yes pplease although i have a bad feeling that ccp wont do it simply because it is in ther best interest to keep things tedious if only you could get all the isk in the universe with onre click then we would not be playing this game right
voted absolutely yes
no i am the fastest scanner i have ever meetwhy my rl skill should be no longer relevant 
not only would make probing too easy at this point just remove it and make the scanner able to point objects and ships it would also make macroprobers easy to program
time flux detected you are going too fast wait five minutes and try again lolanyway agreed i also agree with the macro probers dint know that was a prob until nowit would save me much time while probing in low sec not that i go there much anymore these days but i would if this was possible
heh sure give them a slight repair amount buffa couple things caused the current issues with active tanks though that just giving those ships a rep buff wont solve itccp borked the all you can eat nos many an active tank was fueled by this in the day this in and of itself wouldnt have been a killer for active tanks ccp then added rigs i love rigs alot but tbh the buffer rigs are just too damn effective now with heat and boosters and implants there is a hint of hope for the active tank since heat a tank for a bit pop a blue or exile and rock a hg crystal set and life can get pretty damn fun again for an active tank till you run into a couple neutsthe bigger problem and why i get nervous with active tanks is its damn hard to keep it in cap in eve cap is life without it you are toast yes projectiles dun need it and buffer tanks dont either but even with projectiles and buffer tanks i shut off your prop mod web point etc and you are a sitting duckthe kiss principle applies the simplest and easiest way to pvp currently is to buffer tank it and have some rr handywall of text aside make the change and add more  to the active tanking ships but its the cap thats the killer on them treating a symptom not the disease
i think boosting armorshield rep amount wont change anythingcyclone 600dps600dps tank pvpfit anyone myrmidontriple rep 1k dps tank and maelstrom omggot a friend that tanks 2k dps with it are awesome tankers for solosmall engagements already rep amounts incl implantsboostersheat wo fleet booster the problem lies within buffertanking especially rigs no stacking penalties etcmy suggestion is more about balancing rigs eg introduce omni resist rigs stacking penalize buffer amount rigs rigs are designed to be less effective as t2 modules but regenerative membrane for armor tanks has 15 as well sorry buffing repboost amount isnt the solution lets work on the rigsedit i fly buffer tanked ships abaddongeddon harbinger absolution as well as active tanked ships myrmidoncyclone
definitely pvp is so interactive and a broad spectrum of activities mining consists of turning on lasers filling up emptying rinse repeat hopefully theyll add belts to be found soon rather than macros simply having free roam to kill belts everywhere definitely supported to give another profession a new look as far as the planet thing i wouldnt consider that really mining wouldnt that be more a pos thing
give mining the love it deserves
1 mining laser should have a cycle time of one second2 roids should be much smaller3 belts are moving through space at like 50 ms4 there should be more suboretypes like 5 or so going up to 25 more mineral yieldcombining all mining would be like following you have to constantly watch were your ship is moving have to scanwatch for the good roids relock roids more often but donUFFFDt loose any mining yield because of 1
this ship would be a great addition to the ore fleet as it fills the role between the roqual and orca high sec oppsorca perma boasts at the belt and acts as a gscthis beast picks up ore from orca and brings it to the station lownull sec oppsroqual is at a pos grinding ore and providing boaststhis beast supports the fleet with its rr and brings the ore to the roqual win win as its a skill intensive train for a very specialized role that needs to be filled signeddia
to be compleatly honest  i would as i have already trained two orca pilots one for boasting and one for hauling this would be a godsendsignededit forgot to check support lol
ahhh ye i am all for a custom paint job now that i found this topic but what i was really after was this if not the custom paint how about sort of custom decals ie corp logosbanner and alliance logosbanner on ships
problem ever noticed when your scanning a shadow on the plane of the system ever sent your probes beneath this shadow and had your nice bright easy to see squares and arrows darkened because of this shadow this shadow makes it hard to see what your trying to do when moving your probes around beneath this plane solution quite simply take out the shadow from the plane this would make it much easier to scan things out that are in the bottom half of systems that fall below this annoying thing and personally i dont much see the point in it being there in the first placeor an option to at least turn it off in the settings overview as some people still like it for orientation purposesthird suggestion by popular demand p replace this black cloud with a simple and clear and might i add much more useful plane grid more or less exactly like the tactical overview but instead of showing km show how many au it is from you this would help players not only remember where they are but also shows how far something is useful for d scan and much like tactical overview can be turned on an off with a simple button in the scanner box
not supported it helps orientation and positioning probes its a good feature
agreedits even worse on an old crt monitor that is darker then it ought to be
then an option to turn it off in the settings because i can see it being used for orientation but in the bigger picture are you worried about where they are or where the things your scanning are
signeda billion percent its rubbish ccp sort it out forget the famn zephyr forget making everything shiny forget walking in stations  this issue is so damn overduie that eve online looks so stoooopid
definitely supportedid also like to add more variablity to the points of impact on the ship im shooting at when i actually hit it  it looks kinda strange when my 8x800mm always hit the exactly same place on the opponents ship
there are 1000 more relevant issuesproblems with eve than cosmetics but sure fix it
i think it would be best to criminally flag just the attacking ship and make it undockable if you flag the orca then concord splodes it it would become loot then another orca can swoop in and people would then use higher isk ships probably like tengus or something fitted to make the orca look cheap then theyd get the ship from the loot and fly off to exploit again which would then bring us back here if a ship is flagged to concord it should not be able to dock anywhere
sorry i was too lazy to read everything most of it but i blindly agree on the defender missiles because i have seen in locals chat that defender missiles are useless because you have to target the ship firing the missiles and have to target the incoming missiles and time the incoming from looking at the ship launching and timing it correctly i agree the defenders should work as fof for other missiles make them worth their one and only tier make them worth the bpo its printed on make them worth the isk for me to manufacture and selleh im running with ithave fun good luck
yes make them work
yes fix em
im sure at some level in the brain of the person who thought this out it made sense but ive lost count on how many people ive reported as isk spammers blocked or kicked from fleet instead of warping to just because that button is lost in the multitude of other buttons this buttons are supposed to be the last resort not to be pressed by accident so why are they in the middle of the buttons that are used very often i propose they are moved to a bottom most group if more than 1 option of this type is available they are to be grouped and this entire group must be separated by at least 1 blank space so mistakes by the need to act fast do not happen again if anything i bet this will take some load off your gms since im sure some people have been reported as isk spammers erroneously  i know ive reported some
yes i want to support this change since the current system is full of fail
yes and make reporting and isk spammer only available from local
so if you can only use the report isk spammer option from local how will people be able to deal with isk sellers spamming in other public channelsat the very least though the option needs to be removed when youre clicking in a nonpublically accessable channel corp chat alliance chat fleet etc should also remove the ability to report yourself for isk spamming as having that option when you right click on yourself in any channel seems very strangefailing that the ops idea would be a decent compromise making it harder to accidentally report someone without making it harder to report someone you genuinely want to report
yeah they really need to be blocked off also cancelling market orders and anything else thats severe without a confirmation window
i have become aware that caldari storyline agents do not offer fw missions to lead missionrunners out into lowsec to take part in factional warfareevery caldari couriermission runner should be given the opportunity to help maintain control of the black rise regions just as their gallente counterparts do i find it ludicrous that my rd alt who can only fly a shuttle is offered missions to take out dozens of battleships and structures while caldari navy mission runners who have highly developed combat piloting skiills are denied this wonderful opportunity
you saw this threadthe gallente mission runners arent exactly happy with those storylines

lolby default we tend to assume anyone posting here is trying to propose or point out an issue to the csmjokeshumor in that light tend to get treated like spam by the forum mods
ahh ok thnx for letting me know thatso it is not looked at as spam lets put this one up there for a suggestion ridiculedebateand flamesill run with it
just a thought but gankers know what they are getting when they suicide a ship what if the ship had some type of decoy device to lure suicide gankers bring the balance of being ganked back to both sides as it stands now ships can be scanned pretty much at will with no defense against it ganking is a profession which i understand and respect however bring it more on a level playing field if a suicide ganker scans a ship he may have to think twice about his risk vs reward if a ship is equipped with a decoy modrig it could lessen the defense of the ship and make it more gankable but then it is a different type of defense if the ship is empty yet the scan is showing something of value that isnt there it would however not take any items on the ship off the scan list either suicide ganking is about risk and reward if they definitely know what you have makes it kinda unfair if you have no defense against a cargo scan insurance is a whole other ball game i hope is resolved but currently there is no defense against cargo scans with a passive targeter
actually there is a defence against being scanned two actually one small fast ships cant be scanned because they warp before anyone can lock them  covops are perfect for this two the corp hangar bay on an orcaor carrierrorqmomtitan but those are presumably far less practical for you doesnt show on a cargo scanner so anything you carry in there is invisible hope that helps
if i am preparing a stealth attack i whant to get the best ammo type for the job should i not be able to
whatwe have a hard enough time with afk cloaking rants and now you want to compound the problem by making it even more powerfulno not gonna happenbe happy you can do what your able to do already with a cloak
warp to deep safedrop cloakload desired ammorecloakwarp back to targetwoot
not supported you already got so many advantages you dont need more
i am unpleasantly surprised by complete absence of contructive critics and by how personal the responces are i fail to see any connection between switching ammo for an ambush and afkcloacking these two things are utteraly irrelevant to eachother i really whant to know how being able to switch ammo will make afkcloacking overpowered how are these things relevanti get the impression everyone believes that switching for right type of ammo is going to make cloacker solopwnmobiles or something and it espeshially surprises me when compared to how generally positive responce in csm publick was i get am impression here i am asking for something personally for myself so far all i heard is cloakcing is powerfull enough yeah it does what its suppose to do hides your ship and therefore you should not be able to switch ammo because we are all upset about afk cloackers i see alot of logic here
i dont see any reason to think that this would have much of an effect on the game thing is ccp wants cloaking to prevent you from doing anything useful with your ship except moving and while im sure you could add in some cloaked functionlike ammo switching without breaking anything they dont want to add in so much function that they inadvertently let people do something meaningful while cloaked they could micromanage it but theyd probably much prefer to just keep it a blanket ban and not need to think about it i dont think thered be anything bad about the idea were it to be implemented but i dont see any obvious need and i dont expect ccp to like it im not opposed but i dont think i can really support it
in wwii there were these ship called destroyers whos job was to find submarineswhy not take the salvage king desstroyers and make them something like a usefull ship again give them a mod that wont allow a cloak in say 40 km this will make a steath bomber hunter this will stop people from complaining that there are afk cloakers messing up their game etc the stealth bombers would still have the sneak attack but there would have to be a balance other than the tissue thin effect on the bomber
destroyers are very useful in pvpthey especially excel at killing frigates did you notice that stealth bombers are frigatesall in all  not supported
how about an escort type  some sort of interference field that wont allow cloaking for say 3035 ki cant remeber the last time i saw a destroyer in a gang in 00
not supported
i see plenty destroyer class ships in 00 fleets or you travel without interdictors
heavy interdictors yes interdictors are tooo expensive for the little gain to have for killing frigates but the main point of the cloak hunting ship is to counter cloaking ships that are too overbalanced i have seen some of your postings and you seem to have some decent ideas you are a smart kid but instead of all the critiquing that says blah blah im superior give some more helpfull advicesolutionsbtw where have you been i havent seen an interdictor flown in fleet as an active participant in years they normally drop bubble and leavenot as active as i would like noanyone can armchair coach son get in the game afk cloaking is a problem and there are no viable solutions for it no ship should be invulnerable or why the heck fly anything elsegive me a cloaky superjamming viator that does a billion damage per volley hey im up for itso as a serious challenge there use that rapier wit and come with a better solution for this issue that there are god knows how many posts trying be part of the solution or part of the dang problem
ooyou fly in very strange fleets anyway  the cloaking is fine if your system gets to a standstill from a single cloaker in system you have a problem and it is not the cloakerwe had that in our system for the first few days aswell havent seen him for quite a while since they cant get hot drops anymoregrow some balls no need to nerf cloaker more
ive seen interdiction ships on killboards which means the are usedive seen fcs suggest and recommend there use in several different situationsif youve not seen them doesnt mean they arent in use
thanks drake i hear you but they arent very much usedand darious anything else you have made your point seen all your posts you have loads of info and you are the greatest now anyone with actual ideas 
you need to search the other coughcloak posts and understand that this is a massive argument that will never end or resolvehence why we refuse to support any buffs or nerfs on said subject well except one i want covops on black ops just because the very definition of said ship class infers covops and it would make them more popular than just expensive nich shipsinterdiciton ships concidently are used for small gang warfare due to the destroyer aspectthat and the bubbles are detachedthey dont get used to often as destroyers as a general rule of thumb arent too popular in 00 due to it being capheavy and down to bcsyou dont see frigate gangs very often
this should be a quick code impliment but with my manufacturing i am constantly getting annoyed with the fact you cannot stack assets from deliveries with the assets you have or recombine assets after splitting just a thought but it would be handyblood
hi allfirst off in this thread please do not whine about the profitability of lvl 4s go do them if you think is so good this is not about increasing the profitability of missions trust in ccp to strike the isk reward balance with that out if the waywhile lvl 4 are simply too easy for many the jump to lvl 5 is huge the reward is bigger but the increase in risk goes from 0 to highwhat is needed is lvl 45 agents the iskhour ratio could easily be kept the same as in lvl 4s but it would increase the fun a lot if skilled mission runners could get harder missions its afk once u get a good fit that is just too boring this is a cry to make empire missions fun again please
just try smaller ships if you want fun in missions again i just started using sacris for missions pure fun
if you want to make missions fun again rip out the entire structure that they have now and replace it static dumbai nosurprise missions are going to suck pretty much no matter how difficult they are
i for one am sick and tired of selling my stuff one item at a time sometime i have a ton of stuff that has more value being dumped on the market but its a stupefying chore to sell itomg some help please 
in regards to the 2nd posteryou can also attempt to become friendly with or rent space from one of the larger 00 alliances a large number of 00 alliances have an extremely low population density meaning there is a lot of claimed space that is not being used at allbe warned most alliances that you rent from will put you as a buffer between themselves and their enemies although they will often defend their your sovereignty depending on your arrangements they will usually not protect you from roaming gangs
so long as you can hop across a region with only a couple of jumps no space will be too far away from rent seeking warmongers the only really useful means of reducing the effective sphere of influence of the larger 00 entities is curtailing their ability to gallivant around the universe at will without leaving their home space undefended reducing the jump range of ships shortening the titan bridging range and cutting the jump bridge structure entirely out of the game would go a long way towards bringing back the older more fragmented space of years prior
completely disagree adding space will only bandaid the problem the existing superpowers will still have the ability to just steamroll through it in the name of good fightsthe real solution is to nerf all forms of long distance travel to the point where it will become too much effort for people to jump across the galaxy anymore that way a newersmaller alliance can still try to take a small corner of 00 and only have to worry about being curbstomped by a fraction of the map instead of the entire mapben
this does not stop larger alliances from steamrolling smaller ones larger alliances will arbitrarily capture systems they never use just for the sake of it
1 from mein a sense eve to small  but its not because of to low amout of systems  its becuase logistics are to easy
also think about the fact of the placement of the systems ccp if they did add these systems could not just put them in the midst of current null sec but would have to expand it out further where would the current huge alliances take the ones closest to empire because thats where you sell everything and buy everything so not only will smaller alliances have to go even further it would be through more hostile space and more often than not your hard work salvage and loot will all be confiscated by large greedy alliances and the only real way to get it back relatively safe would be jump freighters this would also create a massive imbalance between empire and outlaw space so you would also have to add new space to this region as well
wrong from the outside it may look that way many are station systems and require sov many have jump bridges cyno gens or now with dominion are developed in some cases they are strategic 49u hed ecp8r bwf etcand 00 has never been more fragmentedwtf was the poster that said it was thinking i remember ascn holding the entire southeast d2g the north razoriron bob red alliance all owning multiple regions or go back even further to xetic5capa
space is an unforgiving place skill up or stay in high sec like me atm so i would have to disagree with adding more space until we become so overpopulated that there is absolutely no where to go or until we get to a point of a total standoff where either or all sides can no longer conquer anything at all
if you want space get out there and fight for it like everyone else
i cant believe he realy post it hereplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesi mean its totaly crap unbalanced and would all highsec lvl 4 mission runners allow to earn more risk free iskies with more afk mission running even that noone would realy try to gank such a ship if you want to make your lvl 4s within a time of afk use an dominix or if you have the iskies maybe an navy domi for such want to get a new shipclass for beeing faster in lvl 4s without looking on the balance in eve cannot be describedregardslantiane
this idea is fabulousyou are fabulousthis whole thread is fabulous
phail what you suggested is an obese dominix  thats not even a good drone bay if your gonna lol atleast make it something fun pno support
im a fellow carebear but l5s should be extremely difficult with their payouts thus being said if you want to make a ton of isk do it in low sec l1s  l4s already have a risk of ninja salvagers we gotta watch for l5s should add more risk by putting you in more harms way just as miners have to do for better orenot supported
level 5 missions are supposed to be higher risk due to their higher rewards they were also invented to try to make you go to low sec so no
eve is not highsec eve is highseclowsec00 if you wanna stick to only 13 of the content you only get 13 of the missionsnever heard of a wowplayer that complains about not getting epic items at noob agents
please lock
see devblog there will be a lot more carebear stuff soon it just wonUFFFDt be in highsec
particularly the carrier part where are these beasts not allowed high sec people regularly send in carriers to do l5s and is one of the reasons that they are where they are which is able to be accessed by these behemoths and also if you think you can solo a l5 what are you scared of in low sec
dracliraUFFFDs modified cap recharger bpo i see absolutely no way how that could bite you in the arse maybe distribute them with some sort of lottery system to give everyone a fair chance
you guys are all wrong this guy is on to something
csm issues take several months to be resolved i assume you want an answer far before then make up a petition  it may seem slow but its far far faster than the csm will be
if this was trackable like something viewable in bio or corp history supportedif no tracking and only a way for people to scamsteal and then pay ccp to cover their tracks not supported
thats like asking if the seasons will change its practically impossible for them to not change it is also nearly impossible to predict exactly when they will change
pretty much thissometimes i block invites when in a fleet or teaching a class i have the option to turn it off afterwards this doesnt mean im soloing it just means i am joining a corp fleet etc and dont want to be disturbed by random peopleoptions are good
i think that there might be a field under petition for this the only reason that isk spamming has a special function is that it also blocks you from any communications with that pilot your motive is awesome but i think it is already covered in game redundancy is bad the only reason i would see this to be raised as a change is if you added some other feature that worked in tandem to kill those damn macro minersedit i just checked  there does not seem to be a category for this under petitions as such i retract my previous statement and say onwards to assembly hall
proposals need to go into the assembly forum section where people can support it you can throw ideas around in here but they cannot be taken forward until an assembly forum post has been madeim not sure at the moment what issues being able to hack open a secure can would have but as far as giving you the password i would be totally against that
they arent npc goods for no reason you know its one of the few isk sinks that are left in eve keep it
if they can make them player manufactured whilst moving the isk sink to a different level of the production line then i see no problem with it
this is not the case the figure is 25 not 25 supportsfrom the csm dev blogwe have to work within this frameworkyour best bet is to get the support of a csm rep directly
surebut first you have to actually do something to earn it
we did and you wonUFFFDt like it can we have your stuff now
yes but you wont like it you have to collect it in starfleet energy credits and merits
thatUFFFDs ok my uncle deals in antiques
pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeee
i blindly without reading the first post link support this because and i know i make refs to x3 but even stationsposeve bought there look like stations
yes please sooner than later infinitely more important than ambulatory chars imho
bump cause i can
i do not support a 10 boost to all caldari railboats there is zero reason the rokh should have more pg than the hyperion and only 325 less than the abaddon pg increases should be case by casei do however support a railgun damage boost so ill give an overall thumbs up
i checked through the threads of all past csm cases and didnt see it figured if it was worst case id close it if not then i still like the idea 
there was a thread here proposing that bms be visibleselectable on your overview which would go well with thisedit found it
yes pleasethe same proposal is part of the bag of improvements to bookmarks proposed by luminus aardokay here
supported for sure
well yeah
use the sun noobsoh well kk yea align bookmarks please
would love to see this implemented
just in case ccp throws that one out due to all the other proposals we can atleast get this one  although it did look good
yes please
yesthis is a desirable addition to an overall improvement of bookmark functionality
i just like bumping this thread every now and then solely because i know it gets your panties in a bunch  enjoy btw is your alliance relevant anymore   just sayin
i dont know how you want to tell whether i would be disappointed about some toony boony super secret going on or not however i do know that ccp should rework their csm system and i do know that you are not a ccp related devhowever whether something is a stupid idea or not is not your call to judge everyone is entitled to hisher opinion at least in the free world i surely hope you are living in the free world dont you your opinion regarding a certain topic might differ but that does not make your opinion better or more true i think we understand hm its a pain in the ass for a 2 week old corp to get war decced by some 12 year old griefer with real life problems
didnt say you couldnt or couldjust saying nice image to project to the peoplenot very bright
ill sell you some ammo  im sure we can come to an agreement on the price unfortunately its not an opinion its a fact this is a craptastical albeit well worded proposalfirst and this is the important part no one except the mentally deficient thinks the war dec system is perfect its hopelessly defective and so broken that it should be replaced with something else that saidwar is a nonconsensual activity i doubt very much that the germans yes i went there sent a nicely worded note to paris asking if it wouldnt be too awful much bother if the french would mind terribly if they invaded and conquered their country im sure the french fell all over themselves saying oh by all means help yourselfa three week old corp has exactly the same tactics available to it as a three year old corp when it comes to dealing with a wardec fight back run away hidefighting back has obvious downsides in that you might get your ship asploded it happens buy a bunch of cheap t1 frigates insure them fit them with meta 0 modules and go give them hell you might lose a few hundred isk per ship and hell you might just win a fight or tworunning away is actually pretty simple especially for a small corp let them camp your headquarters and go mine on the other side of the clusterhiding is just like running away except you dont undock eventually people get tired of paying to shoot at people they cant shoot at and they go away this is especially true of griefer wardecs we actually had someone cancel a war on our corp once because we were and i quote the most boring war targets ever
while i am agreed that the entire wardeclaration system needs a revamp i am solidly against removing them to mutual only statuswhat is needed is a way for the declaring corp to put demands into the declaration clause that the declared party can choose to meet or counter then they can duke it out just as they do nowonce the demands are met however the war should end in a very short time 30 mins
um not really im in a corp that doesnt do this and i dont support this silly idea reason being its a silly ideaalthough if i was in a corp that did wardec indy corps i would still have to say i dont support this idea again though its simply because its a bad one
point on the doll where the wardec touched you
the simplest way to stop weak helpless newbie corps being griefed by wardecs is to stop there being so many weak helpless newbie corpspeople complain about being griefed the real griefers are the ones who trick new players in to joining weak useless corps that cannot possibly protect themyou create a corp then you raise a flag and declare youre ready to play with the big boys if youre not ready to do that youre not ready to create a corpincrease the corp creation fee to 100m isk and change the skill requirement to create one to corporation management 5 problem is 90 solved overnight running a corp is not a newbie activity in eve or in rl
look up my kills anywhere and i dare you to say that againyou are aware csm are democratically selected by the players without ccp interference right
i believe you need an office rented in order to be wardecd  dont you  im unsure of this or can they click your corp banner and select go to war or something of that nature if not then dont rent an office after all an office is not really needed really it isnt but having one just makes things a bit easier for you and your corpies ummm without of course the war dec thing its just easier to get on a good side with some mercs isk talks and dead pilots dont fly for a few depending on how long you want them to pay
the amount of peoplesigh in order to wardec someone you open up a vote do a search for the corpname and hit apply done theres no need for offices
ahhh thank you for enlightening me
sigh in order to wardec someone you open up a vote do a search for the corpname and hit apply done theres no need for officesthat is why war needs to be changed it is to easy to declare war on smaller corps just to get free kills now some people say you shouldnt form a corp that cant defend itself in other words they say they do not want any new corps forming since most new corps unless made by people who started playing early on are newer people people just make up excuses why its good to have war so they can take advantage of it it seems like wars are also to prevent newer people from experiencing the better parts of eve even in high sec now people will continue to say that war is needed but to be honest less then 1 of wars is actually needed so why not just make it harder to make a war having a third party representing concord to determine if the war is just
actually thats pretty much our only job we are a filter for bad ideas and to push the good ideas to ccp based on our judgement and experience your idea is terribleif you and your friends canUFFFDt handle losing concord protection against someone who still wets the bed itUFFFDs not csmUFFFDs problem or ccpUFFFDs problem
no its not a pain in the ass harden up and fight back yes its unfair but thats what eve is about high second is safer it is not meant to be safeif you want help with griefers hire mercs many are new and will work for dirt cheapas to your comments about sok you might want to spend more time with the eve community to see what hes done for newer players such as yourself the advice hes given the time hes put on the test server including lending out supercaps and the issues hes pushed forward through the csmbecause so far youre just embarrassing yourself
isnt that what i said already twice now lolin any event id like to also point out yes csm are voted your fault for not casting votes  third point life isnt fair neither is virtual life  plain and simplemy case point is this thread has become one big trolling fest completely derailed from original intended point has failed to many accounts and should probably be ended already tired of it seeing the top of the list and getting attention for stupid ing contests everyone grow up and just go kill each other in game 
the original purpose of this thread was to propose some way for new high sec noncombat focus corps to avoid being griefed by people who have rl problems but for some reason people keep drfting away from the topic maybe besides this problem we can get something passed to ban people who go on rants comletely off topica for an idea to help top useless wardecing not the ons thatare legit we should have concorddev be ahird party nd speak to a representative of both corpsalliances then they can explain why they want a war and reasons can be checked to make sure its trueps if can flipping was a concord offence no pirates would have ships in high sec

amarr homeworld 10minmatar homeworld 10caldari homeworld 10gallente homeworld 01how does this make sense
supported the intaki it would be good from an story point of view to make these high secure system it would even make sense as a pr coup of president roden to win the votes of the federation intaki and weaken caldari and syndicate influence on them
supported
notsignedthe only way i could support this is if the gallente militia take the intaki system back and hold it for a certain amount of timein fact let the reverse be true if the caldari militia get back in the game and take some systems and hold them they should become caldari sovereignty systems if they hold them even longer their sec status should go up and viceversaprobably wont happen but i can always dream
i support it being converted into a highsec system as long as a good storyarc supports said changehowever take into consideration a completely isolated highsec like that would be illogical too so perhaps rerouting some stargates and connecting intaki to stacmon or something similar might be viable
i thought the intaki sympathised with caldari at least more than other gallentebut yes i think it should be removed from a fw conquerable zone but still made lowsec the gallente fleets would assemble if it was ever under real threat
while im willing to admit that maybe a few exotic dancers are not in fact prostitutes im not so naive as to believe that their title exotic dancers is actually in reference to what they do more than just a fancy name to cover up the ugly or beautiful truth of what it is they really doa recent contract search for prostitutes revealed that there were only 2 available for sale in all of new eden and that each was valued at 75 million isk while i cant deny that they may be worth that much i can however tell you a fascinating story about a bachelor party at the intaki v station and just what a couple of thousand isk will get you in the backroom form a so called exotic dancerso my friend i ask is my proposal flawed or does death just reveal the true nature of the exotic dancerax
immersion if this would be fairytale setting with flying castles and magic it would not matter a lot but it is not in eve star systems are supposed to be real in the sense that planets with those parameters can have stable orbits in those positions they have guy who coded it had phd in chaos physics if i remember correct it might not matter for someone with only master of business administration if i understand correct your mba but it does matter to some people with education in the field of hard science by the way  wiggling around with degree in forums is thin ice for example i happen to have msc in physics and are in my last year of phd studies and i must also admit that nature has been gentle enough for me so your statement about what it is not might be also incorrect 
pretty good idea ill give it a thumbs
im definiately all for this it gets annoying as sin to sit and reconfigure probes for basic patterns
supported manually moving them is especially annoying when you grab the wrong thing and it recenters its focus on the screen or you change the size of a bubble or accidently make the probe go 20 au down instead of across you all know what im talking about
learn to scan not supported
cause scanning isnt easy enough already
this is good idea
there are two old men who to get to work by catching the first tram in the mornings and then walking a mile down an old cobbled pathboth of the men work in the same factory and earn the same wage but one of the old men has no wife or family to suport and so wears nice new shoes the other has a wife and three children and so cant afford new shoes so therefore his shoes are a bit worn outevery day they both head off to work the same time because they must catch the first tram of the day after the tram however the man with the nice shoes always makes it to work quicker than the one without and so has become the favourite of the boss one day the old married man complained to his wife about how his feet hurt from the cobbled stone and that he will not get a promotion because the other man beats him to work every daythe mans wife then thinks to herself that if she complained to the council and has the path repaired then her husband wouldnt have as sore a feetand then will get to work like the man with nice shoesafter a bit of campaigning the council bitumen sealed the path and it was nice and easy to walk on the poor man was pleased and walked down the path quicklysadly however the man with the nice shoes without having to walk carefully instead jogged to work because the path was so very easy on the feetthe man with old shoes ofcourse couldnt jog and was just a behind the man with the new shoes as he was beforethe moral of the story is that sometimes fixing something to make it better for one will often make it better for all and give you no advantage at all

i fully support this idea it does not infringe on freightersjfs and seems to fulfill a sorely needed role
anouther question of design would be which rrs would be given to it  this should be a sub capital ship so normal rrs should be used maybe tie in a boast to barge sheilds to bring them in line with cruisers and make hulks in line with either battlecruisers or tier 1 battleships this would satisfy quite a few people on this ships design i think the ehp should be around 250k but not on sheilds and armor give it a similar tank to the orca and similar structure hp as the orca keep the sheilds in line with a battleship marry this ship with a boast to barges and exhumers and miners will rejoice around the world
i support this idea

why do obstructive shadows when a faint grid would suffice i never figured out the reasoning behind it
invert your view not sure how to explain exactlybut if you look at it upside down you can probe just fine
supportednot need shadow just the scanning harder than
i tried that but its still not quite as easy as you can not get directly under it as you can on the top plus why should us lazy people recalibrate our methods p
pretty much sums up the opplease make an already easy game mechanic even easier because it has a minor instance of difficulty and i am too lazy to work around it
in my defence im apparently not the only lazy one  support ftw
yes this is exactly right why should the game be any more annoying than it has to be
change shader setting to high and thank ccp for removing medium
good lord yes nothing as annoying as getting rocked and splashed by missiles that are fired from so far away they shouldnt even reach your shipor even worse being hit visually by missiles that are hitting someone else on the grid sometimes tens or hundreds of km away
yea but right now ccp is focusing their efforts on cosmetics just as much if not more so than actual game play
here you go sokratesz sorry it took me so long to get around to revise it please let me know what you think either in game or hereformal bounty hunter system change proposal for csmwhat is a spaceshipscifi game without bounty huntingpurpose to create a working and less exploitable bounty system that is not so much designed to hurt piratesgankersgriefers as it is to introduce a thrilling new career into the game for those who like to play the hunterthe current exploit of course being the ability for a player to undock in an insured ship with a clone without implants and get a corp mate or alt to pod the character and split or gift the bounty to the wanted playerchangesno change to the system of placing bounties if less than 20 sec status any player can place or add to the bounty however bounties can only be collected by those with bounty kill rights like normal kill rights dont result in a concord responsebounty kill rights are obtained by bounty office agents when you start a conversation with these agents you are assigned 3 random online targets within say 20 jumps standings are gained with these agents similar to normal agents bounty agents have level 12345 agents level 1 agents assign targets with bounties up2 10mil isklevel 2 up2 50mil isklevel 3 up2 100mil isklevel 4 100mil to 250mil isk level 5 250mil  or something similar this is just an examplethe only change to the system of placing bounties would be a minimum initial bounty say 100k or 1m so that people would not just spam bounties on players and so even lv1 bounty hunters receive a sufficient reward there is the potential for a skill to exist bounty hunting which must be trained before bounty missions can be accepted if this skill was made quite expensive 5 to 30 mil this would hopefully limit the number of n00b alts out there who can pop their main character and send back the rewardthe target is not made aware of when someone receives bounty rights to kill themthe idea of the 20 jump or similar range is that the target is close enough but not too close as that would make the system exploitable ie bring your character to a quiet area and know that you will be contracted to kill your character with your alt because no other wanted players are around for this reason the bounty office should also be closed during and an hour after downtime or any server reboot  when there are very few people onlinesure maybe you will get your alt as a target from time to time but at least this system wont always be exploitedthis may not be the best system but as far as i can tell it seems to be the least exploitable so far and thats the real problem at the moment i would also again like to stress the point that a player must have a sec status of 20 or less to have a bounty placed on them thank you and kind regards dmac88
yep i play assassinbounty hunter smuggler in another world ye should know which one by now lolabsolutely witout a doubt thumbs up
maybe players can submit contracts to the officers that will then be placed out to the public but this will cost much more isk to a create said contract and b place a worthwhile bounty this could possibly negate the utter spam of them and maybe have it decriminalized to attack people with bounty so concord doesnt pop you because you bought kill rights
change this trickexploit in the gameall ship unscanable if signature radiussensor strength reach  108
why you give up so much other aspects of your shipalso someone claimed they are not 100 unscannable
because its an exploit
really dev tell you that
if u dont want to fight just ratting with unscanable ship go playing with hello kitty
seems perfectly balanced to me you lose pretty much any functionality besides being probeproof the only ships that could possibly benefit are noncombat ships few of which have the slots to pull it off and command ships
wait wait waityoure complaining about people using unscannable to do stuff at static siteshow bout you learn how to use that directional scanneras for mission runners using unscannable shipsstill possible to catch themyou just have to work at it
i like this mechanic and really hope its working as intended definitely not supporteda unscannable ships are forced to fly with seriously gimped fitsb a nice mechanic quite interesting to see how people use it to their advantage
if you want to get spoon feed kills just run missions rats happily suicide into yougiven we had a very long discussion about this on the test server forum i am pretty sure the devs are aware of the mechanic as we still didnt see a change to modify the behavior i am pretty sure it doesnt count as cheatexploit but valid game mechanic that said  keep crying
wait wait wait someone wana fill me in herewtf is an unscannable shipall ships are scannable in some form or fashion some are more harder than others
easy way sensor strength  signature radiustad more complicated signature radiussensor strength  108t3 do this well with the dissolution sequencer add 2 mid slot eccm and a low slot eccm and ta da unscannablecan use implantsdrugsremote eccm to help as well
you wrongread all ship unscanable if signature radiussensor strength reach  108supportedremove this sht from gameunacceptable if someone use a ship without cloak couldnt unscan
sorry what exactly did i say that was wrong i said t3 do it well because of the ss boosting subsystem obviously any ship can do it
there you gofor t3 choose a dissolution sequencer electronic sub system stuff in 23 eccm until the sigradius formular hits
thank you so very much darius nice to see someone speak freaking english and explain it for the rest of us sincere compliment and salute to dariusnot supporting for obvious reasonsdont like that answer serves you right tit for tat
not supporting for obvious reasons your reasons is nothing lolif you dont know what is the unscannable ship better if you dont support anythingbut exploit is exploit cheat is cheat even then if it came from wrong development tooso ccp fix it this sht and no not need extra stuff for unscannable ships 3 months ago a capital ship could use this cheat toojust now changed this thing when the capital ships sig radius was changedand not even need t3 ship for this unscannable crap all hac can some cs can etc
you can still catch unprobabeable ships im not telling you how but if you dont want to think about it because youre too lazy why dont you go play hello kitty online
fit a cloak i got one on my bs dont cry this will never happen
why should that be anymore of an exploit than docking in a station or warping to a safe spot to wait out concord but cord should have podded him and as for destroying the orca well there is a warning that say something about joining fleets and corps if those are flagged that you would be flagged as well so ye im in agreement with cord popping the orca
yes please do try to dock with concord on your tail then tell me how that went reallysafespot by the time you land in the safespot concord will be sitting there munching donuts as for joining fleets with someone who is flaggedhave you ever been involved in a fight at all you seem to have no clue whatsoever about aggro mechanics i suppose youre one of those that believe shooting a fleetmember is alright with concord i suggest you get some real experience before you start spouting lies and crap on the forums
wow i did not know that i have heard from a fw player that he the fw that concord can be a bit slow at times and they the fw are there to pick up the slack not all fw players but this one groupnow i hear that on the bannable offense but if they are slow at times is it still bannable if the opportunity to escape presents itself not including docking at a ship i know that was a dumb question but i culdnt help myself
make sure you are not confusing concord with factional naviespolice concord spawns pretty fast and one can not gate out dock or in anyway prevent being sanctioned when being huntedwith the slowpoke naviespolice you can do whatever you damn well please and they dont carry nearly as big hammers as concord
hmm the orca should get a criminal flag for helping a guy with gcc this is just like repping a guy and reps will get you gcced so vouch
but the difference is repping is something the neutral has to activate when docking into an orca you just have to have permissions which are set up before any offense would happen the orca pilot could be an innocent victim as well thats not a good situation i agree just dont let them store i dont agree with flagging the orca
make it the criminal flag not the aggression flag orcas can be used for combat support allowing new ships to be brought into the fight etc if an aggression flag prevents you from docking with an orca then someone who wants to attack a hulkorca combo would just have to wait for the hulks to kill an npc and then they have 15 minutes where the hulks cannot dock up to avoid getting suicided
here what i was thinking of they should make tech ii tactor beams that will give bonus like 50  to range and maybe 50  to speed write what you think it would be very helpfull whit salvage cos sometimes it takes too long
i think first they would need to focus on med and large tractors  only mod i know of in game that goes from small to cap size quite annoying if you ask me
use marauders or rorqual is already therejust use it
because advanced weapon upgrades 5 and battleship 5 is a logical requisition for tractor beams
dont most mods fit all ships small to cap shield boosters armor reppers weapons remote repping those are the only mods that i can think of that come in sizes shield  armor hardeners engineering and electronic mods propulsion mods hull upgrades i think there are many more mods that fit any size ship than those specified to sizeas for the original idea i understand there isnt a t2 tractor therefor youre trying to fill a hole you see but the real question is is this needed a tractor beam is just a tool to get a job done the job that it does is not one in need of optimization in my opinion
not needed and not necessarynot supported
but this is one of those mods that requires mod to ship size matching hence they need to put in mediumlarge yes hardeners can go on all ships but a cap tractor cant go in a destroyer see the point
theres a cookie you want it but like hell you will actually work for it
but its the point of a rorq or a marauder is not an ideal salvage ship which is where most tractor beam use comes into play i think rather they should make a new salvaging class ship
its not an ideal salvage ship it has a goddamned tractor range bonus do you really want specified ships for every miniprofession wheres your hacking ship proposal the analyzing ship proposal
how else can we nerf highsec missions
replace nonammo loot with wrecked modules that are used as bpcs
this idea is bad for my business
congrats you just made afk mining even easier no one will log off when they sleep to make lots of isk for when they wake up this means the servers will be getting wtfpwned 247 then the core processors will overheat and melt which will have the data relating directly to your assets in null sec and your whole corpalliance just lost all its capital ships thus creating an outrage and ccp has to work round the clock to fix all these problems resulting in the complete and utter shut down of eve youve just made the worst decision ever
now im curious about this business of yours
killed xx
your example makes absolutely no sense whatsoeverap and wtz are fine right now if not a little overpowered
my proposal makes perfect sense a mod or rig that allows you to jump through a stargate at a further distance than is currently allowed  what is there to not get
i fit that mod jump into a gate camp instead of burning back to the gate i can just jump out again really
wont quite reach to 15km away but you wont have to burn as far thing is pirates might have it to and just catch ya on the other side anyways 
i proposed cardboard cutouts years ago and got a bit of positive response a single market item that once used cannot be soldto use a cardboard cutout you just drag the item to be duped over the cardboard preform and drop for the user the cardboard item is grayed out but when scanned it shows up on the scan as a normal itemcaveat the cardboard item takes up just as much cargo space as the original item the duplicated item can be remotely duped using the assets listalso you dont need the original in your cargo hold you can dupe it and leave it wherever it is stored then autopilot around empire griefing suiciders its a good way to get rid of your insured t1 haulers when the ship is destroyed the cardboard item is either destroyed or dropped as normal but the killmail lists it as nothing more than item cardboard the recovering party sees it as a grayed out decoy
lmao can just imagine seeing that on the kill boardsthere is something in x3 that i use in my cargohold when i run smuggling ops so the local authorites cant detect it its a sort of scrambler chameleon what it does is redirect the scan to a legal item thus what im smuggling does not show up but rather it shows i have 1 more of the legal item ie im smuggling 200 space fliesillegal but i also have other commodities it will randomly pick one of the other commodities to cloak and match the number of the space flies now if i dont have anything in my hold ammo missiles etc my hold is empty it will take mimic what is in their hold and show that that is what im carrying unless their hold is empty then im on the run but that is a luck of the draw because it does not always work for mimicing whats in their hold i think its like a 15 20 chance of success maybe less i dont remember cause i always make sure i have something in my hold
i dont think youve thought this through all the way if you put a decoy into your cargo you are now just that much more juicy to shoot at you wont have fewer wolves at the door youll have more i understand in a general way if everyone was using them gankers would not know who to shoot but as an individual pilot i want to make myself look less appealing not more appealing who is going to be the first to use this will you really feel like you won if you lose your industrial half full of decoys you still lost something doesnt matter if your opposition gained something or noti do not support this idea
i donUFFFDt think cloaking should be made any more powerful than it already is not supported
this idea is retrded
i would like an explanation how this little change that is made for the sake of convenience more then anything would tip the balance of cloaking
seems there is something to this cloak thing for even in x3 reunion you cant do things while cloaked mod but put mods offline and they power down  signature of some sort put them on line and they power up  signature of some sort im sure  has to beso when sitting cloaked and your trying to change ammo well im sure in some kind of sense different ammo has different signatures which by changing while cloaked would put you at risk for decloaking plus the time it takes to recover to target not to mention the extra time for the reloadloadchange of ammo say for ie nuclear definately has a dif sig than emp which has a dif sig than proton now lead titanium may not have much of a sig per say but powering down so to speak the wep to change ammo would give off a sig that could compromise you in a not so good way as mentioned above now changing ammo ie crystals  thats all sig has to be im sure of iti mean its not like you can sit cloaked and do a tactical ship scan to figure out what munition is best so just come equipped with the best munition you think would be good all around to do the job i think cloaking is for the pros who know or have a pretty good idea of what fittings are out there and probably have the right tool for the job no matter what it is id say just be a lil more patient because everything has a trick and knowledge will lead you to ithave fun good luck fly well fly safe
the responses in this thread area hilarious how can changing ammo in any way make cloaking overpowered ridiculus
noleave cloaking alone if you wish to change ammo then do it when uncloaking or at a safe uncloaked
because you dont have to give up that you are close by
but you dont have to asis bookmark your location warp off switch ammo at a safe warp back its not like theyll notice you
sure and then you come back end the target is gone and you start searching for him again also lots of people have combat probes out to see if signals show up on scan so they could still catch you
and being able to shoot your target with the right ammo type is jsut gonna make it overpowered jesus that is just lamei understand if you do not support it because you do not think it is important andor valuable addition to gameplay but screaming that it would make cloacking overpowered is way over the top
up there on that line that says logged in as to the right of the log out option show a timer letting you know how much time you have left before you can post again in 10s incrementsplease sigh

loldestroyerspvp
yeah destroyers need loving not this way though
yeah see how you like it when you get hammered by fifty chatgang invites in a manner of seconds after jumping through a gateby the time youve clicked them all down youre waking up in a stationno
many mmos have a do not disturb option that blocks out chat this is not unique to eve and i think its a perfectly fine options to use
because way way to many would just miss use them if some mine in their belts they report them as macro if some afk mine they report them as macro if some have auto reject on they are macros ccp would get lik 2000 of these reports everyday only 10 of these are correct macro miners
any chance ure up to it tea 
trying to keep this short and open ended to allow discussionsome npc station services blueprint research  copying specifically always have long queues this is caused by a growing player base and a static fee which has become absurdly low compared to the demand for these services current costs are 1000 isk  2697 isk per hour this comes up to less than 2m for a full month the player run secondary market charges 300600 more than thisim suggesting to make these fees more dynamic this could be achieved by either a supplydemand formula that simply changes the fee for future jobs or maybe some sort of auction system where the person willing to pay a larger fee gets bumped to the front of the line these two are just examples the overall goal is to give a system that allows npcs to alter prices based on demand and what players are willing to pay

how many languages do you speak i am able to read and write in 6 languages though not perfectwe can as well talk in my native language if you prefer that might it be possible that not all ppl in the world are native talkers could that be wow could you imagine that there are some other ppl in the world but enlish and americans wow impressivenah that cant be the world elvolves only around you and your langauge man i feel sad for you and your arrogance you surely miss out on a lot reading a book in another language talking to the locals in their language yeah maybe not perfect and with poor grammar but it is still fun and helps making contactsreally i feel sorry for you that you have ot jump on foreigners and their grammar mistakes on a message board of an international game and well you know what real life losers like that who are only able to talk in one language and moch about nonnative talkers are exactly the same ppl who ruin the gaming experience for some newbie players like the op seems to be one by cheap war deccing a newbie corp
please stay on topic
not supportedi love picking on newbies who cannot fight back
not supported high sec wardecs allows a version of highsec piracy which tempers and controls new corporations if a corp does not get wardecced in highsec it will never be able to prepare for its eventual decent into lowsec or nulli hate to say it this is a sandbox the ability to wardec allows the formation of merc corps and pirate corps i would not be against the limit of one week of warfare without the fight going mutual with a 24 hour cooldown before allowing the coorps to redeclare this way even your highsec carebearish types can have a bit to resupply before the fighting starts back up as well as slowing down those just doing it for griefing instead of any monetary gain
war should not be a wowstyle duel eve is not the land of teddy bears and pointyeared elves eve is not a fluffy cartoon land high sec is not meant to coddle it is meant to offer minimal protection so new players can learn the game and older players can participate in some activities in relative peace war is an instrument for other players to disrupt said activities forcing players out of their bubble so they experience more of the game this is not to say that pve players should be forced into pvp war decs usually happen when players stay in the same place doing the same thing for an extended period of time there are so many aspects of pve that players would fail to experience if they were allowed to stay stuck in a rut a war forces players to branch out and try new thingsit is by opposition that we growadversity precedes growthif were growing were always going to be out of our comfort zonethe unexamined life is not worth livingwhen youre finished changing youre finished
bah high sec logistics are already invulnerable save for suicide ganking its called an alt in an npc corp and it is slightly more common than farming in the north american prairiesthe op doesnt have a good solution as in wardecs being mutual but there does need to be some way to fix the horribly awful current pay to grief system all it does is drive new players out of the game in frustration and that is simply not a good thingnot to mention that with all the station games remote repping and concord mix empire wars are loopy anywhoo the whole thing needs a revamp but mutuality only is not the way
im suporting this because wardec is a broke way 2 harass new playersi liked 2 know how many wardec are made between old and established corp perctperfect there but they fought 4 a territory or for resources so why not the wardec only valid in a certain constelation or solar system or region leaving the rest of the space safe making possible 2 new corp 2 avoid the fight think that like switzerlandanother way 2 balance the thing was extending the period prior the war start to 48 hours and adding the option do get a corp that gonna fight that war 4 uex you recieve a wardec from a corp u during the waiting period can talk 2 varios merc corp and if they accept it they gonna become flagged in your placei dont know if is possible 2 receive varios wardec but if it is limiting to onethis are some ideas 2 keep the wardec but i think this will balance it more
well i didnt figure that my original post would draw so much strong and sometimes emotional responses it has been an interesting read so far im glad that there has been much acknowledgement of the failings and abuse of the wardeccing mechanism although support for my proposed solution has fallen short from all that i have read i have concluded for myself too that it is indeed the wrong solution for the problem at hand on the other hand i have been a bit dissapointed about some posts that claimed that you should not complain and just fight because they feel that is what eve is all about or should be about like i argued before eve is also about free choice of the path you want to go and i frankly sometimes felt quite some disrespect and even despise towards the part of the eve community that chooses a miningindustrialism path however as the eve community as a whole depends very much on minerindustrialist that is a bit short sighted to say the least please lets have respect for each otherfor the rest i stick to the opinion that wardeccing rules should change but i retract my original solution as clearly that was not the right one there were some interesting suggestions that i hope will be elaborated further and which might lead to a solution that is acceptable to everyonethanks for all your contributions so fargwabakk
theres no arguing that the wardec system needs reforming but making wardecs optional isnt the way forwarda more formal system with declared grievances declared objectives and declared peace conditions would be betterand these should apply to both parties if the wardeccing corp declares a peace condition of disband corp then it is under the same ban itself the war continues until one corp disbands that would add an element of risk and increase the value of mercs no ditto for a peace condition of pay 1 billion isk if the deccing corp wants to impose this peace condition it should have to put up a bond for that amount which they forfeit if they let the war lapsebut with more stringent conditions on the deccing corp should also come more stringent conditions on the decced eg wardec follows characters leaving either corp for 24 hours noone in corp can create a new corp for the duration of the war etc etc the tactic of cycling through corps to evade a dec is just as cheap as the tactic of deccing noob corpsyes i know they pretty much are already but you know what i mean
what about those people who use war decs against high sec corps but dont actually have rl problemsnot everyone who wardecs empire corps is a mental basket case some players actually like to pvp in a pvp game
damn  howd i miss this one  page 3 no support
i actually agree with the general idea behind this proposal there should be some purpose behind a war dec besides lulz if you just want to watch ships explode go to low sec i would also agree with the idea of implementing a character level war dec flag that follows a character leaving a war decced corp for a period of 7 days or until the war officially ends whichever is shorter
interesting answer so u see eve has a pvp game and it isnt only thatthe way wardec works pvp players get what they want but rest is forced to iteve in my opinion should be more democratic so adding a few conditions to wardec would balance the question
i dont understand
some players only see eve has a pvp game but others see more than that and those who dont see it only has a pvp game are forced 2 play a pvp
thanks for clearing that up a littleyou can play eve as pve game you just have to keep your head low and stay in an npc corp
the intaki who sympathised with the caldari are either in syndicate or with the mordus all canon states without exception that the majority of the intaki in the federation certainly not all of them but most of them support the federationas stated above this is an incorrect interpretation of the canonso let me get this straight you want ccp to change it so that caldari can deploy capships to support the titan in luminaire but gallente cannot giving caldari an obvious awayfield advantage that cannot be countered by the fdu thats pretty transparent
meh supported    why not
has my support but only if it is backed by ingame player action
supported
intaki is low sec just like thukker is lownull sec as sec status is a concord thing not a faction thing it isnt a big surprise however faction defense of a system should not mirror the sec status in that regard yes there should be gallenteintaki police ships on the gates
well yes but the difference there is that the thukker arent actually part of the republic whereas the intaki are part of the federation
correct me if im wrong but planets and such are actually stationary and dont orbit around the sun personally for me having planets that followed their orbital paths would be much higher on the list then this proposal even better would be if all orbital objects like moons and asteroids etc did this but planets alone would work tooie this proposal is worried about having realistic planets according to their distances from the sun but the fact that they dont rotate and orbit would mean that having correct planets would mean having planets with one side scorched away and the other side lost in perpetual darkness and cold
yes but that is kinda big change to how planets are implemented in eve and its really relevant only for inner planets further away ones have years that can have a lot longer than on earth  ie presently passed 7 years of eve would have caused only small move in their positions i do agree ofc that if they would actually move and rotate it would be even more uber but all is not lost there is already light at the end of tunnel light  ccp is aware that at least temperatures are random in the info fields of planets and seem to be willing to do something about those so when they do that script perhaps they can also include very small and very basic model that sticks right skins in more or less right places by making use some simple planetary model if they dont have time to do complex one in consistent manner
the planets do rotate maybe not all or not all at the same speedduring eve beta the planets actually moved around their star however ccp decided that this had insignificant impact on the game likely for the same reasons mentioned in the post above for the cost in server resources
false false false i am extremely embarrassed that a fellow mba would say such statements that are contrary to businessmarketingeconomics theories i will imagine you are lying about your degree so i do not have to question how far the scholastic requirements for the degree have declinedincidentally it hardly would take a phd in astrophysics to sort this outplease tell us what company you work for i for one really want to know what shiny new purchase might be from a company with a just make it look good attitude in fact it would be nice to know so i dont accidentally invest in the company
actually if we are improving planets lets get them spinning again as well incoldblood if you have nothing to add to the conversation except for personal insults please refrain from commenting
so does anyone apart for the npcs actually use defenders seems to me that the deactivating feature does make them rather pointless in combatperhaps they should be changed so that they activate against a specific target and stay active until the target is deselected and shoot down missiles only from that target that would make them useful without completely unbalancing things
supported they do need a fixthe manual turn on after launch thing is really the only broken thing about them if it could be set so that when the mod was active theyd launch when the ship was fired on theyd be fineand no they are neither nerf or buff nor anything else they arent a nerf to missile boats because you need to fit them in a missile slot of your own you reduce your own dps for some protection  and its not even all that good given the group fire we now seethey would be a nice tactical option if they worked properly they do currently have some pve utility particularly against guristas but thats about itand off topic some folks quite like fof missiles and i know of at least one drake pilot who won a pvp fight expressly because of them im gallente but even so my few missile capable ships always carry a couple of fofs so i can contribute if jammed

not limited to personal sec status but limited to lowsec and null and a yes
revived also i would like to try to stay away from discussions of this feature adding a lag to the game as third parties to the actual game mechanics and functions we cannot say what will and what will not create lag additionally the merits of an idea should not be measured by whether or not it might cause lag i will leave it up to ccp to decide how to get around lag or to scrap an idea because it will add lag that cannot be gotten aroundagain i request that a csm member update us on the status of this proposal is ccp looking into it do they want to do it but dont have the resources do they not want to do it from a gameplay standpointthis topic had support from prior csm members but seems to have been forgotten please just let us know what is going on with it even if the news is bad
i proposed this over in fid a while back and have been thinking about it sincehere is the proposal for the csms consideration since i havent been able to find any major holes in the ideaoriginal fid link linkagebrief summarya new class of module that absorbs the heat generated by modules placed into an overheat state lengthening the time that they can stay in that state before reaching critical damage and shutting offthe module would have similar fitting requirements to a cap booster and require a consumable charge of some kindrecommended gating skill thermodynamics iv or vice products could be used in construction of the charges should these be playermadewhy allows higher ship performance at the cost of a fitting slot and cargo space otherwise utilized for other important modules for example if it were a low slot it forces a choice between armor damagemods and cap gear if a med slot it competes with points ewar propulsion mods and shield tankspros more diversity in fitting choicescons might be abusable by some ships if not balanced properlyconstructive criticism desired if there is something im missing then it would be nice to be informed rather than flamed
i dont know the way it stands now is kind of nice overheating has a desperate quality to it that if it was simply made into an even more routine tactic would take away that feelingof course a ship that is dedicated to burning its  for that glory or death is kind of interesting too but honestly i dont think that your proposals benefits would outweigh the feeling and immersion that the current mechanic suppliesalso heatsinks already go in the lows p personally if one were to go ahead with this id put it in the meds it cant go in the highs because there are way too many ships with spare highs
this already existsoffline modules will heatsink damage from neighboring overheated modules and can take repair paste at any time
if im not mistaken leaving the slot totally empty is even more effective though i admit i havent tried it myself but yeah this already exists no need for a new mod
i would assume a module spesifically created for this purpose should be more effective then an empty slot a ship with active hardeners and reppers can boost its tank by 70 with overheating although only for a short time those 70 may mean life or death and if such ship is primaried in small gangs it wount go down easily
but an empty slot is specifically dedicated to it what else is it doing
i could live with a literal heat sink a low slot mod that would decrease heat damage from mods by a certain percentage would work great on ships which dont have hislots free for heat absorption and make overheating more viableever since their introduction ive wished ccp would do more with overheating and boosters this would be a nice step in that direction
yes because that is a great solution for everyoneanyway yeah shadow is annoying as hell i dont care if i am below a bunch of planets all on the same axis
poor ui has nothing to do with lazy
i live in blood rat space and knowing which rat is neuting me makes it a primary target i support this

sure
a the problem i have with changing to a system where people submit a bounty contract is 1 so far the exploit is around ppl receiving bounty prizes not placing bounties dont fix what aint broke the current system of placing bounties works and 2how could people add to the bountyb as stated above there would have to be a minimum initial bounty you could place on a person 100k or 1mil isk c also above you receive bounty kill rights which dont result in a concord responsehope thats all cleared up
heres the too long didnt read versionyour system will be rife with exploits both for the mark and the hunters it will not do a better job than hiring mercs directly the extended versionthe main problem with the current bounty system is that the targets corp matefriend alt can collect the cash and there is no just no reasonable expectation that the target got killed in something that was important to him if you allow the computer to randomly select the target and match it to a hunter you will have people that will convo the target and ask him you want to split the bounty if you add in any kind of high sec kill rights you got a recipie for disaster as you will be drasticly be changing the idea of security sec basically 2 and you might as well be in a war dec the second problem is why does anyone think bounty hunting is a 1vs1 thing if im a pirate then im in a pirate corp so when you come to my stretch of low sec you dont fight just me but my 5 sniper bs friends you need a gang to fight a gang this is where that crime and punishment forum comes in and you can hire a gang to grief the griefers there is no reason to take it out of person to person convos and making a good contract when they will achieve the same goal as an automated system
note that programmable keyboards are allowed several devgm statements about that
i would support anything to get macro banning to the forefront ccp claims they do so many bannings yadda yadda yet when people are reported as macros in the current way nothing is ever done they reply to the petition saying theyll inestigate then close it yet the macros i have encountered and petitioned have never missed a beat i have made sure they were macros also ive popped roids they were mining and immediately their lasers goto the next roid there is no slight pause these same people are mining back and forth to station when i wake up and still mining when i sign on later even when i goto bed the ones i reported do this and if the belts are empty they goto the next system and still dock 1 jump then mine jump etc ive even bumped a guy in testing him many times to at least get him to say something but never ccp may claim they are after macros but i am calling bs on it after the macros are still out in full force because if they do ban them they dont read all the petitions about themthis does need implemented or something to that effect macro minersmacro mission runnersmacro anything needs to stop and ccp needs to take action instead of claiming something they dont do just like isk sellersisk buyers they claim they ban them yet how do tyhey ban someone who has been identified as a isk seller yet they are still in the game
bolded the parts that you quoted that say the same exact thing as your postmy main point was that programmable keyboardsmice are allowed as long as they dont do more then what you could do from the shortcut menu you can not use them to create functions such as releasing the drones or looping functions
players already claim macroz for every miner in high sec i seem to recall a lengthy and silly debate about whether or not the veldnought was using a macro ccp has automated tools to identify macro use anything the automated tools arent picking up isnt going to have logs that prove they are using macros so flagging a player as using macros is fairly useless right click lock fire much easier at that point it doesnt matter if they are using a macro or not
supportedironic how a newest most carebearish ship has been twisted and manipulated to serve the purposes of suicide gankers

aye 
please do that will make life so much more easierbesides well im not a dev just a wild guess here but maybe it will be possible to combat lag mosnter by streamlining io information flows by grouping them in a single fleet rather than managing io of several fleet seperatellymy guess that right now io is not based on fleet anyway but rahter on every individual account however maybe we could implement it this way so that they are grouped somehow by fleetmaybe single fleet io load on server could be allocated to a dedicated processor cluster based on size of fleetso if fleet is small then process it as normal if fleet grows very large then get a dedicated cluster of processors managing itsmth like thatwearing flame resistant suit and supporting the idea
simple ideaallow corporations to set rat like bounties on ship types of their enemies or just in general  each time a pilot kills a class of ship etc  he gets a predesignated payout from his corp or alliancethe corp or alliance is given a interface through the corpalliance interface to pay out based on such kills and can adjust as appropriate  of course the entire thing is toggleable so that during certain campaigns corps are able to pay their pilots for their pvp participation in the same manner as pilots that might be ratting although obviously not as consistentand csm can take it from there on to its rational conclusions  will be a great simple addition in my opinionregardskass
better war declarationsthe cost of warthe price of war declarations increases over time a cooldown is added to avoid wars being reset for free once a war is cancelled a period of time in wich the wardecced corporation can not be wardecced again by the same corporation starts i think between one week and one month depending on the time the war was active is good maybe coupled with better pricingnegotiationsusing contracts to cancel wars you can trade a war cancel and demand items or money to do it in addition the period of peace can be set and tracked to see if the terms are met cooldown applies though if future treaties include nonagression pacts they could be included in this contracts public record of past contracts
i dont see the point really what does this accomplishyes i agree we need better surrender mechanics the current one is not user friendlyby the way the blue color makes me want to tear my eyes out dont use it ever again
it serves the purpose of cancelling wars being meaningful and making the costs of declaring war being paid as time goes by they increase over time now dont they if they dont ill add that to the proposalbtw blue over black makes one of the best contrasts that makes reading easier im sorry it hurted your eyes p
zes better war declarations would be nice we need a whole system not parts and pieces all over the place this is not going to make it better
i dont think the cost of war increases as time goes by hence my earlier question
fixed  i thought it was by some comments in other threads
first the griefers steal my salvage now the new thing seems to be them stealing my quest items my damsel got stolen the other day and when i fired at the griefer concord killed me even though he was stealing her from a container in my mission they say that they try to sell them back so theres a profit in it but its griefing in its purest formccp can you please fix this thanks
its high sec piracy deal with ityou need to understand that with eve its not your property until its in your hangarif you cant accept this design aspect then you need to play another mmorpg can any1 here think of one better suited to this person 
nice name crappy topic110
assuming this isnt a troll just petition to have the mission reset
they shouldnt even do that for players
anyone stealing mission items is scum of the earth
youll all be so proud of mei ran into some1 elses worlds collide at around 0600 eve time and lucky me was able to grab their 20 x ships crew  dodixie of course where else are there so many carebears waiting to be farmed got a 5 million ransom for it d set a reasonable price anything excessive doesnt work
1st why you dont get the damsel directly after the hub is blowing up2nd we have no questUFFFDs and no quest items here its an mission objective3nd its not griefingto the endcarebear mimimi
uhm you dont get flagged for stealing mission itemshmm if possible that should be fixed not that it would solve much ofc cant go shooting a pirate with a pve ship anyway that would probably cost you morestill it feels wrong and not in line with the other rules if someone steals they should get flagged this will probably mean revising some missionsps to op dont mix salvage into this debate it haswill have a detrimental effect on the discussion and is working as intended
yes it isif you dont get flagged that needs fixing as for the rest if diplomacy does not help let the guns do the talking
exactly what cybergh0st sayyou dont get a aggression flag if you steal a crucial mission item that drop in a can but you get it if you take a crucial mission item that drop in a wreck so it is seem a bug not a intended feature concord should not protect the can for you but it should allow you to try to protect it by force
my personal opinion is that there should be no concord involvement in anything that happens in a dead space areahowever as it stands nothing in eve is yours until it is in your cargo bayaccept that and things become easiernot supported
the mission item can should be playerowned ie another player would be flagged for stealing from it whether or not the mission runner can kill the other player at that moment is irrelevant just like it is irrelevant whether or not the miner can kill the player that flipped his can if they want to engage the person who nabbed stuff from their can concord shouldnt attack them thats just silly
yes
definently need a fix
someday they will be fixed
increase the anchoring skill to decrease the time per level needed to anchor or unanchor an item maybe 5 or hell even 10 this is mainly to take the hours of wasted time away when anchoring or unanchoring poss

20th time it is being proposed here is what we will do urlplease visit your user settings to enable imageswe more trash it under repackage currently it is right next to make active and as that is the most used button on any ship there is a high chance of miss clicking repackage is probably the least used button so moving it under repackage would put it outside of the risk zone
better would be to add the same style of confirm popout that is used to remove yourself from a fleet so you have to hit trash it then confirm then actually click okbut yeah along with the other 9 billion ui changes eve needs this one needs to be done
yeah but repackage a ship also has the are you sure prompt i think make active doesntit may cause some grievances for examplemaxsim goratiev time to repackage my domi for resellare you sure you want to maxsim goratiev blah blah blah yesmaxsim goratiev wtf where did my ship go
you have a point there you know but it definatly need to be moved form where it is to a less frequently used neighborhood
on a similar vein could we move the self destuct option away from enter starbase password  an option often used in high lag environments

a thread with more suggestions 
according to the changes to the navy frigates they are supposed to be a cross between an assault ship and interceptordue to their split weapon layout and lack of dedicated role navy frigates usefulness remains quite limited we plan to turn them into an hybrid of interceptors and assault frigate classes combining points of both being less specialized than the tech2 hulls thus more versatile but less resilientone thing i would like to point out is that the warp speed of these ships were not adjusted to a higher speed to reflect this currently they still have the warp speed of a t1 frigate i would like this increased to be the average warp speed of the assault ships and interceptors sadly i can not log in right now to do the calculations myself but i believe all afs warp at 6 aus and half ceptors are 9 aus and the other half is 13 aus which means the average is 85 austldr  increase all navy frigates warp speed from 6 aus to 85 aus
you might want to link your fid discussion thread if you start cross posting 
better yet i just requested to have that thread locked thanks for pointing out the cross posting stuff edit so this idea half backed or does it have some merit to it
since such a large proporion of a warp is spent accelerating and decelerating rather than traveling at your top warp speed this isnt really that big a deal either way but to fit the desciption sure why notid much prefer to see the acceleration and deceleration rates whilst warping improved for smaller ships though rather than to tinker around with the only marginally useful top speed
navy frigates were changed to closer in performance to t2 frigates that much is truewhat speaks against your proposal is that they were all made into combat oriented hulls with a sizeable damage increase over the old ships in addition they all received an equally large base speed increase making them nearly as fast as interceptors if they were to get any more attention it should be to push them even further towards the af side rather than the interceptor side
being a mixture of the two classes does not mean that every single stat is somewhere in the middle of the values for the afs and the ceptors it means that overall the ship as a whole fits somewhere in between the current ones do i see no need to change this
im sorry op but i would have to disagree with this as it would lessen the isk sinks in game considerably thus things would eventually become much more expensive since every one would start to have more isk
not supported the op csm has obviously no real insight about industrialism and economics in eve
love the concept but as stated by many people so far current proposal has no details on balancenot supported in current form
i like the idea but it is just more trouble than its worth do this and youll be creating a bigger problem getting rid of a good isk sink
it would be nice to get some statistics on the effect dominion has had on the purchase of pos towers i would guess there has been a fairly significant decrease i do not think players manufacturing pos towers or related things would cause the impact suggested by the it removes an isk sink crowd ccp has already moved a sizable chunk of the isk sink from pos fuel to isk paid directly to maintenance fees as the cost of these fees is greater than the npc provided portion of pos fuel that had traditionally been an isk sink the isk sink has grown significantly with tyrannis coming out it seems like a good idea to look over the balance of isk injection and drain in the system pos bpos are a good idea for another variable that could be used to create balanceit is a good idea however im also worried that pushing this could weaken the tyrannis planet management idea i prefer planet management over more bpos
i have chatted to corp and alliance members about both of these subjects and the general concensus is they agree so i would like to be able to swap drones in space for various damage types we dont all have dronebay space to carry various types to launch as and when needed and after all they are a type of ammo and ammo types can be changed in spaceatm i am in gurista rat space am amarr and a laser specialist i would like to see a crystal which does kinetic damage other ammo can be chosen to cause kinetic why not crystals and no i do not want to retrain and apart from that my amarr ships are laser orientated seems a shame that my drones have to do all the work killing rats while my guns are used purely to take agro away from the dronesconstructive comments would be really appreciatedthanksstar
lasers are an energy weapon not a kinetic weapon having a laser that fires a solid projectile doesnt even make lolrp sense much less any other kindi would not be opposed to changing drones in space being as i use drones heavily but we need to make sure that you dont end up with dominixes with 700 m3 drone bays and i think that was largely the intention behind the mechanichowever as written i cant support the proposal due to the double up with the laser issue
basically thisas an addition you can change drone in space with the help of ship maintenance array orca carrierapproach the shiparray  go to the fitting screen  on the lower left corner there is a drones symbol  click on it happy changing dronesthat said the drones proposal is kind of mood and has the tendency to get overpowered if you would be able to do it without the arrayorcacarrier and the kineticexplosive lasers will never happen but in the end  it doesnt really matter the 2nd weakness of guristas is thermal so you can switch to crystals with more thermal dmgnot supported
id like to see a skill to reduce the signature radius of pods say 5level would increase survivability of pod a little and make it easier to escape after loss of ship could be called advanced evacuation piloting or some such since limited to pods would not unbalance the game the same or a similar skill could be applied to shuttlesany thoughts
almost entirely useless but it amuses me sure
simply put there is a bug with reprocessing sometimes loot just wont reprocess for some inane reasoni am not talking about items that cannot be reprocessed i am talking about items like ammo modules etc that should be perfectly reprocessable but the station wont give a quote forfor instance i had 2 thunderbolt heavy cruise missiles in my hanger i decided to reprocess them yet when i get a quote it tells me that i have not selected anything to reprocessyes i didand earlier i reprocessed 100 units of small anti matter hyprid ammo yet 1 unit didnt reprocess along with the other 99 and refuses to do so same with 73 out of 700 defender missiles i hadccp fix this
it is the same as with refining ore you need a certain batch size to reprocess them no bug there
wow i had no idea you needed a batch for looti failed

yes more appealing thats what makes it so much better you lure gankers to attack more then they gank someone and waste their time on uselessness youd get more suicides sure but youd also get more people flying around in junk luring them to shoot thats the purpose otherwise they can continue to pick targets and know risks rather than no risk if they know they are hitting a loaded ship full of isk
i say everyone who reads this thread should convo spam the op maybe he will think twice about post silliness on the forum
its been discussed many many times for many years and has been proposed many different waysi am for the hacking and accessing of secure cans but showing you someones password would be a terrible idea they might be an idiot and use that same password for their login or pos shield or jb network oh who knows what else and i would think that to break a secure container you would need to take hours not minutes real brute force hacking can take days maybe 12hrs to start with 10 reduction 6hrs at level 5 oh and call it advanced hackingwrite a proposal for assembly hall
i glanced at it but i would rather they work on lag reducing tactics then giving s more of a reason to complain omg i have dynamic smoke and hull damage on and im lagging so bad this game sucks whaaanot to mention id rather have hybrid turrets not be useless before considering cosmetic changes to projectiles gg
i believe the anti speed nerf thread prior to quantum rise had close to 2000 supports its certainly 1 of all time for ah that said theres been a few true threadnoughts over the years that have gotten several thousand postsmost notably the one on the t20 scandal  if theyd been in ah instead of general or information portal or one of those they could likely have gotten to the requisite number
bumpie cause they are stil broken
maybe limit the use to sec status only allow covert cynos in 05 or 06 systems maybe allow covert cyno also to be used in mission trough gates aswell gives advantages and risk bypassing ship restrictions but also allow hot drop risk the last thing would be hard to implement maybe allow them only in l4 missions
ratting is a reward in itself with added bonus of sec status i dont see it as a penalty at allit is also not about realism but about balance currently the balance of risk vs reward is skewed and should be restored
as a gallente specd player i support this idea
it was rejected 7 votes against 2 for largely on the grounds that no coherent case was made for why such a boost was needed or what form it should take thats why i have reservations about the op  the current csm seems somewhat determinedly bureaucratic and in a few cases determinedly ignorant of game mechanics and want everything laid out for them just so a proposal like that in the op ie a straight demand for a buff with no explanation or justification beyond a link to a lengthy thread doesnt seem likely to go down well
excuse me did you read the thread if yes you know that there have been quite the number crunching and data presentation as well as the justification for specific changes as the 70 spike proposali can do a compilation of all the arguments i have presented in this thread but that has to wait till the weekend and it will be posted as part of the threadalternatively if the csm wants to read the thread theyll find comparison tables for hacs and bss baseline fits used to benchmark each bs and hac to each other and the relevant stats i cannot append excel spreadsheets to the forum and they dont accept outside references so they will have to eventually read this or tell me to stop trying to promote itthe analysis that was done is based on real field data i believe that i can claim that uk and a has a very good knowledge base as far as fleet bs and sniperhacs go dont you agree i do believe that they need to read the threads there were many counterproposals and point clarification made in itthis proposal has gathered within two weeks more support and views than others have done in months experienced players w both caldari and gallente pilots agree that it is correct as far as weaponammo interaction it has been unanimous and ask why the csm takes no interestthey asked for a specific proposal here is it numbers included and justified
i read and supported this thread and readparticipated in the ships  modules thread that preceded it i know theres been relatively detailed discussion on the topic but the op in this thread ie the proposal that the csm would be voting on reflects none of that instead requesting a buff and pointing the reader to a 25  page thread korvins hybrid weapons proposal took a similar approach buff hybrids plox heres a link to the full details of and justification for this proposal and got shot down because there are a few bureaucratic twunts on the csm i think this proposal is likely to suffer the same fate if voted on by the current csm more because of the way its presented than its merits
ok will take that into consideration and present it in a comprehensive way that covers it as much as possible
i would rather see the damage left as is and get the tracking a huge boost to rails mega should track somewhere in the 0056 range that would make rails middle ground tracking between the amarr long range pulse fits and the typical sniper bs fits then you could have the option to over stuff tcs on a mega and get solid midlong range advantagesthe balance cant keep being about damage for all these ships all we see from that is constantly higher dps ships making them then have to examine hp again
unfortunately as niches go that isnt a particularily useful one since youre still massively outdamaged by various assortments of laserboats who will still track well enough at that sort of range also this would clash harshly with the range bonus given to the rokhas to the concerns of number crunching im willing to spit out some more graphs for them if nessesary andor clean up existing ones to be more clear
actually it would put a rohk to nearly equal damage at better range than a 3 te 3hs apoc for less tracking it would put a rail mega at about equal range for better damage than a pulse apoc those 2 ships would win the 100km battles apoc would still retain the close range damage advantage both of these ships have the advantage of no tracking penalty from t1 close range ammos rather than scorch to hit out to those ranges for high damage apoc can swap down to radio but for a large drop in dps or stay with scorch for more equality in trackingthat defines a role for the ships if you want massive range dps use the hyperion it does 401 dps similar to all the other bs boosting rail damage just screws up that whole tree tracking creates a niche advantage at mid range
see there is the hole in your logic these 100km battles they never happen between bsonly in two situations i have seen bs fitting for 100km both of which is antihac1 sitting on station undock and shooting at sniperhacs while they keep distance and transversal protecting a capital ship that got bumped provi pets ratting in carriers pretty much ting their pants when one of our hac roams gets them outside their stations2 gatecamp busting when you know the rival gang is sniperhac heavy and they sit at optimalspulse apocs pretty much dominate that domain because of the dps they can bring to bear some use tempests w 800mm becasue acs are sexy and the ships are fast enough to close in for a kill both mega and rokh are not even considered even if their tracking and range is enough because they lack in damage unless you increase the damage potential for rails they will not be usable even in their niche which is long range so instead of trying to change the nature of the guns why dont we try to fix them where there are lame damage
im not sure about the pulse apoc since thats in theory a shorter ranged weapons system then railguns and thus making your comparison a dissimilar one both beams and tachyons will thoroughly out damage any rail platform at 100km though so the argument is quite mute by that same measure im sure railguns also outpreform autocannons at 100km also if we took your example out to more useful sniping ranges wed quickly find our dps sinking below that of spikeauroratremor which is part of what pushes everyone to t2 range ammo since it outdamages the longer ranged half of t1 ammo this in concert with the advantages of blobbing up means that the range that matters is wherever most of the t2 ammo will fall around 200km or sothat the hype can do 401 damage is great if it could do it at 200km which it cant where the apoc will push that same damage out to 212km with relative ease if i want to not quite make it to 200km id much rather be flying the battleship that gets 100 more dps for the range loss the abaddon 502dps  154km
tracking isnt even remotely a problem for railguns imho blasters yes arty yeshave they fixed arty yet havent fired one in almost 6 months railguns nothe problem here is that the damage output doesnt allow for railguns to outperform the other systems except at a range in which its damage is so negligible that its largely irrelevant
at 150200km you dont need tracking
im not so sure on the ops proposal but i think railguns need a revisitpersonally id like to see the dual 150s and dual 250s becoming a mid range high damage  leaving the 250s and 425s as the extreme range and the 200s350s as the lower damagerange fitting compromise option put the duals in somewhere between blasters and the top tier of guns  in terms of fittings damage and tracking and  provided youve had a look at the powergrid on the railboats  id be inclined to start using them again
this would be an ok if other races only got similar changes for their ammo as well
odd minmatar did get a projectile buff sacrilege and legion gets a 5 damage boost to hams typhoon has 5 rof as does the raven
still here still waiting
hell yes
fix plx
i agree seems like an awful lot of people want something that should have been done a longgggg time ago why are we still being ignored
agreeing here dont really mind what gets changed just something needs to as rockets are terrible to fit now
with the align to bookmarks this could be integrated at the same time
thats the exact point of the safe spot is so the pirates cant get you without some work 
i dont think the people who make this game play it i mean i can align to anything else in space but not my own damn bookmark i understand they screwed up when they added aligning feature in the expansion but to not include this fixed in one of the first patches after release
good idea
dont be mislead they play it definatly just something theyve overlooked and unlike any other mmo ive ever seen theyve actually taken the time to get an entire seperate staff csm to actually regulate ideas exactly like this one and honestly review them and with enough support and csm reviews they will implement it im sure if they feel its a good idea its all about the faith mate 
yes please although id fear my old mission system where i have bms scattered all over the place 
yes please
it would be convenient

having an option to wardec only to a constellationregion might not be a bad idea since it would allow say a small mining corp to fight the rival that keeps mining in the same belts as them without paying the 50 mil wardec fee or it would let a griefer corp dec only in the jita area
i agree very much with malcaniss counterproposal
this makes some sense
this is totally why i voted for sok and ill do it next time too liang
i disagree because there is pvp at every level in eve ok so shooting rats missions or mining are pve to a point but as soon as you need to sell your loot you are competing against other players do not simply treat the term pvp as shooting other players in the facewardecing does allow for example an industrial corp to attack their market competitors directly or via mercs it also allows people to disrupt supply chains of larger entities though much is done via npc corp alts anywayi felt i had to comment because of the suggestion that wardecs should be mutual because all wardeccing against industrial corps is due to people with rl problems which is something i find ridiculous
im sorry but i am really getting sick and tired of hearing wardecs allow industrialists to attack competitors as an excuse or an valid argumentthat is utter bull and you know itsince when has an industrialist corporation ever wardecdin case you people forgot you make nothing in pvping there is no profit ergo 99 of the indies in high sec wont even bother they just go somewhere else or hire a merc to deal with the problemso stop coming up with excuses and assumptions and start dealing in factsfact  wardecs are dominated by greifers who seek to pvp soft targetsfact  wardecs are dominated by corporations seeking to disrupt logistics in 00now maybe im just a guy in a cave but i have never heard of an indy corp wardecing an another for indy reasonspos take down doesnt qualify and most hire a merc to handle that99 of indy corps are always on the receiving end from some pvp corporation or some suchits both hilarious and totally stupid to see people tell me and everyone else oh but it allows  to do this to an another corpwake up just come out and say it stop lying to yourselvesyoull live longerand let me emphasize that while i have an issue with the excuse that i just blew away it is in no way a valid argument for me to say wardecs should be nerfed or buffed for that matterjust dont put the blame or reasoning in the equation that wardecs are useful in that context useful or not they arent using it because theres no point to it
um why would an industrial corp dec anyone that would be pretty stupid and put their assets at risk for no reason they pay mercenaries to do the wardeccingbut yeah anyway well done for working out that most rational people prefer to start fights when theyre likely to winu mad bro
there is an idea corps would pay for the ability to wardec per system each system would cost more then the previous one this would make wars have a point in high sec to control recources yet make it hard for griefers costs could be set that it would be impractical to control more then a handful of high sec only downside is major trade hubs would be constant war systems i mean it not like people ever war there
yes supportedalso maybe an option for a monthly fixed tax instead of in addition to percentage tax ive been in at least two alliancescorporations that require monthly fix taxes on top of the percentage tax it would be nice if there was a system similar to bill payment system that allowed for corpsalliances to set monthly taxes on members if only to help simplify what it already being done in game
seems reasonable
i agreeop also reminds me of the fact that those rarely used rigs could use a boost to the point were it actually becomes a viable option to use them

supported and bumped  if fw could be balanced out and the fixing needed could start sooner rather than way later perhaps fws issues might be fixed by the end of the yearthe system do not need removal  that wont ever happend with storylines moving on as they do  the system merely needs to get the attentional fixes we as paying costumers deservefw can be so much better than it is right now
i get the impression that ccp rely on data from the game itself rather than count the number of forum threadsto the op if you saw the fanfest presentations you might notice that dust is not eve and thus outside the scope of the csm and is being developed by a totally separate team in a different countrycsm have already voted on a number of fw issues but attempting to tie the release of another game to fw fixes isnt going to get us anywhere

youre only saying that because youre the alt of a salvage thiefwhy are you so frightened of missioners actually being able to protect their salvage that they own you thief
and youre only saying that because you had huge slice of tard cake right before posting herelet me get this right you want no concord in deadspace so mission runners can shoot theivesexcept you and the op and maybe a couple other people in this thread all had a huge bowl of stupid soup from the same can this made it so you dont realize that if no concord in missions deadspace you all have just turned them all into null sec pockets you do understand that means anyone and i mean anyone can scan you down and come in kill you and then salvageloot your stuffwow have fun with that if this comes to pass im going to go hunt some people down just to stop the spread of the tardism religioni really hope this is a troll thread and iqs on eve hasnt really slipped below shoe size
you were unfortunately infected by the malcanis troll there is no cure i suggest biomassing your character so it doesnt spread to your alts
the sad thing is that luck would have it that people are really serious about this motion of removing concord i would rather take a bite than to ignore it and see it passed and then wonder why i didnt say soemthing

ccp should take a look at the asteroid environment used in star trek online no that game is nothing like or even comperable to eve its just another game but visually speaking the environments are stellar compared to eve asteroid fieldsmining in such an environment would actually be somewhat refreshing so long as they limited the bouncingoffroids to the same degree that sto has
not supported mostly because making it more interesting might very well make it a pain in the ass to do long term barges are not agile and need to constantly watch out for suicide gank attempts being distracted by a minigame or needing to manuever frequently might have the unintended effect of making the profession worseto get me to support this would have to have barges updated as well to handle a more interesting craft things like speed or defense would need to be boosted
 did you even read what i wrotethis isnt a proposal of how to make mining more interestingthis is a wakeup call to the csm and hopefully get them to ask ccp what news there are in case of mining darius mclever pointed out that ccp are working on something mining related  seen at the fanfest 09mining is pretty much the same as it were 7 years ago  its time for some news and it can only go too slow

not supported why on earth would you restrict it via secstatus why shouldnt it just be an offensive action like every other offensive module in the game and have a sec status penalty for use
support
uh this makes no sense if he is in a pod shouldnt you have aggression on him already if you have him scrambled and heldas for the ransom i wouldnt mind if it made it easier for pirates to do so but you are asking us to trust the person who just destroyed our ship not to destroy us for the lulz again after taking our money with it being impossible for the ransomee to get safe passage or even an honored ransom something like this wont encourage us to pay you which is the real problem
i have to dissagree with that ideai think pirates already vgot a nice access for a pirate stuff from lp stores and i think its enough i already heard ideas about websruptor  web  warp disruptor oh god maybe a cafe maker with latte or cappucinostupid idea game should be as a poker u lie or be lied

pod scanning is silly turning off implants is ridiculous restricting it to people who are 10 is sillydiculous no no no no no
meh this is a maybe the security status idea is ridiculous the contraband idea on the other hand sounds pretty good i dont like the idea of adding this to ship scanners an extra slot should have to be spent on something that would be this powerful of a negotiation tool just as ship scanners are not cargo scanners and neither of them are onboard
that sounds good ofc there are few technical issues to discuss but main idea is good nowadays its hard to get ransom for pods  im usually killing them when pilots are trying to bargain with me 
ahaha thats a great ideawould be great to know if the guys got a set of 3s or a low grade set when youre getting ready to pop that pod
whats the point in paying if ransom is not honoredccp should make a ransom mechanics first but im not sure how it could be done make target invulnerable once ransom is paidoh exploitablemove target to his clone station with his implants intactsay hi to new form of quicktravelthirdparty like transfer hi this is my alt on the other side of the gate pay me the ransom again

see thats just exactly it it could be implemented in a simple nongamebreaking way initially that would still go a long way to help immersion ive been wanting this since 2003 and it is the reason why i did not get involved in the rp side of eve a few abortive attempts aside i really just could not make it work when there was nothing that could be done with the slavesideally id like a more well developed mechanic that affected standings or loyalty points or something but id be happy with anything that made it not completely immersionbreaking
perhaps the option to keep the salves and incorporate them as part of your ship forced crew labor thus giving you slight attribute pluses to gunnery or other items on your shipeach ship could have only a maximum  of crew it can have at a time  depends on size of sihp  and they also die off after time making you require more  and there you have a valid market price for slavesfreeing them perhaps brings up your security standing or somethingusing them  brings it down
i consider your title to counter itselffree the slaves  finefor the love of god  amarrdont support amarr and dont support slavery at the same timepaaanyways support because of the poor slaves 
it really should be as simple as being able to sell the slaves to the amarr empire keep them in slavery or a reward from gallenteminmatar for turning them in like you get for turning in dog tags

i agree that the system is still exploitable but the idea is that is at least somewhat functional and not as easy to exploit regarding the  convo the target and ask him you want to split the bounty this is a risk as these types of agreements are often not honored in evethe other thing is that i think you miss read part of my idea when you get bounty kill rights they work the same as normal kill rights the only difference is that when you kill a wanted player you only receive the bounty on them if you have those bounty kill rightsthe 1 vs 1 point you raised is very interesting currently i sometime spend time with a small fleet in low sec waiting for reds bounty huntingsure this will never be as good as the crime and punishment forum or hiring mercs directly but look at the bright side for people already punishing pirates hopefully this system will increase the average bounty on a wanted player because they cant just pop themselves when the bounty gets to high and they want to avoid serious confrontation sure there are still exploits here but hopefully implementing the above idea would make the system less exploitable which is a win for everybody except for those who are currently cheating the system and avoiding the consequences infact profiting from their actions
your logic escapes meyou agree its exploitable  but then say it not easy to exploit if i offer to share the bounty with the bounty target thats an easy exploit of the system and since its so obvious how can you say its not easy the second exploit is that if the 20 target can still ride around in most high sec and assuming he doesnt get heads up that his contract has been chosen or who chose it the hunter will probably wait until the target is in a noncombat ship before collecting if you get high sec kill rights on an alliance frieghter because the guy driving it is negative security and all his alliance escort has to stand there and watch you have serious break in game balance sure this will never be as good as crime and punishment then what is it we are talking about here if there is a better method why try to have ccp create a new system that will have a very dubious legitamcy honestly i think you all are just wanting to get off cheap on paying mercs and thats just wrong in itself part of the reason piracy and low sec dont work well is that market guys rarely hire people to protect their caravans cause it would eat into their margins

for missiles just one upgrade module have which is the ballistic control systemno flight time upgrade or flight speed modulesthe guns can get more optimal or falloff from modules but missiles cant get anything just damagerof modulesshould be create for missiles low slot range modules toothis  missile fuel injector 75 missile velocity with stacking penalty if someone using more than one

drones have only 2 modules and 0 implants while missiles have a full range of implantsi think you can get behind the drone users in the queue for more stuff

you faildrone link tracking cpu navigation computer i think this is not 2and one more thing yes drones need more love too i wrote so many times but please tell me how came here drones how much modules have  thats restrict the missile upgrades  if something wrong need fix like missing drone implants and combat drone rigs missing cpu rig missile flight time or speed modules etcthis is just one thing which need to revise like anything else
no way there are no slots to fit extra modulesid support getting new missile variations which have more rangeless damage maybe replace worthless precision ones with that
this  i like
target painters are very nice for missiles missiles already have pretty good range which you can increase considerably with rigsan explosion velocity script for tracking computers would be nice though
a turret sniper is dedicated to range with no tanka cruise raven setup for long range is well  a cruise raven setup for any rangethe option to swap a midslot tank for say a 30 velocity bonus would be good
im for a midslot missile speed boost with it missile ships might have a use in ranged fleet fights which is to say the missiles might get to a target before it blows up
lol you are right i forgot the tracking nerfing aka navigation computer module for the rest of your post seeing how ccp tend to fix one thing at a time yes i want drones ahead of missiles missiles are fairly well equipped with the rigs and hardwires what need to be addressed is some t2 ammo and rockets they dont need a blanket add to all missiles module we especially dont need again torpedoes hitting at 80 km note that the op is asking for flight time upgrade or flight speed modules essentially a way to get missiles further away and in less time range is already a strong point of missiles and flight speed is already at the max possible for the eve engine so i dont see anything in the op proposal that can help missiles or can be implemented unless what he want are 80 km toprpedos like in the past

there should be an option for removing yourself from local chatotherwise this gives experienced players  older players a huge advantage to us newbiesi cannot go explore any space  04 because as soon as i enter the space  which i am not protected in anyawy by concordi show up in local chatany pvp players in the same solar system just have local chat open they see me appear and go look for me at all the jump gates and then expand searchthey should have to run into me in the same jump point  like an asteroid field or something instaed of knowing they are not aloneand i shouldnt know they are there either unless i run into themi dont stand a chance in  4 space unless i have been playing for years
to many pvpbears and nullbears whine  so its not going to happenobviously its broken and there was plenty of topics about it
it would be as simple as making someone have to probe to see what ships are around the system or something if someone is hidden just like scanning for other anomoliesi dont feel like having the need to play the game for years or be forced to join a big corp  instead of going at it alone  just to be able to explore the gameit makes the game  for me anyway  unappealing because i will never be able to put in the amount of time that hard core games do if they find me yes they have better ships  than can kill me that is part of the game but first they have to know i am there to find me
this and variants of this have been proposed about a billion times its not happening at least not in anything like as simple a format as you suggest
come on you supported the silly skill to reduce the signature radius of pods proposalits pretty obvious that ccp would not do a simple delayed local without updating other mechanics such as the directional scanner  they have stated as much current local does need to go in 00 at the very least everywhere ideally
not bad

there could be some thought to a pirate allowed to recieve a bounty from another pirateif you are a pvp killer  concord should not transfer the bounty amount to your accountthis would prevent you from putting a high bounty on a pvp killer and his buddy kills him so they can split the profit
i have been thinking about it for a while and what would be nice is a system that functioned through contracts that is very much like buying a hunting license and getting tags using the contract system would allow people to exchange anything for the service auction the service and privatize the service to corporations or individuals if desiredyou could make then the person who accepts the tag doesnt get paid until that person generates a kill mail that matches the conditions laid out in the tag the conditions could be based on individual person corp ship type or a combination there of seems like a better solution than the bounty system and allows people to fight proxy wars
sounds cool but itd obviously need some tweeking
if youve ever tried to anchor a tower in a 04 on in highsec you will by now have found its practically impossible for any corp to accomplish  practically every nonalt in eve has done at least a few missions  enough that theyve got a tiny amount of standings with every factionthe net result is that its next to impossible to achieve the standing required to anchor a tower in any corp that isnt made of alts for the express purpose of launching a tower and even then you need to be phenomenally careful that none of them picks up a 01 faction standing anywherei quite like the idea that factions only let people they like anchor towers but im less enthusiastic about the notion that  in practice  youre forced down the alt route so im asking for the corp standings mechanic to be revised  to be something other than the average of the members in it  because that means almost every real corp has even very high standings massively diluted i cant think of quite how it off the top of my head but id really like to see something that counts really low standings as negligible even as simple as excluding everyone with an absolute standing of less than 05 would help a great dealid prefer though at corp that had mostly members who werent too negative in standing and a few people who were really high standing  would have a reasonable corp standing perhaps something like a sum of squares modified by positive and negative otherwise it would be daft capped out by the average of the top 10 members of the corp so people who were around zero wouldnt really make much difference but people who were really high or low standing would substantially skew the overall standing for bonus points that would have a similar effect on standings for jump clones i know that it wasnt supposed to be easy to get a highsec tower im not really suggesting that that be overly changed  thing is though practically speaking its very easy  i just move one high standing into a corp on its own anchor the tower and then were done if there were a minimum number of people needed as caps for the average that would actually make it somewhat harder to alt which i cannot help but feel is desirable  theres already enough reasons to run industry with alts as it is
if cosmos was remade as an epic arc players might run them
if cosmos goods were made worth a tinkers damn people would bother with them again
you know how to get around this jump from one war dec corp to another rotate the corps and keep that corp war decced forever costs are the same the only down side is a long employment record
can i have your eyes the blue text is almost blurred the orange is a lot easier to read
when in 05 systems and higher remote anything repairing sensor boosting etc only works on members that are in your nonnpc corporation
so your alliance mates cant rr you or your posthey should share the eventual aggression flag end of the matter
seems to me tri went to play with privateers and burned themself a bit
probably a roleplay prostitute
i am already contacting fox news in case your proposal gets through
oh ok my fault right no flagging after steal is griefing mayby a bug i donUFFFDt knowwhat i mean is ninja looting is not griefing

yes people hate on missiles because you could outrun them and they dont hit instantly sadly or no these things make much less difference these days also its quite possible to hit extraordinary dps levels with shortrange missiles and certain common ships drake etcpresently the following defenses work against gunships ecm sensor dampening and turret disruptionthe following defenses work against missile boats ecm sensor dampeningdefenders were supposed to be a defense against incoming missiles reducing their damage somewhat but not negating it they simply dont work and therefore deserve to be either fixed or deletedits possible that missiles would need to be rebalanced somewhat around a working defender system the nittygritty details are as always in ccps handskrum

bad idea guess proposed by people who want to steal secure stuff maybe have a hacking ability all set at 23 hours the owner is alerted to the hacking then the owner and his corp can respond if the hacker is bumped off the can the timer resets 
it still isnt clear to me why on the csm wiki page for the proposal on the increased fleet size the text from my proposal was copied to the letter except the actual proposed solution the raw logs only show that tea mentioned the discrepancy thank you tea especially since you do not approve of the proposal but nothing was done about it its not that i couldnt live with the altered proposal but there has been no transparency at all on the reason for this seemingly arbitrary modification looking at the contributors for the wiki page this critique for lack of methodology goes specifically to elvenlord and isd salpsan
problem you pointed out is an existing solid one but solution on the other hand was not quite thereafter some unofficial discussion with other csm members and more then few players some of them where fcs of those big gangs wei changed the solution to the issue it was proposed and passed by the csm as it is now and we feel it will solve the problem
not only is this awesome but it would actually make anchoring and running a pos enjoyabledoooo ittttt
unlike mining which is still all reward no risk u cant afk rat
agree with proposal insurance system must be revamped so no pay off for selfdistract or concord kills slightly less isk for t1 and more for t2 and t3
when the eve community stops caring about what happens in eve is when eve is dead bumpedit think i must of hit report instead of quote the first time 
not a bad idea though long range class rails will still need a boost or have the lock limit removed to have their range advantage be meaningful the key problem is that range alone without some sort of damage isnt useful the entire concept of being superior at some range is by doing the most damage at that range for rokhrails this is beyond the lock limit and this never happens for megarails

my full support for lowsec boostalso logistic pilots shoudnt be engaged by sentrys or loose sec status because of supporting an outlaw when in same corp
supported outlaw would be much better than the tyrannis also known as pos monkeyplus lowsec needs something unique about it not just increased risks significantly without increased rewards
except that they forced their own hand with tyrannis by announcing dust 514 where as with lowsec and fw they know through experience they can let it languish and drift aimlessly with little of consequence to trouble themselves with

good ideasmake low sec more interesting for everyoneu can earn trillions in highsec u can earn quadrillions in nosec but u only can earn earn peanuts in lowsecmake the game overall better and boost lowsec
supportbutton right
good ideas please make the lowsec a batter place
7 have lowsec borders between all the empires or at least the empires who are at war so there is no safe route for people this way people would actually hire escort personel to protect haulers another career opportunity smugglers would also be employed in such placesis the best part100 support
some good points
i also would like to add that any standing changes should not be affected in 00basically if you dont take standings hits for killing people in 00 then you should not get a standings increase for killing rats there either
signeddefinately some interesting ideas here

a little late to this game but here goes anywaywhile i agree that low sec needs some love most of the ideas presented here simply dont seem that useful to me the best way to get people into low sec is to give them an incentive to go theremore ideas like adding low sec only pos mods like pleasure hubs which take hookers and booze like current poss take ice and less of everything else the idea of adding in mods that use up the various trade goods which now languish in cargo holds everywhere is a great ideasupported in principle though i disagree with some of the suggestions
i support this
signedwe need more love in lowsec
12i like the idea to limit pirate faction ships to low00 sec only but it is allready too late for this and it would  off a lot of players so the idea is sadly unreasonable however i would like to extend the ideas in the starter post with a proposal of a new ship type that can only used in lowsecnew ship claas  electronic remote access dronessieze  between a smallmedium drone but piloted by a playerthe purpose is to enforce the target to eject his cargo andor his podthe small manned drone vessels will be able to dock on the hull of a target i have the pictures of matrix i in mind when the bots try to capture the hoover ship the requirement is shields below 30 and successfully warp disrupted depending on the taget sieze you will need multiple drones in order to make this working vague values later when the necessary ammount of drones have docked on the tagets hull a interface will become available for the attackers containing a list of all modules and critical systems by clicking on a system or module you start to disable it funktion wich take some time if successful the module is offlined by consuming its hitpoints to zero same as overheat effect apart from modules there are several internal systems that can be offlined  delf destruct ability this can only disabled if the pilot initiate it the basic chance to disable it is 75 and it can be raised to 99 by skills but a swift reaction is needed because the disable timer is only slightly lower than the destruction timer  trustersthe ability to fly sublight speed can be disabled here its one of the early targets because it prevent the prey to get back to gate or stationwhen disabled the max velocity is 0 but the ship could still go in warp when the warp disrupters are taken off  cargohold emergency ejectwhen successfully hacked all the cargo will drop in a special container far enough from the prey to scoop it back frighters can not eject cargo they can only captured or destroyed after the cargo eject the target ship will become unlockable and invulnerable and go instant in a emergency warp to a deep safespot and it get an additional a 1 hour cloak like the one you get after a gate until it moves the trade off here is 100 cargo but no ship kill including fitting versus killed ship but parts of the cargo destroyed to pull this off a good attack team need about 1015 minutes note  not every target is worth time and effort to treat it this way its about freedom of choice if you think its worth your time do it or you just pop it and scavenge the leftovers as usual  enforced emergency eject when successfully hacked the targets pilot will ejected from his former ship and the pod will become unlockable and invulnerable and warp instantly to a deep space spot where it is additional cloaked up to 1 hour until it move the ship is free to board to whoever can grab it a good attack crew will need about 3040 minutes to board a ship thats a lot of time for reinforcments sound easy to capture a ship feeling to yarr out lout  well it is hard work and it need a big support crewthe capture drones have the signature and the velocity of a medium drone they can be locked shoot at and die real quickthey can even shoot after docked on your hull wich make a standing target they can be smart bombed wich is a real horror they can attacked with drones fof missiles and minmatar turrets still fire even without cap not talking about cap boosters wich should the absolute primary to disable first when smartbombs are fitted after all its hard work and its supposed to be hard
good ideas i support it
22so you need warp distupters neutralizers ecm and small boats that take care real quick of launched drones while it is optional to disable any modules it might be a good idea to incap weapons cap boosters and other modules that could break the sige of course that extend the time of the operation and a big retribution fleet might just a few jumps away that means some battle ready escort might a good idea too thats certainly a lot of effort involving a bigger group of people to capture a ship successfully more effort worth to gank the random 0815 guy because that where a real pain and would  people off its not meant to become the number one choice of pirating everything the focus is more about faction fitted ships or juicy cargo or careless marauderdreadscarrier that ratting in lowsec imagine this complex fitted vargur worth 6 billion fall into your hands unharmed that justify a crew of 15 pilots or more to bring it down to spice it up due the sieze of the vessel there is no space for a pod however all functionality a pod provide is supplyed by the ship itself think of it as a pod with extended functionality however if the ship go boom you wake up on station the safety layer of a additional pod is not provided tough stuff for tough guys and space girls the ships can only bought and used in lowsec and npc 00 space because this are the only systems that recive a carrier signal provided by the local pirates that is needed to make the hack software working thats the insurance the pirates installed to make sure their invention wont turn against them some stats target need to be warpdisrupted and the shields must be constant below 30 to make the electronic capture vessels able to dock and work if a criteria is not meet anymore the docked boats will repelled and can not redock until the criterias are meet again if you docked on your prey you see his interface when you click on a module a timer apears depending on the module and sieze of the module between 30 seconds and 5 minutes and when it meet zero the module is offlinedhave 0 hitpoints you have also the buttons to eject loot pod and disable subwarp speed this timers run between 5  30 minutes and have a percentual based success chance that means they can fail and need another cycle simillar to salvaging the ship skillrang 4 and a new skillrang 3 under electronics can significant raise the success chance you get access to the interface only when the minnimum requirement of electronic capture ships docked on the target if 2 or more ships offline the same module on the target it will offlined faster there can be more ships dock on a target than the minnimum requirement that help to speed up the capture process electronic attack vessels needed to capture a ship not fixed just an example shuttle  1 interceptor  1 max 2frigateassault frig  2 max 3cruiser  3 max 5battle cruiser 4 max 6battle shipmarauder 6 max 9carrierdread 12 max 16titan 40 max 60 to boost the pirates a requirement to get into the ship should be a sec status below 5 and the ship should available exclusive above the black market mentioned in the starter post of this thread

i support thisalso could we get the ability to make folders inside folders for our bookmarks i have a folder for xxx km away from a gate and i have tons of bookmarks away from gates but i dont like having 20 bookmarks in the same system for the same gate and i dont like makeing more and more folders
so you dont like making more folders but want ability to make folders inside folders logic fail p thanks for support though 
signedsuggestion make safe spots towards yet beyond planets moons gates and the sun this fools inexperienced pursuers into warping to those larger bodies and delays their probing you down for a few more seconds
isnt that what the warp within 100km is more or less about granted it doesnt take you out of range of sight but if your 100km off not much they can do and basically works on the same principle
im talking a safe spot lined up with an orbiting body yet hundreds of thousands of not hundreds of kilometers out
no i want to make a folder inside a folder instead of just haveing a hugh list when i right click in space
hansu that is possible midwarp to something have your people and places opened up and while in warp click add bookmarkalso you said i dont like making more and more folders is what i was commenting on
fix the sound already bump to the top

i support mostall of these ideas
line breaks are your friend apollo 
no i think his point is that the industrial corp argument is used to justify the need for hisec wardecs and it really isnt something that happens so hes annoyed when it is used as a counterargument
so the freedom to avoid a war by chickening out makes this game great no it does not this would be a horrible idea how about we make it so you cant pvp someone unless they lock you back and push the fire button in real life i declare war on you aw you dont want war im sorry we dont have warthe brutal truth is war is hell
remind me to buy you a drink when wis comes outo7
oh my gawd just fing surrender the damn war  this thread has gone on too long and is not going to go through so can it be dropped already please cheezus
just make wardecs more expensive that will filter those corps that have legit reasons from pansy pvp corps that are to chicken to fight in lowsec triple wardec fees and make the costs increase exponentially after the first week
i have a sneaking suspicion that to take part in the tyrannis land grab players will need to be in a player corp as it is intended that planetry interaction has a low barrier to entry i forsee lots of new shiny corps all ready to be decced
id just like to quote this for it being the same reason sok got my votealso the lack of support in this thread warms the les of my war deccing heart
there are some good ideas here but it seems a few people who do not want this passed are trolling in order to prevent the more mature people from actually seeing the good ideas
supportedthere should be no war decshigh sec should be just like 00
before moving to 00 the industrial corp i was in did it often to keep competitors out of the area and to keep belts from being cleaned out before we could get to all the shiny rocks in thempretty much false ganking freighters is huge profit spend a day or two ratting to get the sec back and gank another wardecing an industrial corp who doesnt hide and fights back poorly is also huge profit not allowing pvp players to wardec empire corps would reduce the ability of small pvp corps to have income definitelyit sounds like you take war decs personally they are almost always profit driven  whether by a competing industrial corp or a pvp corp even in 00 most wars are over scarce resources ie profit drivendid this on a regular basis when i was in an indy corp so we could control omber mining later to control a drone plex which was the source of high end minerals for manufacturing if you are in an indy corp and arent pushing your weight around a little if you dont have people who can fight in your corp then at least by hiring mercenaries to do it for you you are doing it wrongtrue for the most part poss in high sec usually dont have the guns to be a threat to even a pile of mission runnersagain pvp corps have to make money too either they are making money off your loot or they are making money on a mercenary contract taken out on youyeah you pretty much ended up sounding like a dumb industrialist no one can differentiate products in eve so the only way you control margins is through scarcity usually created by muscling out competition pvp wars are cheaper than price wars
i sympathise with the op but unfortunately you are starting from false perspective new eden is a dangerous place filled with people whose sole aim is to make your wealthreputation less than thiers i own a corp that could be considered industrial but weve never been decd thatll change after this post  however there are many things you can do to avoiddissuade combat the best is mobility working in hek and decd by a corp mine in amarr space will they follow unlikely chances are they based in mini space too you are industrialists therefor high int and mem ewar your enemy out of the game train up trade skills and fly outposts make money while they lose it on an impotent dec this way you turn thier strength combat into a weakness whilst they force you to play to your strengths so no dont support the motion
we also need to remember that the treaty mechanic is supposed to be implemented before long so entering into a mutual defense pact may be something that is already on the horizon
i support this idea maby the ability to do a percentage tax like take a percentage of the corp tax like when a corp tax is 10 and the allaince tax is 1 then the allaicne tax takes from the corp tax
i support this idea 100 it would be so simple to get the taxes and would make sure that executor corps are not relying on member corps to send the isk all the time great idea i hope that this is put into effect
not a bad idea
goon alt detector going off the charts here
i think this is a good time to bump this topic given that the gallente militia just reclaimed intaki
intaki was retaken player action is there
planet spin is already in the game its just slower then it used to be which is a good thing imo just to check myself i just flew around oursulaert and every planet with visible landice mass was unquestionably spinning
low priority dont overrule anything more important to look at it but with tyr around the corner maybe you can assign a dev or two to fix it
this guy must be working on the next expansion with ccp and doesnt want more of a workload i agree if ccp wants to add new features as so it should be based more on a realistic aspect back to your drawing board gents
i totally agreei live in a cataclysmic wormhole system which means 2 stars and an environmental phenomena which looks like a 3rd star but i guess its more like a haloin our star system we can only warp to the main star not to the other oneit would be nice indeed to have both stars in the planetary overview cause both stars are physicallyvisually therenot quite right i think as far as my knowledge go dual stars are mainly close to each other in very close orbit if not the gravity disk will be too unstable to allow orbiting planetswhy not planets around both stars impossible the gravity disks of both stars has become one in the same direction as the stars orbit each other so only 1 gravity disk remains to allow planets orbiting with both stars in the centera planet that should cross in between both stars will be ripped apart due to the gravitation of those starsbut so far my theory i agree ccp should stick a bit closer to physical laws and shift the order of the planets so it makes sencethanks for bringing this up
most definitely supported
which brings up the point that both stars should be in the center of each system if these systems are supposed to be binaries planets would most likely be ejected or live a short life in degenerating orbit from the system if their orbit fell between two stars
nuff said on the stupidity level

there should be no mechanics special for ransom it is just deal between victim and the pirate
not needed but definitely wanted
i believe that picking color from a range of presets should allow for this addition not to add too much strain on the server eve has to evolve some day so i support this if i am by any chance wrong well then it will not be done please remember that you cannot really compare eve where you can have over 1k people in a single fight with most modern fps games it just works in very different ways
ok a few things first offadding a custom paint job to a ship will increase resource request and bandwith on the sever side it does not have to deal with the rbg pushes from server to client imagine this current 30 ships zone into a system the server keeps track of each ship and its assocaited pilot then parses a relitivly static and archived database that holds the rbg colors for all ship models for the 30 different ships that load into the systemcustomized ship modles the same 30 ships zone into a system the server again keeps track of each ship and its pilot it then has to parse a dynamic database for both the ship name and the associated pilot inorder to reterive that pilots custom pallete now loading 30 ships would not be a hunge issue but loading 600 ships would cause more fleet lag then their currently is due to the fact that the database would have to parse millions upon millions of enteries instead of a few hundered one solution here would be to allow for local palete settings so you could customize your ship but all other ships would be the default color palletei do beleive it would be a cool and novel idea wtb red and black paint but the server issues have to be addressed first and formost before this can even be considered
thats like saying that if you get a bigger car you need more pain to colour it ofcource you will have more database enteries the question is if it will have a 2 impact on performance or 50 hit as none of us know exactly i suggesting leaving performance aspect of this proposal alone as ccp is probably the only entity that can aswer this question exactly instead we should simply state that we whant more colour and ccp will tell us if it is possible or not
you realize you are talking about 96 bits of data right per color three integers per ship even if the system ended up with 2000 people in it thats 24kb of data it doesnt send that continuously either just when it sends the info on what is currently ongrid when you are warping in or when something new warps inthis is not going to break the server i just dont want to see bright pink megathronsi would be in favor of allowing people access to the other paint schemes any given ship has see bottom of blog

how about replace the current black plane with a clear one such as the tactical overview
also an idea previously suggested and i suppose since this is second upbringing about it it could be implemented as a fix the planet orbits more or less do this but not in a nice neat line like tac view and that would be immensely more helpful as an orientation tool to have have many au it is
this one press the esc key on the upper left of the keyboard and play with those options
still becomes difficult to see when you have multiple probes out and the shadows overlap not sure if youve ever tried finding a particularly hard sig and had to deploy more drones the shadow makes it nigh impossible to detect the underlying boxes
supporting fixing bounties in general almost anything would be better than the current systemi think this specific proposal has merit but placing bounties being limited by killrights would be more flexible than 20 sec status
i like the idea i had also a bounty hunter career path in mind my idea was though base it on sec statusespecially the detail here stated makes sense just for the fact that those groups can do big damage with actually very less effortthe most important thing is to me that the system is not abused to make one man wardecs against people who didnt do anythink of that sorti also would stretch the idea a bit furthersay one has been ganked with his hulk loss will be some 190 misk strips includingwell a normal bounty would cause the ganker to loose a ship eventually including character implants if any but the lost value could be again much less then the ganker costmy addition therefore would be as followssay i lost 200 million to a ganker i want the ganker to loose 200 million value as well  the bounty i pay for him i would be paying say 50 million bounty causing that the headhunter mission is fullfilled only when the ganker lost 250 million value the 50 million would be the minimum value for a value loss above 200 millionabove 200 million value it would be a definate lvl 4 mission with 50 million bounty above 50 million value a lvl with 10 million bounty lvl 2 or below dont have that featurei am sure ccp would find a basic loss value system for that that could also be an official restraint add this official loss value to the killmail which is the maximum loss value  the minimum bounty for that casefurther and i am aware that it sounds old but it fits here people with bounties on their head should have no insurance cover i mean lets face it if people want to get rid of their bounty they would buy a raven or whatever and let themselfs be shot and are done with the bounty that would just render the bounty system useless cause they get their money back

supporting does this affect lag at all though
you gotta check the support boxallow me to demonstrate
nothing would change in the serverclient communications the only thing that would change would be the client way of storing the loot logs
supporting and not because boomer has my family held hostage either
i support
seems reasonable enough to me
split weapon systems are ednobody uses projectiles on the typhoonswap the projectile rof bonus for a drone damage bonus
your post is ednot supporting typhoon pilot
no
not to counter your argument but i do mount projectiles on my typhoonnot supported
who really wants to use missiles anyway
definitely not supportedminmatar pilots need to train projectiles more heavily than missiles so if anything goes its the damn launchers
thanks for speaking for all typhoon pilots depending on role i fit turrets andor launchers andor smarties i think the new turret  launcher changes have made this ship more flexible than trying to focus it as either missiles or turrets yes you do lose one bonus if you fit only one type of weapons but it is only a tier one bs and even with those limitations is still perfectly viableto get the best out of it you need t2 heavysentry drones t2 launchers and t2 turrets which is why minmatar are not easy mode
not supported typhoons are fine as they are now the phoon is one of the most versatile bs in my book yes you have split weapons on it but no one said you should fitt them with both missiles and guns though it will make a close range dps monster if you dothing out of the box and then tell me its a bad ship
instead of trying to ruin a flexible ship type ie split weapon shipshow about for the extremes such as the typhoon we ask for the bonuses to be 75 instead of the current 5that way it balanced out the fact that the two bonuses are effectively just one
wtftyphoon really seems to be a good ship i do not fly it myself but alot of my mates do and they do it well i would not mind it but i dont think it is nessesary
not supported the typhoon is an exceptional t1 teir 1 bs the split weapon system and bonus makes it a very unpredictable ship to go up against its versitility is fantastic and should be on more minmatar shipsthe only thing i feel the phoon needs is a smidge more pg although thats what you get when you buy and fly the fleet issue version
fail again do you think ccp can concentrate just one thing torpedos to 80 km  you can calculate it for me how much low slot upgrade need for it with 75 upgrade with stacking penalty from raven  i whisper for you 4 modules at 40km range will be add for you 87766km with this 75 dataoh and wait if you need minimum 4 for 9km at 40km range how can use damage modules too you used it rockets heavy assault missile or torps when the ship not add for you any  bonuses for range range or damage is this suggestion main pointwhen you use range module in low slot you must sacrifice a low slotmaybe should be an another solution script for ballistic control system range or damagerof
1 i see a request for 2 kind of effects an increase in speed and an increase in flight time 2 range module in low slot so they should be low slot modules convenient note that tracking computers are middle slots 3 80 km can be an exaggeration but with missiles you get ungodly ranges for a short range system and even more ungodly ranges for the long range again rockets are an exceptionbut they should be addressed alone not with a general change in missiles especially as you can pile up the hardwirings that arent stack nerfed with modules and the rigs that are stack nerfed with them 4 you still dont have addressed the problem of excessive speed breaking the game engine search a bit in the test forum and you will see that it is a real problem acknowledged by the devs5 and yeswhen ccp do a broad change to a weapon system they tend to touch only 1 system at a time they prefer to see the effect of the changes before tweaking another system at least when the change affect all the different kinds of weapons of that systemso if they work on missiles for a different balance of that weapon system they will place drones on hold as long as they dont have seen the aftereffects of the change 6 casually 3 missile boats drake raven and kestrel are the most widely used combat ship last queen then fairly behind you find the dominix so maybe guns need to be even further ahead of drones and missiles for a tweak btw if you limit your request to flight time alone it can even be supported naturally it will make mission farming with torp ravens even easier but i suppose it is one of your goals

just speed extra speed would make missiles viable in longer ranged combat in all honesty guns have a mid slot and low slot module that modifies rangetracking what are you talking about are you complaining about missiles being all optimal range the obvious answer to that complaint is that missiles also are not instant impact rockets hams and torps all have normal short range compared to other systems except on a few specialty ships with several range bonuses instead of damage bonuses like on ships of the same classexcessive speed is a problem when something is trying to shoot it it is a problem when calculating transversals this is ammo there is no transversal to calculate as nothing is going to lock and shoot it this gets funky when dealing with defender missiles  which is part of the reason they are broken just look at the computations for tracking done every time a gun fires and compare that with the distancespeedflighttimeokay how does this impact a request for a single module the two are hardly mutually exclusive both do not impact each other creating some kind of horribly imbalanced ubership okay the rattlesnake pilots would send love letters to ccp if both were fixed that must be some good stuff you are smoking raven combat ship kestrel wait what not sure where you are flying that you are confronted with ravens and kestrels in pvp on a regular basis rewording that pilots in kestrels or ravens who are actively seeking pvp and not simply being gankedflight time is fairly meaningless compared to flight speed that is why it is a harder skill to train the largest weakness of missiles is the firetoimpact delay this is why you dont find a fleet of sniper ravens it simply would not work however the flip side is ravens could be part of large fleets still ridiculed but actually a functional part if they could boost the speed of cruise missiles hence the request for a module boosting missile speed
lets alone all the rest but evidently you and your friend are awfully misinformed ccp has tested on the dev server not sisi missiles with higher speeds above a specific velocity they start to act funny and the eve engine is not capable of managing them from what was said the current higher speed for a bonused ship  implants  rigs  skills is the max speed that the eve engine can manage without errors if you want a missiles that overshot the target and the turn back missing again and again go on and ask for an higher speedyou can find some info about the dev post not a quote and discussion on increasing missile speeds here
if youre going to say something like this please link some form of proof im not going to buy it on the word of a character who seems to have a general lack of kills beyond that it just doesnt seem plausible in a game where you used to be able to collide interceptors doing 15kms each without a problem
you were too hasty i was searching for the quote found a handy thread but still hunting for the dev post
i kind of agree with the mid slot module that would give missile velocity  explosion velocity a tracking computer for missiles which can be scripted to give higher  in a single bonus then the low slot module that cant be scripted and gives lower bonuses however point defence requires fixing point defence needs to be an effective system in a fleet that is centralised to a single t2 ship new t2 destroyer anyone which is race specific and good at killing drones or missiles depending on race
since you are proposing a tracking computer for missiles ill support it as long as you also include a tracking disruptor equivalent for missiles no defenders dont count
i would like to know if it is still an issue or was an issue back when people were doing this with ship speeds down waaaaaay down in many cases do missiles still freak out at higher speeds
way past i have seen cruises freaking out when fired against a stationary jetcan and circling hit never hitting the engine has become better but i doubt so much better the basic structure is still the sameprobably 15 kms is safe against slowstationary targets but against high speed or in high lag situations i think ccp will stick to the current max speed of about 12 kms the problem even if the op dont want to hear it is that bonus pile up what can be balanced for a typhoon with torpedoes is overpowered for a raven with the same torp plus rigs and implants when speaking of implants it is only a 5 it do nothing is a false statement the true statement is it is a 5 that stack with rigs skills and ship bonus when you use all the options it do a lot even more if you add a 5 flight time implant so the 75 speed increase with one module mean 900 ms more for a 12 kms missile 9 more km for a 10 second flightwith 2 modules it is an increase of 1700 ms and we already are near dangerous speeds for the engine with 3 modules we get well above 14 kms and probably we will start having troubles with hitting fast moving targets if you look the thread i linked you will find this almost never can have limited consequences for a ship but when you are firing volley after volley of missiles it can become a big drop in effective dps if some your missiles pass thought the enemy ships and continue on their merry way from what i have seen a missiles that suffer from this kind of behavior never recover so every time this limit hit you will lose the missile or volley damage naturally the only people that really know what is the current state of the physic engine are the devs but without further information i suppose the problem still exist
why you lieing im playing with this game since 2003dev never wrote this and i just talk to you the missiles flew quickly early now much slower than and devs not needed test missiles speed they said the engine physical limit maybe at 20kms speed nothing elselet see the missile speeds nowlight missile on a hawk which get 50 missile velocity bonus  8435kmswith 2 module would be  965869kmslight missiles on a ship which not get  missile speed bonus  5625 kms would be with 2 modules 644103 kmsheavy missile on caracal same like hawk light missile speed 8435kmscruise missiles on a raven same data 8435kmstorpedo on raven  50625 kms would be with 2 modules 5796931 kmsall ship get 50 missile speed from ship bonus caracalravenhawkso you fail again and talk about second thing after 80km idiotism which is not true where is that 20kms from 9ks and other thing should be use datas not just your words thats nothing without knowledge
there is a module that is better than a tracking disruptor for missiles here is the modulei believe that module would work more to your liking if the missile ship has no range it cannot hit youbrechan
browsing through the thread on getting some love for low sec it seems painfully obvious that there are a lot of people who would like to see low security space be something other than the smart bombing campfest weve all come to know and love hate loathe ignore though the thread has some real merit as to its purpose i do not believe that the approach is correct becausea requires a crapload of game mechanics changesb a lot of the suggestions dont seem practical because they rely on getting people to change how they play evei would suggest that the fix for lowsec lies not in complicated redistricting or mechanics changes but in adding new pos structures that use the now usesless trade goods that keep popping up everywhere this was buried in several of the posts there and the idea is sound why not create low sec only pos structures for stuff like1 brothel  uses exotic dancers spiced wine beef janitors etc to generate a revenue stream2 slave labor camp  uses slaves skilled slaves beef etc to generate a revenue stream3 drug den  uses blue pills boosters and various other illegal drugs to generate a revenue stream the list could go on and should include a variety of structures that players can create that eat the various trade goods found in the game in exchange for iskies this solves a few problems likecreating a reason for people to go into lowsecgiving otherwise useless trade goods a market that does not exist nowgenerates more opportunity for pirates to go after the people who run these structures and creates pvp opportunitiesno complicated sov like restrictions no changing game mechanics to try and generate some interest use the existing pos infrastructure because they could work just like pos fuel with a different output and you kill multiple problems by letting the players work it out for themselves give us something to fight over please

yes pleaseit would be nice to also get the mineral market values for refine  either in the refine screen or in the sell list
talking with friends i have heard speculation that ccp may hesitate to implement proposal because it would lead to spikes on database load when making many price queries at the same time i do not agree for the following reasons1 database spikes could be controlled by limiting the number of items which may be mass sold 20 50 100 anything would be a great improvement over the current system2 database spikes could be controlled by having a wait time between queries of 05 seconds or some other adjustable value while it may take a minute to load up a list of 120 items for sale it would still be a great improvement over the current system3 its 2010 not 2003 computer hardware has improved and presumably their backend has too they should be able to handle a bunch of queries which are mostly going to be made anyway design decisions can be revisited as hardware becomes significantly more powerful and now is the time to reevaluate one of those decisions

i agree with almost everything the op said capping systems is currently only worthwhile for rp epeening in igs and the ease of farming fw missions makes pvp almost not worth iti would like to see a point in capping systems that reflects on the success in fw itself i dont have a foolproof answer to this but i do have one or two ideas1 drop the level of lp earned in fw missions but not completely that would be overkill2 make the capturing of systems raise the lp earned in fw kills for everyone in the capturing militia this would seriously motivate all fw players to both capture systems and engage in combatpro more fighting and more of a point to that fighting and more of the eve principle of riskrewardcons none that i can honestly see off the bat
disagreeit allows you to enter a system see how many people are in it and stay if you want ive been playing for nearly 1 year i live in null sec so i disprove your theory of how its impossible for you to surviveyou want to remove yourself from local cloakie
yup
glonnif low sec is where you can get ahead by mining probing or other being a newbie  you wouldnt stand a chancei would love to go into 00 and risk everything but if everyone in the system knows instantly that i have arrived what is really the pointif we meet up in space you have your bigger spaceship  and skill bonus because you have been playing longer but it should only be if we meet up that should be your only advantage since you are told that i have jumped into the system im dead meat in any ship i try to fly in and get ahead you dont even have to activly search for me you already know there is a target to kill
yes i supported it because it amused me this doesnt  local arguments just make me bored and tired these days yes local needs a change no this is not the right change its not even really in the right ballpark
remove local  possibleoption to remove local linked with overview settings ie war corp horrible etc much needed
if there was an option to remove yourself from local everyone would remove themselves from local and have alts in shuttles at every gate to identify when people are coming in or where they are going this is a fairly bad idea
i support this limiting the number of players in fleet is difficult to manage the fleet instead there are 23 fleets of 256 playerswe need larger fleetshaving larger fleet sizes isnt going to make the blobs biggerby much its just goona allow the ease of playyes fleets will get larger becuase people wont have to deal with the issues but the increase in the watch list needs to get fixed along with this
im not sure i see where the problem is with thishow awesome would it be to see 10000 people lining up on each side 20000 players all interacting destroying each other in one system at one time
yes

excellent ideaperhaps a build on this idea is to have the broadcasts icon appearing on the watch list too

i have noticed that in the csm category of the evelopedia there were many ui related issues that were raised issues that are often still raised by players in the assembly hall and features and ideas forums like the trash it option to cite but one examplei would like to suggest to the csm that they instead present to ccp an organised compilation of all the easy ui improvements that could be made for both clarity and to avoid fixing the mess that is the ui one issue at a time as it would then take forever to have a clean user friendly interfacei would also like if players could submit their own suggestions in this thread to help building such a compilation
well since we are also routinely hitting 512 pilots in fleet the modified proposal is only a minor improvement also you havent detailed the new advanced fleet skill from the description affects wings rank 14 i assume its a skill that wing commanders will have to train requiring wing command 5 as prereq not fc5but thats is not the point reallysince this is a democratic process and you are representatives this discussion should be held in the public in the appropriate thread for instance the least you could do is publicize the arguments for the change the only paper trail we have just notes there is a discrepancy for credibilitys sake the csm should become more transparent when they change a proposal
i support this cause

on 1 im for some sort of claim system but mechanics for someone to remove that claim have to be in place so using existing sov mechanics i say have people be allowed to drop a sov module in lowsec systems they can then use an ihub to upgrade the system to an extent where at max level it could be as good as the lower levels of null sec are without an ihub also youd get reduced office fees per level in addition i could go along with gate guns no longer attacking you but they would not defend you either theyd just offline essentially in regards to the controlling corpallianceon 2 sure have them be slightly better then current high sec agents but only slightlyon 3 id be for all current pirate goods to be able to be sold on some sort of black market in lowsecnot so sure about creating new oneson 4 to sell maybe to use noon 5 if all the mechanics work right it should increase this profession anywayon 6 no to overly complicated more ransom options such as suggested above for players would be more viableon 7 no you shouldnt be forced into low sec null sec or high sec it should be the potential rewards that get you thereon 8 if balanced to be less profitable then null sec moon goo sure also would give more meaning to some contraband in game to be usefulon 9 if you used my above sov mechanics youd already have this abilityon 10 once again see the sov suggestion i madeover all can agree lowsec needs more reward for the risks
i can deal with this gate guns would still do their thing ofc but anywhere away from them is fair game this meaning low sec would still be some type of sec but mainly for the ones who run it eve is about profit and if a 00 group needs an area for low sec for logistics theyll either need to pay tolls or help guard these areas thus turning pirates into logistics defenders lol but the same ideals nonetheless kudos to you legacy i would approve if was more along these lines than ops making low sec a higher sec for the owners but less resourcewise as welli see low sec as more logistical than a springboard to 00 thats where pirates make their dough would definitely bring a new era to low sec more like low sec interns than actual sov holders maybe

i support this thread but to those people that say it makes shield tanking is just not understanding what were asking for we just want the shields to be full when we jump in just like it does with armor or the other optionadd a secondary session change timer that will keep the fleet bonuss for x amount of time allowing people to jump into the next system
fix it even after fix armor tanks will be still prefered over shield in large gangs especially at capital lvl
good ideas fixs dont have to be big sweeping things to be good this might only make life a little easier but the effect would be positive on the eve playerbase

do you know the history of eve at one point there were no wardecs at all  thats right because there was no hisec the game had no balance between miners and combat pilots at all just to reiterate its called hisec not safesec in your opinion without proper reason actually i think you would be surprised at what ccp has to say about it they have stated on numerous occasions that player interaction consensual or otherwise is what eve is all aboutlook if you seriously cant stand the thought of in game blowing the  out of some bandit that desperately wants ituse alts on your accounts to create shell corps wardec comes in drop corp move to new corp last guy out of the old corp takes all the corps assets gives them to new corp owner viola no more waralthough i honestly believe that with only a wee bit of training and practice you would be surprised at how much fun it can be to blow up a fellow pod pilotso since there is already a perfectly fine method to avoiding a war i do not support your proposalmy apologies

it is time to close a chapter in eves history that started with thisccp started a transition from bpo to invention but never finished it this has consequences a small number of people are able to circumvent invention and make exorbitant profits that inventors cannot compete withyou may argue that life is harsh and that people pay huge sums for t2 bpos for this privilege howeverthe system is selfreinforcing as the owners will naturally make the most money and continue to usurp further bposthe system continues to be fundamentally unfair to new players there are still people out there with a blank cheque that was won in the lottery not earned every one such person keeps tens to hundreds of inventors out of the marketccp is inconsistent rare moons have been addressed through alchemy but this hasnt worse rare moons poss can be attacked bpos are safe in stationsproposalmake the market function properly eliminate t2 bposcompensate the owners convert them into t2 bpcs equivalent to two or three years of continuous production as many are priced that way but at 1 methere will be a residual negative shock to the value of the bpos anyway thats too bad we all lose stuff in nerfs aimed at making the game more balanced as for the price of t2 gear i have no doubt that the market and competition will take care of itreactions please if you have a vested interest declare it at least that way we at least we know what you stand for
no
no
 the system is selfreinforcing as the owners will naturally make the most money and continue to usurp further bposfeel free to buy a t2 bpo if you think they are so great  the system continues to be fundamentally unfair to new players there are still people out there with a blank cheque that was won in the lottery not earned every one such person keeps tens to hundreds of inventors out of the markethow is it unfair invention is the more profitable choice between invention and t2 bpo use most ppl with t2 bpos prolly didnt get them through the lotto they bought them id call that earnedas for the each t2 bpo keeps tens to hundreds of inventors out of work argument have you done the math one inventor can produce more then prolly 10 t2 bpos  ccp is inconsistent rare moons have been addressed through alchemy but this hasnt worse rare moons poss can be attacked bpos are safe in stationsalchemy is a secondary option to moon mining specific rare moon goos as invention is an option to producing from a specific rare t2 bpo
posting in a i dont have a t2 bpo so no one else should either thread
you do not have to have the lowest price to sell your t2 invented items for good profits from them  dont think like a sheep not supported in any way 0lly
any decent inventor can outperform a t2 bpo easily and it happens aloti would recommend reading this and thisthat might give you some numbers to see why the whole whine about t2 bpos are overpowered is just a sign missing cluenot supporteddisclaimer i dont own t2 bpos i still make fortunes with t2 production i could buy me t2 bpos but i dont see the need for it
hey look this thread again
qftpeople like this always just make me roll my eyes if they would just try their hand at the entire invention process theyd easily and swiftly see that t2 bpo holders on high volume goods simply cant hold a candle to inventorst2 bpos are different from invented bpcs in only one way they can build things more cheaply that is it they cant produce in nearly the quantity of invention they cant even come remotely closeinvention has paid for every one of my own t2 bpos invention is 90 of my production output i make more money by invention volumes on high demand items than i do with my bpos though i make more per item with bpos i have fewer of those items to sell than i do with my invention processesthe age of the t2 cartel is over so quit complaining and either buy your own bpo learn how to invent and produce your own t2 goods or stfu and buy the production of the inventors all around you
i am all for this one of the links someone posted against this idea even addmited that 10 of the t2 producers do 33 of the total production with bpos 110 producers doing 13 productionso 910 producers are generating the other 23yep can see why the t2 pbos want to keep their little toysanything that tries to make this game fair or balanced seems to always attempts to be stifled by those that feel entitled just because they started playing earlier that is one thing i like about the gear resets in wow it levels the playing field every 12 years or almost content patch now
only one way to make it balanced no i dont have t2 bpos either but how is giving t2 bpos away to players long ago and not jack for new players get rid of them and let the bpcs take precedence while letting t2 prices get higher like it should be
1 learn to use the search function instead of creating a new theread about something that has been proposed hundreds of times2 read what you find with the search function before posting so you will notice that you are wrong on all points1 bpo is approximately the equivalent of 25 manufacturing slots where you use invented bpcso each t2 bpo keep 02273 maximized inventors out of work building that specific item wow add to the list3 learn how pe work

in for tyrannis
no csm take this up yet come on its the most basic of additions and everyone i know wants it
stable planetary orbits in binary stars are possible as long as the stars are far enough from each other there are also some more exotic orbits possible ofc like planets that switch the parent star once in a while but propability of those orbits is low enough to neglet those then again with eve being real time game one can also get away with totally unstable orbits even as it can and will take several millenia to get rid of the planet that is in process of being ejected from the binary system if that kind of planets were present in eve they should be very very rare ofc as propability that this happens right now in the evolution of binary star system would be very low it seems reasonable to assume that binary systems that are unsuitable for more or less stable planetary orbits do not have stargates constructed around themimplementation of binary star systems itself does not seem very hard all you would need to do is to make second star and possible planets around it visible in the overview granted it would make some damn long warps possibility to explain why second star was not visible previously is distance and need for better warp drive to cover long distances between binary stars for example alpha centauri is triple star system a and b components in relatively tight orbit around each other 11 to 35 au to each other and then one small star component c far away orbiting those two at some 12 000 au or so roughly it would take very long time to warp from a to c as even in interceptor rigged for warp speed 20 aus it would take roughly 600 seconds or 10 minutes would sure give a meaning to the warp speed of the ship tho however  making second star in binary star systems all the systems that have stargates are binary systems according to the backstory visible and acsessible is in my opinion a lot easier to do in some future expansion than sorting the mess with planets after tyrannis has been relased if they are not looked before that expansion it would not end well at all if someone would find that their terrestial planet 64 au from the star has frozen to the core overnight after some dt 3 years from now afterall

there is already enough ganking in highsec going onthis proposal only would lead to pirates not only salvaging more from you mission runners but as well gaking you with no fear of concordif that is implented ccp might as well adjust highsec agents to be as profitable as low sec agents since there will be no difference between highsec and lowsec00 agents then any longerthus not supported

just stop cluttering the forums and make some sain and usefull proposals mmkanyone with half a brain would understand that ccp will shoot this idea down in 0001 ms
do you realise that the ninja salvagers are the least of yoru problems if they sneak in to steal from you then they get the 15 minutes timer dont they  in which case you get the option to go shoot them what your suggesting would allow roaming groups of pvpers to jump mission runners in pretty much any mission anywhere including high secsomething tells me you havent thought this through at all i test my ships out using high sec missions id rather not be busy tanking npc ships then get insta popped when a roving fleet jumps me and overloads my remaining tank popping my ship  this would be very bad idea so no way should it be supported
the problem isthis is hilarious lie there are only 2 ships out of 7 which have some kind of missile bonus namely eris and lachesis both with horrible split hybridmissile slot layout the rest are pure gunboats enyo ships with powerful warp inhibition ewar ares eris lachesis phobos or support ships occator oneiros ironically most powerful gallente missile ship nemesis stealth bomber is designed be duvolle laboratoriesbecause ccp are already in process of redesigning ship modelstextures see last b this would be great time to fix the roden shipyards in one strikeso heres the proposal1 change description of roden shipyard ships to more closely reflect reality something involving advanced electronics andor warp propulsion inhibition2 enyo make it duvolle laboratories ship its gunboat period3 eris remove missile bonus add small hybrid gun damage or optimal range bonus or something 6 turret hardpoints 4 lachesis swap models skins descriptions and producers with arazu let lachesis now duvolle ship drop the missile bonus for sensor dampenerhybrid guns optimalfalloff range bonus add 1 more turret mount 2 would be overkill i guess rook has 5 launcher though could be ballanced by fitting attributes5 optional make nemesis roden ship its more of compensation for losing enyo to duvolle
some of what you say makes good sense the nemesis and enyo should flip producers the description should emphasize warp disruption and split setups suck on ships that dont just bull their way through with raw dpslike the typhoon that said i disagree with making the eris a gun ship  gallente needs a few missile boats give it 7 launchers and 23 launcher bonuses lachesisarazu i dont care too much but i lean towards not flipping them for the sake of it make the lachesis look like a rook and itll hopefully see some use overall i think i support most of this
since the giant container 3000m3 carries 3900m3 i can understand the devs not wanting to make freighters able to use them to boost cargo capacityhowever i would really like to see smaller freight cans that will not compress space and are usable in a freighterfirst rename general frieght container 120k m3 large general freightadd medium general freight 12k m3and small general freight 1200m3the current 120km3 gen freight is nice provided you never organize anything or you are hauling large quantities of minerals or other items like that however many of us use the smaller containers within our own hangars to keep things organized ammo in one can mods that you use regularly in another loot in a third a fourth for blueprints etc what ends up happening when you use a freighter to move a lot of stuff is the smaller cans get dumped out into one large general freight can and you then have to resort all of your stuff at your destination if you have a lot of varied items to be moved this is a huge pain in the rearif this suggestion is implemented you can keep your smaller quantities organized without expanding freighter cargo volume also if you have buddies who want to move stuff at the same time you can keep their stuff separate from yours without losing a huge amount of space by requiring each individual to use a full sized freighter can lastly the addition of two game items and the renaming of one curent game item is all that will be required to make this change that will have no effect on game balance it will just make life a little easier for many of usthanks for your time edit what a difference a space makes
these cans are waaaaay too big i recommend an edit 
very plucky comment bub but seriously what do you think of my proposalwont support own idea until lots of others support it as well
i do support this idea because having to move lots of stuff in a freighter or jump freighter for a corporation or alliance or even individual can be a logistical nightmarehaving a container for smaller scale organising would be welcome because the general freight container is just too limited an option
probably something handywhat i personally would like is the ability to view containers from a distance  assets window it is all nice to organise everything but then when you need to check something you cant see it because it is inside a container if i can look at my station items then why cant i look insidethat would be something id really like
yeah this makes good sense to me
maybe also make a new kind of container that can have a fitted ship framed inside similar to an 18 wheeler hauling carstrucks in the back hell even a tug boattow truck type ship would be nice to havemaybe a 250k m3 eq container for battleships 200k for battle cruisers 150k for cruisers 100k for destroyers and 50k for frigates if the obelisk and that class can haul station sections there is no reason they should not be able to haul a ship from station to station since you cant access the cargo bay in one of those unless at a stationbase
just found out that one can actually list container contents even when not at the station  rigtclick  show contents  so uhm dont mind me and go on with the thread pand yes already made a post here my most embarassing eve story  why 1 year playing  still newbie
pokes waddup with the mining shiznit homiez
im supporting this also mining is meant to be a very intrical part of the eve universe but as most peeps point out mission runners can make more cash than miners either from the bounties the missions themselves or simply reporcessing the loots and selling off the mins its time for miners and industrialists to get their upgrades the pew pewers have enough stuff make them wait untill 2017 for new gear and ships see how they like it give us some stuff
will the csm ever pick this up d hehe they really need to make a better way for us to track which assembly hall topics have been picked up for vote etc maybe this needs to be changed from a forum to an actual csm solution
yes
bumped for great justice
awesome bump
give it the pg its the big daddy of ships its supposed to be the gallante big hybrid platform give it the pg to run a decent tank and still run 8 big blaster cannons and melt enemys its sad that the abaddon so outclasses it on pg
in ccps latest devblog 
ill just copy my comment from the dev blog threadhow about this have the same bar we have now but below it stick those five coloured buttons and have pressing them set people to the appropriate standing itd let people who dont care set people to 1050510 with one click but leave in the more powerful options for those who actually do care perhaps make the simplified system be whats used for standings set by individuals if you want it to be more intuitive for them but let corps and alliances have the detailed version as an option
hey this does sound quite like the idea i proposed in my blog in one banter
love the phoon its extremely versatile dont know what your problem is try flying a different ship that fills your needs
if you want drone bonuses do like i did and get yourself a sweet ass dominix  silly phoon pilots
noliang
how did that meme go again aah yesu madtyphoon is close to being the most powerful bs due to insanely good slot layout drones and choice of weapon systems  versatility is what makes it uber
not supported
first of all go die in a fire ingame2nd so your saying that you use 5 siege missile launchers and nothing more on a typhoon whats on your 3 left high slots miner iislike me i use 5x dual 650mm ac t2 guns and 3x siege missile launcher iis on my typhoon though but thats because of powergrid issues
this thread is wierd in parts its like reading a missile boost proposal from before qr or somethinganyway i support the addition of more missile types specialised towards higher speed andor flight time at the expense of damage within a specific set ie longer range torps for example i dont particularly support modules being added because of the maximum number of modules that theoretically effect missiles being less than the maximum number of modules that theoretically effect turrets the weapon systems work in different ways with different variables having less variables in one system or the other isnt a disadvantage or an advantage in real terms ergo not a reason for a buff
leave my loki alonebetter gang bonus than a claymore can warp cloaked is immune to bubbles and cant be probed while fleet boostingits perfect as it iscant do anything else however hence the ballance of using a gimped fitnot supported
i would rather see a new probe introduced a probe that when launched is seen across the entire system like a cyno field beacon and that is perishable one time use only additionally it needs to cost lots of iskies to purchase 5 to 10 million isk per the probe when triangulated as the others is able to spit out a warpable point to cloaked and hi sensor ships but if the prey is paying attention the probes are essentially wasted its about time gankers faced some risk when engaging pve ships in this case the risk is in their wallets let the ganker whinage beginnoooooooo1 us gank3rs alredy have enuffs risks sad panda1
balancing around isk is stupid re titansalso cloaks are fine as are unprobable shipsin conclusionyour idea sucks
i actually do agree that noncloaked ships shouldnt ever be 100 unscannable however this proposal is terribly written so im not supporting itimo you should be able to make yourself extremely hard to probe to the point where you need good skillsbonusesimplants to probe you out but never impossible i think thats a reasonable balance if you want 100 immunity to probes get a cloak
how many ships does it apply to apart from the tenguhow many hoops does a person have to jump to achieve itis it foolproof last thread i read about it left a big fat question mark on thatas far as i know a ship fitted to be unprobable is essentially worthless for anything else as it has to expend a ton of slots to do itits only real value is for mission running in pirateinfested space since a bogstandard cloak or covops trumps it hands down in all other scenarioshardly a problem
it is not just the tengu any t3 cruiser with dissolution sequencer subsystem ceptor and some eccms in the midsit is neither fool proof and there are enough occasions where you can catch such peoplefor tortugan it would actually be worth a try if a max skilled prober with faction probes and virtue set could find them
yes its foolproof provided that you dont get painted by rats deploy drones or do something unbelievably stupid and yes you have to jump through hoops but since it makes you invulnerable lots of people will do that im actually not that bothered about the pve setups but you can make unprobeable covopscloaking t3 command ships with 3 bonused ganglinks and an interdiction nullifierwhich is pretty amazingly op
apart from being more mobile what exactly is the difference between the fleet command sitting at a pos and the t3 sitting in a safeboth provide benefits to gang and both are essentially invulnerable or does ganglinks not work inside a shield bubble any moreas stated a nonissue
not to mention these are tech 3s bloody expensive and nothing more than flying neon signs saying shoot meit would be different if there where dozens seen every dayso yes op quit your emoing and go some place else
this is more a problem with gang bonuses being applied from offgrid than unprobable shipswhich is stupid and should be fixed as it has been acknowledged by ccp as a bad mechanic
i dislike the mecanics i cannot see a point in sig strength being divided by sensor strength these values are rather irrelevant to eachother instead i believe the mecanics needs changing for it to be something except for sensor strength plain sig radius would imao

hi therenoticed in a recent patch ccp implemented a timer for plexs when they were 5 days from expiring id like to see this implemented for all methods of payment nothing is worse than logging in to account disabled and not having the rl funds to pay for it at that moment in time it doesnt need to be flashy or intrusive just a simple line on the login screen like where they have the ship youre in etc i feel this would be a useful addition
everyone knows ccp hate factionwar and dont want to feed us anything in the hopes well move to 00 endgame so much for sandbox gamehowever this could be an easy fix that may well rebalance the factions in a meaningful waycurrently in each combatzone an npc ewar imbalance exists which allows one side to capture major complex in a single speed tanked t1 frig while the other side needs a 10 man cruiserbc fleet or logistics to accomplish the same thingi may be wrong but if ewar was completely removed from all fw plex rats would this imbalance not be fixed
i have a dreamof an eve where changing your direction does not involve dragging your mouse around your ship and then double clicking in spaceof an eve where 99 of actions are not performed by a cascade of right click menusof an eve where it doesnt take 10 minutes to setup a new overview because you have to go through the worlds longest set of checkboxesof an eve that allows you to customize your ui so that players can change it to suit their play style or needsof an eve that lets you return to the character select screen instead of forcing you to logout and login againof an eve that quickly provides vital information on modules and ships in their description instead of hidden in a table of attributesi have a dream will you join me
my apologies i musta missed it lol
this is an old old complaint and the devs explained why it doesnt work like this years ago basically it has to do with how they optimize database calls  if they asked is this a copy when they called for item information theyd have to ask that question of every item blueprint or not and that would cause far too much lag without asking that question they cant put different icons on if you want to distinguish them without showing info every time use the blueprints tab in your si interface

i want a t2 or faction tractorsimply because that tech 1 tractor on my vargur ruins its shipfuias for the analyser and hacker shipsi use a panther for that
yes it makes total sense to have to train months for a tech ii battleship that easily cost a bil isk just to get a little extra range for a 1mil isk modulei would even like it if we at least got a 510km extra range for a tech ii tractor beam
im not asking for a god damdamned tractor beam ya tard ass i said salvaging as in gives bonuses to salvaging get it 
agreedbeing able to use the module lvl3 and using it excessively well lvl5 is 2 different thingsyounger players have way more skills to lvl up then us with 100 lvl5 skills already trainedthat change just give them the opportunity to try difefrent facets of the game and perhaps choose a new profession speccing

recapthis is a proposal for the reengineering of railguns and caldari railboats so that they get the following 15 to all railguns damage modifierreduce spike optimal bonus to 70 instead of 8010 to pg output for all caldari railboatsjustificationin order to compare we need to create a baselinefleet bs using fittings that let all 4 bs have an optimal of 180190 optimal 3 damage mods each and a buffer or roughly 14k for a proper benchmark we have all are t2 ammoapoc 372 19333 146k armortemp 370  14072 139k armormega 351  16849 135k armor or mega 312  18358 135k armorrokh 321 19430 139k shieldsniperhacsusing fittings that let all 4 hacs have an optimal of 7090 optimal 3 damage mods each and a buffer or roughly 20k ehp for a proper benchmark we have zealot 299  9313 aurora 21k ehpmunnin 312  8122 tremor 25k ehpdeimos 235  8437 spike 20k ehpeagle 235  7925 uranium 195k ehp1 to reach same range as the rest mega needs to be gimped 2 magstabs2 te and does subpar dps 19 less than apoc and rokh does subpar dps also16 less than apocb if fit the same number of damage mods mega does less dps 75 less than apoc and the rokh is still does less dps 16 less than apoc2 although i am using mega and rokh the ratios hold for the other railboats as well especially hacs although brutix is a bit op i had to pick a number to append to my proposal and i obviously took the average which is 15 further comparison at marauder level i used a paladin with 3 x t2 heatsinks and a kronos with 3x t2 magstabs both firing close range high dps t1 ammo i know that paladins use an multis but kronos pilots cant afford using cn am all the time so i had to make an assumptionpaladin t2 megabeams t1 multis 3 t2 heatsinks 697  30 20km tracking 001914kronos t2 425mms t1 am 3 t2 magstabs 601  36 30km tracking 001653697601 116 116 and that does not take into consideration that the paladin can use tachyons which take it up to 753  3325 tracking 00174after benchmarking the ships it is obvious that the numbers support a 1015 damage increase for railguns the 10 increase for the caldari ships is a subject that has been brought forward quite a few times and it pertains to the fact that in order to fit the same ehp buffer as the rest of the hacs eagle needs 2 fitting mods ferox needs also rcuancillary to fit 250mm rails etccontinued
how will it affect balanceif we apply a 15 increase to rails damage modifier and a 10 pg increase to the eagle we get the followingmunnin 195k ehpt2 720mm arties emp m t1  357 80 from drones dps  2936 2949 volley tracking 004482t2 720mm arties tremor t2  238 dps  8122 1966 volley tracking 000945 eagle 195k ehpt2 250mm rails am t1  325 dps  4720 1138 volley tracking 004967t2 250mm rails uranium t1  270 dps  8629 948 volley tracking 003148 deimos 20k ehpt2 250mm rails am t1  360 dps 158 drone dps  2337 1345 volley tracking 005101t2 250mm rails spike t2  270 dps  8437 948 volley tracking 000825zealot21k ehpt2 heavy beams multifreq t1  448dps  2310 1110 volley tracking 005362t2 heavy beams aurora t2  299dps  9313 740 volley tracking 001031 as far as ranges usedthe operating range of the fleet will be dictated by the least denominator which in this case is the tempest with 14072 km so its optimal  12 fallof 176km you have to balance every bs around that range otherwise your efforts on railguns are null and void pun intended rokh reaches 194 km with spike mega does 183 kms therefore both need no more range what they need is to be able to apply equivalent dps and or alpha with apoc and or tempest at that rangea munnin with 720mm arties no range mod and load tremor m w a lvl 5 pilot has a range of 8122 km doesnt that indicate design rangesniperhacs engage  70100kms fleet bs snipers engage  170200kms if you are going to compare ships and turrets you should first look at them at those ranges when the enemy gang is or you warp in on them you load shortest range highest damage ammo and tracking speed scan resolution scripts and slug it out that is the secondary scenario to be examined fleet support bcs need to be able to hit 70kms with max damage in order to be able to protect the fleet bs the apocalypse does 20 more dps than a ship with a direct 5 per level bonus to its ws i believe that is wrong and needs to be corrected i dont want to see amarr and lasers nerfed since after the projectile boost those two are at the same level however i do want to see railguns be buffed to the level of the rest of the long range turretsspecifically for spike lms if the optimal bonus was reduced to 65  70 while its damage was increased by 15which can be achieved by increasing the gun damage modifier it would balance out and make the rokh eagle deimos ferox brutix cormorant catalyst more usable for sniping while not making the mega and brutix op they would be fighting in falloff with a low tracking ammo which is a concern expressed by many
something like this would greatly improve my eve experience
yes please in this or similar formkrum
this would be an improvement over where we are atmbut its still fairly poor compared to a rof bonusnot sure how to calculate the effectiveness of this in terms of dps equivelentsomewhere around 15 dps for lvl 5 would be my guess

another thing i was discussing just the other day and magically on the front page of the assembly hall when i came here supportedmaybe i skimmed over this detail but i think shared corp bookmarks should be relayed to clients in the same way the current agent mission bookmarks are a little submenu called corp bookmarks that then opens up into whats shared

not exactly a top priority but makes sensesupported
1 the game tibia has a similar type of thing for the game which records keystorkes conversations and everything its a good thing to look at but it does cause some client side lag for the recorder
then go to lowsec or nullsec and fight other people who like to pvp and who might actually beat you wardeccing newbs and industrials in highsec is not pvp its just a cheap cowards trick  shooting fish in a barrel
u mad
ill support that enthusiastically when i get that mining dec i mentioned beforeremember people pay real world money to play this game it should not be possible for griefers to leave them no options but to pay for a game they cannot actually play
i didnt realize ccp added a feature to wardecs where people who get wardecced arent allowed to log in at all thats a p chill feature
removing the option to leave a wardecced corp is forcing people who have no interest in combat and who have not trained combat skills to pay to not play stuck in station unable to do anything that you are paying real world money to do is the same as not being able to log on at all
exactly people are paying real money in order to play a game by allowing corps to grief newer players in high sec such as station camping people are paying money to not play the game now ccp could give money back to players who cant do anything during a wardec but they wonso making wars system based would be better that way would be like fighting over recources but war deccing many corps over one system would be unrealilistic so it would be between just a few corps of corse you coud pay more for more systems but each one gets more expensive this way newer people can get out while people who want to pvp can
jumpin jehosaphat just drop corp you and your buddies make up a new corp and every day a new dec comes in drop corp to one of your other holding corps hell disband corps and make new ones stop asking for something that already exists in game and is supported by ccp jesus
this is an example of people who need to be a little more mature instead of just instantly dismissing issues look at it from the other persons side
its not that hes being immature its more along the lines of oh crap not this again havent they got the message alreadywhat the people here are trying to say is that the mechanics to avoid war or deal with it are already there you simply have to learn about and take advantage of it rather than ask that the mechanics be changednow i personally do not support this proposal the whole reason i like this game is for its pvp element an element that the ccp devs have time and time again stated that they strive to perfect now is it perfect as is hardly but there in lies the challenge in making a game that is geared towards forcing player confrontation one way or another and making it so that new players are not at a complete disadvantageif someone declares war on you rather than  and moan you should weigh you options  do you move operations to another part of the cluster a lot of people myself included are lazy and will not pursue targets if they too far away do you jump into t1 frigates and cruisers and lay some hurt on them protip many war decs will end when the aggressing corps isk efficiency dives so while you may lose 5 or even 10 t1 fitted t1 cruisers if focus your fire on their expensive stuff and pop it you win do you jump corp self explanatory do you hibernate stay in station play the market and be as boring as possible stop talking back to your aggressers talking gives them more resolve with which to keep their hunt goingso its not that we dont see your point of view its more that weve been there weve clawed our way through now its your turnedit grammaredit2 spelling
i was unaware that it stopped you from pausing training on that character and rolling an alt in an npc corp sure it may suck but you can still play the gameface it your i cant play so dont let them wardec me argument is bull and everyone here including you knows it

bagehi  thank you so much for proving to us that the art of bullting is not lost on pvpersi havent laughed that hard in a long timewhats ridiculous is your bold faced enough to actually argue something that is obviously wrong and falseive known many many industrialist corporations and they dont even pull some of the crap you even claimed to doonly corporations that do that are greifing pvpers pvpers dont like industry and only go so far as to make sure they have enough isk to do whatever it is they want to do i know very few who are actually good at both things as it iswhat you claimed are very if at all rare incidents and only possible when your corporation just happens to have a capable and good enough pvp force that or you used a second corporation or hired a merc live everyone elseplease give it up we can see right through youindustrialists dont have time to gank freighters what the heck kind of argument is thatyou have any idea how much firepower and effort it takes to gank a freightersure as hell wont be in a wardec unless the other corproation is really that stupidand sad to say ive seen some but even then everyone knows its stupid to drag a freighter out in a war dec duhwe dont have time to wardec because someone stole our omber beltthere are hundreds upon hundreds of asteroids out there they just move on to a different systemor move outhonestly why do people keep this tripe upwardecs are not a personal thing please grow up stop using childish reasoning for oncewardecs are broken but nerfing them or buffing them is a waste of time because it ends up unbalancing the whole systemmy personal issue is the asshats who come up with stupid arguments
how did i miss this thread i particularly love this little gem
less than two days after the third wardec in one month ended we received another wardeclessons learned staying docked is not a feasible strategy because it means i will stay docked for more than 80 of the time hiring a merc corp is not a feasible strategy because at this rate the corp will be broke very soon fighting is not a feasible strategy because it means i will have to fight for more than 80 of my time and cannot play the game the way i want to disbandling the corp and create another one is not a feasible strategy because than we would have to do that once every week wardeccing is effectively making it impossible to run this corpwardeccing is broken fix it or get rid of itgwabakk
join an alliance
you forgot onewhining on the forums wont work nobody cares about you
how are you getting these wardecs send them to mebut seriously youre doing something to catch peoples ire you or someone in your corp is probably doing something to draw unnecessary attention ie screaming in local saying that the people that flipped them are idiots greifers and have no life etc hence all the war decsanother protrip pods instawarp you can escape station that way
as someone who started out eve somewhat highsec focussed  5 years ago i thought abolishing war declarations were a stupid idea and i still feel that way today we still do quite a lot of well everything really industry included and i think war declarations are very positive even when they do occasionally make our lives a little less convenient its really very simple  theres a lot of mediocre corps in eve i mean the kind that someone joins unsuspectingly and somehow eve turns all boring and they quit these i call failcorps and theyre usually the kind of corp that do a bit of everything and whine when something isnt ultra convenient for them the war declaration mechanism filters these corps out by encouraging the players in them to take the initiative to sharpen up and fight back or to sharpen up and evade the war or just accept that they are a failcorp and go join a corp that isnt pathetic and find they dont have a problem any more case in point your best option here is to accept that you havent got what it takes to run your own corp there are any number of real corps out there who would happily accept a member whos a wardec magnet because  well its a free war chances are though youd see no sign of a war declaration
i agree there is no way you are randomly getting war decced like thislikely cause here is someone running their mouth as that tends to be about 90 of the reasons why war decs happen to a corp like yours either that or someone has a big wallet and a bone to pick with you for some other reason pvp corps dont like station camping anymore than you do anyone doing it for economic purposes normally tells you why they are doing it so someone is paying them to grief you one of your corp m8s is bringing this on you or you are incredibly unlucky
the problem is while there are many fail corps there are legitimate start upsshadow cadre is was still is one of these corpswe are a small and financially poor at best most of our assets are in the ships we just barely are able to affordwe cant generate income or bother to mine or manufacture because we get wardecd every fing time we turn aroundand we dont do a damn thing we dont smacktalk i instakick anyone who does pretty muchwe dont attract attention and we sure as hell dont compete as we have nothing to compete withall we get is oh we saw you flying a battlecruiser and they wardec youwardecs target easy preythey never target anyone who is bigger or stronger than you arewith the exception of addicts that are few and far between of course been reading the taxman from the irsgreat writingbasically we just wanted to mind our own boring mediocre business our intention from the start was to get wealthy enough to be able to strike it out on our own in 00 or whsbut due to the wardec crap we always end up jumping from alliance to alliance ultimately we ended up living in 00 and at least here we can do what we want and not worry too much about getting harassed not that we dont but at least we got some good friends out here who are bloodthirsty enough to handle that problemagain im agianst wardecs on principle but removing them is a mistakeim not foolish enough to say that they should be removed all together then high sec would grow out of controlbut something has to be done to balance it out for the small time corps starting up and for the epic fail corps who smack talk out that needs to be crushedif you dont get a solution to that problem in whatever changes are wrought you will run into a total chaos problem scaring off new players or a status quo where things get staleas it is shadow cadre will never have a corp in high sec we will be npc because of that threatmost of our membership are too busy to deal with pvp crap we have only a scant few hours to play and thats thati post often because my job is boring but wont allow eve time  o p sucks to be me
yes to parts t2 bpos should be phased out or put back in but with their own advantages and disadvantages how to do this i dont knowimo the reason they should be removed is that they are like isk machines not uber fast 1bil per minute but a decent return on an investment the problem is other than losing the bpo little risk the t2 bpo price wont drop so your equity is the same or increasing from profitis better to deal with this now before they are 100bil each and if u decide to remove them have an massive outrage from players
are you stupid they are only cost so much because players value them at those figures if you knew anything youd know that they are valued on potential profit over a certain amount of time given current prices something like 46 yearsop terrible idea been brought up before and with same resultsas others have stated invention  t2 bpo
the links presented seem to deal with the issue of quantity produced quite well but not the issue of profitability per unit especially for bpcs of ships which only yield 1 run and even though the bpc inventors may dictate market value bpo holders should still beat them as far as percentage of profit at the same prices though the amount may be less since quantity produced is essentially bottlenecked as noted above that aside the bpos are something shiny and i like shiny unless stronger arguments can be presented not supported
well i did not expect any bpo owner to support it anymore than i expect a turkey to vote for christmas at least one of them was honest and talks about wanting to collect shiny objectsi have no time for responding to juvenile ad hominem attacks as for the more serious arguments concentrating only on demandled highvolume items does not tell the whole storyi doubt that all of you believe that either i see some stories there about how peoples greater invention profits have financed their t2 bpos why are you buying them since they are making you a comparative lossif they are collectors items why are they priced on a threefour year roi real collectors items are not priced that way neither in eve nor anywhere else in the world anyway  the arguments are irrelevant either this post will be supported or it will not thats all there is to it
care to explain that
just do it already
sounds reasonable
i would admit that its stupid that t2 bpos are around because they control the market however how do you plan on reimbursing the people who have them you do realize those bpos are like an investment and are valued almost as priceless some people pay 30 to 50billion for one bpo and thats only for the ty ones its in the game till its gone deal with it its tough but they cant just get rid of something so valuable thats hurting the player who has it if you really want the market to be fixed then why dont you ask for the removal of alt accounts no more daul screening or dual boxing have a person only run one account at the same time mineral prices would go up helping miners and so would the prices for modules that doesnt hurt anyone as much as that bpo because you can still use your account just not at the same timemy 2 cents are no it does suck and it is basically huge lump sum of free money but their isnt a way for ccp to replace the value of something that can make infinite amounts of money
i like the idea of making invented t2 bpcs non give them a decent default mepe before anything else is taken into account

only if the quantity traded is so small that the bpo can cover all the demand to use interceptors as an example most if not all of the raptors are made from bpo while a large number of the crow are made from bpc the raptor is noticeably inferior to the crow so inventors that can choose will produce the crow and sell for a larger sum owners of a raptor bpo that have to produce the raptor or not use the bpo will still produce it if ccp would remove the t2 bpo the raptor will still be a worse ship will still have a production cost near that of a crow and will still sell for less so there will not be more people inventing raptors simply they would almost disappear from the gamesimilarly for modules with little use we would see meta 4 or low cost faction variants replace the t2 as there will still be no gain in inventing them while i would like to see the invented bpc reflect a fraction of the research present on the t1 bpc as it will reward people working to get a better t1 original it will not really change the profit of inventors simply the item price will be pushed down by the high number of inventors with researched t1 bpo and the new researchers would have a harder time before getting some profit
i would like to add ofcource that alpha centauri might not be the best possible example of binary system as third component proxima centauri or component c is at bit extreme range from others 12 000 au is approx 02 lightyears as im not specialized in astrophysics then i do not know what is the average distance between binary stars but i would speculate that is somewhere around 20 to 200 au or so usually in eve the real number is not that important as ccp is in control of the eve galaxy and thus almost any number between 10 and few thousand aus might be believeable the habitable zone zone where liquid water can exsist is for almost all stars relatively close to the star tho somewhere from 05 au for really small ones up to 3 or perhaps even 4 au for really hot ones hot ones have ofc some problems as far as evolving life goes like their relatively short lifespans and some very energetic processes in the evolution of that massive stars as far as distribution of planet types goes tho as mentioned before relatively simple and robust atmospheric model would be sufficent to get consistent planetary types plasma planets can be explained by throwing some exotic material into the atmosphere and lava planets are also possible in the younger starsystems or following some violent events like collision of two smaller planets afterall you do not need a lot of parameters for it  a distance from the star composition of initial gas cloud or just flat out atmospheric composition of the planet and mass of the planet would give you aready pretty good picture what to expect ie what gases can the planet keep and can there be greenhouse effect polar ice caps would need ofc a bit more sophiscated model anyway  actual accuracy of model is not as relevant as getting consistent results for best results ofc it would be uber if they would hire someone from astrophyciks or atmospheric physics field as consultant for planetary overahul but if they dont want then giving someone in the company with masters degree in the field of rigid sciences a week to google around and wrap their head around what is done and known would give also pretty good model i think
and correct the fact that they dont orbit their respective stars and correct the fact that moons dont orbit their planets and correct the fact that gates in the middle of nowhere dont orbit anythingitd certainly make bookmarks more interesting
yeah i agree each little step though

i was trying to sort my corp not this character into respective wings so we could do payouts based on wing performance the concept was that i would assign each corpie to a wing and set an active wallet to them basically thier bounties etc would then run from that wing however i cant do that at all i suspect that this may be shot down in flames as something that doesnt return anything to the masses however from a corp managment point of view it is one i would love to see
i think i understand what youre saying and it seems like it could be a good idea but you really need to actually make it into a coherent idea plan it possibly mock it up then post it
ive taken time to think thoroughly about this proposal as i did some scanning and i cant support itmoving the probes into the optimum positions around a contact is the major player skillset involved in actually doing scanning its what makes one player better at it than anothertake the player out of the scanning and you might as well just add the wormholes and sites to the overview to begin withjust as some people are better at combat than others and some people are better at playing the market than others some people are better at handling their probes than others that skill should be allowed to make a difference rather than having the process automated
thats like saying learn to buy instas when wtz was introducedpeople know how to scan people dont like meticulously positioning their probes so painstakingly not that it wasnt harder beforerefrain from comments that make you look dumb in the futuresupported
well i agree with mynxee but its a bit more than what i personally want i only use one pattern and i dont need to save it but ccp did promise us you could have the probes move closer and further apart when resizing them so that the pattern would stay the same they said that at fanfest  its on youtube even and ive been drooling over that idea ever since ccp can i haz the shiny toy now  pleeeeeeese  signed
as people have said over and over frustrating the player with a flawed mechanic system isnt a clever method of applying game balance the ease or difficulty of probing is something that should be determined by character and player skills not by having to fight against your mouse to manhandle probes around in a horrible clunky interface
dont know if this would be possible to implement but it would be really great to have
this would save me so much work ofcourse it would make macroexploration easier toostill support
im in
wow i came here to look for something unrelated and found something i was talking about just the other day i also use several different probe arrangements depending on the size of the system number of sigs strength of sigs etc and would love to be able to switch between them more easilyi also agree with limiting it to core probes part of being a good combat scanner is being able to operate quickly and minimise the duration your probes are visible for having quick patterns to automatically arrange your probes will put your victims at a distinct disadvantage
rubbish idea
excellent idea the obvious solution to the salvage theft problem
this clearly wont be gamebreakingly abused
great idea
very good ideai also have had to deal with the hassle of trying to fit things in freighters and even orcas i would like to see this idea brought into the game practical and well thought idea lisa waen

actually i was being serious as i read those figures i saw kilometers rather than metersin any event i do support your proposal

supported to allow the proper calculation of the value of a kill implants listed as destroyed items in pod killmails please
that is one of the listed ideas i had posted have 510 differnt skins for each ship and let the players chose which one they want the thing you people dont understand is the server allready does this t1 and t2 ships have differnt paints hell there are even more then 1 paint for t2 ships depending on what roll they serve compair the navy megathron compaired to a t2 megathron the server allready has to tell your computer which one to load the only differnce would be how long it takes your computer to processes the data and load the correct texture from your hard drive and like i have said before in older posts ccp can expand their servers or buy new ones to support new features they are allready doing it for when they release walking in stations specialy for walking in stations have 1 server for models and textures 1 server for accounts 1 server to handle the systems and 1 server to handle walking in stations problem solved hell if you dont want that many servers 1 server for shipstexturesaccountswalking 1 and the current one for systemslike maxsim goratiev said we dont really know how much lag this will cause we can only make educated guesses so push this though to the test server and if it lags that server enough we will drop it if it causes no noticable ammount of lag then we will continue testing or push it though you people arent even giving it a chance at all for those of you who arent supporting sorry if you dont want to see pink megathrons that is why we put an option in to turn custom paint off so you dont have to see it if you dont want toand like bagehi said the ammount of data if his calculations are right is horribly small im downloading at about 200 kb per second on dsl meaning i single handedly can download enough data to color 16000 ships at the same time it takes you to blink and i know the server can put out 100 times that easily what i can download cause it was made to
it should have 847 slot at least those who say it makes it nothing more than a megathron screw you thats like saying an abaddon is nothing more than a apocalypse with its 847 slots the megathron has better tracking but the hyperion is a better tanker and deals better potential dps the hyperion definitely need an increase in powergrid and perhaps in cpu it has the same powergrid as the mega but it needs more to fit all its gunsits meant to deal damage and tank at the same time just like all other tier 3 battleships
alright lets compare it with maestorm after fitting 8 higest caliber autocannons on the maelstorm we have nearly 10000 gigawats left when compared to pitiful amount of powergrid hyperion has left its jsut insane a 4times difference and by the way shieldtanks dont really need too much powergrid maelstorm has more powergrid and more cpu then the hyperion its just embarrassing it even has the dame dronebay and the maximum tank it can achieve is higher
plain and simple an option to not just oclude the sun but to turn it off all together in solar systems more or less blocking it from view or at the very least sunglasses mode to where you can dim it because i know im not the only one who is annoyed by it p

do not remove the ability to set standings to npc corpswhy is usable functionality being removed
agreed when i read the post i was already thinking about this sort of thing and although not being in 00 yet emphasis  were looking for a good alliance to join but i can see where it comes in handy to have the real numbers but maybe the decimals are not needed and thus can be refined into a 110 integers corresponding with their negative counterparts of course and translating this new number system without decimals into a more broad color scheme
supportatm i see ally reds corp reds and my private redslooking at the standing i can guess which one it is and why is that person red eg 11  i dont like his bio 18  he is fun to kill 13  ninjalooter and so on 17  needs to be traced on common ship etc etc i know about notes and use them as wellshould i remember all that folks by names no thank youdoes anybody like those colour squares that much fine why not add them to the existing system just like a shortcut to 10 5 0 5 10 positionseve is not a plain game to play but heck i think nobody wants it to be one
agreedif some ppl want to have a simple standing system  they already can set 10 5 0 5 10 and see 5 color squarei want to can set 7 1 1 3 etc
yes
dunno it looks like this is more a lag issue than a usability issue  it reduce to two bits the standing poll from 8 bits in a big fight it could have quite an impact more from a database polling side than a bandwidth sidemaybe replace the finer grained standing with better notes like adding corp condivided notesally condivided notes obv with rules to prevent spamming about playercorpally
at the very least there should be 7 increments not 5 7 and 5 both take 3 bits to store
i support my own proposal of course
lets face it most groups use the 1050510 system because that how many icons there areif doing this change makes things less laggy then i am all for ithowever as has been pointed out you could have 7 options with 3 bits which you also need for 5 i think they could either a go with 4 options 100510  think about it if they are 5 or 10 you are still going to shoot them or b have 7 options possibly with another set of 2 iconswithout too much troubleedit not supported because there is no difference between 2 and 3 standing for players and lag is bad
supportedcurrently it has the ability to be complex or simple doesnt matter how many use itif its a lag issue then yes simplify it but dont do it to the point of nerfing the ability to use its ability to trackibfgitridofnapsnao

if that is why everyone joined eve then why does the vast majority of people actually playing eve live happily in highsec completely unaware and uncaring of 0 and its politics when i joined eve 0 alliances and such were a sparkle in someones pants some wherethat being said i agree to an extent its hard to understand why the slider is going away in favor of a far simpler system as it sits now it has 200 variables so would changing that to 5 seems oversimplification for any reason unless it has to do with the nature of incoming mechanics that are being kept under wraps if its a load issue then wouldnt 10 or 20 largely accomplish the same reduction in load while allowing 0 politics to continue virtually unaffectedas of now we dont understand why its changing we dont need to know the exact reason but in this case i think many of us would be willing to sacrifice a little less performance for a little more functionality

providence is a region outside the concord protectorat 00 in past many pirates gang living here but the region was conquiered and civilized since this time all unknow pilote was welcome if not hostile for 1 month against all authorities alliance help ushra khan to down the civilisation and wan close the region if their win this goal a and uk have 2 large region and the darkness run on the galaxy if providence falls it would be accept reign of no tolerance and dictatorships are we unable to build a humanist society without concord we need help quiclychannel public stellar revolution
i fully support this proposition and or service and suggest ccp act upon it right nowwhat say you csmstamp out the evil that is umm well me actually
seriously   rofl  we are not bringing the darkness we are liberating that region from the grip of tyranny and false prophets we are taking back what is ours while at the same time freeing the spirits of hypocrites to go back to their creator for judgment but yeah all jokes aside we love all the carebears and their tears and it will be sad to see them go who knows maybe they will actually end up learning to play the game for a change  but im not worried because theres plenty of them to be had around new eden so not all is lost even if they do leave providence
first off we speak english heresecondly this is the wrong forum for thisthirdly reported o p
with me brave god fearing fellows see the godles heathens yonder it is our duty nay our privelage to rise up and strike them down with the laz0r we shall flay them with the missile and the drone we shall blast them with the thermal and the kinetic and em we shallt smite their unholy and blasphemous formsfor the emprahoh sorry wrong game not supported lol
ok so this is just the start of a proposal i dont know if theres anything similar on the forums as i havent kept track of it for a couple of months i also dont have an actual solution its more like a problem id like to raisewhen dominion was released we were told that the new sov mechanics would transform null sec life from pos bashing to actual fleet fighting weve seen some of that but theres still some work to be done the problem is you still have to take structures down and you still have a number of timers you need to follow and thats not a problem in itself if people show up for a fight but if they dont it means you just have to sit there for hours on end staring at the screen hoping for something to happenthe best example of this is what is happening in providence weve had a few instances where nobody showed to defend the system and we still had to go through all the timers to take down the station and everythingso long story short my proposal is to make it somehow important for people to show up and defend their system i have 2 ideas for this and more are welcomedfirst idea would be to cut the reinforced stages if nobody shows up to defend the thing when one timer runs out a way to implement that would be to introduce fuels for the reinforce stages so that the defenders have to refuel the structure when it comes out of reinforced for the next cycle to kick in a problem with this would be ninja fueling so im not convinced its the best solution but maybe some of you could come up with something betteranother way would be to give the defenders an economic incentive for example they could be asked to pay more for the system if the station is in reinforced and maybe the price could be raise for each stage this way the defenders would actually care about each reinforce timer this would also allow for other tactics like going around and putting things into reinforced without taking the system just to bleed the isk out of the defenders i know some of you might feel doing this would be unfair but the idea is that if you cant defend a system you shouldnt keep it please let me know what you guys think
actually i am the one to provide concrete numbers the railgun issue has been put to vote by csm and was dropped because they did not have a specific proposal therefore i put one up with numbers data and logical justification also it has more support and views than most of the other issues mentionedfinally it affects more than 50 of the eve populace and half the issues concerning gallente and caldari are tied to underperforming weapon systems especially hybrids it is of concern to both pvp and pve pilots so i think it is of interest for more people than this listfluffmake afterburners redremove or redesign sensor boosting visualscorp logos on ships more weapon upgrade modules for missilesbuff destroyersthe retribution  aka beating the dead horseadd faction deadspace officer tags to module iconskillright pilots on overviewbut of course it is more important to fix the vindicator for the 50 people that fly that ship than fixing rockets or railguns so whatever i am not going to fight it going to go train amarr or whatever fotm and stop trying to contributeyou deserve yourself
yeah i like this idea keep it around
my proposal is to bring back a character that need the isk to be send too at character sales its too easy now too scam and sell the character
what what whatmore info please
can flippers are usually jerks looking to cause a fight then they let concord do the fighting for the  i say if you loot a named jetcan from say a miner as soon as you loot it concord should show up and do their job they are the police right and theft is a crime correct implement this action and it will stop can flipping and make them earn their own ore or items the perpetrators are just being asses and looking for trouble or just doing it to harrass people so let concord stop it once and for all

allow a type of sovernty to be claimed over whole space called exploration rights this would allow a corp based in wspace to upgrade its system to produce more gravimetric ladar sleeper sights ect posibly allowing the construction of a station in system maby a new type of station that dosent require sovernty my reason for this idea is i am tired of collapsing whole after whole to find bare systems and tiered of waiting a entire week to throw down a minning opertion with my corp mates anyone wanna take this idea and run with it
no
no
possibly allow a wh specific structure that could grant bonuses like the upgrades do rather than get sov these structures should only relate to the spawning of sites and ideally should not be specific to a corp ie if thier fuel runs out someone else can nick it likewise if the anchoring corp is forced out the new wh owners can retain these structuressov in whs nope if you want sov stations and moon goo go rent from an alliance
heyno
hey wow this is a great ideawait no no it isnt
this thread is bad and you should feel bad
6 posts against0 arguments
wh space doesnt allow claiming sov on purpose so he basically killed his own proposal when he suggested holding sov in wh space not our fault
durf derp hyuckccp says no therefore no argument needed o poh and no
noone bothers to read carfully anymore im am not advocating full 00 style sov in wspace i am advocating a upgrade system for wspace but appearantly there is somthing wrong with being able to make the system you reside in beter

lets just create a server where botters and macroers can do whatever they want and not get banned or attacked anywhere this would solve a lot of posts in the assembly hall
no if anything ccp should remove pos from whsbetter yet would be to add sleeper fleets to attack pos some would fall ingthe deflatable category and some would be a challenge and others would destroy anything you could put up to fight back
nice trollwhs is fine leave it be
thats the worst argument you can have honestly and nomaximum allowable is a structure anhorable at pos that would have some supplementary function that slightly improve wormhole but nothing like what we have in sov space we do not whant to encourange people to barricade in a wormhole what would be tolerable is to make it a valid place to stay in for slightly biggerr corps so say anhuorable structure that gives 3050 more sites of a chosen type and can neither be stacked with itself nor with other types of such structure could be interesting but that is it
ccp whisper  for crying out loud how much clearer do i have to beif you dont like what you have then you go to a larger class wormhole spaceccp doesnt want you to stay put so you should move to a new spotwhs systems can last upwards to a month if not moreif thats not enough then your doing something wrongthere is an entire science to wormhole space learn that science and you wont have much to worry about
i too want higher t3 prices
thats not interesting its stupidwormhole space is for explorers go ing explore
i know im just another in a long line of topics but i feel that im looking at it in a different way than the several threads i have been reading i think insurance should be simplified not complicatedinsurance should only cover 5080 what you paid on market for the ship in question ie what you specifically paid this of course doesnt cover trading or manufacturing i think it should simply be the average regional price at the time it was traded or manufacturedabove i mentioned covering 5080  of what you paid this can be split into the three options currently available1 regular 502 gold 653 platinum 80from a programming point all of this information is readily available to grab and storei think that this would encourage people to use insurance when ships are expensive and prevent people for exploiting it when they are cheapim open to any constructive criticism notice the constructivecheers
not supportedat this point its a waste of time to offer anything inbetween the minimum and the maxid rather go with all or nothingand yes your repeating the same bloody idea for the nth time just different amounts
proposal sticking random capital letters in threads should be mandatory
lol 
i must have missed some threads all the ones i have seen want some complex average of manufacturing minerals divided by x y z costs and taxes add nosiumim not apposed to putting insurance at 100 but for me i feel that it defeats the purpose of a penalty plus what insurance company ever gives you everything owed for somethingcheers
so i should be able to insure a shuttle for a billion isk because that is what i bought it foryou seem to think that this cannot be manipluted again it is entirely possible to bring the average price up far beyond what is reasonable stock pile shuttles pump up the regional average for a few weeks then go on a selfdestruction spreeyour idea would make things far worse than you can imagine
id settle for 1 of the 2 optionseither remove the insurance system completely from anyone but real newbie players no more than 4 months oldor adapt american health insurance system in eveincrease premiums 2x for starters and by 10 every yearno insurance for people with the preexisting condition of negative security status or empire warinsurance can deny coverage in cases such as concord death self destruct or certain types of stupid deathsa minimum of 1 million deductible is appliedpremiums increase additional 20 after each ship death
you also have to wait for weeks for your insurance payout and only then after you contact a gm and chew there asses out royally about the delay
concord shouldnt let you store your ship anywhere thats for sureother than that docking anything in a ship maintenance bay without any other sort of restriction is wai
doesnt take a lot of thinking to figure out ways to abuse this
as youre not very bright ill quote you a factedit supported
concord kills me when i suicide gank dont let anyone else get away with it
its 10 days but yes i definitely support this if youre worried about people being freaked out by an expiry notice when their account is going to be renewed automatically then just put a note about automatic renewal right next to it
i dont get alot of money and its a case of being able to know when i need to start getting cash together again broken back means im on disability
i was wondering if eve could implement 2 ideas i had1 a way to color code pilots in your corp chat like a way to give their portraits a different color background this would help organize certain levels of pilots just really an idea like a corp who has combat and miners this way you can color cordinate who can do what without having to ask a billion people same thing with alliance chat i guess2 a corporation merger ability if one corp decides to merge with another one i know some of you will say alliance but not an alliance more like everyone from that one corp is merged into the other corp all the pilots are transfered over without having to individually wait for every member to do so you could put a timer on this if need be to fix exploiting 48 hours or what not decision is made by ceo of the corporation corp b merges with corp a and all pilots from corp b are now in corp ajust an idea or thought doesnt really change any real game mechanics just helps out with organization really
as a ceo or director of a corporation i should be able to modify any of the market buy or sell orders currently active perhaps even the contracts outstandingin a corporation with several corporate traders and alts of traders its very frustrating for me to have to fly my own alt halfway across the universe to modify an order i setup myself on another toonof course the required skills would be involved and perhaps move the order into your stack if youve modified them so youd need an open order available to do so but otherwise i dont see why i wouldnt be able to change the price on something my corporation is buying or selling its my corporation i should be able to change prices on a whimthanks for reading
current situation if someone hypothetically speaking has a crazy corpmate who lets a tower run itself out of fuel and plans to pick it up later and one chooses to clean up their friends mess one has a bit of a problem it seems that one cant unanchor a tower when theres structures anchored around it and one cant unanchor structures around a tower without said tower being online thus one would need to fuel ones hypothetical crazy friends tower and turn it on in order to be able to clean it up which is at least one step too many proposed solution either make it so that the tower doesnt have to be online to unanchor structures around it or make it so that you can just abandon the structures around a tower if you want totheyll work the same way as they do when a tower blows up of these i think the first is preferable  its a smaller change and less likely to make something stupid happen benefits less stupid hoops to jump through drawbacks ccp might have to mess with pos code
sure although every proposal involving poses just screams rework from ground up
op lacks content thread locked
i would like to propose a new system wherein combat drones of an identical type can be grouped into one logical drone swarm the swarm would have identical stats to the type of drone it would be associated with but with a few caveats1 damage multiplier is multiplied by the amount of active or intact drones in the swarm2 when damage is received it is applied to a drone at random this goes for rr as well3 ewar would apply to all drones as they are a collective unitallowing a player to form a swarm would remove a large portion of lag overhead make it so the terrible drone ai doesnt matter as much all without significantly modifying balancethis is a generalized concept though it is one that is worth exploring imo please discuss
wouldnt that mean you could rr one drone and is would heal all of them or somthingi see what your doing needs refining imo
i think he means the rr is applied at random rather and i even being gallente proud can not agree with this because it would cause all kinds of problems and drones already act in this fashion more or less anyways
see them herefurther and more publication will be done next week with a devblog and more
excellent news thanks for the fast turnaround
ive been so happy with the level of communication and timely minutes publication associated with this csm great job csm4 and ccp thanks a tonedit just read the minutes very impressed with the quality of communication that seems to have happened in that meeting and omfg i lold at the low sec sandbox comment
thanks for posting been waiting for some infowish i was there me whistles read the minutes most of the topics have been hashed out one way or another on the forum so to avoid writing a novel i will pass on commenting on them the one thing that did stand out to me was the change of the csm term from 6 months to one year and removal of term limits if the csm goes to a one year term i would suggest having the november election as the starting point that would do 2 things it would reduce the free trip to fanfest csm interest it would also allow the csm to have 11 months of experience under their belts when they are at fanfest it my help show the csm in a better light to the player base not making my point very clear here but i think people can understand what i am getting atwith a 1 year term i see no problem sticking to a 2 year term limit it would be more then enough time for one player to hold the position both from an influence as well as an experience perspective while alliances that provide voting blocks break up over time the players that are in those alliances do not it is at its core bob with some new faces soldrakbansoldrakbansolo is the same old goons the names may change but the voting blocks does not the 2 term limit with terms being 6 months was a but much a csm is really getting into the groove when they are forced out tbh we see this in the california state legislature politics 2 terms 2 years each term a 2 term limit of a year for each term is more then enough
the final paragraph was the most significant imo tangible evidence of ccps satisfaction with the csm
its taken some time and after the hideous failure of the first csm a lot of ground has been made upthe csm is looking very promising now
point 1 nice to see prompt communication of the minutes this is a real improvementpoint 2 disappointed to see so little commentary on issues from previous csms  one sentence saying they were reviewed not terribly substantial edit on rereading theres to be a devblog on the status of these issues ok coolpoint 3 projectile guns seemed more powerful than others i will find out who it was that made this claim i will hunt you down then find everyone and thing that you love and destroy them slowly before your eyes then ill go to work on you your agony and suffering will be beyond comprehensionin game
good stuff nice to see them up promptly this time although some of the stuff in the discussion makes me a bit
i approve of this
destroyers yayfaction warfare bugfixes dont just say bugfixing is a high priority give us a timeframe even a rough one make using them in the meantime petitionable keep the communication open commitand show itfaction warfare long term those of us who play and desire to enjoy fw do not like being effectively considered second class citizens vs 00 players goes hand in hand with other lowsec pursuits
this csm seems extremely pointless do these people have any constructive ideas on how to improve eve or are they just a pack of whiners ccps ideas presented to the csm would do more to freshen up the game but the csm seemed to poohpooh the best ideas in order to whine that they cant deploy doomsday attacks in lowsec wow just what the playerbase is clamoring for the above are fantastic ideas that would screw over boring and pointless station docking games hopefully ccp doesnt take this csm too seriously if all theyre going to do is bring little to the table other than a lack of vision
maybe you should read all of it
this post seems extremely pointless does the poster have any constructive ideas on how to improve the csm or is he just a whineroh the irony anyway moving on we presented many ideas to ccp and had lots of constructive debate with them along with a couple of people complaining about dominion and sov and if you actually read the footnote and the discussion the next day then youd see we supported it in principle the lowsec dd thing only came up for a few minutes if you really think that was all that was discussed when only 3 of the csm even have titans then you need to get a gripthere were also many other things discussed which are still under nda yes that is terribly convenient i appreciate that many people think we all run for csm for the free trips to iceland but if you look at the meeting minutes from csm4 youll see that many of us actually take it seriouslybut im wasting my time because it is clear you have written us off already
aww man youve wasted so much pixels on that guy p
i did that it took you an entire day to go oh hey thats a good idea isnt a credit to you at allif you want suggestions to improve the csm theres an easy one set up a better voting system so people like myself can vote in individuals who actually have fresh ideas rather than wah i want to fire doomsdays in low sec
you dont know the circumstances the minutes only tell so much and its the end result that counts several people were heavily in favour from the start myself included others were less convinced but after we had had more time to discuss the possible implications we reached an agreement on it on the subject of lowsec dds again this had a bit more discussion and going back and forth than the minutes show csm agreed that it would spark conflict in lowsec and result in many pretty explosions in the sky and possible epic battles over caught titans if you think we are just looking for cheap ganks you are obviously unfamiliar with the mechanics of the new ddalso stop whining
so you want a csm who just accept whatever ideas ccp suggest there and then without giving more than 5 mins thought about the outcome with something as core as docking in stationreallyconsidering the reaction on other forums to the idea is of utter horror i think us spending time discussing it properly is justifiedpoint to the person on the csm who ran on the campaign of lowsec ddsoh wait you cant because nobody did and isnt that a new and fresh idea considering it isnt available in game now seriously please continue to base your entire opinion of the csm on a 5 min discussion in one of the 7 hour meeting sessions when somebody suggested lowsec dds could be interestingim glad we have people on the csm who know enough about game mechanics to not simply rush into a new shiny idea without thinking of the consequences
id like a csm that brought interesting ideas like that to the table period that you hadnt considered such ideas prior to the meeting is the condemnation in all of the minutes posted most of the csm said tidbits were you guys whining that you should have more power and you should be listened to more which is fine and dandy had you brought any interesting ideas up in the minutes to warrant such attention there wasnt one fresh idea brought up by the csm in those minutes just mostly whining about dominion and lag which anyone can get on the forums from the unwashed masses what few suggestions offered by the csm were merely small changes that would benefit 01 of the playerbase im glad ccp is reaching out to the player base in order to test out new ideas its just too bad the chosen players dont seem acute enough to actually have any of their own thus far hopefully that changes and you guys actually do some work
u madi think losec dd would be great
i too am wtfsurprised by the numbers though it is no doubt in fact a classic case of a vocal minority of luddites and doomsayers do not listen to them ccpa couple of pointsincarna is unlikely to compete for resources with core mechanics projects since it is 90 art and design and maybe 10 programming it can be developped alongside more essential mechanics without hindering them to any significant degree whatsoeverthe expansion will attract new demographics most of whom will also be active outside the stations that means more players a bigger and more vibrant economy more workers for corps more targets for pirates more everything the kinds of nonevecompatible players the naysayers are worried about will not last past the trial period oh and it also means more cash for ccp which in turn means a better game for all of usccp has a track record of knowing what they are doing and doing it well all the sourbutt killjoys who cry about it being a simsinspace are obviously living in their heads and making up excuses to be ridiculously and arbitrarily negativecarry on ccp we trust you
a good day to you all i wanted to get in contact with someone from the csm or ccp in person but it seems harder than i thought if they are interested they are all most welcome to contact me through ingame mail i will give you my real life mail then i rather not make it public since i might get spammed by alot of peopleanyways ive written a little document to gather most problems with the factional warfare mechanics i have gathered complaints from people ingame and from the forum and combined them into a word document containing some possible solutions to those problemsthe main reason for my post is the fact that the caldari militia is on strike until those issues have been treated or at least looked at and confirmed by ccp and i noticed this post was in the wrong location but i cant delete it anyways its a good way to make people notice i reposted in the appropriate area alsoplease do read thisdocxdocpdf
supportedthe mobility requirements that blaster platforms need in order to be useful are unbalanced with the amount of effective damage that they can put out currentlystart with a boost to blasters then we can look at tweaking individual ships
actually csm pointed at the iceland meeting that gallente are inferior comparing to other races theres still hope
bump for the love of lowsex
to the top keep supporting
supported
minimum effort maximum result
signedfps were meant for pc anyways are the ccp worried about the fact that people playing on pc might end up ripping all the console gamers to shreads and yes each and every eve player has a pc but not all of them have a console soooo
the difference between a failcorp and a legitimate startup is that one takes responsibility for its own continued existence and doesnt presume a right to be there youre quite correct  most war decs are selective in their targets  theres no shortage of failcorps out there so why should they pick on yours if it doesnt suck sometimes theres reasons for it like a corptheft smacktalker canflipper whatever other times its just because you look like the kind of corp that isnt going to fight back and is going to die pointlessly and drop good loot the way to stop this happening is to stop making yourself a target  theres no shortage of ways to do this and the easiest one is stop being the fish in the barrel
problem is weve done it all short of the abusiveexploitive hiding in npc corps to evade wardecso in short its a total and utter waste of time to lecture me of all people as to how to get around itthe point is there is no way around it end of discussion as far as we are concernedi dont infer the right to exsist but i do think this is nigh practically harassment on the greatest levelsand the reasons for why they wardec us are always the same the same reason i give everyone else that complainsbecause they canthey dont need a reason and the ones they come up with are epic fail to begin with mining permit would be the most utterly stupid one i can think of off handso please dont give me the gritty details of how to get around it and how to evade it because when it gets right down to it if your in a corp they can wardec you no matter who you are or what your doingthey will wardec you regardless its just a question of who and whatyou could be casually flying a little industrial hauler thats empty and they wardec you because they see you all the time in some market hubnever mind the guy smack talking for 1vs1s and dishororing them with a neut repper etcetcetcultimately its a greifing tool and nothing but some use it for other reasons others use it for legitimate reasons but overall 9 times out of 10 its to greif someone for something as simple as desirehow do we fix it i dont have the slightest idea every suggestion ive seen would bring too much favor to high sec or ruin high sec with nonstop carnage worthy of lowsec and 00like it or not industrialists carebears as i loath to be told as i prefer industrialist with teeth are here to stay you have no ammono shipsno nothing without usbut they dont give a crapand come up with all kinds of excuses so yes the debate will likely continue on for an another 3 to 5 years or so
am i the only one that reads the accusations of griefers with real life problems and understands the statement as i have real life problems would you please stop griefing me im tired of crying myself to sleep trolls excluded in this analysis as they are irrelevantas someone who has never partook in that many high sec wars i am going to say no this idea is dumb as much as i find docking games online adventures a terrible terrible waste of time i cant find it in my heart to take that whack a mole game away from people
you are confusing who is whomi am not the op who suggested eliminating nonconsensual wardecsi am the one who wants them balanced with mining decs  a state of being that prohibits the decced from leaving station or going through gates unless in a mining barge exhumer or industrial i want to be able to force the griefers to do something as boring and pointless to them as i find combat to be  something for which they have not trained their skills  or leave their corp or stay docked and twiddle their thumbsagain we are paying real world money that fact should be sufficient to ccp to design a means to prevent bored cowards  who would be in lowsec or nullsec if they really wanted pvp instead of riskfree shooting of fish in a barrel  from preventing paying customers from playing the game they purchased
drake youre missing something here we are an industry focussed corp and have been for 5 years weve never really had a problem actually if someone would like to wardec us that would be lovely it serves very nicely as a training exercise thats why i would lecture you  because i have quite literally been there done that and thats why i assert that the current scenario is not a problemwars arent griefing any more than mining someone elses roids are griefing or undercutting them on the market the mines in minesweeper arent griefing you they just part of the game  part which separates the men from the boys or the carebears from the industrialists with teeth if you preferbecause they can is true enough but youre projecting altogether too much animosity onto another player its more like because they can and because itll work if they dont get any kills during the war or worse end up losing ships then they probably wont bother in future it really is that simple  griefing you specifically really isnt worth the effort unless youve gone out of your way to annoy oh and youll probably find that most of the griefers you refer to are more than capable of doing their own manufacturing and industry the strategic thinking team player whos effective in pvp is almost certainly also going to be effective should they choose to turn their hand to industry as well
translation eve is not really a sandbox there is only one right way to play and anyone who wants to play in any other fashion must be crushed ridiculed and driven out of the gameyeah right
i find the stance that just because you are paying someone to play their game gives you and form of right to dictate how their game is played rather idiotic i myself enjoy playing eve online even with all the faults and lolunfairness that comes a long with the game however lets both be clear on a point the griefers are also paying for this game you have no monopoly on this paying concept the only difference is that you are paying for a game you do not like apparently how foolish is that
and you are missing the point and im beginning to think its on purpose no one is stopping you from playing the game you purchased with your real world money until a war dec comes through that boots you out of the game and locks out your login account that statement will never be true no matter how many times you bold underline parts of itif the problem is that you dont like other active players being able to dictate in part the content of your game experience then i have bad news for you  you are playing the wrong game
then you support the mining dec ideaso that i have an equal chance to dictate the content of the griefer cowards game
imho the op did have a point as things stand it is incredibly easy and far too cheap for a greifer corp to wardec an industrialmining corp and do very bad things to any mining ship foolish enough to come out of dock of course since you do get 24 hours you could go set up a pos in wormhole space and go make real money for a while while your enemy goes broke oh wait as long as one of them donates a single lvl 1 mission a day they can pay the declaration fee forever to players who have been around a bit a wardec from a highsec greifer corp just means time to go work out in low  null and watch as they spend money on the dec but are afraid to come out into low  null to get any kills oh right thats why they pick on carebear mining corpsas an alternate idea id reccoment a change to teh wardec pricing bringing the base price of 23 mill a week seriously if both corps have no wars it only costs as much as 3 tractor beam 1sto something a little more consequential say a base of 10  20 mill a week i actually like the highsec wars  i just think that there needs to be enough of a cansequence of starting a war other than potential losses to make people think twice about just tossing the wardec out there if you have a good enough reason you will find a way to pay the dec cost no matter how high just to make the other sob bleed
well we got a wardec because a corp run by holy8th decided to wardec us his corp was onyl going after miners and failing at killing a few combat ships without having 5 people on one but recently an alliance heard about this and wardeced holy8ths corp his corp got station camped so they stop the war then rumor has it he payed a merc corp 700 mil to wwardec this tiny little indy corp thats pretty funny and sad at the same timediplomacy does help but once an indys money reserves run out they cant do much in a war dec thats why system war decs would be a better solution so if you dont want to fight you can leave but consequences you could easily lose your mining sites near your hq this would be a great solution but a lot of trollers tend to add a bunch of rants to this thread so a lot of people didnt see the good posts
you already do industrial corps have a direct impact on the amount of isk pvp centric players pay for their equipment its a symbiotic relationship in which neither would survive very long or at least not happily without the otheryoure not getting the idea behind eve it is not an instanced world it is not neatly divided pockets of activity it is more than any other mmo just like the real world everyone is all smashed up together and what you do affects other people just as what they do affects youthe griefers as you refer to them do not dictate how you play the game unless you let them certainly they dictate what happens around you but no more or less than a suicide ganker at a gate or a market competitor that undercuts your sale of emp m if you want a game where youre not impacted by other players  i reiterate you really picked the wrong game
wardecs could use a price increase but thats about itsorry op but your idea wont happen it flies directly in the face of the core principles of eve one of which is that nowhere is entirely safe
this thread is still lols
the sandbox still forces you to play within the rules set by the game you can not project a bubble of immunity around you while still playing the market just as i can not decide that i want to put a doomsday device on my rifter
to the opthe thing here is that war decs only lasts for a weekmy recommendation would be to train a bit of pvp skills  not too much get everyone to spend a couple weeks on some missile  gunnery  propulsion jamming  mwd then build yourself i dunno 20 rifters or similar each and pvp fit themtuck them away in a hangar and go about your miningwhen you get a war dec treat it as a holiday from mining and go pew pew for a week  i guarantee by the time you have burned through 20 rifters each you will have made many mistakes learnt much about pvp basics had a good few laughs and maybe maybe even gotten a killas with rl a change is as good as a break and mining will get pretty tiresome pretty quickly if its all you ever doi realise pvp isnt what you want to do but hiding crying and feeling put upon is not going to enrich your game experience  putting the barges away for a week building some cheap pew pew ships and getting stuck in will  especially if you accept youre going to lose at first review what happened after every loss and try to figure out what you can change for next time to prevent that particular loss againi think you can see from the responses you got here the wardec system is unlikely to change the way you want so your best bet is to find a way to turn what youre seeing right now as a negative into a positivegood luck
how nice of you to have a very lucky 5 year run streaki stand by what i said if you want to take it out of context or misinterpret what im saying then go right on aheadbottom line is the mechanic is broken and the age old excuses people keep coming up with are bullthat goes for both sides wardecced and wardeccerand just because youve had little to no trouble doesnt mean everyone else hasntyou can pep talk us all you want you can attempt to rationalize all you want wont workbecause the facts are still there the history of what weve had to see first hand is still therealot of eve is based on luck and various small choices perhaps weve made some mistakes thats what makes eve so great the sandbox is big and crowded in high sec probability of escapinggetting someones attention shifts all the timefact remains if i go back to high sec it would be stupid to be in a corporation that lives in high sec unless you have a capable and good sized pvp force or skilled in such ways where you can handle ittrying to retool an industrialist to pvp without getting an additional account is wholly stupid and utter tripe at bestand wardecs as a vacation only works if it happens once a monthbacktobacktoback wardecs and wardecs that stack on top of each other quickly shoots that downand for what reasons did we get wardecd so oftennone at all because they wanted to and they did
i have to disagree here because they can adn they like others tears and they dont have the guts to dec someone who fights back
ccp has asked already to stay in topic do you think that said request doesnt affect you or do you have anything else constructive to add to this thread because except from puny oneliners there is not much comming from you aside some hot airon topic as it stands there are lot of griefers who are not able to beat someone in a real and even leveled pvp scene wardeccing young weak poor non experienced and small corps i would propose the followinga make wardeccing the more expensive the smaller and younger the wardeclared corpb remove war deccing for corporations that exist for less than 4 months
i can see what you are trying to do unfortunately that suggestion would not worka so what war decs between 500men corps become nearly free that is not right what happenes if small corporations whant to duke it out because they ed eachother off b what if noobs want to duke it out what if someone creates a new corp every 4 months
dont be ridiculous eve is a sandbox that means you have to deal with the other kids in that sandbox not try to partition it off and say this is my bit go away and throw a tantrum when they dont see it that way
youre quite correct the difference is i took the problems onboard when they came and dealt with them then they werent a problem any more utter nonsense it takes very little effort to be a threat in combat its much more about mindset and thinking than it is about skill points  even after the 5 years im still flying t1 cruisers a lot because they are still very effective but perhaps youre right  its definitely easier to take a team oriented focussed individual that happens to like pvp and retrain them into industry
alright ill add some more hot aireve is about pvpwars are about pvpif you log in you agree with the chance of being blown updont like that hello kitty online is that way this is the best reply youre gonna get and guess what most ccp personnel will say the same so shut up and fight back
opposed high sec war decs are part of game
1 prices are dictated right now by inventors a lot of stuff without t2 bpos are unprofitable to make because of other inventors not knowing how to do basic math 2 invention came in and dropped the price of t2 by over 973 t2 bpos will expire all on their own throughhow1 owner quits the game2 exploiter gets billions of isk and buys up a ton of t2 bpos for insane prices and gets banned see the moon goo exploitthe impact of the t2 bpos is pretty much all gone removing them would increase prices slightly but would not increase the profits of inventors if you want proof of this just look up the profit margins of stuff that doesnt have a t2 bpoyou may say oh voogru u own t2 bpos so of course your against thisso i say you are probably an inventor and you do not like competing with t2 bpo owners you think your profit margins suck because of t2 bpo owners they suck because of other inventors when invention came out the profits were total awesomesauce once everyone and their dog was doing it the profit margins went down significantlybut if you think t2 bpos are the problem why you cant profitinvent stuff that doesnt have t2 bposinvent whats profitable not what you just have some strange obsession with dont fall in love with an item of course this is going to fall on deaf ears because you just want to have everything your way
im gonna go against the flow and support this not just because i dont have one but because it would break open the market a little and put a stop to a virtual riskfree source of income
how is producing from a bpo less riskfree than inventionproduction
they already do have advantages and disadvantagesadvantage you can research me level you can build without datacores and t1 bpcdisadvantage you must build consecutively by inventing multiple bpc inventors can build concurrentlythis is a real biggy folks  bpo have a fixed maximum amount of runs theoretically possible in a monthlets say mr bpo has a ship bpo and it can build 30 one per daymr inventor invents 10 x 3 run bpc  they can all be put in the oven at the same time  unfortunately due to negative pe he can only build one per 2 days instead of one every day like mr bpo can  but hey look hes still cranked out all thirty of his ships that takes mr bpo a month in under a weekif youre committed to this it is possible to build in volumes that far outstrip what a bpo can produceand before anyone starts on about how inventors cant compete due to the bpos me level cutting back margins  these margins are not the fault of bpos  bpo owners im sorry to say its our fellow inventors  if it was the fault of bpo owners then we would logically see much more profitable invention on items like hic black op marauder jf etc that have no t2 bpo equivalent  ive tried inventing all of these and the margins on these are just as tight as on hac  recon etc that do have a bpo equivalentno support for this idea from me  its just sour grapes tbh
yet many people have enough t2 bpos to fill all their production slots so that limitation isnt relevant to themthe fact that in some sectors all ships come from t2 bpos does demonstrate that there is unfair competitionit is a flawed part of the game that significantly devalues the benefits of the vast amnounts of sp required for efficient invention  using t2 bpos also require far far less sp the only reason i wont support this is because this proposal is flawed as it doesnt propose a workable way of compensating the t2 bpo owners if someone came up with that i would support it
how about let them keep their bposseriously stop being ridiculous the razor guy above made it pretty damn clear just because you cant meet your full potential as an inventor doesnt mean the bpo owner should be screwed
you has youself contribute to getting rid of bpos in game buy them from their current owners and trash them what you dont whant to spend your isk on it why should then the current owners lsoe their longterm investment
supported 
invention takes time effort and a bit of luck bpos  buy produce profit
ccp themselves admitted that the t2 lottery was a bad way of distributing t2 bpos while they will be removed eventually by people going inactive they still provide a steady source of income for those that own them without requiring much effort aor involving risk ccp wants an emergent sandbox and t2 bpos are not part of that anymore
t1 bpos should be gotten rid of then no risk to them
missing the point cheap trollt1 bpos are freely available and can be researched by everyone and produce less specialised mods
1 invention isnt much about luck it comes down to skills a dedicated inventor gets easily to the percentage of successful inventions as shown on
ive heard this request beforei know little of industry myself but youre welcome to write a proposal about it and ill support it
nice dodge replying to that and not to
and if that happens you make less profit the point is not the exact amount of income but rather the fact that its steady and requires very little effort
less effort yesvery little nokeeping t2 production running is also a lot of work especially when you are not just building one thingseriously we are talking about a non issue here invention is fine and t2 bpos are fine
in my humble opinion i think new players should have the chance to get anything older players once had the chance to getthere should be multiple occasions of unique items being handed out or none at allt2 bpos were cancelled by ccp so i would agree that they should disappear of course with a small refund for the ownersi find this similar to owning ships that were handed out during some event id say that if all ships of a kind get destroyed there should be new ones issued in order for new players to get a chance to get their hands on one or perhaps even make them a little less unique just very hard to get sorry if i sound a bit clichUFFFD here i understand people want unique stuff but its just that new players dont ever get their hands on the cool oldskool uniques ships because they all get destroyed or bought by entitysame with unique items of course if there are such left after t2 bpos no not the snowballs pi vote procd
it show you dont know how industry workthe amount of income is very important i own 2 t2 bpo quake l and barage m the hourly profit is 50k for one 167500 for the other i can get more with any of the t1 ship bpo i own with any of the invented items i normally produce and even with some of the t1 module for wick i own a bpo and there i am suffering from mission loot as a competitor so to reply to your question yes if you cant change product and the price change you get less profitwhen you have an asset like a bpo t1 or t2 that allow the production of a single item when the price of that item crash you asset lose use value even if you theoretically can resell it for its original cost with t2 bpo that problem is compound as the item has a large purchase cost against the income it produce a t1 ship bpo cost can be recovered in a few months of research and production a t2 bpo require a few years every time the price crashes you should choose between continuing production and losing from the production of potentially more rewarding items or discontinuing it and further delaying the recover of your purchase costbeside that what i feel ius the most important point hasnt yet been replayed by the pro removal peoplesome t2 item will totally disappear from the game as it will never become profitable to invent them you feel that it will enrich the game to see them disappear
you are really that stubbornyou are new you want a t2 bpo sell orders forum is your place i would bet a large number of the current t2 bpo owner bought their bposwhat we dont need a new version of the lottery
if you are trying to designate corp tax to the members that paid it why dont you set corp tax to zero item sales manufacturing charges and im reasonably sure everything else that can be handled via corp wallet subdivisions is already functional in game
id say to also allow combat probes to be saved this way but if there is a game balance concern just increase the time it takes for the probes to conduct the scan
but that means the guys who are actually good at combat scanning and do minimise their probe visibility are taking a negative hit just so all the newbie ones dont have to arrange their probes
genius would allow me to kill pve boats in my pvp ship with no concordway to go dude
an active armor bonus should allow a ship to fit a better active tank than a similar ship with a resist bonus resist bonuses are great for spider and buffer tanking as well as active tanks current repairamount bonuses need some rethinking especially considering the capacitor dependency handicap that active tanking incurssupported
perhaps to solve this annoying cloakers in your home system problem ccp could add a new item that works with the new sov that negates the ability of your enemys to sit cloaked and safe in their sss an upgrade like this should only be available in your well used systems every system that employed something like this would make cloaks uselesshow it would negate the cloakers ability to hide forever perhaps make it so cloaking devices gain damage while used when they get too damaged the modules die this would happen like you were overheating the module another possibility would be for everyone but blues and alliance members would simply not be able to use cloaks rp reason the cloak has to be on a certain frequency or it doesnt work
mmmmmmph not this againi dont think youre taking into account the trade off covop ships make for using their covops cloaking devicescloakers tend to be on average weaker than their t1 counterparts in terms of tanking yes they get the upgraded t2 resists but they die pretty quick under sustained fire the stealth bomber in particular will die to pretty much anything that has a weapon and pointas for catching them you can nab them at the gate when they enter or leave system you just need a fast enough point or a bubble if you are in 00now with regards to afk cloakers if they are truly afk then you have nothing to worry about they are simply as you stated annoying so go out and do your thing on the off chance that they are not afk and poking around or hunting for targets well thats the risk you take remember a good covops pilot will not engage you unless they feel the risk of decloaking is worth it ie you are easy pickings which is really the point behind such ships anywaysnot supportededit grammaredit2 spelling
facepalmsthe cloaker is not the problem your lack of balls is think about it
00 in supposed to be dangerous shocker
not to mention a lack of a backboneand an over abundance of yellow
actually id be fine with an anticloaker module as long as it cost so much that it was only used on truly critical systems if youre willing to pay 100 milday to prevent cloaking be my guest
with one of the indexs at level vperhaps securitymilitarypersonally i feel it should be tied to industryprospecting as its very easy to raise the security indexyes its unrelated but it would make them work for it
you scurred
the afk cloakers are an issue in 00 i do believe something should be done about them i do not agree that they should completely loose the ability to cloak i think possibly an achorable module similar to the cyno gen array could be developed my thoughts on this array it would pulsate every hour or some other ccp determided time causing all cloaks to deactivate in the system if the cloaker is actively playing the game and not just wasting ccp bandwidth he can easily cloak back up cloaks should be immune to this pulsating for the fist 10 min of activation to prevent any i tried to cloak on the gate but the decloaker array screwed me events thhe cloaks would keep thier current reactivation timer this device would allow the inhabitants of a system to fight cloakers back afk cloakers that return every 34 hours to try and catch a miner hauler or other people should not have that ability if the inhabitants of the system pay attention to the array and know its cycle time which would probably be the cycle time of the tower they could have scanners at the ready to try and catch cloakers like i said previously if the cloaker is actively playing the game then this array would have no effect on his game playi support this issuelt
sureyou can have itthe day i get a undock your afk in stationpos booty into space butan
now that would be funny everyone mining to keep their industry index at 5 to keep their 1hour anti cloak pulse d that would definitely fit the carebear pattern
still nobody from ccp wants to give us minersindustrialists some info i see no love for the minersindustrialsts then im guessing even the comet thing gonna turn out to be more of a turkey shoot for pew pewers to scrap our ships too come on ccp give us a notification that you actually atleast read this say something will you
hii have a proposal which i dont know if it has been propose yet but whatever heres another one currently there is no sov possible in wh space but im just asking myself why but with all the new feature coming to eve with tyrannis the new expansion well i think we should have sov in wh space because of all the logistic necessary for those tower but it requirer sov to anchor some outpost in which you can have all you need to support your corp in wh yes we have no stargate so what we could have a system for that in which in wh you can also jump from place to place if you are within jump range of your other tower with cyno gen all you need is to be fair compare to normal space as we some corp and alliance live in wh space so if we can enter a supercarrier in some wh why couldnt we get our sov and anchor outpost if we have the isk for thatkinzaps i would like to have an official answer to this too as i already petition but got no answer any ccp or csm member are welcome to give me any answer
no
why
wh space  known space
currently it is like that but what is the diference between the 2 wh has some effect on starship sometime execpt for that there is no diference at all we just requiere sov and jump capability so why we couldnt have it
ccp says no therefore the answer is no
outposts sovbuilding up a fortress in wh space is already ridiculously easy now you want a pretty gold star on the map saying you own itbe real dudethe answer is simply no
you know one of the features of wh space is no sovand we like to keep it that way thank youthat of course means not supported
linking this because the ah gets a lot more traffic than jpsc at the moment
please leave all comments about them in that thread btw
how is this important anyways i accept the fact that some people play kill mail on line but those same people gloat over killing a t1 hauler smack full of bpcs that are showing bpo prices on teit kill board when in fact all they did was kill a 200000 isk ship with 23 days worth of copy slots that can be up to 220 bpcs max run btwalso i dont want people to know about the low grade slave set i lost in a shield tanked arazu that sucked 
well to put it into a context that maybe everyone can appreciate what if youre a mercenary corporation and youre trying to show how much damage financially youve inflicted on your current marks for your client to know that the victims have also lost several billion in implants as well as their ship will make them a happy customer but theres currently no way to know thiswhat if your awesome reimbursement program also extends to cover low grade slave sets lost in official operations  no way to know who did and didnt have these implantedwhats the difference between seeing what modules someone had in their lost ship awesomeinsanefail or otherwise and seeing what implants they had poking out of their grey matter awesomeinsanefail or otherwiseok how about a module for those with maxed biology to be able to probe frozen corpses and work it out no joke
yup im down with the implantsonkillmails ideahowever id only support the looting of implants if it was also possible to unplug and reuse them in the normal course of eventsthis is because if unplugging them yourself destroys them then someone else unplugging them from a corpse should also destroy them
yes yes yes sometimes implants are worth more than the ship this would also give a whole new meaning to ransoming
clone grade quality is quantity and quality of neural connections in the brain of the medical clone at the medical facility that your body is cloned back to if there number is insufficient to properly assimilate information from your previous body some information may be lost as soon at the body becomes alive you jump into ityou are cloned back to life the effective quality of your bodies brain becomes infinite as more neural connections will be created by the brain when necessary thats a natural process that takes place when you learn and that is why you can exceed your clone limit therefore determining the quality of the body that you killed is impossible as it does not correspond to the normal specifications of bodies stored at medical facility as normal processes of metabolism lyfecycle of cells death of brain cells due to use of drugs boosters and alcohol change the brain a lot neither can you determine the quality of the clone to which you victim was cloned because that clone is lightyears away from you at the medical facility and i doubt that if you kill a guy and then call up medical personal at his alliance outpost to ask them the clone cost so you know how much damage you did they will be eager to tell you determining the exact model of a microscopic implant included in someones head when you shot through his body a 1400 mm projectile or 1000mm plasma bolt few million degrees hot will be problematic at best
wow people who do not support this topic are unusually poor at coming up with reasons for not supporting
exactly stop being stupid
hmmm id like to support this but the potential to increase lag  server load means i really cantif youd put in some sort of caveat that the modification would be clientside only so that the only person who sees your ship how you made it is you and that there was zero effect on the server i might have given it the thumbs up
you know every expansion increases server lag because there is bigger database taht needs to be searched every new account increases server lag every new module increases server lag lets stop updating eve at all to prevent server lag
haha 
de you are utterly fantasticthank you for that been needing a good laughoh and thisthere is a reason my char has shades bps the sunglare stays pvpers use this as very clever and valid tactic dont like it get more sunblock
my eyes are sensitive to light actually and a dimming feature would be nice1 from me
station management really requires more than 2 options for giving access to the services
good ideaccp make it so
supported
rollback dominionwhybecause id like to be able to load systems and dont want to have to wait 3 minutes to jump through a gate all the timeit would be nice if modules activated when they were asked not at some future time at their convenienceand id like my guns to work in fleet fights i kind of miss actually shooting things
did you honestly thought that by posting that that it would pass and carry throughi thought sosome people have too much time on there hands
excellent grammar draconis i think fellraven may have a flare for the dramatic but this doesnt diminish the perspective hes giving an expansion meant to level the playing field and create opportunity has only managed to maintain the status quo with the exception of the ol bob buddies while creating apathy and disdain for a game that was more functional prepatch
didnt you mean flare for emoragegoing around making demands is gong to make you look like a fooladd to that repeat posting of same thing is going to just make it downright annoying and less constructivefor all intents and purposes im fine with what we got now other than the obvious lag issueand my macbook running hotter than it needs to for some damn reasonbut you dont see me running around emoing it about it now do youccp says they are working on the problem they are working on the problem thenscreaming i want it nao wont make them work fasterjust slow them down trying to clean up the trashand since when has ccp ever rolled back an expansion seti rest my case
gunsguns are a primary weapon assigned to a hard point on most ships gun users sometimes have missile hard points which they may and most often do use for support modules like neuts rr and smartbombs gun users also often have drone bays for additional damage or to kill small stuffgun users have mid slot and low slot modules to increase range and tracking of their main weapon they have low slot modules to increase all three profiles damage added to these they also have rigs to increase all three profilesgun users often rely on drones and most often have goodly drone baysmissilesmissiles are a primary weapon assigned to a hard point on few ships missile users sometimes have gun hard points which they may and most often do use for support modules like neuts rr and smartbombs missile users also often have gimped drone bays if any at all for additional damage or to kill small stuffmissile users have no modules to increase range and tracking of their main weapon they have low slot modules to increase damage only they also have rigs to increase all three profilesmissile users rarely rely on drones and have poor drone baysdronesdrone ships fewest ships rely on drone damage primarily though they have missile or gun hard points which are often ancillary their role they have damage bonuses to all drone damage types and sizes and most often have damage bonuses to their hard point weapon alsodrone users have high slot modules to increase range mid slots to increase speed and low slot modules to increase tracking and range of their main weapon they also have rigs to increase all three profilesturret ships most often benefit from drones more than missile shipsyour point againedit spelling and somesuch
this is based on speeds of target ships tested before the nano nerf with missiles attempting to engage prenerf nano ships if you reread the devblog you will gleen that missile velocity can be increased considerably over current rates to engage most ships at their current speed well before before they start acting funny
you have missed a few correction highlighted in redand hardwirings for all the weapon stats and hardwirings for all the weapon stats 0 hardwiringsthe oinly thing that increased damage is a rig and work only for sentry dronesno t2 variants of any module 1 faction variant of the high slot range module no other faction variantyou want to exchange the number of modules rigs and hardwirings
dont seem so hard to comprehendwe did some basic tests  with special highspeed missiles we quickly noticed destiny our physics engine behaving very strangelyseem pretty straightforward i see no mention of ship speed in that phrase and youthe whole dev blog was saying that speed above 15 kms for any object in the game create problems but this phrase is aimed specifically for missiles
my point venkul is that the op has a proposal to bring missile ships more in line with turret ships and to show that he has a valid point also to show that your post is not only off topic but derails from the threadyou could argue that the proposal fails to meet muster on its merits but i doubt you could show many ways it this is true instead you point out the fact that drone users have no implants it has nothing to do with this topic and you know betterwhat you should do is create your own proposal offering a fix to that completely different issue rather than troll this thread if you want to argue against this proposal be straight forward ive learned to respect many of your post but this is clearly not your best moment
allow me to clear that updevs were attempting to test increasing velocity of drones and missiles to counter nano ships those nano ships moving were at ludicrous and phenominal speeds with up to an eightfold increase in speed over what a vessel can reach with a normal tech2 mwdobviously they were attempting to have missiles and drones mimic and most likely surpass those ludicrous and phenominal speeds in order to intercept the target ship at those speeds density the physics engine started behaving very strangelyseems pretty clear to me to suggest missile velocity can not be increased at all without them starting to act funny and base it on this blog is fail as long as missile velocity does not reach ludicrous and phenominal speeds there seems to be no problem devs have no where stated the exact speed that causes this effect look above the speeds being tested where the funny behavior occurred were obviously well above this random 15 km number you have thrown out
nice work you are good at twisting what ccp nozh said this still stand even after all your weaselingthe combat system was never designed for such speeds it is not aimed only to ships but to all combat system missiles drones and ships about the random chosen 15 km second speed look the thread i linked some post above and you will see why i am citing that as a threshold it is the point where people start to notice some rare strange behavior like ship passing through solid objects at 20 km second it become a common experiencebut a rare occurrence can still wreak havoc to the functionality of a weapon system that rare occurrence can make a whole salvo miss or if it dependent from some specific condition for the bug to appear it can make it useless till the conditions changeto make an example for drones it happen sometime when they are totally unable to track a large stationary object to change conditions you have to send them against a different target and them make them return from a different direction for missiles it can be something like switching to another target not something that will help much in a pvp situation where killing the selected target fast is the key so i feel that keeping speed within that limit is something positive maybe it can be pushed upward maybe it already break the engine at lower speed but normally people dont notice it that only the devs know the point where the errors become noticeable to the players is clearly a point you dont want to reach my point is that missiles dont need to be buffed as a whole weapon class beside rockets and maybe some tweaking in explosionspeed damagethey are a good weapon class and different from guns they are less efficient than guns in some situation large fleet combat mostly but shine in other situations this whole thread is one of the common attempts to push missiles as the top system in all situations not good missiles will benefit from some tweaking but they dont need a general buff
a good day to you all i wanted to get in contact with someone from the csm or ccp in person but it seems harder than i thought if they are interested they are all most welcome to contact me through ingame mail i will give you my real life mail then i rather not make it public since i might get spammed by alot of peopleanyways ive written a little document to gather most problems with the factional warfare mechanics i have gathered complaints from people ingame and from the forum and combined them into a word document containing some possible solutions to those problemsthe main reason for my post is the fact that the caldari militia is on strike until those issues have been treated or at least looked at and confirmed by ccpplease do read thisdocxdocpdf
i believe many dont wish to download the documents so ill just post the document on this forumthe document was originally meant to mail to someone so my apologies for thatpart 1 introductiona good dayi know for a fact that most players in factional warfare would like to see some changes to the mechanics of it i have gathered some information from the forums and the players themselves in game and combined it all into a single listi hope to help players and ccp communicate better since apparently most of the factional warfare problems players have been whining about are still not heard if they have i just hope you guys could actually confirm change because stuff in the caldari militia have gotten out of handthe caldari militia has gone into official strike by letting the gallente take over all of caldari held space this will continue until we get confirmation of changes being made to factional warfare i took this quote directly from the forumslink
part 2 factional warfare suggestionsbugs there is nothing to note here please just fix themplexingtactical outposts lp given in proportions to time defending or attacking a facility need for fuel perhaps npc convoys that can be intercepted to lower effectiveness of the outposts instead of just waiting at the tactical outposts having to blow up the structures and build new ones for your own faction when occupancy is achieved the building might need resources or just time random spawning of plexes not alot at downtime an no more or alot lessmissions make missions have impact on occupancy status of a system instead of only plexesbunkers bunkers replaced with militia outposts that act similar to 00 outposts but easier to destroyoccupancy more clear indication to how much a system is into vulnerability control over systems should give advantages like npc navy support at gates or something bonus for every occupied system for example 05 more lp per system or  of systems heldpvpstations making docking restrictions for enemy parties of the militia free repairs for militia members in militia stations due to the high amount of pirates in eve id recommend giving access to navy ships comparable to pirate faction ships but make them equally hard to get like achieving a certain rank or amount of enemy navy kills or such ships like the state raven but likely not since you probably wouldnt like making unique ships just rare   increase lp gained from kills currently such system dont even seem to exist to some players militia members who willingly shoot fellow militia members should get severe sec status loss and faction loss repeated engagement gets you kicked from the militia miscellaneous filtering of members in faction warfare corporations the numbers state caldari militia to have over 5000 pilots but i have never seen more than 300 online simultaneously in my time here im almost certain that over half of them either quit the game or are alts to increase the number of pilots on the stats id recommend to put inactive pilots in a regular npc corp it doesnt affect them at all if they are inactive so it wouldnt hurt them more militia gm interaction electing a representative and a spare for each militia in new eden for csmgm communications more news stories and events or special missions recognition of achievements  such as amount of victory pointskills per character
 vincent death  gives mission runner some incentive to plex other than just isk fountaining and not giving a  what goes on pvp wise
we need a system to produce stuff which are borderline useless with the whole simcity thing for trany expansion we could have our slaves be producing this junk

ok who let the animaltroll out of his cage again
everytime a troll trolls youll hear this song
not only supporting lowsec love in general but this nifty idea in particular
so you want to add multiple modules requiring artwork as well as usage mechanics for the sole purpose of creating a revenue stream they already have this  sell the items to npc dealers for a profitwhile i support lowsecs revamp this idea isnt that good whether we like it or hate it lowsec will probably require an overhaul from the ground up now the only question is how to do it and what to turn it intonot supported
has some merit but needs work i dont think it should be a isk faucet but if it could be could to consumeconvert the masses of worthless npc trade goods into something useful one possibility is that running one of these lures in extra rats
if you saw them then you too were on at those timesdoes that make you a macropeople on these boards are always claiming that they can infallibly detect macros yet every criteria they use to supposedly detect macros for sure is a trait also shared by some portion of the legitimate mining populationusing bookmarks in the belt check any sensible miner bookmarks hisher favorite belts with preset positions to maximize the effectiveness of the strip minersmining a hold full and docking check for anyone who wishes to avoid canflipperscontinuing to aim lasers at a rock that has popped check for anyone alttabbed and multitaskingquickly switching lasers off a popped rock check for those who are paying close and careful attention to their miningdoesnt respond to chat in local or via private messaging lots of players dont bother with local for one reason or another i personally find the spam and the smacktalk far too tedious to bother reading iton all the time if you are on to see them then you too are on all the time so either youre a macro too or they gasp actually could be other players who have a similar schedule to yoursand people always come up the with the same solutions  either making mining annoying for real miners or creating a means of griefing via reporting so that even the most farfetched accusation of macroness could set in motion a chain that would result in perfectly innocent players losing characters and accounts into which theyve invested much time and moneyi dont claim to know how prevalent or how rare macromining is i dont know how to effectively detect and deter macros but i am really tired of people proposing illthought solutions that would cast too wide a net over legitimate miners
so far the only thing i have seen a macro do that i have never seen a player do is warp to the station for 45 seconds and then warp back into the ice belt for 45 minutes repeat ad nausea  all while in a pod
yet some people go to such lengths to defend macrosi am an on call person from my house so i can be on at any given time of the day or night if i come off a call and log in to see whats going on they are there when i log off they are there ive been on right after downtime times all through the day as well as many times right before dt hits when i log on they are there exactly how much did you spend on your macro program to be defending macros so much so basically you say they should fly free this needs supported so ccp will see people back them in finding better ways to end macros and want to see it stopped maybe some of the ideas here arent the best it is however a better attempt to end people using these programs than simply sitting in these threads defending macro users where is your ideas if you dont have any to support helping put an end to this stop showing how much you support their use if it can be brought up to ccp that alot more people are behind this maybe the devs will put their heads together to come up with new ideas themselves
little thread you have clearly lost your way this has the familiar scent of caod all over it please find your way there next time
even so i dont think they should be unscannable make them damn near impossible to scan sure but not impossible
then petition itotherwise its not going nowhere
and just to add to this it should also apply to cloaked ships as well there should be a chance to find cloaked ships especially if theyre just standing still for long periods of time i commend tortugan for bringing this problem to light
i like this part it gives the defenders incentive to come and fight through all the timers instead of just turning up at the final timer and even if the attacker gets beaten at the last timer theyve at least accomplished something ie isk loss thumb up for this part
nicely done
a number of these items were discussed in iceland  see csm meeting minutes
can we please sticky this
the black ops vessel is rarely piloted in the eve universe yet its role would appear to be quite necesarry in an alliance i believe this ship has become too expensive to completely serve its purpose or that the ship itself is not as effective as it should be its jump range is very limited and unlike its counterparts that will be traveling along with it it does not have access to a covert ops cloaking device it also has the resistances of a subpar battle ship yet i undertand it is not made primarily for combat itself i am not also suggesting to just slap a covert ops cloaker onto the ship but possibly a specialized cloak for the black ops itself it would be able to cloak while warping but it will have a sensor recalibration time unlike the covert ops counterpart that way the ship will not be too over powered when regarding gank tactics involved in null and low security the speed bonus to the cloaked velocity is easily overlooked as well because its purpose is not quite effective in conclusion it would be nice to see one of the following for changes regarding the black ops ship a change in the requirement for jumping fuel a new type of cloak whatever it may be or atleast resists that can give it the ability to fend off longer in fleet engagements
if you read the latest csm minutes the csm have proposed this to ccp and they will be reviewed
yessssssalso lol  eontip of the spear well youre getting shafted flying one of these
earlier black op proposal
you do realize that being scammed on a character sale is a bannable offense right if you feel youve been scammed the proper forum is to petition it and let the gms do their jobs
i think he means to propose a solution to the problem of accounts being hacked and characters being sold if so ccp is working on that see csm meeting minutes
please tell me where you mine so i can come by and can flip your cansif you dont like it then dont jet a can and by the way you have the option of shooting the can flipper last i checked though you might not have the ability
well he iswas a goon however this is a terrible idea it would remove my technique of getting my neutral alt to be able to web my freighter through highsec so due to rational thinking and selfish interests i am calling this idea dumb
so you are saying that just because a crime was committed to you that concord should react well how the hell is concord going to know about in the first place also you do realize that if they still from you that you can then go a kill them for a set amount of time not that i can flip because i have better things to do with my time but realize it is part of the game
whats wrong with can flippers
nohello kitty online is that way 
hmmmmm noif you want sov go to normal 00 and earn sov and the right to upgrade it in wspace you can make a  load of isk as it is so in my book keep carebear 00 wspace as it is
so i was thinking we might for a change of pace stop suggesting stupid ideas in the assembly hallthen i read this thread and realized my hopes were vainthank you for diminishing my dreams of a brighter tomorrow
well i have learned alot just from the few posts you have put up changing the thread name to canceled i agree with your comments the market can be manipulated and you either have to implement a harsh andor sever system or none at all which honestly since i dont cheat the insurance system in eve i dont even use insurance it doesnt even begin to cover the costs of the majority of the ships i flythanks everyone for the commentscheers
i can respect that good luck on your ventures
hell yes my insightful comments on lowsec are now official
something tells me cortante got drive by doomsdayed and never fully recovered lolthis csm brought a lot of good ideas to ccp and we gave them well thought out feedback on new features and proposed solutions to some issues we had raised and previous csms have raised the csm as an institution is now poised to really put pressure on backlogunfinished featuresbalancing type problems in a way that is unprecedented in the mmo world you can be doubtful that whats in the minutes will be realized but to look at that and say all we accomplished was whined about lag and told them to put the lowsec dd back is a pure troll and i should know nidia is in my corp
thank you xhagen for putting the minutes up i eagerly expect the dev blog now as well as rest of blogs ccp agreed to put out as for csm 40 we managed to get some big stuff on the move and i am so proud of it contrary to the impressions these meeting minutes leave none of those subjects passed without a large and long discussion some topics had most heated discussions going on like dominion docking games factional warefare etcso to point once more these minutes are more of a short summary of what went onverone tnx for the compliment we do try
dont post much on the forums there is so much i still dont understand and have no understanding of but i have to say great job i am avid reader of the csm forums and am very interested is where eve is going i must say thank you for the time and effort this has taken i have read every set of minutes and found youre efforts and thoughts to be outstanding keep up the good work and maybe just maybe well end up with a game that is not only not broken but one that we can be proud of and continue to enjoy o7 csm
wowim really happy with the accomplishments of this ccp term and overall the news looks great i have a lot of  trepidation  about the undockingoverview discussion as i think that while this is a boost to pvp groups it hurts industrialists who are trying to make money by serving 00 markets i hope csm will think hard about this before ccp decides to run with the idea and think about ways in conjunction with ccp to help balance the equation out as one of many reasons already highlighted that makes the nullsec barrier to entry high is lack of access to effective marketsthanks for all the work on the minutes  really great to see inside this discussions and the greater transparency is very very much appreciatedps  i would definitely buy a onetime authenticator look at blizzards take rate
wow the csm has come a long way since the first onethe last stakeholder point was the ost interesting  would like to know more of what this actually meanscheers
id like to see any scam cant dock change be merged with a previously raised idea ie apply only to people who have agressed or repped in the last 5 mins or so 15 mins could be a bit too longthis would mean people warping to a station to dock would be able to do so and people undocking then docking again would be fine however people undocking then agressing on station could be held therei guess we will have to see where it goes
so since we heard about ndahow much of the meeting is under nda how much isnt13 not under nda 23s under nda13 under nda 23s not under nda5050
this very much sothe problem with pointed unable to dock is that it would effectively mean that one or two afk cloaker in a system would prevent individual dreadcarrierjf movements to that system due to the session change timer would be too easy to catch lone caps that jump into station dock range by just doing a uncloak bubblepoint cyno profit maneuveryes sure the station holder could deploy some cover for the jump yaddayadda nice theory in practice it would just mean that afk cloakers get even more annoyingi have no issues forcing anyone who engages outside station to actually fight it out instead of deaggrodock but pure point no dock is both illogical wtf does warp drive scrambling have to do with docking and turns 00 logistics even harder buffing up afk cloaker lameness by quite a bit
i think 13 would be about right from projects related to current and summer  winter expansion packs
btw i put a link to this thread in my sig trying to get as many people to read it as possible
csm is now going to be a stakeholder within the ccp development  ooc o n g r a t u l a t i o n s to that enormous leap in importance well done csm  well done ccp 
every time i read logs by the csm meetings i cant help to think that the csm really doesnt do anythingcsm look at thisccp mehits getting kindda silly
thanks for the prompt posting of the minutes it was an interesting readi like this idea just a small notification on the character screen or an ingame mail along the lines of you havent changed your password for 30 days something nonintrusive that can be ignored or deleted in seconds but also raises awareness for the playeri can think of an event where this affected at least 2 csm representitives on the same grid the best way to get issues put forward indeed definitely a reasonable request thoughplease tell me these were not the only improvements you discussed and the possibility of letting them use cov ops cloaks was at least hinted at 
best meeting note everthat aside i am very pleased to see the obvious increase in the quantity of this implementation of the csm over the last one nice work
nice work id suggest using assembly subforum and features to be investigated sticky there so that each subject raised by ccp can be discussed and you get feedbackwell done on stakeholder status
that is a good thing if you take into account that csm represents about 5 of eve population
overview when docked would be awesome as well as hopefully 360 directional scanner and implemented right the scramble denying docking could potentially make the game much better imho
all the good ideas are mineall the bad ideas are someone elses probably song li
thats what he gets for not being elvs friend
believe it or not i think this is more of a boost to those who are currently griefer targets than the griefers themselves drawing from my experience as the guy who usually goes and fights those griefers on the industrial corps payroll they heavily abuse the docking games tactics available now whereas industrialists and casual players tend to be victims we dont know what final form this will take obviously but if the principle holds it should level the playing field a bit in the victims favor while increasing the overall amount of pvp which will keep all pvpers happy except for those that currently rely on docking games  neutral rr for successas to the itll make carrier logistics in 00 hard have you ever considered fighting back its a carrier not a ship that can protect itself well maybe you shouldnt be moving it around without any escort with hostiles in local then give your pvpers something to do ask them to kill whoever is pointing you
what aleks said  it will emphasise the teamplay element of eve it is after all a mumorpuger
catch 22people dont vote for csm because they dont see results csm dont get support because of the lack of votersthe hope is that the stakeholder status will actually give people a reason to vote next time
more like stfu s is for soften silly similar acronyms
if there was an equal isk sink put in place that effected poss and sbu manufacture i dont see why not but i am having difficulty seeing the why tbh
since blackops are being reviewed thanks to the csm he is my personal wish listswap the cloaked velocity bonus for a jumpportal range bonusremove scan resolution penalty for fitting cloaking devicesswap panther speed bonus for a projectile tracking bonusswap sin agility bonus for hybrid rof or tracking bonususe standard t2 resists for all blackops battleships
should give them more base jump range than carriers imo
i would also like to see this showing all portraits can be redundant if you are like me and all your alts look the same p
please visit your user settings to reenable images
while i only like some of the ideas mentioned i think 10 is the most important scale the riskreward towards highsec
up up and away keep supporting
yepi can think of a few occasions when ive silently wished for this
i live in a wh mate tell me about it 
much needed
completely agree
its the little things that make a ui good this proposal is one of those things
supportedi came up with another con though more stuff in the already full right click menu
do it
yes
i am very kind to dogs and other small animals so i figure i have balance in my karma and can grief my little heart out in this game war decs could be better i have fond memories of late 2006 and privateers running rough shod throughout high sec
mmk people id like to end this here whatever you think is not true and high sec is not ing safe wars or not in my case not you will still get popped by s so deal with it  war decs just give you the chance to see your opponent and fight backhigh sec gank tear dont go afk and fall asleep outside of jita kids
i wonderthe people who think griefers and pirates are de facto sociopaths and potential serial killers  have they been brought up sitting indoors watching teletubbies all day did they get stuck in lala land somewhere along the line ill think about it some more next time i go muff diving
i have not asked to make it free for 500 ppl corps are there anyway corps that big out there quite the opposite i said make it so that new and small corps have some safe time some protected time in eve to develop themselves and after that they are free to become camped by the usual griefers a few weeks up to a couple of months should help them out of course the usual pvp people will thumb it down i suspect they are eager for easy killswell that happens already and was suggested in another form by the same griefpeople over and over in this thread people will leave the corp and join a npc corp do you think this is the idea behind joinging and creating a corp do you think that was the intention of ccp when creating the corp mechanics to be forced to leave a corp just because some stupid real life loser is bored and wants some cheap kills yb harassing a newbie corpto prevent this from happening i proposed some time in protected mode for the newly created corp otherwise we coudl just freeze corp creation new corps will stand no chance against the older ones and against griefers anyway
if that is true and i doubt it its probably because of your constant crying on the forums attracting attention and from the sound of it you are doing nothing at all to discourage them
could you please explain how something that is handed out more than once still qualifies as unique to youand what is a little less unique is it a comparable concept to a bit pregnantnew players want the old shinyshiny toys of course with barely 3 years of eve im still drawn towards that bling but the reason it blings so bright is that fact that it is so rare handing them out regularly just diminishes itand back to the real topic i prefer to invent items for which there are t2 bpos less mathchallenged inventors ruining my margins the inventiononly items are swarmed by instantgratification prodnewbs that do not have the fiscal stamina to wait for a product to sell cutting their profit margins by millions per hour because they also do not understand how the eve market worksis having onemultiple t2 bpo more convenient than 700 drone inventions in 7 days hell yes been there and done it but thats really all there is convenience if you are up to speed as an inventor you can easily outperform the profits of pretty much 80 of the t2 bpos and keep up with even owners of multiple t2 bpo of the mediumhigh range there are a few players who have a decent amount of the absolute top t2 bpos yes which they collected and worked for over the years yesand they will outprofit me buhu how mean of themthe top daytraders in jita outprofit me too because i do not nearly have the same amount of liquid isk to work the market like they do and chances are they earned their initial money from static 1010s are somesuch which i wont ever be able to do but seriously that doesnt mean ccp should seize their walletsyou all seem to suffer from what in colloquial german is called neideve is a persistent game universe past successes as well as faults cast their shadows upon todays gameplay this is what makes eve eve grow a pair use your elbows and stop mimimimimimimiing about the game being unfair to youits intendedccp does not even dare to fully reimburse a dreadnought that an account hacker sold for 2 million isk on the regular market because it interferes with the player market but removing legitimately traded items with a trade volume in the hundreds of billions of isk thats just fine how do the players get reimbursedwhat about original owners that won them themselves are they cut short because they never sold them what about people that stole them sacrificing the one thing isk cant buy  trust  and got branded thieves to acquire itwhat value is attached to thatin conclusion poorly presented poorly thought out lacking fundamental understanding absolutely not supported
some of us invested time and a lot of isk to buy our t2 bpos so no
i dont have one so yes lol actually invention should take precedence because the skill is there to be learned and not some cash cow that was given long before many ever started the game others may have bought them but look at the prices being able to own one of those compared to the time it takes to be able to invent i have never owned a t2 bpo but can they or can they not be researched like any other bpo i ask this since the costs for higher me on multiple bpos far outweigh costs for simply copying if t2 bpos can be copied and researched like regular bpos if so a max run t2 bpo copy with an me50 compared to the highest an invented t2 bpc can go with number of runs if not disregard but still approved
this pretty much sums up the mentality of people supporting this thread  at least you havent tried to fabricate some thinlyveiled disguise to dress your sentiment up inyes they can  however this fact is not responsible for why the margins are so tight on invention  my earlier post explains whysort of but not really  it is possible to make t2 bpc from a t2 bpo but there is a reason you never see t2 bpc copied from bpo on contracts the copying time is punitive  significantly longer than the time it takes to build the actual t2 item itselftherefore to make running t2 bpc from bpo worthwhile you would have to sell the bpc for more than the cost of the built items it could produce which is why you never see them
well i have tried to address this feedback on that would of course be welcome as i see it the value of a t2 bpo consists of the followingan implicit valuation of the profit to be made with it over a number of yearsa much smaller premium for having access to the bposo if a certain bpo makes you 5 billion a year at full capacity you might value it for a three year break even at 15  5 say this certainly seems to be the way sell order discussions go most of the time the only reason you would justify a higher premium is if you have additional bpos and you can control an entire market segmentin any case the first part of this value is addressed by this proposal convert the bpo into enough bpcs to last for x years the premium is lost but the profit is not
with barely three years of eve you should know that ccp has in many cases withdrawn items from the market with a compensation scheme i suggest you read through some of the descriptions of pos modules next time you are bored
invention  t2 bpo while i dabbled i made 20b easy in a few months time and supplied myself with t2 modsships on top inventor is not tied to one item so not as badly affected by market fluctuations there is no real limit other than raw skills to the number of t2 bpcs the inventor can have cooking at any one time most t2 bpos have due to their age been soldresold countless times thus represent significant investments for current ownersneed any more reasons why it is a silly ideathe only thing i longed for while i dabbled was for some way to manipulate the me of the invented bpcs  for the option of making it positive or at least not as negativeif you allow for that even a little bit then bpo owners will be forced to become inventors just to compete due to sheer volume thus effectively removing whatever perceived advantage they might have
a single nearly unused pos module got removed from the game by flipping all the npc sell orders to buy orders that had the virtue of being exact and explicit in its compensation value as opposed to t2 bpos whose value swings wildly and is very hard to determine also theres enough value of them in the game that we could expect their removal and replacement with cash to cause a really notable spike of inflation
no such thread would be complete without me voting yes for this one right  so here i am putting it in when i suspend my accounts i still put t2 bpos are reason for that btw at least someone reads those i assume i ofc have many accounts and they kinda blink on and off on semiregular basis overall i would not hold my breath over it arguments for and against have been presented many times already and im sure ccp guys have read em also already on several occasions
its hard enough responding to the real criticism without having to answer this sort of stuff but lets do it as a one off go back up to the first post and read the proposal point out the part where it says replace them with cash
that is a lie and not what is proposedplease present a math proof that replacing a me15 bpo with x years worth of me1 bpcs preserves the bpos profit over these x years
instead of accusing people of lying stop making assumptions i did not specify a fixed amount of bpcslength of time in my proposal ccp would have to work that out ccp has specifically asked that proposals should not provide details of solutionsyour mistake is to assume that the profit of a bpo over x years will have to be provided for with x years of bpcs this does not have to be the case it can be y years
yes after all if someone has thought to tie up his capital for 3 years it make no difference is you tie it up for 10 years  after all we will be still here in 10 years and if bpo owners get multiple bpc to cover those y years so the capital is not tied up for the full period you have the net effect of increasing t2 production you seem to have a hard time grasping the aftereffects of your suggestions this seem a fairly precise amount of time and a specific me maybe you should redo your proposal
as someone that makes darn near all the isk i have in game through invention i find the concept that the t2 market would be broken open by getting rid of t2 bpos questionable at best while i am not sure how much research cuts the cost for bpo owners their effect on profit for the inventor is negligible at best though with the build requirements for ships being adjusted oh so many patches ago i assume a t2 ship bpo owner is rolling in isk as the me effects the armor plate requirements the most unless ccp thought of that and adjusted t2 ship bpos however that assumes forethought on the side of ccp which we all know through experience is a laughable jestoh and not supported why are there so many people want this game to be fair stop trying to ruin this game you bastards
i would like to be able to rename my ships without having to be in said ship now this is not a huge issue it is one of those convenience things that would just make everyones lives a bit easier plus i dont see this being really difficult to implement

not sure that is accurate probably boils down to whenhow a given database entry can be modified or some such spreadsheets in space remember would be a most welcome addition though
can we just have a thumbs upthumbs down links on the op please instead of having to reply
same argument was stated in defence of the old horrible probe systembeing a master of poor ui doesnt make good ui a bad thing
theres nothing actually wrong with the ui while improvements can still be made its not really limited or poornot everyone uses the basic 4 probes drop down a size and move them closer approach most of us who actually live in wspace have probing techniques that involve up to all 8 probes in a set pattern to facilitate faster probingwhile changing the spread will help you get higher signature strengths for that particular pattern not saying its a bad idea at all different arrangements are used for different things and setting them up accurately takes time the goal here is to be able to save that setup and recall and reuse itexamplein my home system i want to put probes over each planet to check for signature locality i can recall a setup that has the probes already arranged in the same layout as the planets in my system because i positioned them before and saved it i adjust the xyz slightly with shiftdrag and away we goi find a new signature and want to use a 4 probe tetrahedron to pin it down i recall my tetrahedron setup and then ctrldrag to resize it  and pin down the new signature its a wormholeneighbouring system has 50 signatures in it i need a fast sweeper pattern using all 8 probes to eliminate undesirable signatures quickly couple of clicks and i call it up30 minutes later i have a handful of unidentified signatures left and i need to go back to my tetrahedron to get some decent strength hits on them which is fine because i can just load the pattern that was saveddoes it still not seem beneficial to you
well up for thisalso to your point teadaze  id say probing for ships right now is too hardin fact ill go one further  probing for ships is practically impossibleassuming the pilot of the ship youre after is not some stoned zombie or afk absolutely anything can evade the clutches of a prober no problem at all  youre relying on a lack of awareness a blunder or coincidence if you wana catch someone by probing them outcurrently you have a better chance of success by using the directional scanner to find approximate direction and picking a likely warpable object lying on that plane and chancing your arm warping to thati dont know exactly how ccp thought combat probes would be used but to have brought about a situation where a default tool included with any ship is more effective in terms of chanceofsuccess than a specialised ship using specialised equipment smells of fkup to me
yes
i like this idea seems reasonable
i like the allow shrink wrapping without courier contract idea better but this is a good start
00 is supposed to be dangerous  you cannot expect to be able to carebear away with impunity just because you have sov  if you have a cloaked neuthostile in local you need to make damn sure your operation is equipped to cope with him whether he shows up or notif you dont you deserve to pay the price if you cant then you dont deserve to be a 00 space holdertrying to foist the responsibility for safeguarding your 00 operations onto ccp is not the way forward  if you are the sovereign force in the system you police it
qft
not supported
basically im a carebear i started missionrunning to get sum standing but now im really thinking about selling my oreship and going on only with missionrunning cause its fun its interactive and it needs my attraction mostlynext step for me is an upgrade from bc to bs some weeks ago it was upgrading from retriever to hulkthe strangest part overall for me isim able to keep up my ammoproduction some 100ks of mediumcharges a week by refining the loot i dont even need to think about reactivating my oreship and with the lps i get the ammo is easily transformed into factionchargesso yeah mining needs some love and some fresh ideas
summer expansion is supposed to be industry mostly not sure what exactly they have planned for mining though
hence this is why it could be awesome if the csm could ask ccp what their plans arejust sayoh hey ccp we heard something about comet mining and planet ring mining at fanfest 09 hows that goingccps answer noo our souls will be scarred forever because you said the mwordor something like that p
last thing i heard on mining was in 2008 after fanfest about revamping the system for plantary belt mining no word since then except wed like to do something at 2009 fanfest
i think the team working on it got bored and were distracted by minigamesan update on what is happening would be nice
i believe another person made the same proposal one or two days agoif you want sov go to normal 00 and fight to get it in wspace carebear 00 you can make a ridicules amount of isk fast the downside to this is that you have to do a bit of logistics to get it all running smoothlysov and stations are just a big no go in my book in carebeard 00 you are relatively safe as it is and with sov and stations carebear 00 would be almost untouchable is the sov in wspace going to be the subject of the month in like missile threads has been please just stop now
well for a start i think you might find the sleepers would object to you taking sov in their space your big shinny outpost wouldnt be yours for long once they awokepart of the point of w space is that it is different to normal space it is supposed to feel like somewhere distant foreign and inhospitable so being able to build a safe home there is against the whole ethos of w space
actually id like to point out that wh contrary to popular belief is taken in my mind and the sleepers have been there waaaay longer but i suppose youd like an official answer as to why nowh leads to space far far away billions of lightyears so this is why no jump gates no cynos leading to them no comms no local no market nothing you have yourself and any friends you brought it as for capital ships they are not brought into most holes but rather built at the pos that players setup there also no stargate makes it extremely difficult for sov and if you start putting the outposts at one point it becomes very easy to booby trapfinally in closing id like to say that its not practical anyways because then youd have to pay for the free version of null sec  you already get the rarest ores the best salvage and its far more safe than null sec as its much harder to find you know i ask you why do you want to put a tax on this
its because sovereignty is simply recognition by concord  ded that you have staked your claim to an area of unpoliced space but which falls under their jurisdiction in as much as they provide and maintain the stargate and associated comms network in the systemwh space is unknown there is no concord infrastructure present in the systems  so how can they recognise sovereignty in italso the wh systems are miles from anywhere  you cant cyno between them because theyre too far apartthe bottom line is if you recognise sov and have the systems mapped so jump technology be it cyno gen jump bridge star gate whatever can be applied it stops being unknown space and becomes simply 00
currently on page 2and each topic is met with the same response as a member of the largest resident wormhole corp at present i can safely say we do not want these mechanics in our space
bump
since the buff cloaking vessels got last year especially bombers weve seen them taking a far more active posture and they fulfil the covert ops niche role gracefully this leads to me amongst others thinking about it as a way of electronic warfare ecm has a counterpart eccm sensor dampening has a counterpart sensor boosting tracking computers have tracking disruptors and speed is countered by webs scrams and targetpainters there is however no way to influence the advantage a cloak brings to peopleof course this is part of their role but i think there should be a way to eighter prevent cloaking on grid or search for the location of a cloaker in system i envision there are loads of other techniques possible how about we put some of those in this thread so maybe the csm can take it up to ccp to take a look at them this thread isnt intended to discuss the feastability of this tactic since we wont get a unifying stance on that im afraidwith regardshighfield
disclaimer i fly cloaked ships myself i believe cloaking is a great mechanicbut i also think it needs some sort of counter nothing as drastic as being able to probe out cloaked ships or any other nerf to that extent but something if you have something constructive to add on this topic please do sok
black star might be a bit butthurt from panda team stealthbomber drops
there is a counter already target cloaking ship no cloakif you think about having anticlaok stuff in game first you have to remove all the disadvantages for using one think about it would you like having instalocking claokers that you cant decloak by proximity youd need the special module for that after allstop whining about cloakers there are quite a few ways to counter them and it only needs smart flying not supported
im not sure i see how you made the leap from a ship being able to cloak to cloaks being a form of electronic warfareelectronic warfare as i understand it is the use of electronic disruption devices to disable or negatively affect the operation of a ships weaponspropulsiontargetting systemscloaking devices do none of these things and moreover they negatively affect the propulsion and targetting systems of the ship theyre fitted to whichever way i look at it i cannot see how a cloaking device would fit in to the category of electronic warfare system  its simply not its just an electronic systemyou also state in your post that there is no way to influence the advantage a cloak brings to people when in fact there is  proximity if you get close enough to a cloaked ship the cloak is deactivated without the pilots consentif you wish to increase your chances of a successful decloak you need to increase your effective size popping your drones and selecting return and orbit is an example of how to do thismuch as id love to be able to track down decloak and kill all the iskfamers proliferating in my neck of the woods i cant support this idea
for as far as the proximity goes youre totally right this feature still should be in place i am therefore not pledging for a decloaking device but a way to get on grid with those ers so the proximity thing can actually be used think of it as a way to give the cloakhunters a way to get the fight to the cloaker once detected it is purely on the skill of the cloaky pilot to eighter evade ships on grid warp out bless if you have a covops cloak or sit tight and hope the best for it this makes catching macroratters possible and gives the cloakhunters at least a chance to get a fight against those annoying red cloakers in home systems i do however think that a slight increase in the proximity factor to lets say 5km is viable
perhaps the problem is not the cloak but your pilots if you dont like the cloak there is still some mission to run in empire 
this and a cloak comes with disadvantagesweaknesses in a lot of ways a cloak is its own countermeasure andif the stealth bombers are having a much larger impact on the game after being changed bombers are the common scapegoatexample in these discussions thats an entirely different thread
would it  to add a new dimension to ransoming youd have to know what the implants were before you destroyed the pod surelyfinding out after the event that you just destroyed 2bnworth of implants might give you an additional bellychuckle but its not going to pad your wallet out any
aye simple is not better eve is not about simple people who play eve didnt stay with eve because of its simplicity fire or just f whoever thought simplifying anything in eve would be a good idea
i think they mean the npc only corporation not the npc corporations that players can joinif that is not the case i fully agree with youthe 7 options suggestion seem a decent minimal compromise in any case after some thought supportedrereading the blog i noticed thisi am wrong or it can create even more problems when setting refining tax
supportedespecially with the new fleet finder and the option to invite ppl via standing the more detailed standings can be very handyeg you have corporations you are blue with 5 but dont want to fleet with but otoh you have corporations you are blue with too but do want to fleet invite this you could do by setting the standing to eg 6keep the detailed but streamline the uialso most if not all of eve is to complexcomplicated issues are linked to the horrible ui not the complexity of the game
for pvp please absolutely no logical reason why ewar does show and neuts do not
signed
tickshould be an easy one to implement too
ccp confuses me cuz theyll tell you things you shouldnt know like whose damping you or scraming but not nosneuts which are less geared towards importance in the pvp ladder depending on sit
i have 2 solutions currentlyfirst is disbanding corps and replacing them with channels thus hiding the members list and avoiding wardecs with one movethe other option is to create a bunch of trial alts and sign them up to the corp to hide the real members in garbage datawhich does ccp prefer we doobtainable through ingame spying google surfing intelligence gathering or via some kinda of apilogserver hackif its a hack then sure a level playing field is good i take the same position when it comes to macrominershowever if this advanced means is simply the collecting of a list of known members then this is not a problem to be fixed or an unlevel playing field in any way shape or formi can understand the social reasons for the thinking i can understand that people need to be seen to be connectedi however can not agree on ccp deciding to publish private corp information just to have long friends lists on a social network
its actually possible to put together a list of every member in every corp in the game if you really wanted to the character namespace is finite so it can be searched exhaustively to find every character name in eve then just run 700k show info commands and voila list of members for every corp in new eden nobody has done this in game because the interface is terrible and the game will sniff a macro a mile away doubly so when you have to keep redoing it to keep your data fresh but when you put a show info tool on the web well someone will write a crawler bot in the first evening to run regular downloads of it at that point membership lists are out of the bag and you might as well make them public to avoid information asymmetry what ccp needs to do is figure out a way to throw a wrench into the proceedings one obvious choice is to hardlimit how often you can do show info queries but i wouldnt give a plugged nickel for the chances of that holding up against some bored hacker similarly they could try to make it hard to put names to corps or remove search functions for player names or something but those seem like very big hammers to use if they cant stop it then it comes down to a question of whether intelgathering or a functional show info is a more important part of the postspacebook game of eve and to be honest i dont know this is not as simple as youre making it out to be theres good reasons why ccp is asking this question and its not because theyre dumb
limiting the amount of information shown on spacebook by default seems like a sensible solutioneg by default make employment history hidden to nonfriends
can we have a nice easy sorting option so we can easily see what needs recycling and what doesnt something that is in game and doesnt require me giving my api out 
been proposed raised to ccp and confirmed as an intended addition already great idea but no need to support it more
ahh briliant ermm i did try to look into it not hard enough i guess where was this posted  linked as confirmed
supportedautomatic logging when enabled in fleet window seems a reasonable idearegarding lag issues i dont think itd be a problem after all since you already receive the data from server its only a matter of keeping another file to append to no big deal
ofcource
typhoon is quite awesome as it is suck it up and train the skills and youll fall in love like many others have otherwise fly one of the other battleships and leave us alone
i do
is hard not to be an ass responding this since ive been through the training for t2 launchers to make the phoon work and now i jealously guard anyone messing about with my swiss army knife however i do understand the frustrations of some minnie bs pilots with the fact that their tier 1 bs is the hardest in the game to skill for by a flippin huge margin and this is only made more frustrating by the fact that the tier 2 bs is a pile ocrud for the traditional roles read rr work that the phoon fills so admirablywhile it may be tempting to want to screw around with the phoon to make life easier it has been that way for too long and too many pilots have given soooo much skill training time to it for it to changed so drastically now removing the split hislots from the phoon would be like giving them to the domi just dont do itccp may have been attempting to address the problem of accessible rr bs for minnies when they switched the hps on the pest as if anyone really knows wtf they are thinking but in reality they made a poor bs worse than in already was as the switch in hps directly contradicts one of the few good points the pest has its base speedi wish there was an answer for you mate but it really seems that minnies just have to put up with more training than other races to be viable as frankly at least in the bs class the other options are just fing terrible sorry but not supported
drake draconis perhaps if you posted on a character that actually pvpd and therefore had been involved in medium to large fleet fights your opinion on post dominion pvp might have some validity
so let me get this straightthis is a whine thread about lag 
gigar again another carebear alt that has not been in any pvp engagementscertainly dominion has made 00 much more lucrative for individual pilots but if like me you play this game for the fleet pvp it is 100 broken this is not a new issue i understand that the csm has already asked for dominion to be rolled back this is not an issue that is going away
huh gigar is certainly not a carebear alt and ive most certainly been involved with massive 00 fleets so i know what the lag is about pjust because i suck at pvp doesnt mean that i dont do iton topicdominion introduced some really really nice things system upgrades yay usefull scs yay so to call a rollback to solve some of the lag noccp have already stated that they are working hard on solving the issues with fleet lag so its just patience thats required now
odd of you to call what i did weaseling all i did was give the entire quote in context and highlight the most relevant parts where i come from we call that an exercise in comprehension you on the other hand provided a snippet taken out of context you then went on to extrapolate from other sources real or imagined to support your erroneos position hell you even did it again this timei will leave it to all who read the full quote in context to judge who the weasel is mmkay
i think i understand your position 1 you oppose a general buff to missiles as a whole because a they do not need one as an entire class and b such a general buff might cause a game breaking imbalance2 you think that a module which either increases range explosion velocity or explosion radius of all missiles is the kind of op general buff that might cause just such an imbalancehave i got it right so farif so did you have the same opinion when the already existing modules that do similar things for all turrets got a a general buff are those the kind of game breaking general buffs you are opposed to funny i must have missed that postoh now go on and tell me that was just a tweek that only provided a little more balance more turret ships are dropping a low slot damage propulsionor tankmod just for that little tweak and not just on minmatar ships you see it was a general buff to all turret users a general buff that many might say was not needed and further widened the gap between turrets and missilesbut let me be clear i do not think that buff was game breaking i do agree wit the op and think such a buff highlights the need for similar modules for missiles howeverincreasing falloff on existing tracking enhancer mods for turret users did not break the game anymore than introducing similar mods for missiles would there must be balance in the forceps general buff
sigh you are always the sameguns have been balanced and rebalanced for ages around having those modules you and your pals want missiles to be buffed with one op or more new modulesyou and your pals dont want to pay anything for that buff so yes it is a general buff a no costit is the same reason why drones will not get new modules it would require to rebalance the whole weapons system if you really feel that missiles need a general rebalance state that listing what you want to get and what you are willing to paywe want fastest damage delivery and more range as a secondary effectwe dont want to pay for that we dont care for balance between different weapons systemsseem to sum up what was proposed here very well
hell no i dont want 00 to be a safezone but tbh its annoying when you see a bunch of cloakers in local and you have a fleet ready to catch them  but there is not even an inefficent or expensive option to deal with them its just a game of when they get bored and leavegoing into an enemy system cloaked getting some kills for maybe 30 mins or an hour should be possible any longer is a pestilence
new topic is not reply topicand patience is a virtue if he wants to wait longer his choice you just needs enough balls to undock and be prepared for their attack
i second this proposal perhaps one could also give additional incentive to fc who succesfully lead a fleet of a cirtan size maybie have a fleet mission that rewards all the members and gives a rare item or something simular to the fc
and there is huge amount of people who just dont care about the game 12 months away so the representation factor is a lot larger when you only count people with an active interest in the game
it will put an end to docking games because nobody will be willing to undock i understand your frustration but this is not the way to go about it there are a multitude of scenarios where someone can find themself scrammed without initiating agro capitals jumping in landed 1000m off a station from warping in kickout stations the fix is pretty simple scale the agro timer by ship size perhaps 2 mins for bs 5 mins for caps and introduce agro for rr simples
interesting especially the part where csm getting the potential to affect backlog prioritieshowever im not sure i like the whole scrammed and unable to dock thing to prevent docking games ie what happens when you warp to a station and someone instalocks before you can dock im far more in support of the idea of increased docking timers and potentially self destruct timers which was discussed at the last fanfest as the ship size grows ie frigs having 1 minute cruisers 1 and 12 and so on no hard numbers just to give an idea
i would take it a step further docking time based on real hitpoint amount that way platedtrimarked ships would need to survive much longer and it would also make rr games much harder
there was a discussion about the pros and cons of including the member lists of corporations the reason ccp wants to include the list is that its already possible to obtain this list albeit through advanced means and ccp feels it would level the playing field if everyone had access to itspending hours scouring killboards for a list of possible corp members and then more hours verifying them in game is not easy getting a spy into a corp to get a list of members is not easy both of these are valid intelligence jobs that i have done in the past ccp should not be removing unusual corp jobs like this and they shouldnt be making something that is hard to do now into something anyone can do in 2 clicks you might as well say it is possible to fire a dd through advanced means and it would level the playing field if any noob with an ibis could do itplease insist eve gate is an entirely opt in feature i dont want farcebook etc exposing my private information irl and nor do i want ccp doing it in eve
damnit not a whisper about market management of deliveries which in its current state is atrocious not able to sort by range systemconstellationregion filtering ect as personal assets are currentlynothing said about the horrible pos interface for well everything from managing weapons to refining no refinery timer in the ui at all to manufacturingresearch its just flat out abysmaldestroyers got a shrugunfinished expansions got laughed off the board cosmos fw etcwhile im pleased to see the minutes posted in a clear understandable format within days of completion i am little satisfied with the topics that were brought up none beyond shares investments concerned the industrial side at alland wth came up with the idea of a scrambled ship not being able to dock at many stations youre trapped dead regardless either you try to wait out the timer and find yourself 20 or more km from the station and scrambled before you can twitch or at stations with huge radii you spam the dock button like mad and get pinned down by an interceptor unable to dock or escape while the blob comes rushing inthat needs an alternate function to limit docking gamesin the end thumbs down
lots of cynics on this forum im so surprised er well done ccp and csm dont let the whiners win this is still very unique amongst games
if you look at the meeting 5 minutes you will see that these topics were not on the list of issues and thus not on the agenda i suggest you moan at the industrial related csm reps for not bringing up this stuff
sigh moan athave you been wearing blinders its been mentioned spoken of pushed and screamed about since the day you got electedclearly anything that does not involve blowing something up it is simply not worth putting any consideration into yeah i do my share of pvp and the holes in that leave a sour taste in my mouth just as much as the poorly managed logistics backend but i dont need to say anything about pvp flaws every csm board has been dedicated to them at the expense of every thing elseat least the particolored mining lasers were not brought up oh of course industrial side again
then you should poke the reps that deal with that sort of stuff instead of going full  against the entire csmand poses were discussed at length but if its not in the minutes im afraid we cant tell you much about the results
im fully aware of this and have been pointing out that people should speak to the industrial focussed csm reps about itincorrect analysiswe have 9 csm reps and we typically deal with 15 or so issues per meeting this means each rep can raise a couple of issues and have at least one accepted for discussioni was not voted in on a platform of industrial improvements so why should i be picking up those issues when i have less knowledge in industrial matters over issues that reflect the platform i did run onwe have industrial people on the csm and they are the ones best placed to pitch those issues they have more knowledge than me about the impact etc but so far it appears they dont think those issues need to be picked upim pretty certain those were on the minor issues list thus didnt need to be discussed further
sorry teadaze but could you maybe explain an old and possibly somewhat grumpy guy the discrepancy of your quote to the statement i found at the what is the csm page at evelopediasince this is among the first pages any nooblet to the csm idea stumbles across it sounds somewhat confusing
getting development time is a very good move but apart from that the whole meeting sounded very disappointinghybrids whine from gallente hurts sure they got not that much range but they do a hell of a lot of damagethe webnerf hurt them more than the fast flying minni so i do see a point but nerfing projectile comeonthats just ridiculousalsopure stupidityccp somehow just cant get into their head that for a working game they need a transition from highsec to lowsec to 00 because so far every part of the eveverse is played differentlyfactional warfare at least some stepping stone between all out pvp in 00 and the carebear hands holding in empire they new sov system was their first step into overhauling 00 but imho the same stuff should be introduced into lowsec though not with all the benefits and all the upgradesthe four militias should be allowed to install upgrades up to lvl3 in their factional warfare zones to upgrade these systems this would allow players to learn and play around with sov stuff that they will face in 00for those that think that is overpowered thing again it is actually much harder to keep stuff running in lowsec than in 00 due to the fact that neutrals will be involved either as scouts spais 3rd parties or just messing with your brainso all in all ccp show again the lack of any knowledge or understanding of game developmentvery disappointed
