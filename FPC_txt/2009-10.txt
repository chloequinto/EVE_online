supported as long as it consumes nanite repair paste to fix the dronesamazing verys who would have thought you had a good idea
supported i like your idea of using consuamable items for repairs which is good and helps keep everything check but perhaps another type of item or perhaps a new repair paste item for carrier repairsvery true on your input but i would also like to add that carriers can only repair a limited amount of fightersdrones once theyre sent to maint bay jz like a real life carrier they cant repair all planes at once  perhaps max 5 at any one time and perhaps new skills to improve repair rate and max number of simultaneous repairs my 2 cents

the balance in the destroyer class is not very good thrasher is head and shoulders above the rest it has adequate power grid and gets the all important damage bonus the others just dont really compare destroyers as a class will need some additional help if the af 75 ab thing goes through interdictors also need a lot of balancing between ships of the same class  all of them are pretty much horrible except the sabre
not enough destroyers in pvp
i agree with a little rocket love even the ammars heritic would rock
if we cant have them fixed can they at least be renamed to roflkets
rockets definitely need a lot of work absurdly low explosion velocity several orders of magnitude too low other frigate weapons do not rely on your target to be double webbed to do any effective damage neither should rocketslow damage for a short range weaponabsurdly high fitting costs rocket launcher takes three times the cpu of a 150mm ac and does less damage it also takes twice the powergrid though this would be an acceptable cost if rockets didnt suck horribly missile using frigates lack in fitting across the board this is true of kestrels hawks hookbills and worms frigate launchers are just too hard to shoehorn in the standard missile launcher is similarly too hard to fit for some reason missile frigates are handicapped in terms of fitting compared to gun frigates which really shouldnt be the case

this would be a great idea it would decrease the database load for all the individual bms that are just copies and allow corpsalliances to maintain a common set by tieing it into a corporate role you can cofigure who has access to see them and modify them great for fcs scouts and wh colonists who spend a lot of time getting copies of bms
absolutely
this suggestion requires some serious support
gimme better scanner
this thread needs more cowbell
supportedat least reduce it to 1 second
support reverting it
yes the new delay drives me up the wall more so because the damn error stays on your screen for more than 2 seconds covering stuff that could be more interesting than it is
from testing subforumso can we drop this now and move on theres no point wasting any more pixels or the csms time trying to get ccp to change their mind when they have point blank said this isnt changing
supported
nop we still want it changed maybe they wont remove it but they should defo change it shorter timer unclickable button no msg no rescan on angle change etc
supported 1000000 up up we go comeon devs a small comment would be appreciated
this can work into dominion if they get a loud enough cry from the people who pay
signed again the simple concept art early in the thread is brilliant and now the sov mechanic is evolving id really like to see this implemented
agreed this needs csm to bring it to ccp again the last time it was brought up was a joke oh btw zastrow j what ever happened when you guys talked to ccp about poss care to share anything or do we have to wait for the meeting minutes which i am having a hard time finding an up to date list of current events brought up by this csm you guys need to organize things better in an easy to read format and time stamp everything in the wiki so we know what time frame everything was brought up in and when updates have been made if anywhere idk i might just be missing it but i dont think soedit correction seems the 3rd csm have used the wiki alot more then the first two great job there only nothing about poss that reguards this thread or the current poss layout and design some things suggested are nice but we would like this topic brought backedit2oh btw csm 4500 hits so far from isksense ads and expect more to come i dont think support for this topic is going to go down any if anything its going to keep increasing as a matter of fact if you havent noticed i rarely have to bump this thread myself anymore p time to take it back to ccp yes
supporting a rather epic idea
the author of the idea is named evelgrivion the candicacy for csm will start sooni propose evelgrivion for csmvote evelgrivion evelgrivion for csm
i just said what it was for its for giving temporary cap stability or letting your cap last longer  depends on what your bag is when you wouldnt normally have it for example a tackle vengeance may run its mwd or its repper permenantly but a nos will let it do both thus letting it perma tank the bs its holding down long enough for the dps to arriveyou have to counter neuts with a cap injector  assuming youre not using missiles  projectiles that isif you dont subscribe to cap injectors as a counter for neuts how do you tackle a curse
so for the fitting cost of a neut or cap injector and the loss of a weapon hardpoint a nos is suppose to give you temporary cap stabilityno thanks im gunna platelse up and maybe fit a neut or two  cap injector because the counters to neuts sucklets take your vengence for instance what where to happen to it in that instance if it tried to tackle a curse nos might keep your tankmwd running but as soon as you get neuted you die so you fit a can injector lolmids which wouldnt really work because if you managed to keep the cycle time of your injectors in sync with the point you could no longer fit as soon as it came to its reload your in troublenos was described by the devs as a possible counter to neuts right now a they provide little in the way of tactical value when provided with the alternative increasing there effect would go someway into positioning them into a good method of countering neuts
any single frigate that tackles a curse is frankly in trouble but the problem of syncing the cap booster you have in just the same way with the nos  unless what youre looking for is a dedicated nos boat ala the days of yore and lets not forget that they were the reason that the nos was nerfed in the first placealso there are nonlol vengeance fittings that work perfectly well with capboosters but its by no means compulsary one way or another its just a frig after all on the other hand any true vengeance fitting sports 3 t2 autocannons which gives you a slot free for either a small dps boost and i mean small  this is the point about tackle ships  theyre not for dps or an extra fitting option  namely the chance to sacrifice some local cap regen for taking it from your target and having more tanknos will and can never be a counter to neut any more because they will never let your cap get higher than his so once hes neuted you all a chap has to do is keep his cap empty and youll never recover thats the central crux of the nos nerf and in light of that increasing the amount taken really makes no difference
the main issue with active tanks as i see it areabsurd fitting requirements compared to buffer setups trying to fit an active tank on a caldari ship is just painful ever tried to active tank a nighthawk ha ha its not just pg intensive its cpu intensive cap boosters being an absolute necessity this makes active tanks take more med slots than buffer tanks and exacerbates the fittings problem above then of course theres the way neuts cripple active tanks and the way active tanks rapidly lose effectiveness when multiple people are shooting at you its entirely possible active tanking would be preferable to buffer tanking if just one or two of the above disadvantages held but with all four buffer tanking seems superior to active tanking in the vast majority of situations
a few scenarios where thats not true1 i have 100 gj you have 1000 gj to start with you take 20 from us both im at 80 cap while youre at 98 cap2 we both have 100 gj you take 20 from us both while im activating my shield booster taking an another 20 of mine3 i nos your friend4 you take 20 from both of us then you activate your cap boosterjust a few quick examples
all true but it doesnt change the central point and its because of one central flaw  a t2 neut takes more energy from your target than it costs to activate it if the amount taken by a nos were to be comparable to the amount taken then youd get into a situation ie almost any fleet fight where cap warfare gains you energy and theres no way that can be rightin every measurable way a cap booster is a better counter to neuts than a nos with the sole exception of going against neut boats but thats completely outside the situation youre trying to protect againstedited because i cant tell the difference betwixt a neut and a nos
change the overheat bonuses to normal bonuses and sounds great edit overhead overheating obviously fails p
1 drone motion doesnt cause lag 2 the bit about orbiting big rocks outside optimal if youre right sounds like a valid bug that should be fixed however that isnt usually how orbiting big objects works so id be surprised if you actually are right about this
signedi also made a simple suggestion to give a temp fix to hanger access
signed this is a role that carriers should have had since the beginning thats what carrier means one of the rebalancing could done that there is a limited amount of m3 a carrier can carry perhaps a skill ca be introduced to increase its amount and this m3 is shared among both pilots w their ships and the amount of dronesfighters the carrier carriesso if a carrier pilot cant bring a full fleet of dronesfighters with a full fleet of pilot ships this would give carrier pilots more meaning to life rather than rep towers  my 2 cents
like other older players i started with less sp than a current new player gets did i sit in station just training for 6 months no not even 6 minutes the new player content is doable and a good player learning experience get out there and experience it while you still have the right sp for it to be challenging
i think this cuts to the heart of the problem the people who are asking for sp boosts do not want a challenge they want to be powerful it is the same as the people who will not mission run till they can cakewalk through it training up all their skills and making sure they have an overpowered ship so they feel godly against all those piddling npc ships there are not the people who take a frigate into l2 missions or a cruiser into l3 missions
my new alt has all basic learning skills to v minus charisma and all advanced learning skills to 4 again minus charisma she is a little over 2 weeks old i admit it might have taken longer if i were truly a new player without access to 3s but still using evemon to plan and your free respec getting great learning skills really fast is very easy i assume you could do the same thing to get into a mission bc quicklythese new players are at a disadvantage threads stem from a basic misunderstanding of eve you are assuming that skillpoints  power as in wow or war where level  power i started eve back when all characters started with about 35k give or take sp and no training bonus or respec ive had fun since day one your problem is not the new player experience its your desire to equate eve with other mmos its is not and never will be the sooner you can deal with that the sooner youll be enjoying yourself
make the itty iv longer so its halfway between the iii and v in size
i for one enjoy flying a bathroom joke
this makes perfect sense as an alternate implementation if this works any better have a container of customizable size  just rightclick pick a number of m3 and your can takes up that much space and stores that much stuff seems like it might be a bit easier to use
four more years president nixon no thanksthe only part of your idea that id support would be the bit about half terms not counting
i can see a limitation on incombents running but not a complete removal of term limits having the same person on the csm indefinately to me does not breed inovation or a balancing of viewsi think this is more an internal ccp issue for all candidates its a fine line that ccp has to walk with all applicants and i wouldnt remove their right to refuse any application though for openness ccp may wish to explain their reasoning but thats an internal decisioni can support this change if it only relates to a csm stepping down to reasonable life reasons and not for instance a vialation of nda or the likes in fact i believe a violation of the nda should result in forfeiture of the csm position and banning from running againsee i see this as a reason why it would be abusedthe term limits also provide ccp an easy way to ride out a useless csm member that has support without having to deal with denying an application that could cause unfavourable press about how the csm is runi agree and support your item 3
currently there are alot of mercgriefing corps out there that do pray on defencless carebears and those ppl that say otherwise are either stupid or roam around space with their monitors turned offany moron can see that the current wardecing facility is flawed even ccp have stated as muchthis would be a great option to have within the gameatm the carebears have market pvp mission runners have oodles of missions and the pvpers have masses of systems to go pew pew in how about developing the bounty hunter side of the gamemerc corps can put themselves up for hire or become an army for hire i point to a previous post shown below
i like this man
hey maybe the carebears hit upon something  charges for hisec livinglets have docking fees and gate fees that scale with the sum of the trusec status of the last 100 systems you were in min scale  0 and the class of ship move most lvl 3  4 missions to lowsec theyre more dangerous missions  let them be in more dangerous space and kick in the fees at the same time the training bonus expires that way you can make the penalties for living in hisec punative without killing off the new player experiencesurely only griefers could disagree no
lets also charge major bribes for negative sec rated pirates to enter high sec5 times for every 1 or somethingoh im sorry guess i took your name literally
aww so cute seriously theres nothing of merit in the details of this thread sure we can argue for a revamp of the wardec system but it shouldnt be to make it harder to grief people this is eve as was said in another place to another personthis is what makes eve great anything that messes with this guiding principle needs a veto hammer
up
not 50 but they could use some boost pulses are damn close in dps and there optimal is massive
qft
pulses do a little less damage but have the luxury of staying out of web and scramble range so if things go  up they can get out if they need to if your in a blaster boat you either kill them or be killedi would support a boost in blaster damage i dont know about 50 but something needs to be done as it stands its just better to in a pulse boat instead of a blaster boat because you have options and your doing almost as much damage as blastersi do however like the idea that blasters are supposed to be doing the most amount of damage but you have to get in their face to do itincrease blaster damage
they are only fine when you choose to keep at range instead of orbiteven then they could use boost supported
i would love a reason to train blasters
i fly blaster ships all over the place but id never even consider a 50 dps hike maybe 10 for distinctiveness but even that is probably crazy make blasters able to more effectively deal their nominal damage but dont up their paper dps to ridiculous levels
i like how the sp training means most of the whiny annoying 12 year olds will play wow instead of evefor that i am truely thankful amarr men
hahahahahhaha i couldnt stop laughing when i read your post haahahaha my tummy hurts oh and no not supported yes i agree wardecs need alot of reworking and tweaking but to remove it completely only when the human race is enslaved and genocide by a superior alien invasion or when hell freezes over and satan becomes a puppy take your pick my 2 cents
in over 4 years of playing ive never lost sp due to having an out of date clone if you have then you suck stupidity should have consequences so not supported
yes because in rl we also fly in spaceships and are clones  its still a game this is a part of the game if you die and get podded just buy a new clone before you log offnot supporting this
simple solutionadd a small warning sign next to your character info like that evemon gives youwhen you undock with outdated clone a small warning sign pops up next to character portrait when you click character info a small warning sign is next you amount of skillpoints your clone can hold and the text goes red
not supported sorry but i for one do not support this idea and im generally an open minded person to many of the wacky and funky ideas in assembly hall forumbut first i dont see why a pilot cant take a max 30 seconds to jz check if his clone is up to level and you most likely only have to check it once a week or a monthand whenever youre podded how difficult is it to get a new clone even if the station has no medical facilities undock and get to one if the station is camped then you have a choice to either risk losing sp and jz stay in stationwith no risks theres no funlastlyi dont see why ccp should suffer and devote a team of already brilliant programmers to fix this problem when its the pilots responsibility forgetfulness and laziness to not checkupdate hisher clonesorry jz my 2 cents
they can add warning message in like 1 hour  testing includedlike they did with hauling contracts
loosing cash ships or standings is ok with me loosing sp isnt
i do
signedsounds good to me
ill bet that the fleet size is fixed because they use an 8 bit unsigned integer in the code the next easy jump to make in coding is to 16 bit which means youd have a fleet size of 25625665536 people which amuses me what youre lacking though is a coherent changeover strategy its all very well saying double the number of people in each squad and suchlike but these numbers arrive in game from a skill system that has to not only fulfil your criteria but also have extensibility for the inevitable 512 is too small we need more blobzors cries from the playerbase given that the proposed cap is going to be much less than the comedy 65k optionbetter optionpropose code refactoring to increase fleet memory usagerename fleet command  cohort command 255 in 1 cohort create skill fleet command allows command of up to 5 cohorts 1276 max fleet size create skill armarda command allows 1 extra cohort per skill level 2551 max fleet sizethen in the same way as corp management  megacorp management you can add skills to add sets of 5 cohorts as and when it becomes necessaryas things stand though i think your proposal is too vague to support as it is
by the numbers it looks like the cap is based on a server side limitation personally i dont see a reason not to increase the fleet limit as long as it doesnt degrade server performance if it would have a adverse effect on that id say leave it the way it is
perhaps someone has said this before but it might be a good idea to change the way and place capital ships are built and how they are stored no more building and storing them in stations for example by doing so you could increase the value of 00 space decrease capital ship numbers which in turn makes them more valuable and increase conflict in evethis is my idea in primitive form  change the capital ship build  storage system
so is this a you cant afford a capital ship so less people should have them it would take you too long to train for capitals so less people should have them or a you just got your first capital and no one thinks youre special so less people should heve them whine
maybe he picked the wrong side of the big war and gets killed by caps too often just a guess
when you reprocess a rig you get materials back when you repackage a module you get materials backhow come when you reprocess a rigged ship you dont get the rig materials back owing for loss of course or the materials from any modules fitted on the ship if you want to reprocess the entire lot
because rigs are never able to recovered this has been explained beforeedit and because its a pain for the server to think that hard
youre not recovering the rig youre recovering 80 reprocessing waste of its components
same deal once attached rigs and their components are inside the ship they cannot be removed without their loss ever
agreed imho leave the rorqual and its skill requirements alone its powerful enough alreadynext thing you know ppl r propose ccp lets rorquals into high sec p
the rorqual is not a pvp ship nor is it a pve ship it is a mining support ship as such using industrial and mining skills is perfectly reasonable and given that it is the biggest most expensive such ship requiring those skills at high levels is not just reasonable but also necessary i see no reason why a capital industrial ship requiring industrial skills at high levels is at all a bad thing
all these sound reasonable
agreed the most egregiously bad caldari ships are the frigate missile boats the rr raven would be quite nice if there were actually rr shield bs gangs
you go away no seriously go awaythis thread reeks stop making it smell in here o p
i posted this in the wrong place this is a repost heres the jist of it and link to original thread i madeoriginal posti was thinking that the market place section could use a new sub forum for services offered rather than having to wade through all the buy and sell items ie shipping services corp creators stuff like that well thats my 2 cents sorry if this post is not in the appropriate place but it was the best place i could find for it 
im personally against anything sane and helpful to people so no upvote for you
i dont really see a down side to this for anyone involvedyou got my support
ah but to paraphrase the excellent argument for why the stealth bomber needed the covops cloak nothing says stealth like ooh look a fleet of stealth bombers on scanner maybe theyre coming to bomb us
its a bump
i love this idea would make the game incredibly more dynamic it kind of annoys me that it does not matter at all where you fightdo whatever you have to do and that almost every single fight happens at the gate it is either you camping or you being camped this would give a reason for fights to happen elsewhere except the gates for example fighting small ships in an asteroid field or icefield would be logical for a heavier fleet
i like the ideas of different environments in space im not too enthusiastic about the random events
i would like to see the options in the clone window aligned for easier reading this is what is it now and this is more or less what i would like it to look likeedits 13 spelling getting and getting the links to work
i know the after image is a bit crappy but i did not have the tools here to make it look better and i do believe it gets the point acrossshamelessly supporting my own idea 
why not just split into three proper columns name points kept price could even be nice and highlight in yellow the clone thats immediately above your current actual skill level so for someone with 43123198 it would highlight pisplitting into columns and using column headers would mean you could get rid of the clone grade skill points kept from each line which is just repetition and waste of space
i urge everyone to ignore any suggestions made by members of sane industries incthis of course includes this suggestion to ignore suggestions made by members of sane
only thing that need to be changed is that it should mention what region those stations are in tbh
why not botharimus that would be nice but i feel that would make it a bit too easy
not supportedsorry but theres jz so many things that could go wrong and will go wrong with such an implementation and i can already foresee that if this idea is implemented people are gonna start a new thread asking for stealthed pilots to appear in local chat almost immediatelysorry jz my 2 cents
ahahaha no way
killmails for faction ammo too that stuffs expensive you knownot supported stupid idea that would cause unnecessary extra load in already laggy systems fighters are not that expensive if you cant afford to replace them yourself you probably shouldnt be flying a carrier
they would get bubbled and killed while you warped out 
i know this may be a bit premature butcurrently there is little use in fielding more than a few titans in a small theatrewith the new weapon there will e a use for as many titans as you can fieldcurrently there is no limit tot how many titans can be fielded by any groupmy proposal is thus for maximum power a titan requires a dedicated system with a structure this structure requires soverignty and replacesblocks all economic upgrades in that system this structure is assigned to a particular titan it has a reinforced mode where it may still provide the titan its support and switching supported titan takes timethis will provide attackers an option to weaken a titan befroe destroying i also this will make fielding many titans economically expensiveno hard limit but still an effective limitation to the number of titans out there
i think this is where i lol

supported i just started my own thread on this coz the search function blows ghey anyways this is my idea to make the button a little less small on individual module overloadlink better workyes done quickly but just increasin the button size by tht little realy helps
for that matter did the minutes of the last csm2 meeting ever get posted
it is the csms job to weed through the forums and find the ideas they feel are necessary to be escalated popularity is usually a horrible indicator of game balanceive seen multiple say the issue was raised and ccps response was that they arent going to go back to the old system im not exactly sure what else you think they can do they could make it their sole issue in every meeting but that just prevents them from raising other worthy topics csm brings concerns of the players to ccp but the popularity of an issue does not always mean that it fits into what is best for the game as ccp can see repercussions of a feature that other players cant such as server lagthe csm represents the majority of voters if you wanted it to represent the majority of characters ccp would have to mandate the election results which seems to invalidate the whole process plus who wants 1 representative in charge of trade alts another in charge of 0 sp scout alts another representing datacore farming etc if you want someone to represent your issues get other likeminded people and vote if you cant swing the  of people to get someone elected representative goverments just arent meant for youat times the csm will be asked their opinion about upcoming changes ccp is considering or long term plans for eve this is exactly what they should be doing and ccp requires a nda so that every little future idea isnt released when a lot of them are only conceptual and might never make it in game it prevents thousands of people complaining about xyz idea based upon incomplete information when it is only in the initial stages of possible planning and might never be releasedcsm provides input into all aspects of eve but they dont run eve they consult and provide advice do you expect ccp to run a multibillion dollar company based on the votes of their players that is a guaranteed way to fail they make business decisions that are best for them and seek player input on game design issues

bump the new effect still sucks and we still want the old one back if theres a compelling reason for not putting it back how about sharing it
i think this would totally depend on how fast you can repair the drones however i think triage should always consume nanite paste when repairing dronesi do from time to time have some bright moments it would be unbalanced to be able to repair all your drones at once yes maybe even have it so that less drones  faster repair so that you can choose to repair one unit quickly or choose to repair a batch at a slower ratehowever there should of course be a limit to the amount you can repair at one time
good idea
i remember a dev saying the same thing many months back right now the damage notifications are a joke and dont notify you of anything supported
great idea having the damage information in a window like a chat box to make it easy to follow and allow you to get the thing out of the wayit would also be nice if you could see the damage your drones were doing

interesting but there are a few critical flaws for me atm being able to capture plex  an alliance that wishes to support the milita should support them  not do their job for them no wardec from opposite third parties or allied empires  this makes no sense from an rp pov after all the first world war started because of a wardec cascade after some serbian guy called some austrohungarian guy a noob in front of his haxxor buddies or something putting this condition in whether intentionally or not basically asks for participation in fwliteon the other hand do i think there should be a mechanism whereby an alliance can declare to be part of an empire with all the rights and responsibilities therein but what you have atm is the rights without the responsibilities no support yet
can you imagine what the cva people could do for your side of the war bsci support this idea or any other allowing alliances to join with certain downsides or restrictions of course itd be interesting to see who joins on which sides drop in lp for capturing plexes while youre at it

i can support this
while flying around i noticed that alot of the rats fly standard shipmodels that are simply recolored versions of the normal ones i propose to add a small painting option in the fitting pane that allows you to do simple alterations such as changing the texture hues on various areas of the ships base texture or the color of windows and perhaps adding a corp logo as nose art if possible i would also like to see an option for the color of some of the particle effects such as thruster exhaust and signal lights seeing as simple visual alterations serve no ballancing purpose but have the potential to make the game visually look much better in the future i would make this a freely available service accessable from any npc station or pos array for people who are worried that someone may try to make a ti look like its tii counterpart to scare people away remember that most people will right click info and or scan you down long before they are in visual range of the ship in all i would like to give players more of an ability to express themselves in their ships
yeah for more lag
actually you could do it without inducing lag1 have a preset unchangeable selection of patterns2 make them part of the client3 add one data element telling the client which pattern to use when texturing the shipviola no additional lag since the hard part drawing the ship on the screen is done client side anyway additionally you could tie it into the show effects option in the menu so people who dont want to see them dont have tothe real problem would be developing number of ships in eve x number of patterns per ship new patterns
very very little data sent once for each ship a single value representing a color scheme choice hell we could go crazy break ships down to give them several separate coloured areas and use two or three valueswhat this would add in lag is far outweighed by its worth in eyecandy and subscriber retention not to mention saving ccp from having to hear people whine about certain awful colour schemes
actually there wouldnt need to be that many new patterns available since there is a wide veriety of color schemes already in the game for npc ships so start by enabling those presets and than gradually add more as time goes on
it still needs more resources as you have to load more textures atm 10 apocs you have 1 texture in memory afterwards you have 10 textures in memory for the same ship model
thats a clientside issue with a simple clientside fixx enable custom paintjobsto a lot of users loading up a few extra textures would be a nonissue with the huge texture memory on modern gfx cards that may well be an overwhelming majority of users
consider the lag in a fleet battle 500 ships each one having send a scheme code id love the option of more costumization but i can see it being problematic to scale
not necessarily because you only have to send that value once  when the ship enters the grid after that youre just sending position updates your client already knows what color the ship is after that so theres no need to send it in any subsequent updates
the lag for visible turrets would remain considerably higher i dont hear any concern on that being a resource hog
i think this is a fine proposal that will add a lot to the gameexperience of the players ill leave it to the devs to figure out if this would be too heavy in development or system ressources but i doubt that it is a real issue

i agree that this is a good idea and could be based largely on existing game features docking screen similar to station screens require a gang member status to utilize etc like a lot of other players have already said this is something that i thought carriers could do for a long timein response to the issue of clone vats i dont see that this necessarily reduces their importance it provides another logistics mechanism that makes the game a lot more intricate and harder to predict after all the clones themselves are the important feature of this part of the game an extra wrinkle in how they move just enriches that part of it
you already have the bonus to training to 16 mil spyou now have the skill queue which i never hadstop complaining and be patienteve is a harsh game to new playersits a godforsaken place where you have to build your own character from scratch in sc
op mentions wow this makes the idea auto failseriouslynot suported1 your wow friends dont like eve because they are wow people the mind sets are totaly diferent stop trying to make it the same i tried wow once it made me want to scoop out my eyes within 5 mins of mind numbing bordem did i run to the forums and ask them to change it no so please stopi came in at rmr 800k points and i got to 2 mil before someone told me about the learning skills and my 1st thought was awsome i can learn stuff while im away without grind allowing me to sample the diff aspects of the game not just stand in spot x kick npc y in the shins from now till dooms daywith the remaps time accelerator etc you can get in a af new boost ftw or a ceptor faily quickly in the order of a few weeks i beleve from what i have been told and quite honestly even though im up to 50 mill sps these are the ships im currently having the most fun in rememver kids its only a couple mill sps reasonably speced in a t2 frig which means 40 million skill points im not using in that ship the only advantage i have over a noob is that i can fly more stuff if you go toe to to with a nub in a frig it can be a close match if the nub practices and is just plane better than you he may even win you dont get that ever just by sitting in a station for 6 months farming sprantps well that was a longer rant than i pictured in my head also i suffered so should you 
im currious if anyone at ccp knows exactly how many new players have quit because they felt they couldnt be effective for the first 6 monthseven if its perfectly possible for players to be effective quickly if people are leaving because they dont believe it something is wrong
it took me less than two weeks to be out fighting back the day i started and what did we get 200k sp or something back then i didnt know anyone else who played the game but there are who have 50100mil sp and all they do is train their skills yeah i made some 100 dps on my t1 lolfit rifters and stabbers but guess what sometimes i did even better than on full t2 gear  blindly attacking  can be surprisingly productiveyou either play the game or you sit in the station and your sp got very little to do with it

yesalthough one possible point ccp might not like this because it allows you to easily put containers in a freighter although couriers can do that this would allow you to do it solo
i like this
another ideaa new in game item plastic wrapperone time use only infinite volume its size is equal to its volume  01m3you rename it into name of the pilot and throw all the stuff in there that will alow using them anywhere including nullsec and deep wormhole space
i just would like to point out that anyone who thinks our dear leader mazzilliu shouldnt be appointed a life term in office is an idiot
there is absolutely no reason to remove term limits if you want continuity move that 2 members of the current csm always remain for the next term as advisors those two members should be elected by a vote of the csm as only the council can determine who was effective and who was not
i like this suggestion id even go so far as to suggest that we players vote for 7 delegates and the csm elect the other 2 delegates from within their ranks to serve on the subsequent council

each time that you anchore a pos in a wormhole class 1 or class 6 the number and the respawn rate of the signatures are flematic ccp you create the tech 3 a really beautifull ships but with this prices not very overpriced i have experecience and i know the real cost if i have this spawn rate the number and the price of t3 ships will be imposible its very easy check the total number of subsistem selled in jita in 1 month or each week maybe 1 o 2 subsistems of each tipe or less sometimesmy proporsal decrease the nerf of the wormhole signatures when you anchor a pos maybe not for the belts but a little more i see one belt each month or one radar
did it occur to you to try moving to a different wormhole when you despawn everything
do you know how many wsystems have at least one pos i usally search from kspace a lot of them and its really difficult to find a virgin system acttyaly you can find but give 6 months more and tell me pls
sheesh learn to frontier when the gold is gone find a new streamalso learn not to be an alliance pos 
do what we do blow the damn thing upodds are they are low on fuel or out of fuel if empty or unmannedwe tend to find quite a few of them weve had no problems our alliance is frequently operating in whs
its been suggested before im sure but its worth harping on about once more i thinki propose that the wallet divisions mechanic be extended from corporation to personal wallets the default behaviour would be that the master wallet be used for everything and display of the other wallets be supressed to preserve functionality for those that dont care  dont need it but in other ways it would mirror the corp wallet functionalitydiscuss
theres nothing to discuss ive wanted this since before time was time
what would be the need for it tracking trade funds if so lets be honest that the information youd want out of that is far more detailed then youd want to deal with in the wallet id love to see ccp put complete analytical software into the client but realistically that kind of this is done better with a third party software pulling the data off the api
granted but that doesnt meant that it wouldnt streamline things to have seperate divisions eg trade mineral aquisitions1 mineral aquisitions2 as an accountants son i like having these all in physically seperate accounts  not least because it lets you see how much you have to spend on exotic dancers this month at its root id say the reason is that different money in your wallet is used for different things so having a trade wallet and a couple of manufacturing wallets and a profits holding wallet would be useful to mefor reference i also think that analytics should stay out of game it depends on what youre doing as to what precisely you want to report on and id prefer the devs concentrate on helping me pew than helping me make isk give us an api c and the excellent zedgraph library and we can do for ourselves thank youoh and the obligitary vanity support
i can see the use though if i was to prioritise its way low on the list
i prefer to organize my personal funds by project or intended use having personal wallet divisions would make this a lot easier
tldr version at the end a proposed solution to the issue of titan proliferation liberal use of doomsdaysdoomsday devices work exactly like they are meant to an antiblob weapon but when alliances or groups of them have reached the point where they can doomsday a capital fleets we have to accept that it has gotten out of hand however eliminating doomsdays is a bad idea there will be little to discourage conventional blobs turning into a focused fire megaweapon and youd likely have to in order to make titans worth it will most likely have the opposed effect it will encourage titan blobbing so really changing dd mechanics is trying to get around the real issue the proliferation of titans or rather the liberal use of the doomsday devicesthere are some poor ways of dealing with this that have no doubt been thought of and discardeda limit on the number of titans an alliance can have or a highly exponential titan maintenance fee sound initially good but theres the obvious get around create titan holder alliances when a titan costs dozens of billions to build 1 bill for a holder alliance is pocket change some ultra rare dd fuel but then youd have a similar problem as you have with moons now few valuable resources means the more powerful alliances will fight over control of them and youll have very thin chances of the little guys being able to get in the fight or the cost will simply go up so only the very rich alliances can afford it having the same effect of leaving the little guy out id like to propose a new idea limit the amount of active titans in a system or the amount of dds that can be fired in a time period when it reaches a peak blow up a random titan or throw it in a random wspace system and continue to do after x amount of time sounds illogical but in the world of scifi excuses can be easily writtensince the events leading to the destruction of seyllin i there have been bizarre accidents with titanclass supercapitals leading scientist are now theorizing that the radiation emitted by the titanclass unique reactor technologies or doomsday devices somehow provoke the appearance of strange wormhole like phenomena which have already caused the destruction of several titans early data analysis concludes that the phenomenon occurs with increasing frequency when there is heavy concentration of titansheavy use of doomsday devices in a certain area of spacethe mechanic itself would be something like soafter x amount of titans present or dds have been fired in a system titan class vessels will be randomly destroyed or sucked into wormholes with a frequency proportional to the amount of titans until the amount of vessels goes bellow the limit or y time passed since the last dd titan begone timer z secondsnumber of titans in systemorandtitan begone timer z secondsnumber dds fired in the last w hoursexample say the limit is 4 titans and group a has them all in system group b cynos in 4 more instantly a random titan explodesgets sucked into a wormhole 30 seconds afterward the next titan does then 45 seconds then 60 seconds and now youve reached the 4 titan limit all is fuzzytldrdds are fine as they aretoo many titans are an issuesolution if there are too many titans in a system start randomly blowing them up or sucking them into wormholes until there arent so many anymoreprofiton

hi drake
what a surprise the 2 forum s are the first to respond and they dont even offer any critiquing they just shut down the op without giving any reasons
you would be wise to go read the dev blogspatch notes to see the methodreasoning to our madness
heres the whywith the awesomeness that is the stealth bomber the job of the dd for interdicting large subcapital blobs is slowly starting to be replaced note that ccp never said that large fleets of sub capitals were badtm just that having them in one concentrated ball of death was boring there might have been a technical reason too but once you hit boring its time to do somethingthe problem then becomes the increasing use of capital blobs  100s of dreads  carriers on each side basically pounding at each other basically the rr bs fights of old writ large and with 8 year lock times again boring area effect weapons are not the way to go here though because a you want to limit the calculations required to see whether or not each damagable object on grid is in range one of  but not the only  the reasons that torps are direct weapons now and b any area effect that can be effectively deployed on a scale large enough to bother a cap fleet will render any gang of any number of bs utterly boned hosed and generally in a bad way  no matter how many plates you havethe solution therefore is a superpowerful directed weapon and of course the requirement that every titan pilot put in local before he fires now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battlestationhence no support

who says that blasters are fine fly only vagabonds  zealotsanyway blasters need boost so signed
are you freaking stupid a 50 dps boostblasters are fine and yes my preferd ship is a blastermega if anything they could use a slight tracking boostregarding the argument about ac not using caps its being compensated by minmatar ships having mostly active tanks or sub par buffer tanksnot including phoon wich most ppl use torps on
qft
fully supported and to all of you saying that blasters are fine right now they are not gallente weapon systems should be the most powerful as they are supposed to be a torp raven should not be able to outdamage a megathron for example theyre both tier 2 battleships and clearly the raven is superior because 1 torps do much more damage 2 they always hit and 3 they can shoot up to 30km acs are capless guns and they will even be more powerful with dominion they have great falloff etc pulses theyve already been mentioned due to their much greater optimal they can be far superior to blasters
a neutron blaster mega fully skilled tracks about 74ms per 1km of optimal meaning at 45km optimal they track about 333ms thats without any tracking gear i dont think blasters need much more tracking than that considering ionselectrons do even better the dps issue you have to remember is at a very limited range the number 1 problem any blaster boat has is getting in range of its opponents if it has to soak up damage on approach it better be able to do way more damage than its opponent when it gets in range right now thats just not practical 50 doesnt have to be the final number but i think with the energy limitations i added it should be appropriate in a 1v1 at optimal there shouldnt be many reasons for a blaster mega to lose tracking disruptor speed energy neutralizing and range can all play havoc with this sort of ship to counter that damage in a long duration fight cap instability really becomes a problem blaster boats should be able to field a lot of pain but in a very short burst of time longer fights work against the ship if youre burning through so much capacitor that even injectors cant keep up that too limits the damage the ship can actually deal out numbers on paper dont play well reality on the battlefield does
now your basing your stats on a ship that has a tracking bonus that doesnt mean tracking is fine on the other blaster shipslasers could do with maybe a 5 loss in dps but there is no way i will support a dps increase on large blasters cause we already do more then enougha dps buff now would in the end once again end in a damn hp buff on ships and that is the last thing i want

bounty solutions numbers corresponding1 allow bounty posting on aggressors onlythis would mean that anyone that attacks me or blows up my ship anywhere anytime can get a nice fat bounty on their head this of course is excepting situations such as wardeclarations and lawless 00 is still 00 space i am also suggesting that the bounty be required to be placed within the aggression time limit that is in place it disallows players from hiding from bounties by running a hundred missions and disallows easy friend tagging2 a player with a bounty is a criminala player with a bounty has committed a crime which has been established by rule 1 so let the players kill them anywhere anytime criminals should get what they deserve and players should have the right to enact the justice that is due3 security lossgaini think we handled this in 2 but i have one thing to add now that players are acting as security forces lets give them credit for it how much can be debated later but at the very least a player shouldnt lose security for it4 bounties are paid for by players out of pocketa bounty placed by a victim on criminal is a reward for enacting justice on that criminal so i dont see why the mystical money mill i assuming its technically concord should be making the payouts the criminal didnt attack concord it attacked the player and that is who needs to take care of it using this method of payment players cant create money out of space by popping each other and collecting bounties repeatedly to make it even more fun lets tax the bounties so the first players that try to use the tactic of friendkilling actually lose money on itnow you may post that i am a troll and that the entire system should be removed or complain that pirates cant get free money anymore
nah system needs a full rework including bringing a player policing faction to lowsec also a method of bring a low bit of security to the entire system in lowsec not just a tiny bit of security at gatesstationsim hoping ccp does an expansion around thiswith that said bounty system itself should be refocusedif in real life im a rich guy and i want someone killed i put a bounty on his head chances are its not going to be on some nobody pirate its going to be on some high profile dude the chances this guy has the sort of equivalent negative security status isnt likelythe bounty system should be more distributed then it currently is factionsalliances put bounties on people which becomes visible to their factionalliance now mix those together that is to say have concord as a faction warfare alliance that you can join the global bounties being issued by them
1 player flys in and does a can swapflip2 owner flips players can3 player posts bounty on owner4 lols are to be hadprofitme thumbs down
1 ok so playera commits a can flip thus triggering aggression timer and opening up availability of bounty 2 then the can owner flips the can of playera in retaliation thus opening up aggression on themself 3 at this point playera posts a bounty of their own isk on the previously stated can owner 4 so in the end both players lose some items to each other in the can flipping and playera additionally loses isk because they posted a bounty on someoneexplain who profited and how i think you missed the part where concord is no longer paying bounties players are also being a player in the process of posting a bounty i should consider that the criminal on whom im posting a bounty may possibly arrange to be popped by a friend and end up with my isk thats called risk and its all over the gamesecondarily in response to jason this really is a complete rework also i am not trying to make the system identical to real life because if i was it would be simple bounties all around on anybody anytime also there are something of bounties on corporationalliances in the game already called war declarations
in a game where theres no real penalty from being killed and everyone can have as many alts as they want i dont think the bounty system can be fixed enough to really work
i noticed a rather meanspirited i think csm topic regarding problems with gms and the petition system i would like to propose an alternative to their suggestionswe need a petition databaseheres how this would work when a gm answers a petition heshe also flags personal information in the text to redact after some time say three months the petition will be searchable on eves websitethe three month waiting period is there to ensure that the petition is not easily tied to a specific person and to ensure that any possible bugs or exploits uncovered have time to be fixedso whats the benefit the player base should search through the petitions before creating a new one if their questionproblem is answered and no gm is needed thats time saved for ccp on the other hand if they have a similar petitionable problem they can provide reference material for the gm this allows the gm to see prior precedents for the issue to make a faster better decisionoverall i believe a petition database would speed up the petition process remove a lot of clutter and make ccps rules and the gms decisions more transparent

the pp interface is really awkward it would be nice if given an upgradefor example dragging buddies and bookmarks into folders becomes a pain when you have too many having the buddies disappear form the allbuddies list when you put them on a group or adding a right lick feature to put xyz in group uvw would be nicethe ability to duplicate bookmarks form the interface or a right click option to export bookmark to cargo hold and items hangar if docked and a right click option on bookmarks in hangars to import to places with out the bookmark disapearing would be great as wellin any case a more friendly way of moving stuff in and out of groups would be great

awful idea carriers and dreads are supposed to be usable ships not to mention that you just proposed to make it impossible for freighters and orcas to dock  wtf
i never said make freighters undockable only a maybe and if they can dock put a limit on how they dock how does stopping capitals from docking in stations make them unusable if you can fit them outside a station doesnt that mean you can use themactually this is a i dont want my alliance capital assets to be placed under any risk whatsoever because we are incapable of defending them whine
not supported capital noob proposalthere are so many things wrong with this cant even begin to pick it apart
say no more get this ty mission out or at least cut the amount in two you actually get quite alot of factionstanding from this one as opposed to the 8000 units of kernite one but having to move 2 rounds with a fully cargo rigged transport ship sounds fair
its been a long time since the ui has had any major overhauls yet the ui is seriously lacking in many areas from market functionality too manufacturing overviews and tactical overlays all need updating with an emphesis on useability eg why cant i put 10 manufacturing jobs on at the same time instead of doing them all individually why are lp stores so rediculous to find anything in instead of having a mini market like uinot to metion its looking old and run down eve needs a full ui overhaul
just my own personal gripe with carriers and mother ships they all have huge open hangers big open areas where fighters would fly out of why o why are they just shat out explosively in all directions make fighters fly out of the big open area please ccp make my nidhoggur even more epicos
sure and do it with missiles from launchers too
currently you can only have 100 items in an item exchange contracti suggest raising this limit to 250i had a massive bpo sale and was forced to make multiple contracts instead of one or two large oneswhat do you think
yep
i actually raised this in the community roundtable today with wrangler and the lovely mod whos name i have forgetten the 5minute ban was brought in to combat the isk spammer keylogger posting however they are going to look at the editreply restriction
this is basically the idea i stated earlier just with a consumableyet you dismissed it in favour of a more difficult solution are you sanefurthermore its simple include a drone repair bay capable of holding 1 fighter or more and take that space from the drone bay as it stands carriers can hold 16 fighters if you have nothing else furhtermore you could still use drone repairs bay as a storage and launch platform
or you could try and read instead of questioning my mental statewhat i am saying here is that there should be a balance between a possible consumption and the repair rate of drones this means that either you have a fast repair rate and consumption or a slow repair rate and no consumption two options however the original proposal deals with the secondthe original proposal dealt with here is a slow nonbattle usable mechanic which has no consumption because why should it cost money if its something you cant use in combat internal repair systems and remote repair systems dont cost resources other than energy eitherwhat i however do support is that when triage mode is activated the repair speed is significantly increased and it consumes nanite paste or some other form of consumption to stay in line with the repair rate but providing a bonus just as the triage mod does now for the systems already in placei was not discussing the mechanic behind this as it is very simple and obvious just make sure that the total amount of drones being able to be carried is added up somewhere so that you can never put more drones into the initial drone bay than drones in drone bay  drones in maintenance bay

i agree ccp has not adressed this matter and should with the growing support of its paying customers however i tend to think they have put the csm mechanic into place to have fair representation of the players lets try not to muck up the water with critisism of the csm roles just yet the system is fairly new and seems to have some momentum as well as a few bugs to work outto me being a csm is like having the job of a prober in a worm space corp its a thankless job that gets critisized often has tons of time and energy invested and no matter what or how you do it someone always has something negative to say or a better way to get the job donebut yet that same someone with the big mouth is all to often the one who does the least to help the overall cause and the first to hide when its time to knuckle down and do the tedious ground workand campaigning for a pilot for csm has a different place my well intentioned friend try to keep this topic clear consise focused and thriving with genuine input that will get the attention of those that make the decisions rambling flaming bantering and soap boxing for a csm candidacy simply gives those that wish to read this thread and digest its content more crap to wade through and detracts from the impact and serious consideration it should gettreat the topic like your favorite vessel and tweak it to the point it makes a impact and is noticablesupport those few men and women who have given their time effort and thick skins to present such ideas a chance to do their job and feel good about doing it rather than shoot them down at each opportunitylike i tell my corp and alliance members if you can do the job better step up to the plate show your stuff basicly put up or shut upif your not part of the solution then better to stay silent rather than add to the problem
to the op do your work on politics cause you really need it sorry to be insulting you but this wont work and doesnt make senseif you attack amarr do you really think caldari will stay on the side without any rights to intervene wtf  believe me the emperor and the people around him will say were allies to caldari order them to help us now maybe not like that but caldari wont be able to stay on the side they cantof course theres other major downside to your idea like the way 1 faction could be overwhelmed with wartargets i call that legal griefing maybe your just giving that idea to tip the side of the battle away from one faction for all i know who knowsnot supported at allalliances should really stay out of fw if they get inside fw its going to be hell
i would like to see more posts on wether or not there is a community interest in improving ship visuals and less on how this will effect lag wether or not it will lag the server depends soley on if and how ccp chooses to impliment the system
the easiest way to do this would be to simply allow players to apply a color over their shipthey could have a choice of 256 colorswhich can be packed into 1 byte of networked data1 no textures to generate the color is applied over the existing texture2 500 ships  500 bytes of data sent to each client500 bytes  lolone alternative could also be only sending the value when look at is done at a distance or the ships model is visible on the clientthe problem with this youre not painting logos or anything fancy just applying a color
not supported cause a bee stung me today in my garden nah but im not supporting itreasons ccp has stated before that it cant be done the person who brought this up are you a game developer no then what makes you think it can be done now furthermore what makes you think it would be easy if in fact it can be done but it is difficult and requires plenty of coding were going to waste an entire expansion potentially on this this time could be better spent on something useless like certificates through some unforeseen circumstance it could ruin the integrity of the game and create a massive blackhole sucking all the customers out of the gamenow to be serious unless we understand what occurs exactly when you dock to a station then we arent in a position to suggest the difficulty of this issue for example whats the kind of stress having all capitals allow players to dock up to them like stations going to be like furthermore they cant fix the speed in which to view and sometimes never view the multiple compartments in the carriers hanger space i for one would like to see them fix that before adding to the carriercarriers cost less than 1b now with titans costing upwards of 70 carriers can carry much less granted but having 20 carriers you could bring in a fleet the size you would with a titan the cost of 20b facilitates the use of carriers more and titans less making titans that much less tactical the purpose of a titan would have been thoroughly mapped out during their creation and while the game always evolves what else would you suggest to replace that function with that has equal value something has to make up for its immense cost otherwise what you are suggesting is what wow does all the time making expansions obsolete cause they are idiots
magic 8ball says outlook not so good
no there are plenty of empire corps to run missions in there is the red and blue empire wars corps to pvp with someone already said if a corp told you your worthless they are ed and you need to find another make your own corp if you want to the is eve do wtf ever you want tothe 100 multiplier is perfect gaining 8mill sp in 3 months imo is way to much for a normal noob that 8mill sp will take closer to 68 months if you stop staring at the character sheet skills train faster tooif you guys want to keep whining go play wow and grind it out
no i completely disagree with any remedy to this situation the fact is csm have incentives to continue being elected because they get a free tripmeals and lodging to iceland every election makes a fantastic holiday destination altering this process gives ccp and large alliances the incentive to abuse the system in which case i might as well chuck money on the street and see how long it takes for someone to find it usually 10 min which is more entertainingbottom line is by placing this in the csm submission and ccp review pile you have already abused your powers its like sending a bill through to be discussed having it denied and implementing it in society anyway that isnt democratic its tyrannyi have to draw blood from a stone every time i petition ccp about an ethical issue which always requires a supervisors input because the grunts have to stick to the ccp policys this money could be better spent removing one step so that people dont have to wait so long for a proper solution
maybe you should understand that the point of wormholes probably wasnt to go populate it and just drop a pos in one and stay in it youre supposed to move in and move outnot try to claim systems like 00 sovereignty or something
if your struggling to find a good wormhole then move to a class 4 or higher they last much longer just dont expect it to be a picnic
maybe you missed it but the devs have stated several times that the pos dont affect respawn rate in wh systemsit is simply a perception problem you find a system where no one has been before for daysweeks and despawn a lot of sites crying bonanzathen the new sites slowly as they always do spawn and you cry saying but there where 50100 or more sites when i entered clearly that is the natural state of this wormholewrong the natural state is a slowly increasing number of sites your initial big number of sites was the result of weeks of accumulation if you are willing to wait for weeks and no one come and despawn some of the sites you will again see 50100 or more sites you see exactly the same phenomenon in all the other exploration content stuff accumulate in some forgot angle of the universe and when you find it you find a gold minebut after you have despawned everything it will not return all in a rusk the nest day but simply trickle in a few sites every day btw the rate of spawn of new sites is directly related to the rate of despawn of already existing sites in other wh of the same class found by other players
a pos doesnt influence the spawn rate of the sites players do just like the kspace exploration system if a site despawns the site goes to another random systemmeaning that if you actively hunt down all sites the respawn rate is lower than the despawn rate is this a bad mechanic no it makes sure you dont hang around in one system too long farming over and over but hunting actively for greener pastures
 facepalm theres no pos nerfing spawnsthread
yeah id also like to have an accountant tally up my tax and check if i can claim anything back from the blood sucking contract agents p  since the beginning of time the year is roughly before may 2003 people have always used one wallet for personal transactions fine multiple wallets in corps have been to stop thieves leeching from the main wallet there is no practical use for this
id love this
i would also want a simple system so that i can easily divide the money between the wallets by setting a  on each one and all money coming in will be sorted accordingly a self tax system kinda
as far as i know there is no issue that covers this however there is a similar issue already raised by the csm about revising the bounty hunter system this covers npcs and not players and therefore do not dismiss as the same issuemy proposal is simple as of yet we dont have the revised bounty system and while this does not make the revised system being proposed to ccp obsolete it would make the pirating career that much more interesting dangerous and potentially rewardingthe proposalmy proposal is to introduce intelligent npc bounty hunters that actively seek out players with bounties on their heads the higher the bounty the stronger the fleet that comes after you it could either be very intelligent where the bounty follows you from system to system or simply a spawn that occurs on a random chance with a despawn of say 15 minutes either from when they spawn or when the bounty player leaves the systemthese bounty fleets could consist of anywhere between 2 ships and up to say 15 or more requiring a pirate armada corporation to dismiss them however because of the abnormal strength of the bounty hunter npcs they could drop valuable pirating gear to continue harassing empire low sec and nul sec playersspecificswith a bounty of say less than 20 million isk only a maximum of 2 ships will have a random chance of chasing you and going upwards every 2050m isk placed on your head huge fleets will not always have a 100 chance spawn rate when bounty hunters spawn but rather a low say 510 chance of spawning with the required isk bracket the harder the spawn the more likely that defeating it will yield a rare item however will not guarantee it to make sure that the system isnt abused the spawn shouldnt have a long timer so that players must be quick to earn the reward the spawn should be better than avg faction ships but not so much to make it a good training system to do whs etc what im refering to is their ability to use ewarweapons etc well and focusing fire or spreading it out if any bounty players are killed by the hunters concord gets the bounty on their headd reducing the value to 0 again and thus draining isk from the systembenefitsdisadvantagesisk sink to take further funds out of the gamegreat way to punish annoying griefers that suicide gank youmakes the pirating career more interesting by making it more dangerousnew way to earn faction items but not make it easy to do so or any more likely than a faction spawn occuringanyway thats enough ranting from me lets hear your opinions
hisec just not safe enough for you ehif you want those ebil piwats killed do it yourself
way to fail more malcanisjust because i post a topic about the pirating career does not mean im a high sec baby ive spent the majority of my time down in 00 however i bring this up because the bounty system is currently for show much like the certificate system by adding to it there could be more incentives for players to go pirate and a simpler way to have noobs and those who are hit on one off random encounters to deal with their problem by placing bounties on those pirates furthermore my topic introduced an additional topic to make pirating more beneficial for pirate groups as well
isk out through bounties would be negligible in comparison to the currently available isk fountainsnot all pirates are suicide gankers many are outlaws who cannot even enter hisecwith global criminal countdown gateguns and lack of access to hisec pirates have enough penalties that last given the lack of lowsec attractiveness and thus lack of trade hubs is particularly debilitating to those with a single accountthe reward is minor if its approximately equal to ratting plus being jumped during 1v1 or 1vx engagements would lead to making piracy pretty much unbearableyour problem seems to be with those who take piracy as side proffession or gank people on alts while having the heaviest effect on those who take on piracy fulltime especially those who yarr soloif anything losec piracy needs a few minor benefits to improve its attractiveness vs suicide ganking on alts or roaming 00
nogo and do it yourselfnpcs doing things for players is ing cancer in this game
as clever as the idea is this only leads to one conclusion player harassment via exploitation of bounty systemnot supported for lack of foresight
hang on so if i give myself a bounty via an alt then i get faction loot dropping spawns that follow me aroundawesome
i got bored after reading your first paragraph but the reasons are probably in there i dont support nerfing titans
and a highvalue system like say a titan nursery would have the maximum number of titans in system at all times making any attack practically impossibleend result 100 foolproof defence with zero chance of defeat yay for static sovereignty mapssolution is to find a way to make people want to bring titans forward into the fray while at the same time minimizing the utter devastation that multiple titans can cause when used togetherthis is the focus of a rather lively debate in the test forum but it is at an impasse i am afraid almost impossible to give any ability worth having without it scaling horribly
the last paragraph is all thats needed as a reason the rest just seal the deal
my proposal is as followslet players pick one of their 3 characters per account and then transfer all skills acumulated on the other two characters to their chosen main character all relearned skills would get turned into raw skill points to be applied wherever the pilot sees fit im sure most will be opposed to this idea and here are some forseable reasons why followed directly by why i think it should still happen1 ccp will say its to hard to dowell they say that about allot of things that may be why instead of taking the time to make other ships more competitive they take the easy way nerf it approach until ships like the raven become nothing more than support dps it may be almost impossible but it still seems nessasarry to me2 some people like the way it is because you can set up the other characters with diferent attributes to help train certain specialized skills such as titans or industrial characters this comes in handy because ccp in all their wisdom cant come up with a safe way for a titan pilot to exit his super capital and pilot anything else withought trusting a bunch of people who would gladly pod their best friends for a chance to get at his titan in the saftey of their 00 pos would it be so hard to let somthing as big as a station go into a mode outside npc station where it is considered part of the station by the npc and thus made indestructable while it is externally docked to it even if it means longer docking times  aggression timers for supercapitals as far as the training bonuses to our alts go has anyone taken into account the 100 bonus to our main characters training while we train our alts has anyone stopped to think that mayby ccp copied other popular game systems allitle bit when they started out and then realized even tho it doesnt quite fit the game its already there and would just be too hard to fixis it really worth having a specialized miner when you have to stop training your main to save a much smaller percentage just to have to log on as a different character who has stolen valuable combat skill training time just so it can hold its own against a few belt rats doesnt that start to equal out after awhile what would be wrong with having implants that would only work in conjunction with similar implants but would go higher than 5s so a pilot could temporarilly train industrial faster than combat etc3 corp spies and corp killers would have to work allitle harder to infiltrate corporations and a lot harder to disapear or avoid retaliationdont get me wrong i love watching the ceos of my alliance watching me out of the corner of their eyes after ive been there for 6 months as much as the next guy always wondering if im really the person i claim to be or if im going to dump this load and come back with my second account and my pvp ship to blow them away every single time we go on a mining op only to disapear into the woodwork once again i dont see a problem its not impossible to infiltrate an enemy corp just because they know you as their enemy people do similar things in real all the time ive done it ive got the medal for doing it and if i can do it then it cant be that hard and if somone really doesnt have the wit to be a spy withought an alt they could always buy an account close it buy another close it because they sure wouldnt want to follow their main around with it mayby to make it easier ccp could change the 15 dollar swap char portraits option out with a 15 dollar hit to skill points creat new character for this account optioni will only answer those posts directed to why this is a good idea a bad idea or an idea to improve this idea or an alternate idea to fix this idea so if your here to flame my grammer my spelling or my intelligence just make sure you throw in an actual reason to be opposed or be ignored fire away
i dont mine so i think all mining barges should be removed from the game and the equivalent minerals deposited in the owners hangars no compensation for the skillpoints tbh you people must have known that getting free minerals from rocks that just hang stationary in space without even shooting back was always an exploitalso i want  no demand a ponyalso someone should beat me with a cluebat night and day until im either pretty or stop making extremely stupid proposals in the assembly hall about moronic ideas which have been proposed and shot down twenty times already
i like my alts and dont want to pay several times my current rate to maintain my variation of playstyles and affiliations if you would allow new accounts at a discount so the costs wouldnt change there would be no point to thisyour basic reason for suggesting this seems to be it still seems nessasarry to me im assuming you mean necessary you dont actually give any good reasons for doing it so there isnt much to refute here but im sure you dont see the need to provide strong reasons before ruining the playstyle and fun of many current players i might as well just say no and leave it at that this is propably a troll anyway so why waste time on it
i currently have 3 accounts i utillize them as followsmy main 3 miners 1 corp killerhealer one dedicated explorer to keep tabs on whs 2 bogus traderno points recons 1 command if anything i over use themwhat i am talking about is risk accountabillity and making the game more personal im sorry if actually having to risk loosing your main character to find out whats on the other side of a gate has to much risk involved for the general population but i dont think disposable alts are any better and despite the fact that i also enjoy this style of gamplay i would be willing to give it up for points compensation to add to the adrenaline rush people feel when they dont have the luxury of just throwing an alt through to see if its safe or burning a corp to the ground and then torching the offending character and starting all over again withought fear of retribution
sounds to me like you are thinking up schemes to get the sp respec which has been shot down repeatedlyif you dont like your alts and that ccp makes good hard cash from multiple accounts then recycle you unused characters cancel any extra accounts and feel content that you are making eve a better placeno on all counts

when you create a new character the skillsheet should be empty or you should be able to customize what skills you have at start starting a new character only to have a bunch of useless skill that make your skillsheet ugly is bad
your character clearly didnt have the logic skill from the beginningthink newbies have enough skills to train and newbies wont really understand what skill does what so they will end up just giving themselves a bunch of botched skills
how exactly can a skillsheet be ugly pray tell
what makes eve great is when you fool someone into thinking your for something when in fact your noti suggest you take a gander at the other current wardec post and try againotherwise you really are foolish bob for surenice try as i said before epic fail big timeme applaudsoh and if you didnt hear me that time i do not support this proposalgetting me this timeturn up your hearing aid next time eh
never suggested that you were for this proposal but clearly there was something about my parody counter suggestion that bugged you or else why the flamenice attempt to deflect from your hasty posting though sorry it didnt quite workand so ends another dead thread
what you did was assume like you usually do these daysstop compensating for your shortcomings and start readingassumptions make you look stupidi reacted that way because i strive for balance in game mechanics people foolishly think that ditching one thing will cause no harm to the game as opposed to the other and vice versathis isnt hello kitty online but nor is it gank onlineits eve online the balance between high sec and 00 is required yes its a problem but if you dont strike a balance your never going to get the problem solved

i would have thought that invisible sarcasm tags are just as good as the visible ones  this idea is so ridiculous it wouldnt get passed if all the whiners and their alts combined came by to support it
i agree a fix is needed but throwing damage at it is possibly not the best fix improving tracking would help since they are supposed to be close range weapons and since webs are nerfed this makes tracking with blasters overly difficult1 improve the fall off mechanic in terms of hit qualityhalf falloff  5 additional misssingle falloff  10 additional missdouble falloff  50 additional missmore then double fall off  95 miss2 allow low damage ammo to also give better falloff like iron  leadsame goes for all other guns hence boosting flexability of hybrid and projectile ammo and giving t2 ships designed for falloff something more useful this also adds little for lasers which should be inflexable as intended to work at their good optimal range ships with ammo have to reload and carry the ammo but they have more flexability within their given specialisation

this has already been raised by csm and given to ccp i believe all your discussions have been discussed on the previous thread look up the only sticky on this forum and under mazzs links
since when has this been the case you place bounties on other players via the bounty officethis hasnt changed since 2003 has it
well well so youve never seen the can swap trick in person ehnot very experienced in this game are youif owlman can figure it out why cant you  o p i suggest you spend some more time in game before you make a suggestion againps psssst the owner of the first can wont notice or respond because a hes not equipped to respond b most people dont give a damn about the bounty system in the first place c he gets confused and takes the can anyway which turns out to be the can flippers can all of which could happen while hes off docking and out of sight not watching the can swap bit hard to figure out who dun it

good in theory bad in practicethe problem stems from the hierarchy for the gm petitioning structure ccp staff at the frontline level are required to apply very strict policies to your petitions this is why you get bad petitions and an overload on the petitioning system imo what you suggest would mean a lot of useless and insensitive examples would become precedent for gms to usewhat you need is to replace grunt rules with a new approach to allow creative but controlled and monitored solutions such a system would decrease the petition load

thishi mynxee long time no see
u mad
well they should at least flip the damage bonus so that normal pirate ammo is more valuable given that its harder to procure
dont you get an evemail from yourself saying so you died when youre podded i get podded fairly frequently and im pretty sure im always deleting those annoyingly obvious messagesif thator waking up in a station far from the remains of my ship and corpsearent reminder enough to upgrade my clone i dont know what is its my practice to do it immediately as soon as i spit the vat goo out of my mouth as for training beyond your clones capacity and then losing skill points when you diethats just lack of attention to detail not good in a game like this one
not really the best way to address your potential voterbase dip some of the complaints in this thread are valid whether or not you or ankhemesempatenkahs hand think they are or not do remember who put you in your comfy seat in the first place
so you want to dictate how the war declarer fights his war against his enemy i believe that is what you and all these other change the war dec mechanics people are trying to do what you call backstabbing we call gathering intel spying cloaky cloaky and right when you drop your guard boom its called war matei think you would be surprised just how friendly and respectful a lot of the people in this game would be if those who whine would stand up in the midst of war and fight fight damnit fight so you lose a t1 cruiser big whoop ive seen 3 month old toons come out when everyone else in their corp was turtled up i like turtles btwthe point is although there could be some changes made to the war decing system totally screwing it up is not the answer making those who choose to engage in pvp so what if its war declaring pirating 00 etc have to pay more or have a harder time doing so goes against what eve is all about sitting all docked up and cozy running missions in deadspace pulling downs millions of isk per hour with very little risk and trying to change pvp avenues for the rest of goes against what eve is really about
well i havnt seen a single key log or spam attack in ages either that of ccp are really on top of there game

after translating the post which took a while as being a 37 year old i have trouble understanding 13 or 14 year olds i decided that the idea was so bad i would actually answer itsubcapital assault ships bloody stupid idea if there were these monstrosities allowed in empire there would be few or no poss in empire left with no carebears to build our stuff prices would skyrocket with high prices no one would want to risk their ships and blah blah blah well you see the above is basically rubbish but you get the point people would just go out to kill poss all the time as it woulld be very easyso i dont support the idea in fact i propose a new one concord dont come when you blow up stupid people

sounds good and looks fair enough after all its not about eyecandy its more about it actually being different visually that is

supported but for all settingsif the database loadstorage is the problem store the settings on another system that may not even be connected to the current server network and sync them ie transfer only if different on client startup or shutdownproslog in from an internet cafUFFFD and you still have your settingsno extra load on the game servers nor on the game networkonly minor changes client side for transferring the file on startupshutdownno changes to serverconsminor change to clientbandwidth will go up slightly if many people run their accounts on different machinesfeature to clear settings must be implemented in the web gui
with the additional parameters specified by mr dirk above i wholeheartedly agreeredoing your fittings your overview and bm folders is not fun at all
i dont see why this is necessary it means more lag server side for something that takes very little effort client side if ccp needed to stop us spamming directional scanner to stop lag think how many server resources searching for all our bookmarks will take
i use a laptop and a desktop moving around bookmarks from one folder to another can be a nightmare with mor ethen 2 computers same goes for overview settings and adresbook
at the moment navy cap boosters can only be traded via the contract system which is very tedious for both the buyer and the seller from the price they have in lp shop and the fact that the game mechanics clasify charges together with ammo in the same category  just check market or try to put a ship in the ship maintenance bay of a carrier it is clear that they are to become for the average eve player what faction ammo is nowthey need to be moved from contract only to contract and market
10
i agree with myself  all of us do
i completely agree with this searching contracts is tedious for minor items like cap boostersmoeover every single pakaged item should be available on market wth the exception of rigged items or multiple product offerings as long as we are going here
faction ammo is why the hell arent faction cap boosters
i am always happy to support pvpers survive until they realise cap stability is the way to fly it is a consumable like ammo put it on market
this
lol i didnt even know they excisted i think that proves a point if theyd been on the market id have known about them
all items should be on the market
supported ccp made the right move w sisters probes and ought to do the same here
they were heavily used in the tournament i think rooks and kings even used faction drones in the tournament 
same as sisters probes or faction ammo supported
very odd why faction ammo is on the market and this is not make it soi would actually be for putting all factiondeadspace modules on the market instead of on contracts which allow for more scamming
im sure this must have been discussed before but with short ish search via eve search i found nothingim a neat freak and having so much crap in one place annoys me ok i can use containers but its pretty hard to see in them other than by contracting them to an alt and reading whats in there that is a huge pain in the ass and im sure much create a massive load on database serversall i ask is that we can create up to 7 personal hangers that we can put crap in and keep tidy keep us people with ocds happydel
fully supported i cant imagine why there isnt some sort of folder system or anything like that for your hangers and ships i tried going the station container route but its a pain in the ass when you fly to jita to buy a new ship and you cant check your assets window to see what modules you already have at hq and dont need to buy and that uncertainty gets expensive when your ships are fitted entirely with t2 mods
this proposal collects several positively received ideasissue 1 enabling overload in the heat of battle can often be trickysolution make the button a few pixels taller and it should go orange when overload has been activated and will be enable on the next cycleexampleplease visit your user settings to reenable imageshere i am overloading 1 webber the guns and the mwd ill be overloaded on the next cycle issue 2 in battle it is very hard to see what target is affected by impossible to know whether it is scrambled warp disrupted jammed sensor damped in large battle it is hard to see who is remote repping who that makes fleet management all more complicatedsolution when the target is locked under the target bar you can see all the remote effects projected on it including damage remote rep and all commonly used mods hovering cursor over it will cause a line to be drawn from the effector the guys who is projecting the effect to the target the lines will have different clolour depending of the type of the effector red for damage blue for ewar green for remoterepp and shield transfer yellow for cap transfer or whatever colours developers see fit as well as that hovering your cursor over the icon of the effector lets say warp disruptor will cause the multiplyer to be shown showing how many of the modules are being used on the target that will help fc make sure that target is jammed and all dps is on the primary exampleplease visit your user settings to reenable imageshere i am attacking retriever and the icon of the warp disruptor and webber at the bottomn helps me make sure that my friend in a tackling frigate has the target immobilized having a status bar next to your capacitor deiplaying all effects projected on to you would be nice so in a 10 men fight i know who exactly is jamming me and i tell my fc about it so that that guy is primaried if i am doing a mission that will tell me which rat is webbing or scramming me clicking tactical overlay button would display all effects in the form of lines for all targets in sight it could have an arrow or something else to demonstrate direction of the effect this would greatly help all fleet commandersissue 3 i do not want to be limited to just a few warp at orbit and keep at range optionssolution when you click esc you would have a menu personalize where you could change all the ranges defaults to any custom numbers in kilometers with 1 decimal place that was i could completely change the entire set of ranges that pops up when i click warp at to my guns optimal my points maximum range and my drones maximum range and pick the one i need for a warp at i would be able to enter coordinates x y and z with the center of the coordinates being at the object that i am warping to so havingx  50y  130z  73would mean that i am warping 50 km in front of the gate 130 km above it and then 73 km to the leftthese coordinats would be saved and would show up in the warp at menu in custom order in format x50y130z73 or in the for of the linear distance to the gate issue 4 it is annoying that when i try to fit my ship and i do not have a scrambler of meta lvl 4but instead have a lvl 3 one i cannot use automatic fitting but i have to do it manually solution add a popup asking no item of exact meta lvl found would you like to fit the closest avaliable lvl item instead the same would happen for ammo and drones scripts booster charges and so on when one of the items is not found during fitting an option to skip and replace would pop up whenre fitting would continue without this item or you would fit something else instead
issue 5 it is very hard to transport large amount of goods belonging to different people and then figure oput what is whosesolution add an ingame item a plastic wrapper with volume of 01 m3 that acts exactly same way as courier contract once you place your items into it can be only used once shows name of person who packed itplease understand that as i am not a professional game developer exact balance and tweaking and color is up to ccp game designers to make it the most user friendly and appealing same goes for the numbers and exact position of buttons if you like the suggestion but you have another view on how it could be solved in a more elegant way support this topic as you want to solve the same issue and post your way of solving it if you disagree with just one of the five points i posted point it out with reasoning and preferably some constructive critics lastly not all of the ideas are mine i just collected alot of ui issues and there solutions under 1 roof ps i know that barge on the picture is not a hulk but i cannot change it to retriever due to character limit
nice man i like them all and i would love to see them ingame asap

supporting a ui improvement thread despite the futility of such an action
fully supported especially issue 2
more useful ui features are always good
these are all fine ideas strongly supported
1 seems good to me 2 i can see the value of it but i cant think of a way to make this anything other than incredibly busy visually if it can be done in a way that doesnt fry the brains of newbies and fill up 90 of the remaining screen space on vets sure 3 this might actually be too complicated for me to support more customization sure but what youre asking for is more the province of bookmarks than of menu options 4 sure good idea 5 already a couple threads on this idea but yeah on the whole supported
i support all of this but the solution to issue 3 the premise of warping to something is that your warp drive finds the object locks onto it and flies to it its not surgically accurate nor should it be and warping at distance is the only reasonable custom coordinate to have though i am in full support of allowing full customization of atdistance values up to say 180km or something so that you cant warp in to just anywhere at 210 to scout out before warping the rest of the way
if i had an isk for everytime i saw this thread
would it help at all if a ships paint is only visible if your closer than 10km to a ship or would that not matter since the info was loaded when you entered the space
it is normally loaded when you enter the grid they just have level of detail to scale how many details they render
why do i get the scene from reservoir dogs in my head

tbh i think reskinning the ship as one of the various factions would be more efficentbutsigned
emptyquotin
i agree everyone who doesnt is an elitist veteran loser who wants to retain their epeen size difference i have many friends who make an account and a character to try the game because the way i talk about eve makes it sound awesome then they have to wait for months before they can actually play or be useful and normally quit
you dont have to be an elitist veteran to fly rifters for tacklingmaybe ask your friends in goonswarm about rifters and introduce your friends to them
christ these kids today they all want new cars given to them by mommy and daddy sigh  oh op needs to settle down and just play
yeah great after ive got them all hyped up for the awesome eve experience i can give them a rifter  scrambler and say do this for a few months you cant actually do any of the stuff i was talking about lol
seriously dont do this
as most of the people here i think that giving away a large bunch of sp to people that dont even know how the game work is a sure path for failurethe next step would be we need to be capable of respeccing our skills as we did them wronga suggestion that i have often seen and that a this point in the game evolution i would support is to remove the first tier of the stat enhancing skills and give directly a 5 increase in all skillspeople that have trained all the learning skills to 5 like me will feel a bit shortchanged but most of us would not stay irritated for more than a few minutes especially if ccp gave some of the sp we spent back in some form naturally it would not have the same effect on new players that saying you have 128000 sp the 5 tier one skills at level 5 to spend as you want as a free gift but it would do much more to help them that giving free sp that most of them would spend to learn to fly cruisers without even knowing the basic of the game
they should just get rid of the training skills give everyone the extra stat points like we all had max learning and then give everyone who has skillpoints in learning doublespeed training for twice the number of sp they had in learning
not supported more than half of the dominion patch is a massive boost to new players  you cant have more
eve is a complex game you use those few months to understand the way it works for beefing up your wallet trading making friends finding the right corp choosing part of game you like learning how to pvp fit your ships etci am a relatively new player and there is plenty of stuf newplayers can do you are not suppose to be able to get as good and someone who played this game for few years withing couple of days at least not in anything except flying t1 frigs
ill bet they know and you know what else ill bet ill bet they dont care i dont know how many people have active subscriptions to eve but i do know that there are probably an average of 30000 people online at any given time just counting that number 30000 and assuming the average amount they pay per month is 13 factoring in the lowerrate extended subscriptions and the higher cost per month of timecards ccp is making 390000mo gross income though i remember reading that there are several hundred thousand active subscriptions so that number could easily be multiplied by ten eve doesnt need more subscribers of course more subscribers does mean more money and thats always a good thing but they dont need to sacrifice very important game mechanics in order to keep the newbies playing ccp should be plenty content with the number of subscribers they have now
i want to see this too maby it can be a way to transport rigged ships once the ship is in a package it acts like a freighter can and can be loaded into any standard transport while the rigs remain intact
supported butneed an idea how could be increase the negative standings toward npc piratesmaybe a solution for thatcross standings toward other npc pirate factionlike this dronessanshablood hate angelsserpentisguristas and vica versa so if you shot angels the standigs toward angels decreased but blood increased
you fleet with the alt and then the alt hands the mission in for the fleethowever it works fine for the corp standings but iirc you need to have a faction standing of above 200 to get missions yourself and thus your own storylines the alts storyline missions wont give you any faction increases
choices should have consequences but in a dark universe such as eve deciding to turn traitor to your faction really should be an option especially given that most of the pirate factions members likely originate from their opposing empire faction
i propose a new class of industrial ships geared towards the transport of rigged ships throughout highsec i propose implimenting 2 verieties of these vessels a small and very cheap veriety for use by individuals who are simply moving one or 2 ships and a large capital veriety simmilar to a general freighter these new ships will use the same models as their standard industrial  freighter counterparts save for the fact that their cargo holds are replaced with maintanance bays of apropriate size aside from this they will be no different from their industrial counterparts in terms of fitting they will require the new skill industrial transport carriers trainable after gaining rank 4 in any of the normal industrial skills the freighter veriety will require the freighter skill as well the ingame story will be somthing along these lineswith recent advances in rigging technology the number of ships that cannot be transported by normal means has been on the rise with concord imposing strict limits on capital ships within high security space enterprising corperations have begun retrofitting their fleets of industrials replacing their massive cargo holds with specialized ship maintanance rigs capable of handeling the transportation of a wide veriety of customized vessals without the need for wastefully dismantling after market additions
i dont think this is a good idea as it hugely simplifies logistics when moving region to region while i understand that currently logistics is a  i dont think creating a cheap ship carrier is the solution
well the alternitave would be to allow carriers in high sec and just make concord do a  ton more dps to compensate for the high sec ganking problem
you failed horribly at searching
tbh the search feature of the forum is completely useless  so i dont really blame them for thatas for the op this has been hashed over and hashed over in numerous other threads the general consensus is that a lot of people would like it and a lot of people wouldnt i go back and forth on the matter
so you want them to implement an orca
hah i knew there was already a ship for it
when the orca was first introduced i was quite ecstatic that there would be a new ship that was being designed specifically for hauling ore i figured this would be especially helpful in wspace where i tend to mine as much ore as i can before returning back to kspace the problem is that the orcas mass makes it difficult or even impossible to use in some instances at best the orca may be able to make one or two 2way trips from wspace before the wormhole reaches critical mass and is on the verge of closingthe orca is also a cheap tool used by wspace corps to shut down unwanted wormholes with ease without risking a more expensive ship such as a carrier if you look at the ratio of cargo space to ship mass youll find that when comparing the orca to the next largest hauler the iteron v the cargo space to ship mass ratio is way out of linei propose to give the orca the same ship mass as a covetor or hulk since they appear to be about the same size on screen even give it 30 more than the hulk and it would work as it stands the ships mass doesnt work well with its defined role with regards to wspace transportthanks
uh nobecause you obviously have no experience with whsive seen whs survive 4 to 6 trips with an orca
you obviously have no experience with whsit all depends on the wormhole type
exactlyif the class of the wormhole itself is low the orca wont even have a chance of making it a class 8 wormhole not the space itself but the class of the wormhole entranceexit will normally allow 2 twoway trips by an orca before it starts to destabilize i did give some thought to the mass of the orca since its able to store 2 hulks i would then say make the ship 34 times as massive as a hulk this would still put it way under its current mass 3 times may not seem as much but if the ship is mainly filled with empty space inside much like a balloon then it wouldnt have all that much mass compared to something like a carrier which would have more armor and such which would contribute to its mass
you know what i dont care what you think or say because ive seen it myselfthis proposal has a chance in hell of flying because of the raw facts of whsdont expect it to work out pal
im not opposed to this idea per seas long as its effective agility doesnt change but ill just point out that the orca really wasnt designed for wspace it was designed for highsec mining gangs with a sideline in the small freighter business
thisthe orcas primary benefit is that fleet members can load cargo directly into the ore bay thereby bypassing the dangerous use of jet cans and the need to anchor secure containers the orca pilot would be better off flying a hulk and loading things into a hsc and then coming back with an itty 5 while a corpmate or two fly around fighting off rats and pirate gangs
a lot of people already agreed that it would be lovely to have more hangar divisions for the individual players just like the corporations can dowhat came to my mind is something to make it even better and more usefuleveryone can have multiple hangars and multiple wallets this apply to corporations toothen you have an option to protect one or more hangarwallet divisionswhen you do this everything inside the hangarwallet is locked and to unlock it you must request an unlock codethe unlock code is sent to your rl email the one you registered with the account and expires in 10 minutes or something like thatthis way when a hacker get control of an account he cant access everything but cheap stuff and people can get back in the game withouth so much painwhat do you think about thisthank you for reading
from the comments ive read on the forum  it seems the first thing a hacker does is change password and email this to prevent there victim from logging in or recovering there accountso this system would only act as a delay for them not really usefuland not to mention highly userunfriendly towards the players
well you are right but not completely imowith a secure hangar you can save your most precious stuff like bpo faction ships and items unique stuff and the most of your money maybe so when an hacker get control of the account he cannot empty your characters and when ccp give your account back you have still plenty of stuff to keep going and the recover will be easier
considering that a lot of accounts get hacked through use of keyloggers it is not going to prevent a lotonce they have access to the account it is donethis is just a case of people needing to learn how to keep there computer secure or suffer the consequences for failing it
giving users personal divided hangers and wallets because of security is a really poor reason9 times out of 10 the breech occurs at the corporation level not the personal onegood idea bad motivationnot supported
not supportedpeople dont hack you to get your password it happens by way of you downloading a keylogger or being phished basically the only time anybody can get into your account is by way of your own stupidity when you essentially hand over your account information to themhonestly though i would appreciate a save password checkbox in the eve login screen it would make things easier for you to get in using your own computer and would also make keyloggers pretty well useless
this seems decidedly inferior to the authenticator idea thats been mentioned a few times
what if those faction loot dropping spawns would pod you  would you be so happy 
i can understand having a 72hour restriction on forums use but why is api information a part of the restricted system surely nothing bad can come from people being able to access their api information immediately i suggest that api information and possibly all character info available online is separated from the 72hour forum login restrictionperhaps ccp will make a better way when this cosmos thing comes out with dominion well have to see

yeah this is silly
so if youre here to flame my grammar my spelling or my intelligence just make sure you throw in an actual reason for opposition or be ignored
just no
easy i dont like missilegun skills on industry characters and i dont like miningindustry skills on pvp characters yes you can pick your character but it still screws you basically i would prefer to pick my own skills so i dont have to accept the crap they stick me with having tons of random skills that are useless is ugly i want clean skillsheets you do realize that the skills given when you create a character are less than a day of training they are random skills over all skill paths worth almost no sp that only wreck your skillsheet the skills given to you are already botched why would it matter especially since it is only 50k spyou are arguing to save the 50k sp you are given at the beginningscrew that
wow is that way seriously how long have you been playing eve
i vaguely understand where hes coming fromopening your skillsheet the first time to see a bunch of skills you dont recognise or understand isnt hugely helpfulmaybe just a new tutorial explaining each of your starting skills and suggesting a few others to be trained should be implemented
i love how you say this because it is the exact oppositeanyone with many accounts and is useful in this game agrees with me i may have 8 accounts and characters that i would prefer to not have stupid skills that i am stuck withremember you are arguing over 50k sp and 10 skill that you are stuck with woopdee do what a waste
thats the way this game used to be the problem is that eve is so complex and noobunfriendly that it was impossible for a newbie to know what they wanted to do and would often end up with starting skills that were completely different than how they decided they wanted to progress so ccp implemented the verybasicskillsatstartandthendoublespeedtraininguntil16millionsp plan and made everything much better there is nothing that needs changingand whats wrong with being stuck with stupid skills its not like there is a downside to having skills that you dont necessarily need besides the extra sp it takes to keep in a clone but beside the fact that 50k sp is only going to push you into a higher level clone when you are 45 minutes of training from the next one anyway said higher clone levels are very cheap that is until you are in the tens of millions of sp when those extra 50k wont even be noticeablestop crying about stupid things
really you want a pure build industry character this proposal is just for the looks and thus completely unnecessary
i lolled dont tell people about spelling then go on to spell stuff wrongalso i didnt brand people who disagree as a griefer i branded the people who would probably emorage at me as probable griefers even if they post with an altalso an idea is better than just bleating about others ideasalso move out of your mums basement try speaking to real females and stop wacking off over japanese schoolgirls you may be allowed to join the human racealso cybering doesnt count as real sex you need to actually touch the other personand lastly if you dont like a suggestion just post not supported itll save everyone from suffering your incredibly dull intelect
yes mercenary contracts i support this i do not however support any of the op changesand of course it is reasonable from a storylinerp point of view that concord will accept money to look the other way its just like earth
when you browse for a fit you can only click fit to automatically fit the active shipbut it is useless if you dont have the modules alreadywhat about a buy and fitwhen you click it a window opens and it list all the module available on the market at the lowest price then you can click buy all and fit or just buy all then you can use the fit button in the fitting browser or buy just single modules with a buy this button next to every single moduleit would save a lot of boring time imowhat do you think
that would be cool so i have a pvp ship fitting saved and i realize i need it now so i get the whole thing in few seconds in case i just need the ship asap
just no
the only ship ill allow is the one that pulls your ideas out of your head and allows others to gank themthat was my subtle way of saying no
anyone heard of mobile warp disruptors no must have dreamt that was what they were for thensilly me oh and can i have a frigate that carries capital weapons only i cant afford a dread
i think what he is asking for is a ship you can put in the middle of space between two stargates so you pull people out of warp leaving them 0 chance of survival yeah this seems totally balanced
new players want to get into the action like anyone else theyd like to hop into some of the cooler ships but skill training time stands in their way i propose that when new subscribednot trials players go through the tutorial mission in noob 10 systems they gain credits that can be used to rent a noncombat ship for x amount of time which is limited to the noob 10 system the time rentedlocationship type would be limited enough to insure against abuseganketc perhaps 2 weeks of credits would earn you 2 hours of flight time or whatever so if im starting and earn enough credits i can trade it in for a hulkorcacovops renting ships like covops etc ship types would come prefitted not allowing players to refit weapons for example and try it out ships available would be non combat for anti ganking reasons this allows new players to get a taste of what they are training for and perhaps allow them to decide if this the path they want to train for im sure there are ways to abuse this idea but that goes with most things
im going to say no to this idea as the ships you are proposing are specialised t2 hulls the tutorial already covers mining and industry and provides a mining frigate to try pew pewing some roidsi would say the tutorial needs to introduce new players to scanning and maybe point players towards certain hulls for different activities the procurer for mining cruisers for pve cov ops for scanning etc this way new players will have some idea of the direction to head in and wont put them in overly specailised hulls like hulkscovopsedit i haz grammar and spellings
so the fanfest turned out to be a damp squib information wise so one wonders whats the big hold up with the much more important minutesskunk
to show you it is even worse i am now a csm 3 members and i dont have the minutes of the meeting yet either i would have expected to have gotten the raw version sent to me immediately after i was appointed as a replacement they must be very special to have taken this longissler
since the election i havent really seen much from either ccp or the csm that either confirmes or denies any changes on whatever they promised during the election from ccps side all i have seen is dominion this and dominion that and the only csm i have seen doing anything is csm larkis who get himself banned for something whatever if the csm is going anything worth mentioning ccp doesnt really let that come to public anyway so this system is more like mentioned before a popularity contest by attention s it isnt us the players that need to stop whining rather that csm start taking action and show the players who voted for them that they actually tries anything of what they promised
you know what is funny is that csm term limits also has more support within ccp then you would expect it probably has something to do with the fact that firsttimers are somewhat not very good at contributing because they have to deal with the fact that there is all this new csm rules to learnthis forum and you posters in this forum is also a pretty terrible measure of player opinion its also hard to get the message out to your concerns because all we can do is post things that end up getting drowned out by more posts by trolls and or people who are mad for little good reason i get most of my measure of player opinion from my corpmates and forums that arent the assembly hall because this forum is the caod equivalent for the csm
bc captcha doesnt ruin forum experiences right
you mean like captain above youit just really annoying going on many of the different forum sections and still having to wait for the 5 minute timer i dont want to spam the forums anymore i just want to reply to many topics on different section of the forum  after this i am going to cp having to wait there then to gd and having to wait there then test server feed back after having to wait again will be happy for a 1 or 2 minute but 5 minutes is a bit much  plus how do you get past the forum times captain
agreed it sucks
all the same stop giving away that you can get by it
the dev blog said that submissions would open on the 1st of octoberbut as far as i can tell they havent yet am i just going to the wrong page
support
i like it
id support this given the following restrictiondrone  fighter repair operations take a considerable amount of time ie 5 minutes or more and they need either minerals that get used up in the process or spare parts
not much else to be said
i think repair rate shoud be 10 for hull and 20 for armor per minute for all drones in dronebay no maintenance deck or 24 as basic and 80 repair rate per level of skill
fully supported it might be a good idea to create a nanite paste bay that this ability draws from which would need to be periodically replenished possibly even a module connected to it though im not completely sure about that and i agree that different types of drones should be able to be moved in to the bay and returned to their original groups after their trip to the infirmaryin support of this new ability that seems such an obvious thing to have could we also please make it possible to check on the status of our drones health while theyre in the drone bay i get so tired of deploying fleets of drones just to see if anyone needs a bandaid
great idea
10
not a new idea and one that certainly has its implications but a useful and welcome change nevertheless specially for those like me whove had their friends reprocess their faction mods thinking it was garbage
supported but if youre gonna do this add a small tag of the faction logo and not some ugly ass crap that was posted in the op ie a small red tag with the blood raider logo on if its at all possible to recognize if logos are too big make a new smaller id for factions
as someone who nearly reprocessed 10 amarr navy energized adaptive nano membranes while cleaning up my hanger i fully support the op
absolutely the ui is terrible and even minor change would aid both handicapped and other playersedit i work as a sysadmin in a design company that has a well respected interaction design department if ccp doesnt have the resources or the ui skills to do this im sure that there are many including my company who could do this convo me in game or send me an evemail for my email addy if there is a need
supported this communtiy should not be left out of the best game online
recently i came up with a similar idea i wanted to make my own thread about it much later but since youre allready on the same track i might aswell add my idea to yoursa couple of years back a study was done in the netherlands to try to find out how many people have selfharm issues shockingly the numbers they came up with is that 1 in 8 girls in there teens and 20s and 1 in 30 guys of the same age admitted to it in their survey using those numbers over a playerbase of 300000 assuming most of them are guys then eve would have 10000 people with selfharm issues on average however i argue that the concentration is far higher in massive multiplayer games since a lot of people who suffer from selfharm issues are drawn to these games 10000 people on the low end of the estimation thats a number worth thinking about especially with that team you suggested in your original postim a moderator on a selfharm forum and have years of experience with them and i can tell you eves learning curve doesnt help their selfimage however your suggested team can do simple things to improve the situationto name a simple example if you have one list that keeps track of whos best in your game you have one best player in one catagory of fields if you have many lists you have many number ones in various fields meaning more people get to feel good about themselves its all about feedbackregardless of what people might think about people who have these sorts of issues or even physical or other mental disabilities that makes life also in eve harder their numbers are hard to ignorei fully support your idea and i hope youll take mental conditions like the one i just described into consideration when expanding on it
very much supproted
for the win
fanfest is over many enquiring minds want to know how you got on
csm delegates did you ask ccp about this if not you fail and csm is useless
fix the scanner if you dont want to remove the delay just listen to the players theres a lot of excellent feedback and ideas just go and readthe current status is ed and just makes me want to quit the game everytime i get the annoying popup and take 10 seconds to scan 3 belts while all targets warp outseriously its the single most ed thing that was ever done its totally stupid and its embarassing that you released that on the live server
adapt or diejust sayin whats good for the goose is and all that
is the scanner going to be fixed soon finally
there is no adaptation to the handicap that has been placed on huntersthe situation is as followsjump in 360 scan target on scan usually a ravenrecalibrate scanner narrow down in a direction of belts that likely hold the target and scan againscanner is empty rescan 360 degrees scanner is empty because the pilot saw you in friggin local chat he has now warped and cloakedccp have stated that small gang and solo warfare should remain viable thoughout the changes they have made and yet change after change they have handicapped the hunter to the point that now if you go roaming your effectively just going sight seeing as the chances of you catching a target have been reduced to near nothingpretty much leaving you to engage defense fleets or assault fleets only resource denial is a valid warfare tactic and needs to be allowed to live on or all you will have is blob on blob crap ass fights that are of a limited fun and take hours of prep timethe scanner change has crippled the ability of an aggressor to wage resource denial on an entrenched sov holding body by making it virtually impossible to catch someone in space if they are simply at their computer and paying attention to local
according to forum that shall not be named ccp is decreasing timer to 13 sec and making button unclickable during that timer
sweet bubbah drop it already you all spam the button and lag my game gtf over it or go play mine sweeper or something
perhaps you know something that we dont and have adapted in ways that the rest of us cant understand your limitless intellect is shown in your post so im obviously not doubting youi guess you have a way of finding targets that the rest of us obviously inferior creatures cant grasp so perhaps youll enlighten us on what it isperhaps if they gave us a working functional scanner or gave hunters back the ability to actually hunt things besides the ever present mass of ships that make up the blob we wouldnt be lagging your game also since its your game can we now forward all complaints about it to your inbox
give those hampsters steroids and make this server side

dont wanna stomp on your post but as you said it was brought up before it even has a loose semblance of csm support item tabs
sure
tie it into needing to be in a player corporation and you have my vote pcs need incentives and this would work marvellously as it doesnt benefit the 1man corp has corp hangar division as much as the multicorp
could i suggest that youd also incorporate idea of personal hangars which you could set permissions ie pos access or such so if you belong to a player corporation or an alliance who owns the pos you could see and use your personal hangar for blueprints at the pos as well instead of just corporate hangaredit small requirement could be that being able to access to your own poshangar would require the corporation to have a office on that station thus not making the corp hangars absolutely obsolete j
you have a point there what do you think about warp drive having sertain inaccuracy like  5km either way ven more options of range would be nice currently warp drive is not surgicly precise either it will warp you in somewhere withing 2km of the point you where warping toactually bulky interface would not be that bad if the dedicated fc uses it to coordinate fleet action however for 1 person we need something rather small but i think everyone will agree that currently it is very hard to see what is going on on the battlefield
changes made mostly due to test server feedback hail tracking modifier lowered to 075 from 05 resulting in a 25 reduction in tracking speed penalty same as barrage sisi modifications taken into account sisi projectile ammo changes rescinded they dont work ie emp does more damage than quake t1 long range ammo is useless and damage increase combined with the effects described in this suggestion would make too many ships opmaelstrom fittings modified speed and agility improvedtempest and fleet tempest fittings modified target painter bonus changed to a 5 tracking per level bonus mass and agility modifiedtyphoon and fleet typhoon now as seen on sisimunnin slot layout changed to 636panther power grid increased to 14750 an additional missile hardpoint added artillery 1400mm and 1200mm optimal range reduced by 20 tracking increased by 20 fall off reduced to 25km alpha increased by 50 1650mm changed to 1680mm highest tier artillery is always even numbers dps increased by 30 alpha increased to 75 optimal range increased to 10
i can attest to thiscurrently the larger minnie boats are somewhat underpowered and it prolly will take ccp a few iterations to get it right again and have another faction start whining about being nerfed too much
not supported anything that may add to lag on warpjump in is a big no no even if i turn off the skins the fact that the server will have to still push those skins to each player on grid will still ultimately cause more lag for everyone involved talk about an easily exploited grief mechanic
well if what a lot of people here are saying is true and it is indeed possible to be effective within weeks rather than months then no game mechanics have to be changed they just need to show new players that it can be done and how
whats with all the new player hateevery time a thread pops up about helping new players it gets flamed and shot down by either csms or other playersare new players really that unwelcome
get rid of learning skills so new players can put that 16m sp bonus to things that are useful to them now instead of training things that will help them train other things a month from now
im against this proposal but i welcome new players weve taken completely new pilots into our corp and taught them how to survive and then thrive in eve what new pilots need isnt an easy mode to get started what they need is to stop hearing things like you must train all learning first and you will be uselesss for months
no new players are very welcome ive run with many since back when i was a new player until nowthe flaming in this and other threads is when new players think eve should  wow and want to purchase sp or whine because they cant pwn in the largest ships in the game some new players wonder whats the deal get it explained and go on happily in their eve life recently i chatted with a new player in my alliance that had some of the same concerns as in this thread he left too but he left because he realized eve wasnt the type of game he really wanted to play and he did so with a head on his shouldersnew players that just want to complain that they cant jump into a battleship just by grinding npcs and cant get over the nonwow aspect is the people that generally arent welcomed
noadd two options at character creation1standard starter character2custom charactermaybe
perhaps you should learn to read before you practice replying besides if you think you know who is an a large alliance with a huge amount of out of game coordination i think you been smoking to much of the wacky weed dude i think the way this was pushed through the csm with no quorum counting an absent member to make a quorum is an interesting interpretation of their rules and very limited support yeah three supports and off to ccp it goes wow look at the great representation the eve community has reminds me of certain workers collective representation which always after awhile begins representing the collective representation rather than the workers disband the csm
of course it should be optionalnot only does eve have an international customer base the very definition of profanity changes so quickly that the overhead in maintaining an effective filter is not worth ittherefore any profanity filter ia going to be just a gesture for those that want such a thing  for whatever reason those who want to be free of such a gesture or are just confused by it should be able to choose not to make itsupported

there should definitely be an option similar to sisters of eve hereanother option that could be applied to all factions might be to take consumer goods like antibiotics and consumer electronics and sell them at a lower price than the market demands say 25 the benefit to the player is getting bonus lps or a faction standing increase as a reward for effectively subsidizing their corporation of choice this would create a bit of a demand and lots of market activity for these objects and might serve as a test case for using them as part of a planet economy some time in the future as has been suggested for new sovereignity and might be used in infrastructure developmentthis is also an effective way to pull some isk out of the game if there is an incentive to sell for less than the item is worth
this already exists after a fashion since some pirate factions will offer missions to kill others for example you can receive missions from blood raider agents to kill both serpentis and angels

serpentis home is fountain although they have some agents in curse while syndicate is npc space none of it is serpentis sovereignty fountain is an npcplayer sov hybrid like delveaside from that 110 on the troll

funny how you chose delve as your region of choice
the main reason for personal wallet divisions is to have a savings account to ensure you dont get completely fscked over by a market mistake its damn annoying having to log into my bank alt just to withdraw isk
hi all
im not sure there is any main reason but certainly there are a multitude of uses to make life easier which is why i think the game would be better with than without it
actually what he really wants is an orca you can cram a battleship into  a conundrum i found myself trying to solve last weekend of course to be useful you have to be able to put in two of themunfortunately it cant be done at least that was the consensus me and several orca pilots came up with
you just have to squeeze the bs a bit and they fit into the orca p scnr
if i recall correctly ccp said at the time that the orcas size was on purpose so it wouldnt fit a bs of course now that theyve made it so all but the angel bs is 500k m3 so carriers can fit two they might look at making the orca fit a bs with room for a cruiser or a few frigs
ive said this many many timesallow the freighters to transport rigged shipsproblem solvedno its not perfect but it keeps the orca in its niche
lolthats hilarious i myself have seen orcas go through multiple times it does indeed depend on the wormhole but i see no need to reduce the mass of the orca it seems balanced enough to meisaac
actually if you go to the following link youll find that the orca is just the ship that people advise on using to close down wormholeslink
dont waste your breath isaac they are just crying to be crying
i am waiting for them to start whining about the wormholes you cant take an orca into at all because the mass limit is too lowopthis is the stupidest thing i have heard in a very long time wtf does size have to do with anything go find a loaf of bread and a chunk of concrete the same mass tell me if they are even remotely the same size hint if you say yes youre either a liar or a dumbass
nomy corp intentionally uses orcas to force collapse some wormholes sometimes we use it to force collapse an enemies high sec wh exit so they cant escape or enter
the kill contract or bounty or merc depending on which name you like betterworks similar to a courier contract where you can make it public or privatetarget infoindividual or corponly gives general info about target not exact playercorp name to keep people from taking up the contracts on themselves or their friends damage goal total number of kills required to fulfill contract either on the individual or corpreward amount of iskies upon completiontime frame  of daysweeks to accomplish goal to receive iskiesother info any info the contractor would like to place hereexamplesindividualtarget info male caldari player home system clone location of jitadamage goal 12 shipsreward 62 million isktime frame 2 weekscorptarget info caldari corp based off of race of founder home system hq location of jitadamage goal 50 shipsreward 150 million isktime frame 5 dayswhat do you think
how would the actual mechanics work and what would be acceptable targets for them this idea isnt exactly new so the details are what matterit looks like this is just an official mechanism for merc contracts for bounty contracts it would make sense if it would be built around the security status system and be limited in who you can target with them as a dedicated bounty hunter it would also make sense if you could avoid getting concorded for doing their jobif this is just for mercenaries i got nothing against it and something like this would be nice to have
with the introduction of dominion on the 1st of december and the proposed 11 tax on npc corporations this will cause a flood of one man corps through out eden the 11 tax is a great idea but will not solve anything as alliances  corps will not war dec one man corps  under this situation there is no incentive to grow corps into any size at allproposal make all corps pay concord tax similar to alliance taxes  increase the cost of creating a corporation from 2million to 20millionif corp tax was based on the amount of members and the tax payable was on a sliding scale ie 1100 members 10 100300 members 5 300500 members 25 over 500 members 0 tax this is just an example and not probably what ccp would introduce if they were to incorporate this ideaif this idea was introduced alot of players both new and old would seek out the larger corps which will enhance the game for both also alliances with extrememly small corps in them ie 110 man corps itll give an incentive to merge with the larger corps within the alliancesand finally any corps who do not pay the tax are disbanded and if this is done name shortage will not become a future big problem ie i wanted to use the name hidden empire for this corp but the name was registered to a 2004 player one man corp whos in my address book but in a year and a half ive never seen on 
greetingsi can see your point and your personal cow too that is laying in the bottom of a pit so to speak the idea you have has a valid stand pointshowever considering different aspects of organizations ie pirate corporation and other rather non empire based organizations it would be rather funny to pay some tax to concord or to anyone in the empire in that matterand also there are a bunch of one man corps that are used for different things you could not want to be doing in the corporation that you might be in due the current aspect how the game work ie research and inventionas even you would want to do research on your current corp but not to have those precious small antimatter charge bpos in the pos modules but instead resting safely in the station you probably couldnt do that since youd need a corp hangar access for that and when speaking of that someone else would have access to there as well thus making your precious bpos vulnerable for theftwhat could be used for inactive corporations could be that you have a time counter that tracks the activity of a corporation and if not active the corp would go in a state of inactivity which after x amount of time would disband the organization however still the issue with shares would be have to be looked atthis solution would eventually open up the cool names that bring you fame and followers probably a cake too to be back in the pool so to speakwhat comes to the issue non deccing one man corps well instead of having the lovely spam on the corp chat what you used to enjoy and be fond of in the npc corp you would find a peaceful silence and most people would probably feel lonely too and perhaps try to seek out more members to their own venture or end up joining to some other organization for daily 5 oclock tea chatbut the point from your idea to get the inactive corps to fade into the oblivion is a good one and the inactivity timer would probably give some solution to it as well although probably not alland not everyone would enjoy playing in large corporations either  some larger corporations also can have the tendency to turn like the caod is now which yuchh is a quite horrible the universe should be somehow related that people enjoy what they are doing and if someone enjoys playing as a lone wolf let him if he gets most joy out of the game that way  dont see why the person should be punished for his or her enjoyment of the game just because heshe doesnt want to join some massive blob organization to play and try to have fun probably this method would only discourage people from playing the game that only way to have some sensible play it would be in 500 member spam chatroombest regards j
you bring up many valid points so maybe going down the road if all corps pay 1 million a month for the registration of the corp name and if its not paid in 6 months the corp becomes invalid defunct seems the easiest why both for players and ccp in incorporate
no you dont want to nerf other peoples game play even more some people just dont want to be in multiple hundred player corps for some people the 10men corp with their friends is more than enough
darius i agreed to that but having 100s of corp names taken up by inactive players is not an answer to this issue either so something has to put in place regarding this issue but i gather nothing will be done till corp names are like this    because anything good has already been taken
hi maybe it has to be the longer you are in a npc corp the more taxes you have to paymost players who realy want to play the game will find or create a corp with in 36 months
no there doesnt have to be put anything in place you got all those corps already their number will just go up a bit and even if you force them to merge you will end up tons of bigger corps with too many inactive playersand normally a ceo does good in kicking any inactive people especially when he doesnt know them well enoughand if it is just about corp names  creativity always ruled i personally consider the tax for npc corps stupid btw
as a member of a small and awesome corporation i do not support this idea
why would you want to punish the many people who are playing the game with a bunch of friends in small corporationsadding a congregation tax like that would add no value whatsoever and make people vomit in disgust just imagine if a government instated a rule that all cars must have a minimum of occupants when on public roads or the owner is slapped with a fat billthanks but no thanks
this
no its bad enough eve loses some the sandbox attribute when players feel they are being forced into making a player corp or to join one now you want to force that person to join a large corpwhats next after the tutorial youll be assigned to a player corp come on guys you won one ease up for goodnesss sake
i agree that introducing npc corp taxas it should be will cause more 1 man corps however i do not agree with the solutions op offersmy solution is1 double the amount of wardecs you can have going2 have a flat weekly tax on all corps none of that percentage bs enough tax so 1 man corps are hindered and 10 man corps are barely affected something like 510 mil a week
some people is rather terrible at arguing no one is forcing you to do anything stop this bull argument same with the 11 tax there are plenty of isk sinks and taxes in the game and we all some more than others suffer them are necessary if you want to keep a corp paying 1 mill a month is not going to be a nightmare if you really want it you will pay increasing the tax to create corps long time due seriouslly this would stop proliferatyion of stupid oneman corps anyone else including people who really does need to create a corp will pay as with much else in this game i would leave exact quantity to ccpalliance maintenance and creation should be probably increased too due to the currency that major players move around nowvariable maintenace bills if all major corpsalliances should pay an higher bill not the other way around pay for the advatage of being bigger my model would be somethign like 10 players or less x iskplayer 50 players or less 08x iskplayer 100 or less 05x iskplayer etc
so now that ccp has given into the whines of hi sec pirates you begin to realize that this alone wont bring you targets en masse so you move to step 2 force them from 1man corps to multitarget corps maybe we could ask ccp to paint bullseye targets on their backs to make it even easier for you to shoot them we wouldnt want you to work for your kills now
who is to decide whether some really does need to create a corp or nottheres nothing wrong with a one man corp or a two man corp or a 1000 man corp there are many different reasons for wanting to form a corp anything that acts as a barrier wouldnt be goodthere is a lot of mention of inactive corps if there are these flying around then they will likely have a number of outstanding bills for office rent it wouldnt be too out of place to have a corp that is say 12 months behind on its headquarters to be wound up the corp assets seized to pay for the outstanding rent and the members placed into a random npc corp
that hhen you have a bunch of pricy bpos you can afford 5 mill a week
proposing a solution to a problem that does not currently exist i am not supporting this but i would reconsider after weve had dominion for a few months and weve been able to analyze any potential problems
i do not support this at all first of all we are trying to solve a problem that doesnt even exist yet how the hell do you do thatand punishing small active or even semiactive corps is not the answer i do not know what the answer is but it is definitely not more taxes that make absolutely no sense in the game a 00low sec corp paying a tax to who care to explain how that would work within the cannon of evenow starwars galaxies had a rule that once a guild was created you had to get 5 or 10 members within a week or it was disbanded something like that may work but not charging corporations some bogus tax
i dont even support going that far theres nothing inherently wrong with very small corps during low points the corp im with has been down to 3 members those three were active and during that period we flew and acted together as a corp other people dont want to wardec tiny corps thats a seperate issue and maybe the wardec system needs to be looked at but the problem isnt the existance of small corps
i would say that even the wardec limitations are fine you should not be able to wardec everyone and their mother
qft  and awesome sig
not supported
what limitations you can currently wardec anyone who isnt in an npc corporation you just have to do it three at a timeheres a thought stop wardeccing people just to get your epeen stroked and you wont have this problem not directed at you darius  but seriously if a one man corp isnt worth your time go find a bigger corp to fight oh noes i haz to makes choicez
i am a peaceful industrialist i dont even know about that war thing i just supply goodies to shoot things
very much this
war dec limitations lol lmeao lmfeaorotf oh my after several tries to get the war dec limitation raised to 6 or at least to 4 this is just to funny i have found many one man corps to be quite profitable targets of war decs perhaps you just dont recognize a target rich environment when you see one or perhaps you dont have a clue how to make money off of a war having caused hundreds of billions in damages from war and made over a hundred billion in profit from war i can assure you that war in eve can be very profitable
thank you for proving my point  the limit is fine like it is
if youre in a corp and pay tax anyway you shouldnt be able to be wardeccedwhy would you pay tax to concord for protection if they then wouldnt protect
well i never pretended to give the best idea out there but i think that something should be done and talking about it is always goodi never heard about the idea you are talking about btw do you have a link pleasethx
i agree halfway good idea bad motivationindividual hangers might be nice for sorting stuff but have we considered station vaults you can set these to require a password too if im not mistaken
named this thread to proposed as i suggested this in the community round table at the fanfest and hoping it doesnt just vanish into a black hole of nothingnessthe caod as it is now and has been a quite long time  a garbage land inhabited with trolls  lacking the actual organization discussion or something worthwhile to read announcements from themwhat was suggested that youd have a spokepersons role in the corporation  alliance who would have the right to speak for organization that they represent and post on that forum which would hopefully bring quality back to the discussions and announcementsofcourse this would bring out the issue hey i just create a new corporation called ingtrolls and grant my alt a rights to post there ha that will show themwell what was proposed to this that the caod would be discussion and announcements for a bit more veteran corps ie x amount of time existing  yes you could have your evil trolls in the hood alt corp running for x amount of time and then jump in the spread chaos troll poop etc all over the forum although your corporation would probably be banned after that completelythen what about the junior our new formed corporations and alliances we could have a for example a forum called junior caod where you could actually introduce your newly found corporation and alliancethrow it to the bloodthristy audience that lurks there  get your fair share of all the bashing and crap there is which should be in some other forum cry and whine here with cheese and arrow through my brain forumprobably after a while of the  and crap there is to evolve to a bit more civilized discussions and announcements and take your place among the veteran caod forumnot only this would hopefully anyway introduce a bit more quality in the discussions but also would give people something worthwhile to read and probably for the scope to get some juicy stories to write as well and give your now a bit civilized corporation  alliance name and fame amongst the people of the new edenjust some thoughts for brighter and something worthwhile to read while at work future j
cp is actually just as useless theyre both epeen extens0rzcp is for individuals and small corps while coad is for large corps and alliances whats good for one is good for the otherpersonally i say get ridfix both or none they both are crap
breaking up the circle jerk that was caod and bringing the level is discourse down to raw flinging is probably the best thing weve done for eve
there are 2 ways to fix it1 delete it from existence2 actually take the time to moderate itand for  sake get rid of this 5 minute timer
apocrypha 10 and the updates that followed overhauled the probing system simplifying it and making it more accessible to probers but the improvements neglected the directional scanner only one tab to the right from the probing system the directional scanner should be radically overhauled as outlined here linky
agree with most of this go for it
only thing i dont agree with is the whole 30 second for 360 whats the first thing when any pvper scout carebear pirate does when he jumps over a gate in lowsec00 he scans for any hostiles and targetsif you were to implement that piracy will die carebears will liveas fecking usuali agree with moving it a bit and making it look nicer maybe fix it so you can see the scan radius of say 30UFFFD other than that its fine aw and the whole au  km thing
lots of good ideas here i like the dscan on its own tab but automatically updating it without the player spamming the key is attractive i foresee ccp dreading the number of calls to the server that this would create and there should be some discussion of that but largely in agreement with thisid also make sure that filtering of results was possible and that low strength results not be fully identified an excellent pointone other possible change to the system could be to give a visual of the ships orientation on the dscan tab and an arc indicating where the scan was being aimed the arc would be sized according to the players desire through a drop down or by manual entry of the number of degrees and could be grabbed with the mouse and manually aimedrotated rather than tedious zoom out and back in after orienting
reading your proposal im quite confused aligning and repositioning your scanner to point  celestials isnt hard besides its not the ship you have to align its the camera and holding down alt givs a nice crosshair is that what you mean by aligningi like you integration proposals though
himy corp is an empire production corp 1 of the activities is selling bpc packs for example caldari frigat pack of 6 frigat max run bpcson contractit is a painstacking job to sellect the bpc you want in a contract discribe the items in the contractprize it and put the contract out because at any time we have about 120 of those packs outstandingnow my request is is it possible to make a save function in contracts so 1 dont have to do these stapsover and over again instead looking trough a saved list and pick the contract setup you wantprovided you have the items in your corp or personal hanger
if you had read through the wall of text youd know the op did not propose there be a cap of allowed titans just that something terrible happens to titans after a certain number has reached lets say the limit is 4 and defending alliance has 4 titans in system when attacking alliance b cynoes in a titan alliance a has 45 chance of something terrible happening to their titans while alliance b has 15 area of effect weapons are terrible on the server yes but i cant think of better ways of dealing with blobs
hi guysits dt i am bored so i thought i would go a read over the dev blogs againi read about the part where they will be adding tools to help improve your home systems and stuff and i instantly got all these cool ideassuch as having a destructible warehouse anchored on the ice belt of the alliances favorite system cheap t1 sentry guns protecting certain areas like the stargates station or even on the belts they will obv do  poor dps p but its still coolinstead of having just an outpost whats wrong with certain little outpost throughout the system doing different things like a ship maintenance building were repair and fitting is only availableabove idea is sorta awkward and could  people off but i would like to hear what other peoples ideas would be on cool toolscheersgibsearch function fails
i have a suggestion for the chat channelswould it be possible to divide rights to chat channels into 3 categorys superadmin can do everything only group to add people to listsadmin can mute and kickobserver can mute it would help a great deal and would greatly avoid others from adding alot of unauthorized persons to the operators listsin addition a superadmin should be able to call out a log of everything that others on the lists have done like changed motd muted that person for that long kicked that one and so onregards awacs sgt dj sarge on eve radio
ooh very good idea seconded
trying to manage anything out of game is impossible without this give new accounts api access
since apocrypha i noticed a new and rather anoying feature cp added that prevents you from undocking if your ship is fitted with modules that the powergrid cannot support the dialog box claims that this is for saftey reasions but i call bull it is a usless feature that only serves to make it harder to move fittings in smaller ships in the olden days i used to fit strip miners to my friggates empty slots because they could not fit in the cargo hold and i am certain i am not the only person that does this i held my toung when ccp changed the way they worked so they only fit on mining barges but now when i cant even undock because i put on a large shield extender on my daredevil when it wouldnt fit in the hold i understand that ccp may see it as an exploit but in reality it is no different from strapping a bike to the back of a car it serves no balancing purpose and is a purly surpflous function added by gms who dont have anything better to do with their free time than harrass people
step 1 build a ton of doomsdays step 2 put eight on a destroyer put destroyer into carrier sma step 3 repeat 2 until sma is full step 4 congratulations you are now transporting many tens of billions worth of minerals in one jumpcapable ship yes people actually did thisthis wont change back really it doesnt need to either  youre allowed up to double your pg in modules equipped which means you can have two complete legal fits on your ship without breaking anything the fact that you cant use module slots to transport items far too big for your ship is exactly the point  youre not supposed to be able to you want to move strip miners around get a barge or a hauler you can strap a bike to the back of a car with no difficulty the problem is youre trying to strap a car to the back of a bike good luck with that
just because you dont want to use multiple accountscharacters doesnt mean no one else does you may think its unfair but clearly you are in the minority herethis has been suggested many times and each time it has failed it will never happen

could someone on the csm suggest that the actual date be put at the top of the raw logs and the meeting minutes themselves when they are posted labeling them using the format 3008 is decidedly unhelpful and incomplete when you are wondering when exactly the discussion took place
short answer  yesthe csm definitely can effect eve in both good and bad ways the csm has the opportunity to directly interface with ccp in a 11 manner that can definitely change how they think the csm can also help keep ccp honest by being a set of player eyes to review ccp actions when scandals occur so you can choose to believe this or not but i can tell from direct experience these are the factsmy advice is not to ask does the the csm serve a purpose but how do i make sure it is as effective as it can be for making eve a better place for you how do you do thisparticipate study the candidates make them clarify their stands on issues make them state clearly why they are running and what they expect to do if they are elected then when they are elected follow what that do and hold them accountable if they what the bring up as issues or how they voted is inconsistent with what they promised you when they ran call them out if a scandal occurs and they remain silent should ccp make decisions you dont agree with then call them out they promised you when you elected them to serve your interests make sure they honor that promiseor better yet run be part of the process by joining the csm but if you do please take it seriouslyissler dainzecsm2 csm3 csmx
to the op and all the naysayers if you dont think the csm is acting on behalf of the player base nor accomplishing anything i suggest a reading comprehension coursethat said communications from csm to players is sparse and somewhat poorparticularly regarding meeting minutes it annoys me that it takes so long to learn what was discussed in csm meetingsespecially the ones that take place in iceland from the perspective of expectations management regular official status updateseven if no progress has been made in the minutes getting through ccps review processwould be nice they could be put in mazs sticky in assembly hall for ease of trackingedited to add from my perspective the opinions of people who cant be bothered to participate in the csm process by either voting or running for the csm carry far less weight than the opinions of those who embrace the concept of csm and do what they can in order to try and improve it through tangible action
i would like to get by it 
eee i know how to get round it now 
no more detailsdoes that mean csm was not involved in current sov overhaul scheme at all
so when the discussions are in the form of brainstorming it is hard to point at specific items ccp opened the discussions with some high level concepts and then we openly brainstormed how they might become real in game specific things we did stress were that poss needed to be removed from the sov mechanics that we wanted to be able to do more with our space and that we were really excited by the idea we could improve the quality of our space if we had sovin the case of the csm 2 the ideas were still very much in the early stages of formulation so no specific implementation was discussedi wish i could point at feature x of the new sov was the csms doing but you have to remember the csm is not intended be where specific detailed feature designs originate that is what ccp does for a living when we do discuss features and game changes we are expected to be more general in our description of the problem or opportunityi am sure there had to be some discussion of the sov changes with csm 3 once they recover from fanfest maybe they can share something about that here in this threadissler
the brainstorming as i know it and use is not a constructive discussion it is a sophisticated method to seek for new ideas inspiration and possible solution
no you are going to the right page the submission page has yet to be opened i believe

1 yes2 i too would like to see the capability to separate our inflicted damage information from our incurred damage information3 id go so far as to allow us to show just the number portion of the message and to color coordinating them better4 allow us to have numerical representations for everything that affects our ship self repair projected repair natural shield regen natural capacitor regen energy drain energy gain nos energy transfer each could be color coordinated our choice on colors of course so that in a fight i could see that i just did 500pts damage yellow which cost me 100 capacitor blue took 175 damage red and was drained 65 capacitor by a neutralizer orange with my armor finally repairing 300pts damage green all this information is already sent to us from the server and the effects shown in various locations mostly in the hud so any cries of omg more lag are irrelevant as it would be just the client responsible for translating that datastream to a different output format
this would be great
even 13 sec is too longthe delay should be only 05 sec max however this would eliminate all the network load caused by button smashers
13s yeathats still whatever if a game gets too annoying there is always time for a break p

oh hell yeahsigned
to be exactcant see why this hasnt been implementededit linkythese supports also need including
im still in favor of this and it needs to get back up top if the devs are still drunk out of there minds from fanfest we might get lucky and have this added as a top priority
great idea

1good idea maud you filthy pirate you
posting here to mark that i plan to raise this later
confirming this is a good idea
i searched for everything hanger never would have though of that description oh well long as ccp do it i dont care lol
yes very nice
supportinbut dont we already have mael for  shieldtanking
you have my vote absolutely all the dicking about in test server feedback over the current insults to balancing on sisi have been a waste of time
tempest will be passive tanking gank same like the megathron where as maelstrom will be active shield tanking heavy fleet sniper
what a jokemy favorite part is where you make the tempest completely useless tempest needs more lows not less it seems like you have never played this game 857 would be fine yeah shield tanks are awesome and incredibly useful if only there was a crappy minmatar bs ship that already did this oh wait the mael can only assume this is a horrible troll
as explained in this post earlier this will use verry little dataeven if god forbid the system was insanley large and lets say 1kilobyte a ship 500 ships  500 kilobytes which only applied on system load time would on most high speed connections only give you an extra omfg 5 seconds of waiting you would hardly notice the increase and progress should not be halted on behalf of those people who play eve on dialup
i realy tired seeng same thing every day so why not just paint it for one takes care of lags possible do button do not use custom paints
proposalcreate a new web strength amplifier modulethis mod would be a lowslot item only one could be equipped per ship like a dcuit would be supported by a skill further amplifying its effect at level v the mod  the skill bonus would make webs roughly 80 strength compared to 60 without the modskillwhyan 80 web would unnerf the huginnrapier and make them fair compared to all other recons currently amarr have recons that can cap any other ship in seconds caldari still have recons that can totally remove 23 ships from a fight gallente have scram out to 20km  which is now uberan 80 10km web would not be overpowered on the average pvp ship especially if it had to give up a damage mod or tank mod to do it an 80 35km web is not over powered on a minmitar recon that has no other useful purpose and would give up speed in exchangein fact this would be a great addition to the game and add exciting new trade offs to pvp
amenreally csm deligates how did you think that would flyafter seeing the massive objections on the forum then continuing to not explain your reasons to the general publicamazingly brash think this shows that we very much do not want these same candidates if this is how they behave

mazzilliu if your going to update this to the csm how about putting the player input into the answer for examplecons  allows large corporations to abuse the csm system  allows ccp staff to abuse the system  reduces flow of ideas and processes leading to a power struggle  creates more tension for ccp which it doesnt need right now  likely to cost more than its value ccp investing to get new ideas and thoughts rolling  gives a lot of players the incentive to become a csm member for the wrong reasons  may indirectly impact other volunteer programs which receive no special incentives  on general principle makes the csm members think they can rule the worldperhaps next you want to scrap the election process while your at it  half the eve population doesnt know about what csm is does or receives from ccp in terms of benefits
quoting a qft posting in an epic fail thread andcompletelyutterly opposed to the ideas presented
is there a way to impeach mazz for being a total idiot in ignoring the obvious lack of support
unfortunately no we can simply think of this as the asshat csm and hopefully not have a repeat in the future unfortunately the good things this particular csm have done will forever be drowned out by the idiocy of the last six months which is unfortunate the current members of the csm who can run again are going to be tainted by association
there are plenty of remedies to correct this atrocity however the problem is after the first few posts csm stopped looking at this issue probably because of the one week time frame to be considered for csm submission at any rate heres a few fixes  update the evelopedia file with proper information not your fantasy version  remove the information from the submission pile provided it hasnt already been processed
this issue passed in the csm you have three other delegates to thank not just mazzi dont think id want to go so far as to impeach or recall mazz as shes done a lot of good work on the csmbut this particular issue has been handled very badly there are also no hard rules on how an issue needs to be proposed to the csm so while this may be a rather disappointing incident there is technically nothing wrong about itall you can do is remember who voted to pass this issue when it comes time for voting
complete crap three csms have just guaranteed they will never get a vote from me i encourage just about everyone to take this stance even if they pass this nonsense make sure they dont benefit from it
ccp still has final say it is in fact their gametheir rules they can decide to completely ignore whatever the csms have done on this matter should they choose tostill i already know who im voting for his home corn liquor brew sold me
ah yes lets all thank the egotistical i got boobs no offense to de of course lets make a proposal and vote it in with less than 3 supports for making such a stellar farce of this csm termyes much good to be had hereim glad you love this sort of thing its no wonder the csm have a hell of a time retaining any sense of decency let alone respect when there own ing people ignore the ing publicnormally i always back them but this is crossing the linehell id say this is worse than lark at least he had the guts to fess up to it sorta kinda
fuck yeah
yes but i gave a thought to something elsethat is mission i thought for the belt and plex npcsand other thing 00 rats why give for players security standings  no concord there not decreasing when someone shoting to someone but increasing when shot the npcs  thats need to change to npc pirate faction standing change
that is exactly the point you shouldnt take those hits you keep your empire faction standing to run missions there if you get kicked out of your region at some point
its were u get your bounties for right its were u get your lps for right its why u earn 45m ph rightno penalties for farming tons of isk in the safety of empire if ccp implement this im going to quit eve with my 5 accounts not supported wow  way
yes
you realise this proposal is designd to allow people to move to 00 and mission out there but otherwise cant because they nerfed the hell out of there pie faction standings while living out in empirealso supported as missioning is slighly less boring than going round and round and round the belts in a trance when your skint or theres nothing going on and i cant run local mish because i nerfed my standing to hell while doing the empire thing lol
i agree with this sentiment buying your way with isk i dont like but some betrayal mechanic should exist to show the pirates youre really with themagain though choices have consequences this should do something like turn the 8 caldari standings to 8 or something equally as drastic if youre going to betray your faction they wont like you the pirates will also require that youve not run missions for their enemy or shot at any other their ships for at least a month how are they going to trust you if youre still shooting them down a negative sec rating could also be required also to prove you are really a pirate something that will get you shot down if you go into high sec systems at least 07 and abovethere could be some isk as a bribe to the agent but the above faction effects would be more worthwhile as those standings take time you could have more challenges to prove your worth such as taking on fleets of empire navy ships in a mission in low secbut not a simple payout and cool off if you really want those pirate standings you cant be working for the empire any more also you should know that the empire wont take you back probably ever pirates betray people caldari or your race wont trust you again after youve betrayed them though
i agree with these proposals who cares if you have to pay isk to bribe your way to neutral standing that isk leaves the game and its actually rp appropriate
since ccp looking into mini atm there might be the time to also have a serious look into the recons
my rapier and huginn are working fine no changes needed
a dualwebbed vagabond becomes a vagabond that suddenly can be caught by pretty much anything with an abmwd and has a sig radius of a small moonits fine the purpose of minmatar ew is to make it easier to hit stuff youll have no trouble hitting a double webbed mwding vagabond
i support this op 100 but i also support the idea of a web strength amp mod see
i seem to remember a point in time at which there were rumours about a low security sovereignty system i suppose this developed into factional warfare eventually but to the pointlow security space is the unfortunate middleman of space in eve high security has concord and wardecs nullsec has its own playerrun empires and wormhole space has no local and the routes to and from it fluctuate whereas lowsec is an area in which most pvp will get you flagged local is present and you cant set up systems by which you can easily lock it downnow before the whines start im not proposing we do any of the following remove local allow bubbles or remove sentries none of that has been done to death and the answer is typically an overwhelming nowhat i suggest is that ccp make low security space the new black market for babies organs drugs biomass and baby organs simply put make low security space different from high null and w space rather than a mix of all three perhaps put a sov system in place that provides economic bonuses for those who hold sov like whats presently proposed for nullsec on a smaller scale increase the incidence of gas clouds allow implant manufacturing there etc etcanother suggestion i remember seeing was to delay local by a short period of time maybe something like 30 seconds to 2 minutes the gate crews are probably understaffed and underpaid and itd add to the danger of the whole place somewhat but not to a huge degreethis is by no means a properly thought out list of ideas its a call for improvement in that areatldr create incentives for players to visit and establish themselves in lowsec other than pvp make it unique
while i dont know if any of what he suggested is sensible lowsec definitely needs a revamp right now gate and sentry guns as well as the gcc only encourage big ship warfare as opposed to discouraging whatever it is they were meant to be discouraging
assault frigs projectile weapons capital hybrid turrets destroyers the csm has raised and argued about a lot of various balancing issues already and theres still a lot more floating around what i want to do with this thread is poll the forums for which issues that have not already been raised in a csm meeting are really annoying the hell out of you just list your 1 complaint with a certain ship weapon system module or whatever to help us prioritize our list of issues
1 lachestis wtf missiles2 keres is it usefull with only 2 dampers3 arazu uhm dampners sk cause u need atleast 3 4 sin t2 battleship that is even worse than a battlecruiser5 gallente destroyer a rifter is even better6 gallente ships could use some extra cap or power grid in general because of the use of blasters a blaster ship without mwd  dead and a mwd ship without capbooster  fail 7 black op can use some more power grind in general8 cover op jump portal generators uses 1500 powergrind on a ship that has a bonus for it whats that all about
i may be going over some of the stuff you already raised but will post anywaysrockets torpedoes were boosted to be useful in pvp then hams were introduced while rockets have been unchangedtech2 short range ammo is useless compared to faction ammo tech 2 guns take quite a bit of training and cost more powergridcpu than t1 and only get a 810 damage bonus from the spec skill maybe change t2 short range ammo from high damageterrible tracking to decent damageawesome tracking i dunno whateverits also really annoying how the sabre is leagues above every other interdictor in the game so much that the sabre is insanely expensive boost the other dictors plox i know you raised t1 destroyers how about t2 as well
tengu and to a lesser extent the proteus seem to be completely out of whack compared to the other t3 ships in usability those 2 either need nerfing boo or the other 2 need boosting yayfrom my own experience and chatting to others it pretty much boils down to the tenguprot being able to both tank and do serious damage where the others need to make a choice between ganktank
to be fair to the proposal its always been the blood home region and those dozen npc systems sitting in the middle of it are a big part of why its so defensible along with providing a good source of playerlevel income a lot of 00 space doesnt get delve is the mecca of 00 in large part because of the blood bits still the game just came out of a three year long war over who would own that region it doesnt seem quite right to call the whole thing off after its over not to mention the lynch mobs the players would organize based on claims of ccp would have done this years ago except bob owned the space then and so on its not necessary and its not justifiable no support
delve and querious is going to be splitted among many small aliancescorps after dominion sovchanges anyways because of good rats therewe have enough npc00 there no more is neededfck the time flux
war or no war it has nothing to do with my proposal its not inline with other npc homes regions and amount of npc space from other factions this wouldnt have been able to be changed in the past because sov is very important and now all sov will go down anyway dominion gives the perfect oppertunity to straighten this bug out and show us the eve players that we are all equal and no alliance gets any benifit above others strangly u can say exacly the same from the ferrogell exploit wile it was still undetectend and u owned a few posses that exploited this bug
battlestars has valiantly kept the blood raiders at bay
depends how you count really the blood are low on sovereign systems but in terms of settled systems they actually beat the guristas pretty handily and arent too far behind the serps and the angels yeah theyre on the low end of the five but its not so low that theyre in obvious need of repair and no no alliance is getting any benefit over others you want delve go take it youre seriously trying to compare different npc factions being different with a massive and economywrecking exploit being abused thats moronic
syndicate belongs to the intaki syndicate not seprentisalso for example mordus legion live in pure blind but only hold sov over one system
what im trying to say is that all the major factions have npc space to float around in and blood raiders only have 7 systems srry if i wasnt clear enough my native langish isnt english ore thukker and mordus arnt exacly large factions they dont even have officers
rather than perscribe a particular remedy in which the forest gets lost in the trees simply thisthat the csm1 acknowledge the likely hood of a proliferation of small corporations after the change to the npc tax rate2 acknowledge their consituents desire to be able to start legitimate corporations wihout using a character randomizer because all of the names they wanted and all of the sensible variations there of are taken up3 realize a fair number of corps are simple placeholders while using a character to keep a corp open and name reserved isnt bad squatting shouldnt be indefinitely free4 ask ccp to commit to developing an elegant solution to the issue which allows players to continue this practice as long as they are active and paying attention but closes the corporations of purely inactive characters to allow for the growth of the communitymy personal take is that hqs should have a tax similar to offices which can over time bleed a corporation out if no one is around to fill the coffers and click the button perhaps someone else or even ccp proper can develop a more elegant solution which is why i ask the csm to take up this issue and raise its importance to ccp rather than debate and advocate a specific mechanic to fix it
interesting idea but how would ccp be able to tell that an inactive characters permanently inactive people do take very long breaks from eve after all i like the idea of automatic rent tax for all rented offices that the corp has once the corp wallet is exhausted and rent can no longer be collected the corp members could be booted to the npc corps and the corp autoclosed butkf a corp is closed does the name become available for others to useanyway ill be interested to see the discussion on this topic if a well thought out suggestion for a solution is made i might support it
solution for a non existant problem not supported
city of heroes had a system in place where if someones character was inactive for over half the year their name would be up for grabs by new players if they resubscribed after that if that name was chosen by a new player they were given the ability to choose a new namethis was necessary because folks would often create level 1 characters to reserve names should they decide to roll a new concept character to play with however most never did use them and it became a bit of a problem until that was implementedif corporation names end up being a problem with the npc tax system i think a couple lines of code to account for that would be more than enough to suffice and ultimately also wouldnt have any of the negatives that a tax might induce
this
i think that the potential increase in the number of one or two person corps is a relevant concern however no one wants to be too heavy handed before the problem actually materializes the automatic billing proposal seems pretty reasonable thoughwhat concerns me with the potential for all of these corps popping up is the premium that offices will be at and the increase in costs because of that im sure ccp has already considered this and concluded that it just pushes more little corps together and thats what their aim is to get people interacting well see what happens though im not concerned enough to propose something be done before seeing the scope of the issue
yep this
valid reasoning but a very very very very very very very low priority issue and at best nonexistentnot supported
the point being that the orca would be less dense due to the fact its designed to hold large amounts of items which means that much of the space is filled when empty with space the orca is like your floating piece of bread as bread has pockets of air something more dense would be something like a carrier or even a battleship which is laden with armor weapon and redundant electronic systems its amazing to see so many people have issues with changing things im curious as to what your ulterior motive is is it because you also use the orca for shutting down wormholes or is it because you are against anything any industrial player asks for you have attacked the logic behind the ship design itself but you have given no indication why you would oppose such a change in the game how would this negatively impact you should this proposal be accepted
what we have issue with is your incesesant whining and cryingwe have no issue with the systemthe orca is fine as it is its a sturdy ship and it serves us whs explorersminersindustrialists just finein all honesty its a bit stupid to use the orca for the sole purpose of killing a wh a battleship with armor plating would be far more effectivemaybe its time you should stop playing in the sandbox class 1 and start working in class 2s and 3s so you dont have the problem of killin whsadditionally its a valid tactic to slam the door on people who invade areas of whs that are claimed and since its 00 anyone can do whatever the  they want to do with itdont like it then move along kiddo because this isnt going to change a single bloody thingif it wasnt the orca youd be picking on an another ship and asking to have its mass lowered as wellthe issue is you not the orcacapiche
you could always kill the orca if your problem is wormholes shutting down
you still havent stated what issues you have with the proposal instead you dodge around the issue and make attacks on me because youre unable to justify a real reason besides saying you are the problem lets not degarde the issue into childish banter personal attacks is simply a childish means of deflection stay ot please
frankly this wouldnt impact me one way or the other since the wormholes i frequent are too small to get an orca through the begin withand speaking as an industrial player my opposition to this change is because theres no need for it aside from your whine in this thread and since i dont see a long line of people in here supporting it im guessing there arent a lot of other people who see the need for it eithersometimes people who dont support your ideas do it because its a bad idea not because we have an ulterior motive seriouslyparanoid much
try reading first offsecondly try listeningbut since i have to spell it out to you since your such a whs noob fine then1 your obviously lack experience if you keep having trouble with orcas getting inas ive clearly indicated step it up to class 2s and 3s problem solved2 you want to lower the mass of the orca for whs transitions but in reality the real problem is mass itself to what end would this accomplish more entrances and exits with orcas whats your real motivation and not this pathetic excuse youve given us as i said if i was going to kill a wormhole then get some real mass a battleship for examplein addition just because no one can come up with a obvious drawback in your delussionary world to your proposal doesnt mean we are stupid and your ideas is the bestthe point is as ive said many times before this is a waste of time and your whining over nothingwhs is supposed to be unstable unpredictable risky yet rewardingnot everyone is going to figure it outi suggest you take a step back and start doing a little bit more homework and alot less gripingnothing irritates me more than hiddenveiled proposalsmass smass your up to something else here
actually i was just making the proposal in hopes that the orcas would be able to make more trips through the wormholes and be able to traverse the lower class wormholes as well i have no other motive than to be able to use a ship for its intended role also a battleship currently has much less mass than an orca so closing a wormhole will take longer with a battleship i have no issues with people using orcas to close wormholes although i believe that this may be why some oppose the proposal its cheaper to lose an orca than a carrier
i give up this guy is hopeless
i like the idea but if you dont moderate it correctly people would just use their alts to get a kill  grief anywhere license and thatd not be goodtbh i dont see how it could work
theres enough things for mercs to do that arent purely killingprotection suppression etc that im loath to run it through a contract system that only includes kills also kills as a raw count is an awful system  hey player1 just took out a merc contract on you for 100 mil let me pop a dozen shuttles and ill split it with you is hardly what we want to encourage i appreciate the attempt but i dont think that this is the right way
ok im just going to go ahead and say it because i think some are missing the obvious 1man corps do pay taxes the ceo collects that tax however hell he wants to and spends that tax however hell he sees fit whether its buying its members ie the only member  ships mods whatever the hell the ceo of that corporation wants to do with that tax so why in the world would you want to add another tax to 1man corpswould it make you feel better if all 1man corps were forced to set a corp tax of 50 as the ceo theyll still have access to that tax money and it will still belong to the ceo  so in the end its the same amount of isk but in two different walletsstop trying to fix something that needs no fixing sall
go wardec noir or goonfleet or some other large alliancecorporationoh wait you cant because you wouldnt win or make profityep make sense to me
they shoot back  of course he wouldnt want to wardec em
the reason the tax is being implemented is to make it so that the wardec immunity provided by npc corps doesnt come free one player corps arent immune to wardecs it might be slightly annoying to have a million of them buzzing around but its not actually a problem and even if they never group up itll have done its job
bingo amongst other things
you miss the point its corp names thats the real issue im getting at in a few years under the present dominion expansion finding a name will be a real problem the idea is to weed out the inactive corps so there ticker names be added back to the pool and btw on my alt noir wouldnt be a problem and you go and dec the goons
can feel your pain people have been swimming in the  of trolls so long that they have been morphed into them no one really bothers actually to read the posts anymore  just pick one random thing in the posts and start going at it and ignore everything else j
why you cant think something original for your corp name and suffer because the name you want is already takeni am against the recycling of even dead corps name after a name is chosen it should be linked to that corp and only that corp if you want to use a dead corp name do at least the minimum work to call it new xx or refounded xxhaving 99 of dead sparta corporations and one alive because a lot of people enjoyed the film will create a lot of confusion about who was in what corporation
funny that drake as i see you in forums constantly but i never see you logged on i guess you do your fighting in forums troll
i find myself looking for alot of the same things on contracts constantly just to check prices of certain items and rather than keep putting the item name in and selecting from a list i wonder if it would be possible to implement a quickbar of sorts for contracts so a person can immediately look up something from a list of favoritesthoughts
bumped for a breath of fresh air and a windbags prerogativeafter further thought ill readress this topic wo adding it back to the opthe sec status link had 3 major effects 1 it affects empire wars its easy to travel 4 jumps if you have no wars it becomes more challenging if you arent so lucky2nd it affects timereward value especially for 00 players is it really worth going to empire every time to insure a ship at a higher value for a lot of players its not even worth 2 jumps if that were not true you wouldnt see a varied market price from system to system on the average mods3rd it affects piracy its easy to move a bs to 10 with good security status but it penalizes people who live a life of crime and quite honestly why shouldnt it
remove insurance alltogether imo
i agree insurance has a number of flaws but they are not critical your system just is not going to workpvp is already very expensive especially for the new players what i would like to see is insurance varying depending on what modules you have installed and maybe some kind of insurance for t2 gear and ships
i think that this is on face a great attempt at fixing insurance scamming im in full support of not giving payouts even the 40 base payout to gate gunconcordself destructs also like the idea of shortening the premium timesbut if insurance is designed to encourage pvp then the penalty for losing ships will start to play against that i like the mechanic itself eventually you will be prevented from doing something youre bad at financially or a lot of isk will leave the game so how about this compromisethe lower the sec rating of the system where you lose your ship the more forgiving your insurance history becomes instead of the model being you went to a dangerous place and that was stupid it shifts to thank you for losing your ship in a dangerous area rather than doing so in our highly civilized highsec systemsthis lets pvp go and be pvp it also means that if you want to shoot your ship up because its about to be uninsured you can take it to a lower sec system if it might affect your insurance history and if its gonna end up dead anyway why not have some fun there and drive it like you stole it rather than just having a friend or local pirate shoot it lower rate of profit oriented insurance scamming more traffic to lower security systems isnt this what ccp has been trying to effect

yeah brilliant idea all they have to do then is just read out the stored password from a file
to be honest i dont bother with the rest of the forums and find it difficult sometimes with this one when you have trolls just shutting down ideas without providing honest feedback ccp clearly doesnt monitor these forums and so nothing occursthat said it wouldnt be a bad idea for them to seek volunteer moderators to clean up ill responses as they are so numerous and need a lot of folks cleaning them up after so many reports from a volunteer moderator a senior steps in to determine the situation and if necessary ban thempresently this cant be happening because the trolls are still around
once again cheers for your insightful knowledge drake dismiss an issue without giving any helpful feedback or in your words foresightthe bounty system is already exploited and this new system does not ensure that faction loot will drop when you kill a spawn the idea is to make it a random chance with the majority of spawns being difficult deadly and threatening to pod you if you get caught they wont be like ratting at all more like either between ratting and wormholes or like wormholes in difficulty without the system disadvantages ofcourseso i put forth once again that you have dismissed an idea without having your own foresightas your a forum troll and devote 10 seconds to each post if only forum administrators made a new rule for exactly that behaviour
interesting set of ideas ill tell you right now that autoscan wont happen for server load reasons but the approach to integrating directional into the existing probing interface i like a lot supported
yup i can see this making many peoples lives far easier
good ideafor the meeting minutes we are waiting for perhaps 14022010 might be an appropriate dateskunk
there has been some discussion about changing the process so that the final minutes are approved as the meeting goes on basically after every topic the portion related to that topic get read back and approved right then that would allow the minutes to be almost immediately released i hope the csms of the future adopt something like thatissler
excellent summary at least the forum whining from the csms was interesting to read when jade was involved now i feel like im reading some horrible deviantartist justify why their nonart is actually art and how everyone else is wrong without ever providing any facts to back it up outside of i know something you dont nyah nyah nyah the egos of most of the csm posting in this thread are precisely the example of why they are not fit for the job according to modern leadership theories good leaders which they fall under the definition of have words such as coach or servant or humble or able to listen to viewpoints directly opposed to their own attached to them unfortunately theyre as hard to find on internet games as in the real worldemphasis mine
i read sun tzuUFFFDs art of war and quote from it continuously i think this makes me fit to lead i have also read machiavelliUFFFDs books and i have come to the conclusion that not only am i fit to lead i ought to take down anyone else trying to run for the csm until i am the only viable candidate remainingalso i occasionally have the word UFFFDservantUFFFD at least attached to me as in sometimes i can get someone to do stuff for me i also like to UFFFDhumbleUFFFD others for my own amusement and UFFFDcoachUFFFD people when i think i know things better then themalso the bolded word in your quote is my own emphasis its the loophole that makes me exempt because i am a girl in real life woohoooooo
id also be very grateful to have a larger variety of font sizes 836 at least would be wonderful thanks ccp
honestly 0 and o should be radically differentseriously supported
0od these all look similar far too alike in the current font please fix
i mainly fly t2 frigates and have no fear of dessies whatsoever surely this is wrongiirc the purpose of having 25 rof but with more guns was to increase alpha it all made sense a very long time ago
cormorant id prefer to fit with 8 missile slots to be honest tweak them they can only effectively fit rocket launchers and give them a missile range boost if you have to that fits in with the antifrig effect anyways
i honestly love the thrasher even if i dont fly it that much any more you could make it better by adding another low slot for a gyro or another mid for some more shield or a seboeven nicer would be if there were 2 t2 variants of the thrasher one the sabre and two a little terror damage boat with a tankthe one thing they should do with the thrasher is remove the rof penalty to make it viable against afs and cruisersthey could make a t2 catalyst variant with 5 drones aka an ishkur with guns and tankcoercer could simply do with a cap bonus and cormorant well i honestly dont know because its so badbut any buff to destroyers would be lovely
ccp please helpa donation of 90 ms explosion velocity could rehabilitate a vengeancea donation of 25 hp damage to a basic rocket could save them from the recycle binplease reach deep into your hearts and give to a deserving cause
bump question to the original poster did it actually happen that the latest patch made your hid stop working
this spawned off another thread where someone was reporting their mates problem he uses a suckpuff mouse was effected by the removal of the zoom buttonsbasically whenever he undocks jumps thru a gate or anything that resets the camera he has to call someone into his room to manually reset the camera the simple removal of 2 usable buttons completely destroyed his experience of eve
are there any numbers on how large the group is that has physical limitations like this if ccp believes that this group is very small they may feel less inclined to do something about it
hell yeh fix bugs that stops people with disabilities from playing
100 supportedsomething id love to see is a talk to type function built into eve voice i know that they are widely available but anyone whos ever fcd with deaf people in the fleet will know that the available workarounds are a pain in the assit would also be a great tool for all players if everything the fc said was repeated in a text window
well last alliance i was in the favourite topic of conversation on ts was painkiller sideeffectsthere are a lot of people in eve who cant work or are on some type of compensation for injurynot all have limited function but plenty do
supported w added dmg type plz trying to figure out that the dmg type by the visual effect is stupid
yes plz
signed
that would actually be a good middle ground imo while i would prefer it to be even a bit lower i could live with thatmaking the button unclickable is a great idea as well should also remove the autorescan when adjusting angleedit or go an entirely different way and make the delay depending on how many things the scanner actually finds say 10 msec for every signature found
i was going to suggest the same thing though 13 is probably still a bit long its fine for people that just spam the button to check for enemies but when youre fast at using the directional scanner to pinpoint something any delay over 05 seconds will slow you downwhat if they changed the delay to 05 for frigates 13 for cruisers and 2 for anything bigger scouts and covops would retain their current usage but missionrunners and wspace pilots the kind that need to spam the button will still only be able to hit it every 13 to 2 seconds
the only thing ccp has to do is remove the delay from narrow scans
3 seconds or less should be fine  for an inty 2s is ridiculous
definetly needs changing
crap scanning wasnt lagging up my game in the first place
signed
signed 2s or even 13s is ridiculous
support this topic remember your alts support it too
supported
as far as i can tell ccp added scanner delay for purely technical reasons so the chances of this delay being removed are as likely as session change timers being removed i think it would be more productive for your thumbs to instead weigh in on the proposals trying to fix localsystem hunting
hey it could be an implant eh honestly if youve got ur wallet all managed ur not the kinda person wholl succumb to a scammer easily
while i agree most of what you said keep in mind not everyone is able to take time away from there rl and fly to iceland or go to meetings every week about a video game in addition to that the csm considers this issue already brought up and i as well as many others disagree with that it was a poor job they misrepresented the idea and made it look like a joke not worth 10 min of there time it never even made it officially to the table as it was already discussed and there was no point in talking about it as such the csm has failed on this topic and until that changes or i am in a position to signup for the csm and support this idea myself im going to lobby for itsure you can sit there and say you do the job and see how it gos for you but end of day the real world knocks and bread and butter come before anything else
yup
there is a very good reason plex isnt transportable picture me this you are flying around space to bring your plex from one station to another somebody is passive targeting you to cargo scan and they see said plex they suicide gank you their corp mate takes your plex yay free month of gameplay plexes are usable from anywhere so theres no reason they should be transportableother than that fully supported
how is this different from ganking your 300m hauler and buying a plex yay free monthfully supported this would be awesome
for the sake of followup i am letting you guys know that this is in the works
its in the works as in ccp is already working on coding it and putting it in game soon or in the works as in your planning on proposing it to ccp and putting their head in a vice until they introduce italso supported edit spelling
fully supported
i like your thinking as it doesnt do the self flagellated thing that so many minnie after years of playin eve on hard mode think that minnies need to have i mean the amarr get an entire class of ships that simply are better than anything else in their class zealot curse abaddon apoc geddon etc etc so why ffs cant we ask for a speed tanking tempest with highly mobile arties no one complains that the curse can kill just about anything at range i can see future gila pilots fitting fof missiles with its numerous bonuses to nosneuttracking disruptorsmwd etc ccp will only give us the changes if we make ourselves heard loudly enough and long enough
yea
id prefer a set of changes like this to what is currently planned by ccp most importantly it avoids the problem of having to rebalanced the falloff mechanic which might well unbalance such ships as that already work well with acs like the vagabond and vargur and future machariel changing artillery based on size stops the artillerythrasher becoming overpowered so that seems like a good idea to methough i would like a 7mid tempest im a little worried it might eclipse the maelstrom putting a shield boost amp ii in that extra mid makes it essentially identical while having close to the same effective turrets and 2 utility highsedit maybe best to rename this topic dominion projectile balancing revised
its a pity we cant just do it serverside like custom weapon skins in css i dont really care if other people cant see what my paint job looks like im kinda weird like that
black ops colored raven ftw
you people are making alot of assumptions hereits not as easy as it sounds otherwise ccp would have done it a few years back as it isi like the idea but i seriously doubt it will ever happen because there is obviously more to this than what everyone assumes it to be
care to point at what part of dominion is a massive boost to new playersreducing a few prerequisites
notsignedagree with this 
not supported new players today have many advantages over new players in the pastneural remappingcheap and accessible implantsdouble skill speed training at firstwe only really have to problems1 other players telling new players they are worthless until they have 20m sp2 other players telling new players to do nothing but train learning skills when they start outtake the lower rank learning skills to 2 or 3 then get halfway decent at flying a ship you like then you can go back and fill in the learning skills
9 times out of 10 these stupid posts are always due to lazyness and people who dont want to wait for spslearning skills honestly teach you to be paitent you invest in skills to gain an advantage that will take months off of that nasty very long skill down the roadboosting noobs who join the game are self defeating and insulting to players who have managed to get capital ships as im not at that stage yet and its daunting in itselfthey already have a major advantage the biggest issue is they keep getting told to do stupid things and you have these corps who demand a higher sp qualification not in every case mind you some corps dont have a choice in the matterbut thats not the problem the problem is this is eve onlinenot world of frakking warcraftnot supported
a friend i know in another corp who i helped recruit for got two newbies in they never had a problem fitting in and yes they did train learning skills but it was between other skills for pvp they were effective tacklers at about 15 mill sp and they both still play and like the gamenot supported
there have been lots of threads about salvage theft and loot theft etc especially in relation to missioning in high security empire space i want to ignore a lot of flames on these threads which usually boil down to go mission elsewhere and bring a specific point to the table i would very much appreciate it if the csm could then take this to ccp with the intent of looking at getting it fixed or at the very least explaining to me why the game works in this waywhat am i talking about when someone comes to one of my cans or one of my wrecks and takes something out of it i am able to attack him without concord getting involved to put it simply he goes flashy red obvious exceptions excludedhowever if this same someone was to instead salvage one of my wrecks but not remove any of the contents he does not go flashy redso he is not allowed to steal my loot but he is allowed to steal my salvage or to phrase that differently im allowed to protect my loot through the threat of killing the thief but im not allowed to protect my salvagebearing in mind that quite a few missions require you to fully salvage them for them to be profitable at all why and can this please be changed
the only point that is to be brought to the table is that it is intended game mechanics we have too much threads flogging the dead horse and its not going to happenninja salvaging is a profession i dont like it that much either but i recognize it for what it is i think the whole missioning system sucks but that doesnt make me want to start an endless stampede of annoying threads about itnow can we please stop the flooding of the waaah someone salvaged teh wreck threadssigh
game mechanic answerloot is inside a container which is tied to your character and your corporation unless you happen to be in an npc corp so anyone who takes from the container without being a member of your corp or you obviously gets flagged because thats how containers work inside the game code for more reference look at how jet cans worksalvage on the other hand is not inside a container because a wreck isnt treated like a container its treated more like an asteroid to be honest  you perform some action on it and it yields an appropriate result actually i suppose theyre more like hacker sites which may or may not yield anything at all but the point remains  until you actually have the ore or salvage in this case in your cargo hold it belongs to whoever gets to it firstas far as getting it changed youre fighting an uphill losing battle ccp has already stated repeatedly that they are not going to change this mechanic because salvaging is a mini profession separate from missioning itself and as missioning is not the only way to create wrecks they do have a pointand to your point of missions only being profitable if you fully salvage them  if a few armor plates or tripped power circuits are the difference between profit and loss for you i question your methods
wrong  sftu you dont know what your talking about quit living under a rock please and get a life ffswhat do you think people did with the new scanning change they whine yelling screamed ed and made some threats here and there and it worked pirated finally cried enough mega nom nom and it finally workedccp decided to put it down to 13s here is the only thing that i can say about this continue screaming yelling crying until ccp make the changes this is how it works yell enough and ccp will make the change plain and simple its a business thing if you dont know what i mean stfu
we were actually having a calm discussion until you came in here with your vitriolic inflammatory commentsreported trolling
1 i wasnt talking to you or i wasnt pointing at you2 i was helping you cause your going to get flamed3 learn how to read and finish the whole post before freaking cause if you did you wouldnt make this type of useless reply
ccp devs have repeatedly and consistently made the same answer every time this subject has been brought up salvage is free for all thats how they intended it to be from the beginning and thats how it will stay furthermore they have no intention whatsoever of boosting the income from hisec mission running to the contrarydeal with it
1 she was attacking your belligerent attitude2 she did read3 she never needs help she can take care of herself just fineyour pushing it too hard back off you made your point no need to get a jackhammer outand no im not the model example of this as i tend to get riled up myself but you dont go attacking your allies in the processas for the situation i dont like the idea of ninja salvaging as much as the next guy but my beef is inside missions itself everywhere else is open game to mebut these days i spend more time mining and exploring than i do missioning so its a bit of a moot point
thank you for explaining i understand what your sayinghowever the wreak does have my corp name on it and personally i still think that i should have the option of defending my claim on it just like how i can defend the loot which i created im not asking for concord to defend it im not asking for salvaging to not be a miniprofession im asking for the ability to shoot people who profit off the back of my work without concord being involved im sure that there is an acceptable change which could be made here  i dont know what it is thoughgiven that you say this has already been addressed then ill go back in to my hole and try to stop getting worked up over it
something that i have been working on is not free for everybody i personally did not suffer much from that but i think i should be able to kick ass of some tard that is stealing my mission salvage the simple reason that makes salvage not free for everybody is that if they repeatedly steal someones loot that someone is going to dec them sooner or later just the matter of how that person gets ed off although i think nidhiesk is a bit too emotinal about it i do agree with what he is saying this is for the same of more pvp if someone steals my stuff they should be ready to face the consequences
you people do realize that if and i do mean if you get this your opening up a new can of worms rightwhen you declare that wrecks are yours essentially this means can  wrecksand when that happens a whole new sport of ganking takes place
i know a whole lot of people who would love for this to become true and they are not mission runnersediti forgot to give support to this wonderful idea
let them reap what they sow
i fail to see any significant can of worms they already equal to cans the only difference is that you cannot salvage canstaking stuff out of someone elses wreck already makes you vulnerable to them and shoting other peoples wrecks equally as cans will get you concorded
supported so i can hear the sound of exploding ravens from motsu to gulfondi and while youre there each mission hub should have an aztec style pyramid for making human sacrifices surrounded by a moat of carebear tearsto the op and those who agree with her  given there are some fairly sizeable corps based on salvaging do you think said corps will simply go away if your proposal was accepted or do you think they will specialize in blowing up mission runners1 currently salvaging is non aggressive no flagging or concord2 making salvaging aggressive means people have no incentive to leave your cans behind so they will take both the loot and salvage3 mission runners will now have to pvp to protect their loot4 carebear tears flood the ccp office because not everyone wants to pvp
wow this seems to return every weekyou know what normally will happen if you shoot the ninja salvagerhe will come back in his shiny pvp fit ship and kill your shiny pve fit shipi saw someone loosing his absolution to a hurricane because of that yesterdayso instead of loosing some wrecks you will loose some wrecks and your mission shipsounds smartthat said and taking into account that the usual answer from ccp was salvage is for everyoneyou got options shoot the wreck what doesnt exist cant be salvaged leave the mission and hope the rat aggro pops the ninja salvager bonus lol moment for you run missions outside of the big hubs where you got less people and therefor less ninja salvagernot supported
i would endorse the suggestion that ccp should put up a screen with a careful and detailed explanation of why salvaging can never be considered theft every time you start the game
i will agree with your proposal on one conditionanyone can tractor any wreck no matter who its tagged forotherwise you are wanting nothing more than to widen the gulf between risk and isk in regards to high sec mission runningninja salvaging is the risk to your isk tree stop trying to deny it

thanks personally i dont have a problem with ninja salvagers  it sucks to high heaven when they hit my wrecks especially when im doing something like ae 4 or one of the missions with a very high wreck count  i like the extra isk as much as the next girlbut when you get down to it its not that big a deal shrugs i mean its no different then if i go into as asteroid belt and start mining the rocks someone else is working on right and i dont see half a dozen posts a week about that in the assembly hallzomg asteroids i am mining should be mineeleventy11competition for resources is as much a part of eve as pewpew so get out there and compete bring a buddy or an alt to salvage behind you as you go  side benefit they can rr you or bring additional dps to the party meaning you can finish missions faster and earn more money per hour
will they go away noif i dont shoot at them no change no worriesif i do shoot at them after they are flagged will they come back in a pvp ship yesis this what i want yesi can do pvp  well assuming that they get flagged which they dont currently i disagree i think that it is different because the wreck only exists due to my efforts in killing the bad guyfor a moment though im willing to put that disagreement aside ignore the fact that ccp have said no to this already i am grateful for that information and consider the concept of its floating in space therefore its free for allin that case why does taking stuff out of a wreck or can flag you its just floating therethe problem here in my eyes is that there is a disparity between loot and salvage it doesnt make sense to me and i guess others whove posted on this subject that the game will protect my rights to some of the dead bad guy but not to all of himto everyone who moans about these posts  its the fact that it doesnt make sense which causes people to post please seriously consider trying to have a civilised conversation instead of just moaningin relation to the asteroid analogy come to think about it flagging people who mine the same roid as me would be kinda fun seriously why not do it the flag only means that i have the right to kill them without concord killing me it doesnt give them the right to kill me until after i shootpeople keep talking about isk for risk  where is the risk in this salvaging profession or the mining profession  if you want to take the discussion that far i do a mission i might be killed i do some market trading i might lose a lot i go to lowsec i might be camped i take salvage from someone elses mission no come backs at the moment its riskfree free cashthanks for reading
ok i did not think this would be so hard for everyone to understand so i will go slowlyno it means that they know that if they touch my loot they will be shot so there are less people stealing my loot because they know that they will be shot currently everyone who wants some isk can just get a scanner out find a mission runner and salvage his mission without any kind of retaliation and if they are in npc corp you cannot even war dec them you know what happens if someone takes from my can my entire corp can attack the thief i have a number of people in the corp that are always happy to shoot someonethen that person wasnt very smart since he could have warped away while the thief was getting his pvp ship out and could have brought something appropriate for combat or called his friends if someone is dumb enough to shoot something he cannot take on he will loose his ship this will give me an option to protect my loot all mission runners still can shoot there wrecks or politely ask the guy to leave that means i do not get my cash i personally do not suffer from this problem but alot of people are affected by it current situation is illogical if a wreck is a useless piece of junk then why do you get concorded for shooting it effectively salvaging an empty wreck and shooting the empty wreck leads to the same consequences for the owner the wreck disappearoing but in the first case the offender will get popped and in the second case he is absolutely safe
since no ones hit on it yet i suppose ill fill in the blanks hereif this policy would be changed so it were logical loot ownership would belong to the killee not the killer as currently exists in pvp mechanics which means anyone could come into the mission not yours since there is no instancing in eve take the rats loot not yours as the npc corp is the owner and salvage the wrecks also not yours since they would belong to the npcs at bestif you want an actual logical fix thats the fix people should be lobbying for im a mission runner i salvage my own crap and everyone who whines that theres no salvage aggression needs to quit crying about me me me
it also shouldnt have my name on it  and anyone could take or blow up anything and concord doesnt get involved that would make sense  i could live with that although i wouldnt like it as much as what we have now it would make a lot more sensecan you imagine the pve mechanic being used in pvp in relation to loot  wrecks it would also work in a round about wayi agree with everything that maxsim goratiev has said in this thread just for clarity i still support  wish for my original proposal i think ccp need to counter the arguments put forward in this thread just saying no because they want there to be an easy way of making isk without any risk doesnt seem like something which should be in eve i mean isnt that what level 1 missions are for well there isnt no risk in a mission  someone might steal your loot or salvage of course
supportdo it just to see how many omg turn it back threads we get by comparison a week later after hundreds of missioners lose their ships to ninja salvagers in hilarious fashion
supporting for carebear tears
hey dont tempt me to support this i would sit outside of the station all day and salvage their wrecks
i always assumed salvage worked much like international waters does atmfirst to get to it gets to salvage it working as designed as posted above no support
so a 33 increase to web strength give or take yes im in favour of a paladin fitting 120 webs this isnt needed rapiers are just fine and dont need a special module to assist maybe trade off the weapon bonus for a web strength bonus but no generic module for the task thats just silly
mod norig mayberig with penalty yesnot supported otherwise
no thanks everyone shot you down in ships and modules why did you expect to get anywhere here
just give the rapierhuginn an extra role bonus for web strength tbh
think rigs with penalty would be good
here are my thoughts on thisnpc webbing works at 75 webifier t2 works at 60 so put it at 75 and put some rigs which could affect itt2 web at 60 is really a useless mod especially with intys or nano ship or anything that moves at lightning speed those web modules are simply not enough
i fail to see the point of this use 2 slots for 2 webs adding a low slot mod to supplement this is like asking for mid slot stabilizers or adding low slot tackle if the recons have you concerned i can get on board with making the rapier fill a similar role to the pilgrim or the falcon to an extent in that they are designed to be up close with a bonus to recon mod strenth pilgrims work up close curses at range falcons up close rooks at range put the rapier in line with a suitible recon strength bonus say 10 per recon level to strength but keep the range side note this would be nice to have in regards to remote sensor damp ships as well but that exceeds the scope of this thread
haha i am quoting this for posterity because this is funnyif ccp pass this issue i suggest you quit eve
then answer me this miss ego tripwhy did you pass this when there was no supportim quite sure that everyone here would like to know thatif you cant answer for your actions i suggest you quit evehell i just might run for one single reason to make sure this crap doesnt happen againi may not come up with great ideas and spend alot of time shooting down several really bad ideas but im not stupid enough to ignore the majority public opinion no not the omgtheykilledthescanner angry mob but when its obvious they dont support something you dont going around pushing the issue and then sit there acting all trollish and pridefulthis is an abuse of privilege and poweryes ccp could still say no thats not the pointthe point is you ignore the public and passed the damn thing anywaythat is why you are as just as bad as lark if not worsea lot of people may hate me or not appreciate me but i think its safe to say they agree with me on thisso what do you have to say for yourselfwhats wrong too busy asking me to shutup
enthusiastically supported
quite old enough to read these naughty words thank yousupported
loads of good ideas in this thread and easy to implement too should be a no brainer for the csm to bring this up
i think hyena is nice where it israpier and huginn should be 2 ways1 same strength but longer range2 stronger but same range as nowhuginn i think for the stronger one
im a little uncomfortable with the idea that since webs are too weak to effectively stop ships we should boost them on the rapier alone making it the only ship capable of effectively stopping other ships wouldnt an overall look at webs be better
why fit a webifier when a scram has just about the same range but will potentially slow down a ship far more than a web mwds are pretty standard and disabling those with a scram is simply far more effective than a web as far as the rapier and huginn are concerned they do not slow down ships enough to warrant their use their role has been taken over by the arazu and lachesis
not supported only for recons just boosting webs to 75 fixes it webs have simply been to hard to the point disruptorweb is very very meh scrambler acts like the old web in comparison
please post your suggestions for fanfest here so the csm can help you help ccp make next year even better if its relevent information also mention wether you were at fanfest or not so i can figure out if you were getting your fanfest experience via the feed or from being therehereUFFFDs some i can think of right now1 the bar needs to stock much more gin and tonic and much much less opal polar beer is a  beer you should offer viking and guinness at least as an alternative smirnoff ice is a little girlUFFFDs drink but its what many of usme were practically forced to drink due to the lack of aforementioned gin and tonic2 ratio of food and drink tokens given to the csm needs to be swappedso making it 26 beer tokens and 12 food tokens and doubledmaking it 5224 if not doubled at least give us more beer tokens3 i canUFFFDt really remember
drink some more maybe it will come back to you
look  its another whee im a csm gimme more free stuff post from mazzif anyones surprised you obviously havent been paying attention
yeah no really there were scheduling conflicts with some stuff and things can be improved for next year for example the csm panel was scheduled the same time as some popular stuff and it was also scheduled way too early in the day the big presentation speeches also had a lot of repeat material that had already been announcederik has a really good post in the internal csm forum about it and ill let him copy paste it over himself so we can make this an official csm thing
i have to agree with this
even out the scheduling i spent way too much time idleing on thursday and saturday and missed all the fun stuff on friday since i was hungover from the goon partyagree on the drink selection i got tired of polar really fast
oh yeah and if the public says no she ignores youno surprise there
yes i know this proposal gets brought up pretty damn often but i also think it doesnt get brought up enough because the only people it really bothers are new players all we older players and csm members dont give a  about learning skills because most of them have them to 5 as is but really this should be a top issue for new players it sucks it ruins the game theyre utterly pointless and all they do is waste time you could be spending training something usefulremove them reimburse them change them hell i dont care what you do but this should be a priority learning skills ruin the game for all the newbies and for a lot of older players as well who never bothered getting them up to 45 and are constantly reminded that theyre at a disadvantage we need new players more than anything we should be thinking about them first and foremost
yes exactly when i started eve and saw the learning skills i went wait what and immediately quitlearning skills are frankly the embodiment of what eve is all about choice and consequence you have the choice of training them all in a row and thus maximizing their benefit or training them as you go and maximizing some other portion of the game i get so tired of this argument of zomg if you dont train them you cant compete for the first month i played this game i didnt even know that learning skills would help my training ah the joyful blissi also had no idea what support skills were you know what we should get rid of those too they ruin the experience for new players having to train all these skills just so they can be effective pilots and this level 1 through level 5 crap thats just silly once you train a skill you should just have it no support
what develdrin saidnot supported
this
yes learning skills ive just completely forgotten about the annoyance of after all ive only trained three alts in the last six months  why would i remember their existence and the fact that my main is doing a 10day learning skill and i constantly explain how they work and why theyre good to newbies complete side issues point is my main is old so im clearly just a grumpy old vet looking to make others go through the same pain i once did now that i dont have to think about it any moreyet again not supported
no one said you had to train learning skillsno seriously what is your problemthats itnot supported
seeing how several new players feel that they need a boost to compete not that they really need it that much removing the first tier of learning skills and giving everyone 5 to to the characteristics could not be a bad move all our alts would get it too so even the veterans would somewhat benefit
where the hell do all these attempts at wowification come from ffsdont like learning skills dont bother with em the eve learning curve is steep the majority of the playerbase likes eve for this wow has an easy learning curve if you want it easy wow is the way to go
it has nothing to do with choice and consequenceits a problem of a get bored and train fast or b dont get bored and train slow its an option between sucky option one and sucky option two there are no actual benefits to them and all they succeed in doing is adding useless training time in a game where all other skills train for the purpose of actually getting you somewhere
the fact that you can list it as choose a or b and listed different results for each makes it a matter of choice and consequence you successfully nullified your own arguement in the first sentance of your own post
choice and consequence shouldnt be about choosing between two options both of which suck dont get me wrong ive been playing since late 05 i know that we all make choices whether to train to bs or sb tank this or that interceptor or cruiser we start early but each of them gives you something exciting to look forward to something interesting in the future each skill is trained for a reasonlearning skills are just trainedso we can train more its a choice between training slowly or training skills that are boring as hell to train for 2 monthswhy do we need this useless and miserable choice why cant we just you know have choices we actually enjoy making i cant think of any other portion of eve where you have to make the choice between 2 totally miserable optionsdont get me wrong some sort of proper choice would be great who knows chose once skill instead of the other but really other than slowing you down and ing you off what actual enjoyable purpose to learning skills serve
choosing between 2 easy things is well easy soft unchallenging eve wouldnt be eve without choices that1  are hard2  force a sacrifice 3  have a real impact
while i completely see where youre coming from there is a very big difference between forcing yourself to make a hard choice giving you two choices which are both undeniably crap its not a choice its a frustration seriously what do you gain from the learning skills being in the game that youre going to make tough choices youre going to learn that playing the damn game
learning skills were a stupid idea and im horrified at what stupid advice people give to newbies regarding learning skills when im hauling on a alt or somethinga choice whether you get it anally or orally sucks youre still getting shafted anyway
whyno i mean seriously why ive been playing this character since december and the only learning skill i have yet to raise above a 4 is learning itself thes rest of them are all 43 why is this frankly because the payoff for having it doesnt outweigh the cost of training them any further they might once i start training things like carriers or the like but frankly until evemon says hey you oughta do this im not gonna bother and that frankly is the advice we ought to be giving the new players train them when they will actually help you reach a particular goal faster not just because theyre thereas as side note for not having them all maxed out ive still managed to accumulate 13 million skill points in 10 months
learning skills are good its the implants which bust it up like you speak anyone can train learning skills and keep them implants on the otherhand you pretty much cant pvp with 5s im pretty rich pvper and wouldnt consider pvping in 5s 4s and 3 is what i pvp in on top of that if youre really rich or in a massive position like supercap pilot you most likely want slaves in your head the shield supercaps are kinda rammed which are 3 and not 5theres the problem there
these are useless old baggage that should be removed one way or another
well its nice to see that not everybody disagrees so apart from learning skills not being quite as bad as i make them out to be does anybody have a reason why theyre a good thing to have
um because the provide a tangible benefit improved training times in exchange for time spent training them just like most other skills
i like lowsec the way it is the whole point of it being lowsec is that it is not patrolled by concord but it is still monitored why would concord monitor systems that arent held by official factionsalso on to stupid rp bs local is automated there isnt a guy at every gate updating local whenever somebody passes through it would factions really be paying people to sit in gates doing that how come alliances dont have to pay salary for each gate crew in space they controllowsec is fine not supported
the alternative is bad instalocking ceptors and such making it largely impassable which would be really horrible for people who try to do any business in lowsec there is no need for 00 mk iiif you want to see what im talking about get to 10 and then traverse fwinfested systems its probably the best power of two promotion that existsgenerally the large ship camps are much easier to deal with they practically encourage smaller ship use for roaming since smaller ships slip by so easily that is quite good if you ask meincreasing the isk rewards of lowsec is of course interesting giving some unique things which can be done there is the right way to go and in that respect i agree with the op lowsec needs to be a profitable but risky place to livealso we need more lowsec its getting a bit crowded
but i agree with the rest of your post
spent too much time in fw bloblands and nearby areas probably
mhh low sec is fine as it is but the only thing that needs improvement in my opinion is the reward or bounty when you either do exploration or bounty since we risk our ship every second when your in low sec well anything that gives you isk from the game and not the market npc bountyalso the fw sov system  wtf is that whats the purpose to capture all the systems ccp should give something in return since we worked for it for that mhhh i really dont knowand yes more low sec system please its getting crowed but for fw thats fine as it is since more target are present mwhahah
agreed sentry removal is bad and to be honest sentries are fine as it isoh andthats changing with dominionim not saying change specifically mechanics or resources just make the place more appealing for players who arent into omg1337pvp as well make it worth holdingalso please read the post before you reply people evidently havent been theres shedloads of lowsec systems as it is just noone wants to be in them
there are plenty of people in my low sec eating my cookies and sleeping with my agents you must be in the wrong lowsechowever i completely agree with you that lowsec needs some changes particularly for the good guys the bad guys already have everything they need
why are players forced to petition isk spammerswhy is there no gms in each trade hub and the rookie help chat 237the isk scammers are there every 1015mins yet its left up to the players to police itby the time petitions are processed noobs have already been lured into their trapgms in the trade hubs instabanswhen will my ccp wages arrive for helping staff the antirmt division
or the smart trick of trying to find certain patterns in repeated postings in local with code instead of man power which costs a lot more
processing of strings is a very cpu intensive processfiltering that volume of text data is not a good idea for keeping lag lowthe gms are already there they already ban isk sellersthere are already dedicated gms for answering isk seller petitionsso why do we have to send petitionswhy cant they just use their eyes
gms are insanely busy and despite the rather irritating volume of isk sellers there arent nearly enough to justify a halfdozen gms watching chat channels 237 flag the spammers it jumps to the top of their queues and they deal with it im for better reporting systems but this isnt going to happen  ccp is not going to spend a million bucks a year on mostlyidle manpower for something like this
because they would go nuts have you any idea how much utter bull goes through the local channelsquite honestly if i had to read the drivel of a bunch of acneridden 13 year old morons that cant spell properly going off at each other over someone docking or not undocking or stealing someones ore or whatever stupid reason and for like 20 different systems at the same time or how many do you think a single gm should handle id commit suicide very shortlyeven if they just have to crossread all that real quick that would be to cruel to ask from a human being and certainly against the geneva convention or somethingnot supported petitions work fine
what you fail to realise however is that isk sellers cost ccp both dollars and customersthe rookie help channel is constantly spammed by isk sellersif the new player experience is so important in reducing customer churn then surely protecting these new users from having their accounts ruined is a profitable causefirst thing new players see is 15 posts by a isk seller spam botthis is something worth spending money on
having just created a second account i see where the op is coming from isk spammers are prevalent in noob chat and in market hub local chathowever i have also observed that gms are on hand around half the time in noob chat and they do their part to shut the spammers downthough it may seem counterintuitive i think its ok to not have gms in place at all times to ban the isk sellers in market hub local chat new players and sometimes older players who make new accounts need to be exposed to and reminded that isk spammers existthey need to use the report feature and learn how to use right click  block the later which helps to make chat in places like jita far more manageable as you can block scammers just as easily as spammersi agree that isk spammers do cost ccp real money however i dont think that cost exceeds the cost to train and pay a group of people to work 237 on monitoring noob chat and all heavy traffic market hubs note im estimating therewe as players have some responsibility to deal with it ourselves right click  block is like a reflex and its easy
dont block isk scammerspetition

heres the list that comes to mind  electronic attack ships aside from fitting the most jams into the fewest points for alliance tournaments i can think of no reason anyone would ever fly these  i thought t2 ammo had been brought up but if it hasnt then bring it up specifically all the highdps ammos and voidsince even as a longrange ammo its a shortrange ammo range is a perfectly valid role for t2 ammo and worth eating some drawbacks but dps is not because we have faction ammo repurpose it likely to middling dps and a huge tracking boost also for the love of god ditch the perloadedweapon penalties  ew drones other than ecm are unusable partially its the stacking nerf partially its the fact that youre giving up 10 points of jam or 300 dps to use a flight of webber drones but in general they all suck i want to see all drones get used at least occasionally  split weapons are awful full stop  combat recons have some issues mostly the lachesis and huginn despite the term combat these are not dps ships if the combat recon picks up a bonus you dont care about and loses a covops cloak youre not going to use it the curse sees plenty of use because it picks up a bonus that actually fits into the ships role the rook sees some use because it actually does useful dps with five twicebonused launchers the lachesis and huginn are splitweapon stupidity with no benefits at all over their covops counterparts strip their second weapon bonus and give them probably ew drone strengthon 100m350mbit and web strength respectively in the same style as the curse either that or make them actually usable at combat with as much firepower as the rook  the prophecy ferox and cyclone are kind of junk make them as good as the brutix  i may be wrong about this but i think halo implants are junk if im right that they see far less use than slavescrystalssnakes then give them a boost i exempt talisman because they do interesting things even if theyre niche implants  cap batteries suck they take too much fitting and dont give enough bonus a large cap battery takes twice as much fitting as a medium cap booster and delivers the same amount of cap as one 800 charge yes they boost recharge but not enough to justify their use very often slash the fitting reqs and add an xl battery give us something that at least pretends to be an alternative to boosters  there are too many awful rigs take the ones nobody uses realize that 40 isnt a useful bonus size for something like warp capacitor and buff them until theyre usable  active tanking is no good for normal pvp yeah itll never be usable in fleet but in gangsized combat it should get some buffs as long as it doesnt make it too good for pve boosting the overheating bonus is probably the best bet here  shield flux coils are junk cfcs sees a bit of use on mission ships to permarun the cap better than pdus can but i dont think ive ever heard of a sfc fit active tanks dont need them and passive tanks dont care too much about the cap penalty from sprs  painters need some work theyre slightly usable sometimes but they could be a lot better also theres no reason they shouldnt have range like old ecm did i can see why damps and tds dont hit to 250km because theyd be too good but painters arent broken at that range 150100 or so is completely fine for tps thats all ive got for now might think of more later

blood have 13 systems not 7 and they all have stations and a good number of agents as well and of course ore thukker and mordus dont have officers  theyre civilized factions not pirates but even by the standards of pirate factions theyre not really that bad  they have about twice as many stations as the guristas do remember even if their nominal sov is smaller besides somebody has to have the least
every other day theres a thread about how salvaging another persons wreck should result in a criminal flag so to save everyone the bother i propose the following a message on the agent conversation window that clearly states that there are no salvage rights in eve the new player experience should teach noobs that wrecks do not belong to them wrecks should be marked differently from cans to avoid confusion over what does or doesnt belong to the playerthe ideas need some flesh so all suggestions welcome
iirc wrecks used to be marked differently from cans  ccp changed from that to the current scenario or you used to have to loot the wreck before you could salvage it  something or another like thathowever i endorse the idea of adding this to the new player experience  maybe have a drone ship or something that comes in and loots the wreck and another that only salvages it so the new players can actually see the difference
as i said in my thread about how salvaging another persons wreck should result in a criminal flag i think that the problem is is that there is a disparity between how loot and salvage is handled in gameit doesnt make sense to me and i guess others whove posted on this subject that the game will protect my rights to some of the dead bad guy but not to all of himi put forward that if it made sense then it wouldnt need explaininghowever in the absence of it making sense then yes an explanation would be a good idea
yep been asking for this for years
i would love it if i didnt have to wait 4 hours everytime my agent gives me 2 faction missions within a 4 hour period it is especially annoyin when im running lvl 4s with some of my corp members and have to choose between a standings hit or calling off missions for the night i understand you dont want people to just decline missions till they get blockade or world collide everytime but faction missions suck for anyone who plays in all 4 sections of empire wouldnt be bad to drop penalty lower or remove altogether just my 2 cents
you have two weeks to accept or decline a missionnot supported
damn good idea i have run around between 3 different agents when i grind corp standings huge waste of time very few people i know run faction missions anyways
who cares about the two weeks to acceptdecline its the 4 hours im worried about huge buzzkill to have a mission night cut short because you decimated your standings declining faction missions so easy to lose standings so hard to repair faction missions should either have no penalty to decline or have special agents for people who actually want to do them noone i know does
its annoying but at the same time its a necessary system to prevent people from just doing only the best missions jump between agents get your gangmates to pull missions or bite the bullet
last i checked there is more than one mission agentsurely you can find some that will eat up 4 hours of your time
ccp has already approved and built ur idea into the game they are called orcarorqual now we can close the thread isnt ccp just grate and awesome
i think hugely simplifying is the whole pointdifficult for the sake of difficult alone is not good design
hrmwhile on the one hand i like how wormholes promote a team effort to really exploit them i also can understand the point of view that wants to be able to bring as many toys as possible into wspaceshaving the mass off of an orca seems like one way to go but maybe there are other ways to lighten the load perhaps a new module that halves the mass of a ship for a limited duration or a science based skill that allows a pilot to treat any ship he or she flies as 5 per skill level less in overall mass per wh trip
 bolded for emphasis because youve proven so far that you would probably miss it
lul i dont care about this proposal  did i supported it i just pointed out your incompetence  thats itthough maybe i should support it  more orcas flying into wspace  more juicy kills for mesupporting
folr all the folk out in 00 alliances isk per hour wouldnt be a huge issue if your alliance leaders would just come up off some of the iskies from the moons jk saw this was already in a raised to csm vote and was wondering if their was any update or possible changes we may be expecting
everything that brings more people in the belts is a good thing suported
the latest patch notes says the directional scanner is set to 13 secondsmy proposal is im very serious about this sftu about the new change they arent going to lower it more they wont its clearso please adapt or dieps yes im angry at this change but it doesnt mean i have to whine about it over a 1200 supported thread just adapt and i dont consider myself a pirate and i dont whine about this changei never did lmao
so someone sets up a public contract against you you use an alt to pick up the contract and so defend yourself from getting popped and just dont get the reward or better yet pop yourself with the alt a few times and take the isk yeah this would work
i can actually see this as being useful but the broker fee would have to be equivalent to a wardec fee the contract should inform whether it is an alliance corporation or pilot that will be targeted if it is a corpalliance it would give a rounded 10100200300etc number of the members the actual name of said alliancecorporationpilot wouldnt be revealed until the contract was acceptededit a friend just made me think of this you shouldnt be able to place a bounty contract on a pilot who has a positive sec statusedit 2 in regards to using an alt to pick up your own public contract wouldnt work as you dont know which contract is actually you also the killgrief anywhere license already exists as a wardec so obviously you wouldnt be able to place this kind of contract on any npc corp either and in regards to ships as a count maybe damage in isk im assuming regional average of where the kill was made would be the value in damage
actually wardeccing a very large corp makes a lot of sense for a one man  woman armyyou wont be perceived as a threat at all until you have made a fortune off your kills if you play it wellthe only problem with wardeccing alliances is the increased fee but lets be honest 12 good hauler kills on the way to or from jita and the war paid for itselfedit not supporting this the reason for the tax was making people pay for wardec immunity the only thing left to do is extending that to all forms of revenue ie trades and industry
nonsense get an imagination tickers are a bit more of an issue since the namespace is so much smaller there but this is what dashes and periods are for
i like it
i am not in support of wis eve is a game about internet spaceships not showing off stupid trinkets and drinking gamesif it does come it should have massive risks associated with it we are leaving our immortality behind and dying outside the pod should be an eminent factor throughout our time spend out of pod there should be dramatic punishment for dying outside of pod im talking skillpoint loss akin to not having an up to date clone in fact no clonewis also needs a reason a real reason for immortal pod pilots to unplug from the grid the incarna teaser does seem to hint at this all i hope is that ccp implements wis right and it keeps the dark dank evil environment that new eden represents  drinking games hiring npcs collectible trophies and all that sims crap
on the subject of submissions do you have to pay for the trip to iceland or is that included in the package
similar letters have to be fixed size adjust would be nice too as long it doesnt screws with ui
in my opinion it should be done in a separate bay so you can not repair all your drones at the same time it should be a mechanic out of the heat of the battle and not inside
a tiny launcher that can carry a very limited supply of rockets not really intended as a primary weapon but rather as a cheap supplementary weapon systemsupported this needs to be fixed increased clip size would be a critical part provided rate of fire stays the samemight be stating the obvious here but as rockets get a boost their fitting requirements should be looked into as well as they are practically free to fit at the moment
so its october nowwas this brought up with ccp in septemberif so what was the outcomewhy does ccp have such poor communication with the community on this issue that clearly a lot of people care about yet ccp has ignored for so longi thought this council on stellar management was supposed to help communication between ccp and its player communityi applaud the posting of issues raised here 
agreed
supported and what does in the works mean in this instance
yes
yes that time of the year is approaching can we string our ships with lights seriously it would really boost the holiday spirit to have a ship covered in night blinking lightswhile i get bombed on egg nog and kill peopleit could even be a high slot i got extras
honestly wth notcoupled with snowball cannons and the works
you talking about bombing eggnog made me thinkwhat about eggnog bombs for stealth bombers  or maby somekind of special christmas booster
blueprinted bombers that can do lightshows in highsec that would be epic ingame
yes and i want to see the santa claus ship flying in space too with his reindeer wingman hihiwow the lights the egg nog i love that
bring on the blinky blinky
this would work with formations
supported bring forth the lights and eggs
bump
supportan everything but 3
nice ideassupported
if it wasent as easy as it sounds rats wouldnt have different skins at all 5 bucks says each ship has a flag that tells which skin to use and changing a value is not that difficult though the implimentation and the user interface for said task may take time
either option 1 or 2option 1basically 3 types of heat reduction rigsnot largemedsmall obviously highslot heat reductionmidslot heat reductionlowslot heat reductioneach one lowers the amount of heat damage applied to the modsincreases their resistance to heat damage for that rackoption 2 more overpowered heat reduction rig that affects all the slots to increase their resistance to heat damagewould allow others to push the edge away from some cookie cutter setups prosconsonly con would be seeing some t3 setups for extended heat timers but you sacrafice other things to get that so i would still see it as balanced
supporting my own topic with a brofist o9 and a thumb up btw we still dont have a thumbs down ccp p
isnt it called strategic cruiserif they really add those rigs that might get overpowered with said cruisers just as a side note iirc a strategic cruiser can already be setup to overload for 7minutesedit sidenote
hmmmm not bad but coupled with offline module heatsinks this could stack to be too heavy a bonusoffline modules in a rack suck up damage from those around them
seems like an interesting concept as long as its balanced even on the uberheat t3 ships id like to see it
and that disparity unfortunately exists because of the game code surrounding containers so if seems illogical it probably is  but unfortunately loot ends up inside a container and follows the mechanics thereof salvage otoh does not and so behaves differently
this is where you are doing it wrongwrecks do not belong to anyone because without specialized equipment its just trash there is nothing of worth however if you take specialized equipment salvager module and use it on a wreck it becomes something of worth just like asteroids before you mine them they are just plain old rocksnow modules on the other hand have an already determined have a certain market value of wrecks you can never determine the value until the wreck has been salvagedbecause you need specialized equipment and because there is no value to wrecks before salvaging why should you then be able to get the rights to kill anyone over a bit of worthless trash
would be an interesting extension of this argument if next miners started complaining that some hulk started mining their rock meaning one they had already laid a laser tono that is sillyit is working as designed and there are denial tactics you can use against ninja salvagers such as looting your own stuff as you go i do that in some missions or firing on the wrecks and adopting a scorched earth policy mike
supported you told  wrecks do not belong to anyoneits wrong belongs to who kill the ratif you pickup from wreck a loot why you get global flag because those wrecks belongs to someoneminiprofessional  thats lol this is not miniprofessional just stealing someone stealing from someone salvage items without risk because the rules is unlogic and the salvager not get criminal flag like at loot pickupsomeones buy weapon  ammo and waste his time for kill those rats and cant pick up the own stuffs because someone just steal themwhat is miniprofessional when someone scanning the abaddoned wrecks and salvage them but we knows those guys jumping to missionso dont tell me those words miniprofession it is just simple stealingif there would be a miniprofessional you would scanning the wrecks but you cant because a ninja salvagersstealers scanning the missioner ships or just jump to beltanomaly etc
its always so nice when people dont read and take your words out of context like you have just given a perfect example of i didnt say wrecks belonged to no one i pointed out why salvaging is not stealing there is logic in the system in your crypost there is notit is a miniprofession because you search and salvage with a specialized ship and or equipmentyou are not wasting your time and ammo when killing rats last time i checked grabbing loot and bounty brought in the main amount of a missioners income which is plenty as it isccp stated from the beginning of salvaging that it is a miniprofession and not meant as extra income for missionersim going to leave it at that because most of your post is unreadable and you really should consider a full rewrite with some logic and constructive arguments
qfe it seems that the people who have posted since i posted the above havent read the aboveimho loot and salvage should be treated the same perhaps loot should be free for allperhaps there should be a timer on it at current it vanishes after a set period of time if you dont loot or salvage it perhaps instead after a period of time it becomes unprotected which is to say that you dont get flagged for taking it and after a longer period of time it vanishes or perhaps there is another solution i havent thought ofwhat i do know is despite how much you explain it to me right now i understand you and am thankful for the explanations  it doesnt make sense to me and everyone else who has complained about this that loot is protected and salvage for the same wreck is not protectedas for asteroids and mining well see my previous postanother thought that comes to mind is that in real life things like modules would definitely come under the heading of salvage i mean isnt it nice that you blow up a bad guy and then get a perfectly good working undamaged module out of the deal without requiring you to have any skills in being able to salvage the wreck yes its nice yes i like it no its not realistic missiles documents gold coins etc all make sense as loot ship modules etc not so muchagain thanks for reading im happy to see a mostly civilized discussion on this subject
1 fail post again i explained it punctually for what theft and you you talk about the fact that your words are not read lol2 you said again not belongs to someone those wreksif not pls answer when you pick up a loot why can shot you someone  because the wrecks belong to someone  dyes3you told againt fail wordsit is a miniprofession because you search and salvage with a specialized ship and or equipmentok i go buy a covops search your mission with specialised ship and equipment and pick up you loot oh nooo you will be get criminal flag  and tell me what do you looking for  wrecks  you told miniprofessional thats bllsht you will be scanning ships and not wrecksyes salvaging a mini proffessional but just the salvaging not salvaging other player stuffs if you cant kill anythingabout what you talk it only a pathetic one explaining into the things
agreed
i was not talking about theft in my original post i was pointing out the facts why salvage is not stealing shooting it might create a wreck but without specialized equipment it is just trashthe wrecks belong to the npc but the loot belongs to the player there is not doubt about it but wrecks are worthless in their initial state and you have no right on shooting somebody elses ship because they are cleaning up your mess why would trash belong to anyone i have never seen so many people argue about trashyour are whining about having other players steal salvage the fact that salvage itself is not defined to any user combined with that eve is an one universe no instance game makes it open for anyone to exploit anything they can get their hands on this is how the entire game works why would they chance only salvage to have this kind of systemthe only thing i hear from you is how obviously i fail in posting while you cant even write a well written argument yourself a typical case of the pot calling the kettle blackthese threads are so enjoyable because you are never going to get this ingame this is never going to be raised by csm and because people like you keep crying about itmost posts are not giving any constructive idea like hey this can be done otherwise and wasting forum space and timenext
loot belongs to the player who killed the rat you can see that by rightclicking show info on the wreck check it before you post incorrect information problem is you hear only what you want to hear if you dont want it to be implemented and you dont want it to have a point does not mean there isnt any all the reasons have already been stated above multiple times i am not going to repeat them all if wrecks are so worthless then why can i not shoot an empty wrek belonging to other person withought getting concorded
pipe down matei do know what im talking about i do not live under a rock and i have a life we whined for years for a skill queue we did get it in the end but that was because a skill queue had a future and was beneficial for everyone it was just ccp who had its doubts about the possible consequences removing the possibility to ninja salvage however is ing in he soup of a lot of players which aint going to happen its going to get a load of cheers from one playerbase and a load of boos from another its on the same line as piracy dont like getting killed in a gatecamp and still it happens im pretty sure a lot of people think that way doest mean piracy should be taken out of the gamei do know what you mean but i just disagree and will not stfu to end with an old meme  adapt or die
actually the wreck still belongs to the rat as by logic the wreck belongs to the owner just like pvp wrecks do why should wrecks suddenly belong to you while they are not your remains i am not against this because i dont want to hear this or exploit the business but because there has so far been no good reason provided why the killer should receive the right for the wreckthe only reason i have heard so far i want more cashbecause they are loot containers although there is no loot in them sometimes the code doesnt allow others to blow them up this is all due to coding and should be changed however this might be easier said than done
mission runners already get bounties loot mission rewards which include isk standings and loyalty pointswhy should you also be entitled to the salvage youre already sitting in a somewhat safe environment with essentially no real risk of losing it to the rats making a ridiculous amount of isk per hour if anything mission rewards should be decreasedninja salvagers add a form of pvp to what is essentially a pvpless activity if you dont like it move to low sec where you can kill them if you cant afford to lose your 8 billion super officer pimped battleship dont fly it you can do a level 4 mission in a tech i fit drake
hey whine man go to belt and shot down a npc and show information on wreckthe wreck will belongs to who killed the rat and show for you the information paneland not just the pvp wreck belongs to you just try use on wreck a tractor beam oh no you cant use but the wreck owners can do or who fly with them in missionso better if you dont speak more stupid thingsso when someone else salvaging others wreck thats just a nice stealing
you told very wellnice explanation
ok seriously lets put this bit to bed in order to be consdiered stealing you would have to be taking something that a doesnt belong to you andb belongs to someone elseusing that definition lets look an npc ship after its been killed in reference to the game mechanics that the ultimate arbiters of such matters ccp have put into place shall wea wreck is clearly split into two seperate parts  the wreck itself and a container which may or may not hold anything at all yes the container is always there it may just be empty  try it sometime  you can open container on an empty wreckccp has clearly indicated that those items inside the container belong to whomever kills the ship  they even tag the container with your name and your corp name additionally removing one of those items if you are not the owner of that container flags you as a criminal  clearly this is stealing as defined by the game mecahnicshowever the wreck iteself belongs to no one and therefore taking from it does not flag you as a criminal therefore how can we call it stealing if it were in fact stealing would it not behave exactly as if you taken from someones canas for those of you who say but the wreck has my name on it actually i posit that what really has your name on it is the container inside the wreck not the wreck itself the misconception may come from the fact that the container and the wreck are visually one unit but logically two separate entities game logic here folks not people logicbe that as it may according to the mechanics of the game salvaging a wreck whether you actually caused it to become a wreck or not is not stealing
it only his physical realisation for the game because he could not be some other way to solve but let us not explain it already into the things but why you pulling the wreck when you using on them tractor beams because you grab the container  d and why you cant if you can do anything who do you want  because the tag belongs to killers  game mechanics againbut i told you this is just a simple game development thingso thats is still stealing because you didnt anything for kill ratsyou need someone who kill those rats or you never get those salvage items like as loot
salvage a non empty wreck before you loot it and tell me whats left over then come back here and tell me theres no container in a wreckgo ahead ill wait
fixed my answer
ccp are not in any way going to boost your riskfree mission income accept that and get over it
puts tissues and popcorn on the table
bolded for incorrect assumptions salvage is not owned by anyone and is considered freeforall first come first servethe discussion about salvage theft is invalid because nobody owns wrecks you cant steal something that nobody owns nobody can steal from you what you dont own whats next are you going to complain that someone is mining your asteroid beltyour false beliefs of ownership are your own problem to deal with you can cope with reality and accept that you dont own everything you see or you can cry and wish ccp to cater the game to your own personal whims your choicethread
even though your post contains little logical argument i will respond to itif mission running is so riskfree then let me risk it and shoot anyone who thinks he is tough enough to steal my mission loot i am asking to give mission runners an opportunity to protect there loot hence for pvp and pvp is risk therefore your argument is not valid as i am asking for risk both for the mission runner and the salvage stealer quote boost your riskfree mission incomehow on earth is letting me shoot the guy that stole my stuff a boost to my income i simply fail to understand logic in that statement you are complaining about mission runners getting too much cash but mission running takes a decent ship good standing and a lot of work to become profitable yes i know it is easy for a 2year old veteran char but we are talking from a relatively new players perspectiveninja salvaging can be done after a daytwo of training with a salvaging destroyer you can about as much isk per hour as a mission runner in his expensive faction battleship without even risking getting scrammed and killed by rats yes for a new player that is a valid threat why are you protecting salvage stealer that parasites on other persons work and receives substantial income without any risk involved mao if you are ing other people off by taking there stuff you should face some consequences in the end i am not asking concord to kill the fer for me am ieven decing is not the solution because first of all many ninja salvagers are in npc corps that cannot be deced and secondly it simply isnt worth it unless it is done repeatedly to dec every  that salvages some wreck because probably they are going to sit in thations if they log on at alli just fail to understand why everyone is protecting ninja salvagers i cannot see any valid reason for iti do not care what is the reallife perspective on worthlessness of a tangled and burned wreck its gameplay that matters and by gameplay it belongs to me with the loot and the tagsbounty because i killed the wreck i own it and there in no point in the dead rat owning its own wreck gameplay wise it makes sense and that is all that matters why make up all this complicated stuff about wrecks in containers containers in wrecks and so on it is simply a wreck with stuff that is not damged that you can simply take out without speshial equipment or skill when you salvage wreck you putt all the stuff in container it is that simple please read above as i already stated if wrecks are so worthless and have no owner then why can i not shoot an empty wrek belonging to other person without getting concorded
so consistency dictates that as long as npc wrecks are a free for all so are player wrecks rightoh waitcant have it both ways
you realize that effectively that halfs the speed of the ship ou are webbing from 40 to 20 thats too powerfull for just one mod a mod that would improve it somewhat like mag field stab and has stacking issues yes mod that doubles webbing power with one mod no
i would like to know the answer to this
noif ccp decided that certain members of a specific csm were valuable assets to the company they could hire them on as consultants or community reps they would then still be in a position to influence ccp without being stagnant holdovers of voting power blocs fresh blood may need to relearn the job every six months but it still has a chance to make new idea blossom make new mistakes and maybe even manage a few new successesterm limits exist for a reason please keep themmike
1 id like to know as well
as usual this just goes to show that in the end some members of the csm has their own agenda representing the eve community is the last thing on their mindyet another sad day for the current corrupt csm councilnext thing you know we will hear about a csm member using insider information to attempt to profit oh wait
well thats eve for youof course its a terrible idea noones disputing that all this emo butthurt about it though
the nerd rage here is palpablefrom my limited perspectiveas a csm virgin there was very little in the way of feedback from ccp about how we were supposed to conduct ourselves it was simply a case of youre coming to iceland on these dates crack on ladies and gents at least in my experience i know there was a bit more conversation between dv and ccp xhagenit wasnt until we got to iceland that we really started to see how the process operates and what its all about and by that i dont mean insider trading  so its not really until the second term that people are really able to start making a real contribution not that myself or any of the first termers didnt add a lot to what was going on at least in the run up to the iceland summitmazzs suggestion is pretty balanced if you read it maybe not entirely correct certainly things do need to be looked at most of the trolling here is typical csm and flamebait from the usual suspects knock yourselves out i enjoy reading it if youre so rabidly opposed why dont you run for the csm this time around and make sure you use your powers for good rather than act as a malignant despot like everyone on the current csmwith regards to power blocs keeping the same people in position year after year i do realise that many people in these blocs are mindless drones essentially but i dont think many of them would put up with their alliance being represented by an incompetant boob i believe the goons ran their own internal primaries and im sure many other alliances did you dont like that its the way the cookie crumbles joe bloggs from 00 naptrain bloc 2 is going to be able to rally much more popular support than john smith from empire mining and production corp 1532523 it just means you have to put in the extra effort the csm is a political body and as a consequence of that the most powerful organisations are going to make sure they have representation if you are naive to think its going to be any other way then l2politicsthe arguement that most people live in hisec and the csm is a misrepresentation is pish and codswallop you will probably find that of people in hisec a large proportion are farmers tradehauling alts for 00 types or mission alts for 00 types regardless the vast majority of goods manufactured and generated in hisec are going to make their way up the chain to the 00 war machine that doesnt mean empire should be or is ignored by any stretch of the imagination in fact on the current council 54 members predominantly stick to highlow sectldrcsm is a force for good term limits need to be looked at maybe not in the way suggested but a bit of a shake up is in order perhaps not right now but certainly another year or so down the line
the reason they implemented the term limits is because they were emulating some sort of icelandic system of government and the issue itself wasnt exactly a big deal for them it was just that way because they had to pick some way and that was as good as any other way knowing what they knew back thenlike i said in another post the assembly hall is like the equivalent of caod for the csm its a good measure of the opinion of a few dozen active assembly hall posters and thats about it im mourning the fact that i will never get the votes of a few dozen of you i really am pretty much almost every single issue ive raised was one i raised myself or something that didnt get more then a full page of replies much less actual popular support but was something that was blatantly broken with the gamefor example one issue ive raised all the way back in aprilcreate tools to detect macroers without player petitions involved got trolled to absolute  and i ended up not raising it but thenin september the first iceland trip during a meeting one of the devs specifically requested i send them a link to my list of suggestions since it was pretty much exactly what the unholy rage project was months before it was even announcedmy point in all this is that aside from a few major issuesfor example the huge reaction following the scanner change the assembly hall is pretty much a gallery of ideas and csm members can load up their shopping cart with whatever they want a lot of ideas are bad ideas or repeats the reason for this specific issue that i have raised is because the first term of csm members is largely spent being useless learning the system figuring out what the  et cetera by the second term they finally know what is going on and pretty soon after that they are disqualified for lifeterm limits in real life are intended to prevent corruption since the longer someone serves the more likely they will be more of a detriment then a benefit to their office the csm is not applicable to this since theres not really any ingame special interest groups that are trying to push issues at the cost of another group of players instead the longer a csm member serves the better they are able to serve since this sort of position is more like a consultant job then an actual public office the better handle the csm member gets on how ccp works internally the better they are able to filter good ideas from bad ones and the better they are able to rework raw ideas into forms that ccp can actually implementso tldr yeah i do a lot of assembly hall trolling and you can interpret my motives any way you wanti suggest you interpret them in the most malicious way possible but at the end of the day im not really going to get my measure of public opinion from what the csmcaodequivalent posters say aka i dont really care about what mr drake draconis thinks
webs are not supposed to stop ships they are supposed to slow ships down webs are working as designed and as expected on all ships including the rapier and huginnso many scenarios on this thread are referring to the vagabond or interceptors  these ships are supposed to be fast nobody complains that a sensor damper works poorly on a ship with a long targeting range or that a tracking disruptor doesnt make guns stand still on a ship with good tracking or that guns which will peel the shields right off a ship with weak defenses will only take them halfway down on a ship with good defenses
supporting this
this should go instead of the tp bonus
everyone who champions the old stupid 90 web returning on any ship needs to realize this webs are not meant to be a impassable brick wall of doom
my suggestions for improving the fanfest1 better value for money at the pubcrawl dont get me wrong i had a blast doing it but the free drinksshots that were promised i didnt see any of them blobbing the first bar with the last three groups prolly didnt help much either2 better arrangements for storing coats and the like during the party at the top of world i nearly lost my sweater 3 kras  ccp xamother3 i missed an area to lounge the space that was used for the pvp tourny looked like the ideal area for a lounging areaagree with you at the selection of drinksyes i was there
off topic and trolling comments removed please stay on topic
wouldnt it be arguably be better if they werent there at all though in terms of benefits you get from skills learning skills are pretty much the tiest satisfactiontime trained ever
satisfaction is a subjective thing and lets face it it is another form of pvponly without the asplosions if i can train faster than you i can reach more advanced equipment more quickly which meansa against people who started at about my birthday i have a competitive edgeb against people who are older then i am i reach par with them skill wise more rapidly which means that our skill as players becomes more important when we competehowever like every other form of pvp in this game you have to make the choice to compete and like every choice in this game it means giving up something else
the only real reason i can see for their defence is that i trained them and so everyone else should have to the its a choice crowd seem to miss the point that this is a game and no choice you make regarding the skills is fun or entertaining their removal could hardly be considered dumbing down the game or wowification when getting past them takes patience and the willingness to swallow the bitter pill of a pointless delay in character advancement two characteristics i would imagine are common in the average monsterloot grind mmo playerthey dont put off what many an elitist would call undesirablesthey dont require any intellect or skillthey dont count as a meaningful achievementthey are a timesinkthey slow down character advancementthey provide a perceived barrier to entrythey do all this in the critical early period where a new player is hooked or abandons the gamethey cost ccp subscribers which translates to less targets customers allies fixes and new content for uspersonally i like having more people competing in our shark infested sandbox and i like ccp having more money to improve the game with the dumb ones will quit when they find that eve is hard the undesirables when they are shown that it is harsh a couple months of wasted time barely registers on the radar of the kind of player who grinds x thousand of creature y to obtain their very own 2 z of righteousness
really would you be happy with the training times without this avenue of improving them if the learning skills were removed but character stats were not buffed to replace them would you be happy with everyone training at the same slow rate if the answer is no then you in fact do see a very positive benefit from these worthless skills
develdrin wouldnt your competitive edge be more meaningful if it was due to having made more intelligent choices on what meaningful skills to train rather than having been more patient during the period of time where most are figuring out whether they want to stick with eve or not
again thats a subjective measure how do you define meaningful as i already pointed out  i was a month maybe two into the game before someone even pointed out to me what a learning skill was and even after i found out i still didnt sit there and grind them all down at once id one or two trained a few skills did one of two more trained a few skillsetc etc nothing in the world says you have to train them all at once
all things are subjective thats neither here nor there many have an opinion on this matter but the opinions that matter most when it comes to something that adds little to the game once the timesink is passed are the unheard views of those who left the game in whole or in part because of itin the first use of meaningful i refer to the standard definition that of having significance which in a game setting means generating more satisfaction fun or entertainment to put it another way is making a good decision or sitting around waiting a more satisfying way to achieve a competitive edgein the second use i refer to those skills that are significant beyond the skillsystem itself apologies for using the word twice i could alternatively have used the phrase skills independently beneficial to ingame enjoymentas for having to train them all at once of course not you dont have to train them at all but to rephrase an earlier point it is a selection of choices that dont in and of themselves add entertainment value to the gamein addition you have now twice pointed out that your opinion is likely biased by the fact that you were hooked before you discovered the timesink i wouldnt be using your personal experience as the crux of your argument
last things first cause thats how i am even if i had discovered them from day 1 i feel fairly confident in saying that they wouldnt have lessened my enjoyment of the game because frankly i wouldnt let them i didnt train them all in one go for the simple reason that i wanted to train other things as i went but that doesnt mean i dont appreciate them as a choice in the gameback to your definition of meaningful they do have significance as i already pointed out they add to the environment of choice and consequence and they do provide a benefit to those players who choose to utilize them sorry im huge on choice and i dislike having those choices taken away simply because other people dont find them meaningfuland i question your opinion that they dont add enjoyment value  the idea that i might have an edge over someone else  even a minute one  is immensely enjoyable
this seems to be the essence of a much more reasonable discussion weve boiled it down to two simple differences of opinionits a fallacy to claim that your wrong as this is your opinion its an opinion likely shared by a number of players my concerns about it are twofold first that this is likely a minority opinion but without an accurate survey beyond the scope of this forum i couldnt prove that point my second concern is that what they add for those people isnt worth what they take away from others this would be both the dissatisfaction caused from the effect on efficient character development the impact this has on retaining new players and the impact that has on revenue used for game development there is also another consideration that reinforces the second point the existence of a secondary mechanic providing similar benefits with far less impact on the aspiring newbie attribute implants if a player chooses to use attribute implants then an opposing player can take that advantage away or at least make it an ongoing cost there are also choices in how much you wish to invest which scales with how much you stand to lose and the option of a tradeoff even setting aside wealth referring here to pirate implant sets vs 4 and 5 sets and 3 sets vs lowgrade in short learning skills provide greater reward with zero risk once obtained they cannot realistically be taken away making the choice far less significant than that regarding implants all this while still allowing the player to continue to directly and perceptibly advance their character so although i feel more enlightened to the opposing position i would argue that the drawbacks of the learning skills still outweigh their benefits especially in light of the existence of a separate mechanic that provides greater benefits regarding your point on significant choice with reduced dissatisfaction
this right herei would only support the removal of learning skills if they were not supplemented by increased attributes base attributes  implants is all you get no 10 to replace learning skills
i think you mean you have the tier 1 skills at 4 and tier 2 at 3 you plan to play for more than a few monthstake evemon and prepare a 1 or 2 years plan instead of some month long plan it is not important what you plan and if it is something you want it is only to see itit will suggest to you to train the learning skills upthe highest levels of the skill pay if you play long enough but as long as you plan at most a few months evemon will not suggest you train them
protip if a newbie does make a 10 year skill plan and listen to evemon then hell fail and get disgusted of eve right off the bathe wont even be able to afford advanced learnings while flying in his starter frigate much less implants obviously some skilling in order to do anything in eve is necessary unless youre purely training up a alt or buy isk right off the bat in which case you can go down the optimal route if you find sitting in station interesting anywayevemon is not in possession of all the factsive preety much trained to 43 and then went 44 looong afterwards and trained useful skills largely in eve experience  sp count so it wasnt nearly as bad a choice as some sp is everything nubbins would like to presentthat said the advice generally given to newbies regarding learnings in npc corps and on the forums is downright horrible eve is a game and it is meant to be fun nobody is going to get hooked on sitting in station waiting for learnings to finish and its not even the optimal choice if you want to maximise sp since the month spent getting learnings to v could be spent training for ships you can make isk effectively in for implantsskillbooks which a new player will not be able to afford otherwise on a genuinely new characterwhat is optimal for training your alt is not optimal for a new player i wish people would understand that particular bitalso experience and knowing how to play the game  sp count for a long time after i started pirating most of the fights i picked were versus often much older players getting out there and doing stuff is much better then sp whoring which pays off after a yearunless youre training a alt or somethingthe best fix to learnings and what they do to the new player experience is to mute everyone talking about learning skills in rookie chats  npc corps and ban them if they do it thrice
while i understand the competitive aspect of skill training eg ive trained this skill so youre better that the person who hasnt trained it but surely isnt it better to add skills which actually give you a meaningful achievement eg i do more damage i can fly more ships i can move faster not ive just managed to get bored for longer than you havesorry but im in the opinion that surviving large amounts of boredom shouldnt be considered an achievement
you are replying on a different point from what was the focus of my post to develdrinshe was saying that she will never train the last levels of the learning skill unless evemon was suggesting it i was pointing to her that unless she do a year long plan evemon will never suggest to train the higher levels in the learning skills but playing a 1 year or more will make training them to 54 convenientwhat you are saying is that training only the learning skills before any other skill for your main is dead boring and a great way to leave the game and i concurwhen i trained my mains i did it during play doing the operative skills while playing and enjoying very much the access to a new module or ship and the passive learning skills while offline it worked well even without the skill queuethat is the way to do it i will suggest to a new player with the added benefit that the skill queue will not require him to put up the alarm clock to call him 5 minutes before the end of the skill
yes and all of those training options exist the option to training learning and affect your time to train all of those abilities also exists since all are options i do not see how its good to remove some of the choices and force all players down a narrower pathedit im also curious about your answer to my question would you support the removal of the learning skills with no buffs to replace them
this at least is an argument for removing them that i can stomach  im not saying i agree with you  but at least its not the normal whaa they take too long put the game on easy mode for me whine that we usually see on this topicits worth noting however that at this stage of the game im not sure theres a way to remove them without screwing over if youll pardon the term large portions of the player base especially the older players additionally im not a fan of removing the idea behind the choices that these skills representon the bright side at least were not yelling at each other
options for removal includeremove skills and add 111 to all attributesremove skills and add nothinggive all players the skills at 5alternativelygive all players the skills at 44the last allows players to get going from day one without feeling like theyre seriously retarding their development while still providing a choice on when or if to train the heftier level 5 skills
you forgot an option leave it asis its not broken
not supported i trained them its part of eve think of learing as school for your character
people really need to get over this argument so is pos warfare doesnt change the fact that its a horrible game mechanic
says the pot calling the kettle blackthis proposal has been raised many many many many times and has been shot down many many many timesyou have little to no room to be throwing a fit over something that has obviously been settled long before you began this little discussion
heres the problem with learning skills when a new player joins the game they often ask what they should train first 9 times out of 10 other players respond with learning skills get them all to at least 4 training learning skills first puts all other skills on hold even the most vital ones new players want to actually play the game not sit in a station spinning their ship and waiting several weeks for learning skills to finishthey quit they leave and call eve a boring ship spinning game i certainly wouldnt want to play an mmo that tooks weeks and weeks before i could play it id quit on the spot and play something else and we can see from new player retention thats exactly whats happeninghow nice it would be if new players didnt have to sit in station for weeks and weeks training learning skills it would be great if instead they could train the skills they actually need to get out and play the game
so what they should do is shooting the people who tell them you have to train all learning skills first yes it is benefical to have the learning skills high but it shouldnt stop you from also train skills that improve your game play
so the game should be changed because people give dumb adviceif the majority of players start telling newbies to self destruct uninsured ships should we petition ccp to automatically provide insurance coverage for self destructions
alternativelyexplain learning skills in detail in the tutorial the advantages of training them and after what time they can expect to reap the benefits and the disadvantages of training them right off the bat how to optimally skill your character etcetera do it properly since this is a very important bitdo not let players give them false and erroneous information which is only useful when training your altthis is very important for the new player experience and is one of the worst things about italternatively just automute everyone talking about learning skills in npc corporations and starter systems more players who are not disgusted by training learning skills and not experiencing eve in the process is only a good thing
wow people would then get relly a dread for their trained dreadsp and not a stationhuggin and pvemobile ooohhhh what a pity
you fund somewhere in the instruction book of moros prohibited with them the pve or station huggin  lolban the moros from lvl5 missions because mr caldera advised it what a pity
we all know what happened last time you thought outside of the box with your morosesreally gents theres nothing to see here while i embrace diversity like a liberal with a hardon for albanians and kwanza the moros was overpowered in its role now that we have carriers and dare i say it the rorqual there really is no need to use a dread for this sort of station hugging buffoonery dreads are there for two things killing towers and killing caps if you want to be able to shoot the smaller stuff bring a support fleetps there is nothing stopping you from engaging in your station hugginglevel 5 grinding buffoonery btw you will just have to siege whats that you dont want to risk your ship when there are people out there with a chance to violence your boat please i invite you to come and join me on wow instead
what about that i am not a capital pilot but could this fix it
the proposed concept was named viceroys it somehow involved holding the space in the name of a faction i like the idea of people finding a reason to move into losec and improve parts of it i also like the lack of bubbles the gateguns and the sec hits for nonsanctioned violencein my view losec should become an alternate stepping stone to being a petrenter for growing alliances a treatment similar to that coming to 00 focused on improvements to the systems ability to provide blackmarket boosters implants clones etc would bring people into losec both those looking to holdspace and those looking to use it a modest tax should be applied to npc bounties there which goes directly to the governing viceroy those holding sov there do so at the will of their allied faction its not their space its the factions and while they can improve it it should be clear that if they want to grow into a larger more profitable group or keep undesirables out they need to get out from under their benefactors toes these sponsoring factions allow sanctioned violence against viceroy aligned with opposing factions through an fwesque concord agreement and a blind eye is turned to a little unsanctioned competition between those seeking the empires favor in the case of those viceroys supporting pirate factions such sanction is neither offered or desiredit makes sense for the empires to seek the aid of independent capsuleers in gaining advantages concord have made illegal it makes sense theyd want their representatives out there quashing piracy it also works well for the pirates themselves who are probably now looking to acquire some independent capsuleer muscle to secure their operations in losec and remind the empires that there are still sharks in these dark watersif your not fresh out of awesome by then you could add that being 2 to a pirate npc faction with negative sec status stops them from shooting you those siding with the outlaw factions should of course be able to install improvements that lure empire and concord npcs rather than pirate ones and spawn similar plexeswhile this concept could be adjusted and applied to npc 00 id much rather see the factions themselves making their presence known out there and would love to see something done that makes them truly stand out as the interstellar powers that they are
no doubti dont think anyone is arguing with thatso why not hire more gms cost im sure but i dont think its going to get any better by doing nothinga new interface would help more gms would help even more
i actually support this idea you cant beat a real person insta banning isk sellers to be honest it also opens up employment options for people who may not have the skills to become a gm in other departments
i only support this topic if ccp creates a group of poeple who will take care of this isk spammer issuereally simple that specific group has the power to suspend that character temporarily but to do that he has to copypaste and get a screenshot of the actual isk spamming thats it if a person goes back to ccp ccp can shove that screenshot and all other evidence in his facetaking a screenshot and copypasting takes seconds to dohell we could do the same thing with scammingif a person abuse its power ban all his accounts that way your sure he wont abuse itwell i think cause i wont
supported however ccps history of things is to let the playerbase do the work
what about a random day of the month where there are some dedicated gms that hit some noob channels and trade hubs makes it hard for the spammers to hide if they cant predict when it will happen
i think at fanfest they said there were about 60 gms do you really want to waste about 10 of those so we can have 247 insta isk banning petitions are slow enough as isseriously i think some sort of client side pattern analysis would be better download a blacklist from somewhere every time you log on and every time you see a blacklisted url it hides the chat message and automatically petitions ccp
in another game i used to play we had two options that would apply hereright click character name1 block2 report isk seller to be investigated not autobannedthe reports where automatic and automatically added that person to your blocked listif you reported a non spammer you got a banto stop griefing of other real playersworked pretty well
they dont hide  the halflife of an isk spammer is maybe 10 minutes they just roll up new trial accounts one day a month of extra enforcement wont help except on that one day
you have to remember that these isk spammers are bots theyre not real people who get tired theyre automated programs that are constantly runningthese isk spammers will never give up and they will never cease their activities they will never throw up their hands in frustration and say i surrender they will never stop spamming even when plex sales undercut themno matter how difficult it becomes for them to spam they will always keep trying theyre programmed to do so ccp isnt waging a war against a group of people theyre waging a war against hundreds and hundreds of computers programmed to spam
need a faster way to petition them tbh althoug last time i petitioned an isk spammer the petition was over in under 5 seconds of me sending it
1actually stop i take it back im wronggms are mindless drones they enforce policy often policy that doesnt match community standardsfor example gm would be compeled to enforce profanity as well as spam7seeing that the ccp keynote add

2nd tier rank 3 learning skills such as clarity and focus are 45m iskthis is a little much for characters that cant really afford a ship yetcoupled with the loss of skills that used to be free this is a roadblock for new playersto improve the new player experience and allow new players to follow the advice they are given by older players i believe the amount of isk to purchase these skills should be lowered matched to the entrylevel characters that purchase them
will it be good to make things even easiermore affordable for newbies not surewill it make a nice small wave in the market if these changes did take place probablydoes it really matter from a slightly older newbies perspective such as myself what the price point of these 2nd tier books were personally not really which is why i support this movement at the end of the day speeding up the process of learning these learning skills and upping their sphour count can only do so much for them when factoring in the entire eve experience they still need to go out there and learn to lose their ships pop other peoples ships and pod themselves some signed
im not convinced the cost is one of the few things that signal to the noob that they should focus doing other things before bothering with advanced learning skills a new player shouldnt try to train them at start and instead focus on ship support and other skills that actually enable them to play the gamenow they get to play and learn the game at least a little instead of wasting all their trialearly game time on learning skills if they really cant afford the skills they have better places to invest their skilltraining and time forcing them to play the game instead of letting them get bored to tears while trying to follow a sp maximizing guide isnt hurting them and is propably better for new player retention
have you tried the tutorialyou get a tonload of skillbooks and some shipif the new player want to skip the tutorial because he already know it he misses the 0 cost skillbooks and ships that it give hisher choice
i didnt have a problem affording the books at the time heck i didnt think much of it at the time as i was too busy enjoying the gamethis is a non issuenot supported
not supported for this reason
the cost of these books tells a new player two things 1 go train usable skills until you can afford them and 2 go make 18 million as soon as you have your first cruiser giving newbies a solid but attainable goal for their first week is a good thing
thisbig timelearning skills arent just a boost it teaches the finer points of eve when it comes to budgeting and management
actually i think it would be a better idea to raise them to rank 5 just to make it really obvious that only obsessivecompulsives should be training them to vin before pottsey
this isnt about new players this is about speedtraining new alts for minimim costremember malcaniss law when someone proposes a change to help the noobs it is always to benefit rich old players
ding dongnoobs have never had it so good in my day i started with 40k sp no accelerated training a sub par tutorial advanced learning skills required level 5 in the basics we had to warp to 15km everywhere in three feet of snowby the time a new player should be thinking about advanced learning skill he should have enough isk to cover them
yeah i think youre right i wasnt taking the tutorials into account but just a discussion amoung others who had recently created new active accounts
yeah this seems to confuse a lot of people so adding it to the npe makes sense
search ftli raised this well over a year ago original thread can be found here
eve is full of consequences this is one of themdo the mission and lose standing or waitim all for ways to get rid of antiempire missions but there has to be some drawbackid still suggest having the option to filter them out and getting less pay on the other missions
not supported eve should not be about grinding the missions you want to do they should change it that if you decline a mission the agent doesnt have work for you for the next 24 hours
the only way i can find this acceptable and which should fix your problem is when you accept a mission you got more than 6 hours to complete it that way if you call it a night the next day you should have time to complete itbut if you dont have time to complete it anyway and you come back the next day sure you lose the bonus isk but the npcs do return so who cares about that more isk when shooting them anyway
nope you want to be liked by an empire you should be disliked by another
non existent tried creating a corp lately i couldnt make noir back in the day because it was taken by a place holder 4 alt corp that was over a year and a half ago now with the patch coming up its definitely going to be a concern

hello folksi recently read the story of a player whos account was hacked and his stolen character sold on this forumthe true owner petitioned and ccp sayed the transaction was valid and couldnt give back the characterccp only gave him back his account why his 2 alt with basic sp his 4 years character vanishedi wil not comment about this and it is not the purpose of this message but this gave me an idea csm could support  because any one can one day become the victim of an undetected keyloger or whatever sh happen syndrom and considering loosing stuf is not so dramatic whereas loosing a several yearsmouths char with millions of sp is differentany account owner should be able to lock any of his characters disabling possibility to sale his charactersof course you can still unlock any character on account management but there will be UFFFD 1 week timer before the char become available for sellingi think this delay is enough for the true owner to declase this account was stollen if ever neededthis would lock any transaction and alow ccp to investigate about a potential theftps  sry for my poor englishedit  correction about stolent character age  80m sp represent almost 4 years
i think this is generally a good idea but needs to be developed more some sort of safety lock to prevent emptying of wallets contracting all items over trading all items over etc would probably help toowhat i find interesting is how the character sale went through with a legitimate credit card and a hacked account this incident really sounds like an edge case and not worth creating a csm issue specifically over although i really dont have petition statistics on hand to see how often this happens
yes this is the reason why i sayed this is not the purpose here this the purpose of gms and the owner of this account not ours the stealing was just an ilustration about how i get this ideaand of course the idea sould be developped morei leave this to any csm member or candidate i trust them to present it well to ccp if any of them think this is a good idea

not supportedyour talking about a one in a million odds type of situation and suddenly proposing a solution is not going to help us anythe problem started with the guys lack of common sense and or security on his computerintroducing a lock to someones account to prevent the char from being stolen could easily be reversed by said account hacker there by defeating your proposalnot supporting because the problem is the user in question not the systemyou are responsible for your own account security not ccpstop putting the burden on ccp to prevent you from doing stupid thingstop that off that your hearing this second hand there is no proof no documentation and ccp will not likely give you any verified facts other than rumor mills and second hand sitesso flame away but the facts are the facts

yeah i have been thinking about this for a while and when i can figure out some way to make it so that suspicious eventssuch as suspicious login or password reset etc trigger a temporary account restriction without screwing over regular players that just want to do stuff in eve i would totally raise it as a csm issue but i cant think of any way to do that properly right now 
supported security is the responsibility of the individual tools help though and i see no harm from such options being available
hm i think i will agree with that
good ideai could live with loosing isks and stuff but no charactersupporting
this is a pretty good idea expanding on it a bit why not require an email confirmation of all transfers this removes eve as the single point of compromise this way if someone wants to sell the character they also need to have access to the email account associated with the account expanding on this even further this could be tied in with character termination just throwing some ideas out there but all in all i support anything that makes life less painful if an account has been compromised

the drone interface is horribly out of date and needs a massive upgrade
1 clicking on your drone window or a drone group should not cause your selected object window to lose its current focus2 the drone window should keep its settings across session changes ie you have the drone groups expanded including the drones in space and when you have a session change they all go back to closedsupporting drone ui changes

even though your post contains little logical argument i will respond to itif mission running is so riskfree then let me risk it and shoot anyone who thinks he is tough enough to steal my mission loot i am asking to give mission runners an opportunity to protect there loot hence for pvp and pvp is risk therefore your argument is not valid as i am asking for risk both for the mission runner and the salvage stealer quote boost your riskfree mission incomehow on earth is letting me shoot the guy that stole my stuff a boost to my income i simply fail to understand logic in that statement you are complaining about mission runners getting too much cash but mission running takes a decent ship good standing and a lot of work to become profitable yes i know it is easy for a 2year old veteran char but we are talking from a relatively new players perspectiveninja salvaging can be done after a daytwo of training with a salvaging destroyer you can about as much isk per hour as a mission runner in his expensive faction battleship without even risking getting scrammed and killed by rats yes for a new player that is a valid threat why are you protecting salvage stealer that parasites on other persons work and receives substantial income without any risk involved mao if you are ing other people off by taking there stuff you should face some consequences in the end i am not asking concord to kill the fer for me am ieven decing is not the solution because first of all many ninja salvagers are in npc corps that cannot be deced and secondly it simply isnt worth it unless it is done repeatedly to dec every  that salvages some wreck because probably they are going to sit in thations if they log on at alli just fail to understand why everyone is protecting ninja salvagers i cannot see any valid reason for iti do not care what is the reallife perspective on worthlessness of a tangled and burned wreck its gameplay that matters and by gameplay it belongs to me with the loot and the tagsbounty because i killed the wreck i own it and there in no point in the dead rat owning its own wreck gameplay wise it makes sense and that is all that matters why make up all this complicated stuff about wrecks in containers containers in wrecks and so on it is simply a wreck with stuff that is not damged that you can simply take out without speshial equipment or skill when you salvage wreck you putt all the stuff in container it is that simple please read above as i already stated if wrecks are so worthless and have no owner then why can i not shoot an empty wrek belonging to other person without getting concordedyes

same bs thats weighing down the real life senatea resounding no
im skipping the next term because beginning of the year terms suck im running during a fanfest term for maximum relevancealso im going to quote your whole post because its absolutely adorable no sometimes people want something that isnt the best when talking about the internals of some system they have never really participated in also most of my voters dont even use the assembly hall and dont have a clue about anything in the csm they usually just want webbers fixed or stuff like that youre just one guy who has one vote and a ton of posts
you keep hiding behind your delusional world of nonaccountability and see how far that gets youyou may think this is just one big game and yes eve online is a gamebut its a game that many people enjoy and would like to see improvedignoring those people when they happen to know more than you think they do is a fatal mistakewe dont need to know how the system workswe know that we post here to propose ideas to be heard by csm to carry forward ideas to ccpthat is the point hereyou posted an idea it was rejected you carried it forward in spite of that rejection and it got passedwhat the hell did you expect a hearty pat on the backyour more foolish than you lookyou wont think they are adorable when they start taking issue with thatyou can make as many excuses as you want the fact remains you abused the system for your own gainat least lark had the guts to own up to it thats more than anyone can say for you no i dont approve what he did but hes making some valid points and yes your proposal was fair and balanced as lark saidbut your proposal was rejected and you obviously didnt give a  thats what has everyone sayingwhats the point of a csm that wont listen why bother with it in the first placefor the first time ive started participating here im starting to question why i bother defending you people in the first place
one of the things i strive to do every day dear drake is to get your approval on the forums for my proposals your thumbs up or thumbs down is a critical part of the voting process this is why i respond to your posts so i can get more of your important feedback when i said that csm first terms are largely spent being useless blobs while learning the ropes that was pretty much it im not quite sure what i should fess up to but after the reputation i have been building up in eve as of recent im not really sure what else other awful thing i can possibly admit to to make people think i am even worse
if that was true you would have never have pushed this proposal in the first placetherefore your just being hypocritical and wasting my time with your propoganda for your causeand why bother you just proved to us that you dont give a damn to begin withso dont bother buttering me up you can do whatever the hell you want because thats what you did right here i could flap my gums endlessly and your still going to push forward proposals that are not supportedno ones going to stop youthe catch is just how far will it get you before you attract the crowd far larger than this one
i dont know ive never done anything unpopular before i guess it will be an all new experience for me having people disliking me and my postingyou should also never stop posting man dont give up maybe youll change my mind if you make another post
they still have not answered why this got pushed forward with only three votes
beacause they can if i understood correctly you need one participation as csm member to know how it really works its stupidwhy not just ask old csm member how it works andor ask for a better documentation from ccp
well yes i did ask previous members and some extra documentation would be helpful let me expand on the virgin comment you can ask all the pros read all the books and watch all the blue movies you want before you do the deed but at the end of the day pretty much everyones first time is going to involve a couple of nervous half hearted thrusts and a trail of man fat leading from a hip to an inner thigh everyone knows how it works first time around but theres a difference between knowing the mechanics and really understanding
i simply cant support more terms if one is being used as training wheels for the whole term if it takes one term to figure out how to represent the community and be able to learn the csm mechanics if you will then the person should not be there to begin withsounds harsh but it is how i feel about it
you know what you are right only experienced csm members who already know wtf they are doing and how they will do it should be allowed to be elected
and mature ones who dont emo rage
current csm reps are pretty crap quote this post if you want to reduce term limits to 1

i was surprised that mazzs proposal was passed given the lack of support here i hope ccp does not support her proposal as written but do feel continuity is importantby which i mean continuity of productivity not continuity of pet issues each csm might support and best use of ccps investment in the csm larks amusing description alludes to the struggles a new csm deals with some remedies that occur off the top of my head and that would seem to contribute positively to the idea of my definition of continuity with or without a change in term limitsproactive selfeducation i would expect every new cms member to have taken the time to read every word of past csm meeting minutes raw logs too other csm stuff at evelopedia and at minimum the first 15 or 20 pages of this forum and jita speakers in addition id expect them to have had at least some discussion with previous csm members who ran on similar platforms to learn more about progress and obstacles relative to their initiatives and what some reasonable next steps might be being as informed as possible would seem vital to new csm delegates being able to hit the ground running and not waste time raising issues that are nonstarters or have no traction butdo new csms actually invest the time and effort to avoid that id love to hear from some incumbents and past delegates about how much back reading they did to prep for the jobnew csm orientation guide some kind of living document that orients new csms in a practical manner to how internal csm processes work level of effort expectations obligations links to important internal csm info contact info for relevant parties etc maybe something like this exists already but if not it would be extremely usefulespecially if it were all in one easily accessible document or wiki or somethingnew csm orientation a meeting between new csms and exiting ones before the new folks take up the yoke for purposes of information sharing qa etc surely this must already happen doesnt itanyways i ramble bottom line with such short terms i feel it is vital that new cmss be at maximum velocity from the first minute of the first meeting they attend doesnt sound like thats the way it happens currently there is no reason it cant though to validate ccps investment in the csm it should
theres already a sort of orientation but that sort of transfer of information is better handled speaking to a past csm 1 on 1 rather then in a short meetingalso all the internal csm rules and  is out there and public but its buried under irrelevent stuff and outdated stuff and i would rather kill myself then read that boring  i tried to do it but i just couldnt get through it theres no way you can expect someone to get the csm from just reading that even if it were theoretically possible to do the only way you can do it is by experience and communication my term up until before the iceland trip was pretty much spent on doing nothing much since i didnt know wtf was going on everything useful i learned about how to do csm stuff was from speaking to past csmalso who would update such a document to educate new csms i guess we can get around to it after the meeting minutes are released lol
so what your saying is you couldnt be bothered to read up and get the general feel and history of the csms progresswow thats yet an another strikei can distinctly remember numerous occasions where many people would be screaming at the csm for just that very reason they failed to pick up on past things and lo and behold your repeating historyoh and nice dodge on the obvious againhave i read everything on the csm no but i did catch quite alot of documents and minutes from time to time just to see what the hub bub was all about and i managed to get one thing clearly in mind the csm is not about showing up and just passing anyones ideas at the drop of the hat it takes effort and alot of workyou have to read the posts that people propose ideas for you have to listen you have to observe discuss pay attention to detailsnot every idea let alone everyone is worthy of pushing ideas forward as most things i shoot down are utterly ridiculous or a waste of time but the fact remains that its just my opinion and that doesnt justify my so called opinion to take precedence over someone elseif i was csm and i proposed an idea and everyone said no even if i disagreed and thought the mob was crazy i would have no choice but to disregard and move on aside form ccp making a point to say otherwise which i would document and make sure it was clearly stated that was the casewhy because unlike half the scumbags around these days i give a damn about being honorable enough to keep my frakking wordcsm would be a nasty job personally due to the fact that your forced to realize that its not about what you think anymore its what everyone thinksbeing csm is not taking a personal power trip and pushing your agendadamn good thing that the ccp is really the one to choose whether your sly move is going to take affect or notim pretty sure they wont but if they do its gonna be one messy day for the forums
itt drake draconis gets trolledi know you are maybe considering running for csm drake id advise against it though i guarentee you will either alienate the other delegates long before you arrive in iceland or give yourself a stomach ulcerhave a strokeyou might get some straight polite and honest answers if every time you make a post about something you dont agree with you dont spew out so much spiteful bile
i would vote for drake draconis for csm just for entertainment value especially since he knows sooo much about the csm and his posting is of such high quality i really want to see if hes like this irl
people always give me funny statements about ulcers and strokes but this is who i am i can no more fault you lark for being a pirate than you can for me being a bit zealous and passionate about how i think when it comes to certain subjectsthanks for your concern regardlessif i was a csm member howeverid probably stop posting the way i do currently as being csm representive means i represent a larger group of people and not myself nor my corporation or my alliance for that matter id be come a target for alot of harassment and troubles cant exactly afford to take pot shotswhen i post its my opinion and only my opinionas csm i would have to alter my perspective and try to take it as someone who needs to filter out and spend more time listening short of giving my opinion which would have to be less barbed and more subtle if not tactfulbut im not required to do that right nowand im still testing the waters so to speak because im not convinced it would be worth the effort if all we are going to get is a bunch of guys abusing powerbut i do have one questionif i alienate myself from the rest of the council for pushing this issue then i dare ask what exactly is the issue they are takingthe fact that im against passing a proposal obviously opposedim curious as to what you people think about thatand what would you people the public think about that
yeahcsm public info is a mess to find and read through insert organizational nerd rant here i know there have been attempts to be more organized and timely in publishing csm info but i still see a lot gaps and questionably long sometimes annoyingly unexplained delays too bad really because i think good and easily accessible documentation of csm activities and initiatives is a big part of the continuity puzzle that and the development of new csm orientation materials just need champions to take up the cause
everything is still a work in progress every time we meet with ccp so far we always bring up csm organization as a subject not only do the public info release need to be better organized the communication within ccp between the csm and the people working in the relevent areas need to be worked on same with the scheduling we have come a long way from absolutely nothing but we still have a ways to go and at least we are plugging away at itbasically theres a lot of internalish csm hit that is also broken and needs fixing too that the public doesnt even know about because its either not spelled out or probably under the nda or something like that even after finishing most of one term i dont really have a good enough handle on the situation to really know what is the best plan for everything
how can you fault me for the way i play the game really whats so bad about being a pirate but i digressall well and good broski but you said youd stop yourself from behaving in the manner you are behaving now if elected judging by your posting history i find that very hard to believe its not just this one issue you seem to approach everything you disagree with with the same passion and zeal i call it spite but one mans hot apple and pastry dessert is another mans evening companionship and in no way am i suggesting that you will alienate yourself from this council or any that you end up serving on by arguing about this issue its quite contentious and understandably so only those of us on the inside looking out have a real perspective on it and those who voted for it are far from freeloading power hungry despots im making that assumption based upon your posting history which quite frankly unless you genuinely are rping a 15 year old with a chip on each shoulder one called nerd rage and the other unwarranted self importance is pretty terrible even by my standards
i wasnt faulting you for anything i was making a comparison of your judging me for my behaivour is no different than me judging for yoursin other words pot calling the kettle blackif you wana get picky if what ive been doing is so bad in your eyes lets not discuss what you did recently ehbut ill stop there as youve been very respectfulknow that i genuinely appreciate your comments and respectfully say that regardless if you can go around saying stuff so can iand that is why i do what i doi dont intend to offend or insult randomly there is a method to my maddness if you willstrike up a convo with me when you spot me and youll find im quite capable of admitting im at fault when you give me valid enough reason to accept itim unique i tend to not follow the crowd like it or not its who i amregardless lets stop beating around the bush and covering up the fact that mazz and whatever people you guys feel appropriate to pick have pass a proposal without well daresay our consent as a whole bad choice of words yes i know but how else do you describe thisis this the csms true naturei hope not
just to clear this all upmazz answered your question earlier as to why it was posted for submission csm members arent in mazzs opinion as much political positions as opposed to 10 year old fat kids running through a candy shop the topic was submitted because ccp asked for a previously nonsubmitted topic raised by mazz which makes all future posts valuable apparentlyon another issue just because your position doesnt clearly depict that of a typical icelandic office doesnt mean that the terms should be increased those terms are based on several very well structured theories which have been established globally and known to work for example in australia some cities there are entire museums dedicated to these theories and the history of democracy that still doesnt avoid the issue of ccp paying for all expenses for that trip to iceland every year with less than 9 voting for csm its a shock because ccp hasnt added it sufficiently in the game to give more attention to the very sensitive issueon the issue of large corporations and alliances voting in their own members i realise this is going to be the case however by increasing the term limits  and in some cases someone suggesting they are unlimited or take on a more consultative role means that these members could be rotated in the alliance for who gets the next trip to iceland this is fantastic because it becomes the opposite of good it means we pay more money for nothing
ooops forgot to check the support box in my last postsupportedvs
while i dont necessarily disagree with this idea let me explain to you why it will never happen im going to use an exampleday 1 ccp turns off the profanity filter on the forumday 15 little johnny intrepid little 15 year old asks his mom whats a tardday 25 after her apoplectic fit mom does what shes best at  tells everyone she knows that ccp is bunch of child hating pervertsday 4 little johnny is on oprah explaining how his self esteem is damaged and he can no longer be a normal personday 6 lawsuit is filedday 9 every liberal conservative and religious organization in the western hemisphere goes on the warpath against eve online and ccp because of the childrenday 15 in the resulting media frenzy ccp pulls the plug on the forums completelyso if you really want to be the reason we have no forums at all please support this proposalalso im frankly surprised we dont have a profanity filter in the in game chat
little johnny can suck my in its his mums stupid fault for disabling the default and optional profanity filter
harden the  up
for those of you unsure what i mean take this program for example basically its the program replacing pidgin in future gnome releases they have a roadmap of what they want to do in the next while giving projected release points etc etc ccp used to have something like this

replace the target painter bonus with a web strength bonus some people seem to be afraid that this will return rapiers and huginns to solopwn ships this would simply not be the case what killed the rapier was the rsd nerf the huginn was nerfed by the speed changes increasing the web strength just balances these recons with the other races and if you switch out the tp bonus for the web bonus the bellicose would be an actual worthwhile ship imagine that
current flaws with market mechanics exchange of goods at prices outside of sell  buy order spread trading with yourself inconsistent broker feesas of right now current market mechanics impair market efficiency more specifically by making them sensitive to manipulation and leaving individuals with little safety as we all know there is usually a marginal spread between buy and sell orders currently on the marketthis spread should reflect the interval in which current market prices mp are settled the spread consists of the best highest buy order price and the best lowest sell order price currently when placing buy sell orders above below best sell buy order price settlement is done at the price specified by the second party issuing a order leading to a direct exchange with the minimum maximum price being the best sell buy order price such issues are non existing in reallife market places for commodities and induce manipulation and may result in some economically costly surprises to people not paying enough attention to their price settingsto illustratethe following buy and sell order sides are present for good x i have exactly 4500 units of x to sell but i dont want to wait in line at the price of 5075 instead i place an entire sell order for my stack of x UFFFD 5025 this would result in me selling 1000 UFFFD 505 and the remaining 3500 UFFFD 5025 please visit your user settings to reenable imagesin eveonline doing such a thing selling an entire stack at a price below the best standing buy order price would yield different results instead of having the best price standing dictate i get the following transactions 1000 UFFFD 5025 and 3500 UFFFD 5025 leaving the buyer at 5050 a 025 premium if i wore to set the sell price on my order to say 4800 id get 1000 sold UFFFD 4800 and 3500 sold UFFFD 4800 a price that is not within the current market spread and giving premiums to both buy orders the realworld case would be identical as posted earliernow one could of course place two separate sell orders in order to maximize the prices but if we really strive to have good markets mechanics need to ensure trades happen within the spread this flaw can easily lead to costly mistakes for individuals and might lead to market manipulationim sure were quiet familiar with the daily average prices of the different goods that we buy and sell its a indicator to which we put some weight of how good of a price were getting in comparison as trades outside of the spread are allowed and so is trading with yourself banned at all worldwide stock markets one could technically impact the average price people put their trust too without actually having a impact on the sellbuy order structure this brings me to the third point inconsistent broker fees currently broker fees are not consistent they are only applied if you buy something through place buy order or by trying to sell something through the advanced sell order option if you want a direct settlement on the market you can easily avoid such fees but when you think about it what is really different between placing a buy order that lasts a week and one that leads to a exchange immediately not much and so comparing eve with realworld broker fees one can also conclude that it is not realistic i would suggest to either remove it completely or be consistent with it apply it over all boards to sum it up incorporate market mechanics allowing market settlements at multiple price levels for one order and market exchanges to only be made within the current spread ban trading with yourself yes it can be bypassed by having several accounts but removes simple manipulation overlook broker fees and be consistentthe market in eve needs more functional features and mechanics to ensure continued efficiency if more illustrative examples are requested ill happily handle it
imho the market is fine
it would be nice if the market gave incentives based on bulk rather than a flat rate i know this would benefit mass production more than the little guy but the npc goods need to be sold in different quantities to fix this gear the buy orders towards a small medium and massive ship so that new players have a nitch in the npc goods market mid level players dont compete against freighter owners and freighter owners are capable of buying up an order reasonable to their ship size rather than dozens or hundreds of smaller ones each tier being less profitable per unit but easier to handle for your respective ship size
theres some problems with releasing the full meeting minutes on time probably largely stemming from the fact that you cant force someone not on your payroll to do something for you and also the fact that in life  happensthere is the nda issue that we cant talk about meeting stuff before the release so this issue is about tweaking that rule a little bit and providing clarification since sometimes minutes can take a while to get out but people want to know if a csm issue passed or failed in a meeting especially if its their pet issue or somethingso my proposal is that csm members can discuss the results of the csmonly online meetings such as whether an issue passed a csm vote or not what was said and so forth any releases of this nature ought to happen on a public forum to prevent any future scandal csm members still cannot discuss parts of chat that were not going to be released in the meeting minutesall those times the secretary says x lines are going to be striken from the logs etc and csm still cant discuss results of official csmccp meetings until the minutes are releasethis isnt entirely off from what happens anyways and i cant imagine anyone getting really punished for doing this right now but i think that the nda gets in the way a little bit for no good reason in this instance and right after a vote is held id love to post in the issue thread that it passed or failed in real time im telling you absolutely no secret  happens in the csm only meetings theres no reason to treat them as such
there was an area full of couches and beanbags on the 2nd floor  it was pretty chillmy addition  csm panel should have either been a roundtable or a live csm meeting rather than a panel a live demo of how the csm operates or a better way of qna would probably have interested more people than hearing 9 people spend 20minutes answering 1 question
many people have chosen nicks that may be great for a spaceship game but with incarna this will change nicks become increasingly important when you are actually gonna be face to face character i would like to pay 20 or whatever to get an additional nickname this doesnt mean that i should be able to swap between them but i could change my displayed nick once every year or once in a lifetime it could even display on character info the red lion formerly known as redlion and then noone could take my old nick and people searching for the old nick would find the new standingsbuddylist etc will update automatically so its not exploited
when this game was young long before the super packs and massive blobs even before alliances standings were hard to interpret ccp brought out tools for warfare to make things easier for people to see and understandone of those tools was alliances it became obvious why this was needed it was a logistical nightmare to coordinate corporations independently with no way to really tell who they were the alliance system was added so that all friendlies could unite under one bannerit had a side effect though suddenly alliances became the new corporations of eve and corporations became subsets it became a game of working for the alliance more than working for the corporation a 2nd addition was the newer overview it allowed better coordination of fire easier targeting and better selectivity for the fc the 3rd addition was more problematic it became bluered syndrome now it wasnt enough to be corps with allies under one banner we instead need to make it ridiculously easy to pinpoint who are friends and enemies arei believe this made it all to easy to make the super power blocks because standings were much easier to sort amoung friends now it wasnt about having an alliance where protection came from being under the same banner rather we created blocks alliances of alliances seems counter intuitive and redundant what has become the point of protection under an alliance when its really only about protection under blue status in the regionthe results of this impact are obvious corps are constantly hopping between blue friends players are constantly hopping between those corps someone might not like the rules of member a but loves the benefits of that blue group so he just hops over to lil o friend of big brother and gets an easier life so again whats the point of corporation or alliance teamwork when you can separate people out so easily no need to keep your industry core in alliance just make another hide alts there and keep them blue incase something happensphreeze tried to make a proposal but due to some obvious flaws it didnt pan out but i believe his base was goodive aimed to rework what he started herethere should only be 4 standings alliance fleet at war red and neutralpeople in alliance should be easy to spot its the benefit of flying under 1 banner same with fleetsneutrality creates confusion in a good way it makes battlefields harder to read and position on while avoiding threats it makes identification that much more necessary it forces fleets to coordinate better together so that its not just a matter of looking where all the blues are on a map with 800 people this is good it also forces people to more closely watch and organize who they need to shoot this will probably create more subsets of fleets where support and dictors and logistic need more coordination to avoid affecting friendlieswar is confusing in the heat of battle its hard to tell whos a friend and whos an enemy its more about communication and anticipation rather than just looking for the guy waving the blue flag red status for wars only helps in several ways if you have enemies that are really a problem war declaration makes them obvious targets if theyre just a minor harassment then who really cares this should translate into more empire conflict carry over from 00 it should also create more isk sinks which this game desperately needseveryone else it needs to be shades of gray i think this would positively impact 00 warfare and remove the desire for super nap pacts its hard for someone to want to be in an alliance currently when its so much easier to avoid the alliance while reaping the blue rewards lets change that force people to declare intent and loyalty moreif you truly dont want to be in an alliance fine but suffer the drawbacks of those choices neutrality is a 
why did i mention the overview well obviously standings affect overview performance if we make these changes again the benefits need to be played to alliances fleets and war declarations its so silly that you can actively declare war on someone in 00 by just turning them to 001 standings force people to merge into alliances to avoid friendly fire incidentsff is a great tool for breaking nap pacts accidents happen in war it should require more political swagger to fix issues than it does now ff now are really just stupidity and mistakes the proposed changes make ff more practical and realistic its hard to decipher who really is a friend when everyone has a gun on the field so force overviews to only show all neutrals and reds or just people youve declared war on if a new player comes into the mix great it adds to confusion until you see their intent if they are a problem today war dec them tomorrowlets break up the super alliance pacts that are so easy to make now lets push for more conflict uncertainty and build a 00 filled with warfare even if its sometimes mistakes for the politicians to clean up
why dont you go full  with your idea and get rid of all standings even if you are in the same corpalliancei hope you dont expect any real discussion of your idea because it borders on the insanelastly you should wait until what dominion and treaties bring it may be a limited number of blue slots or maybe a sliding cost to how many blue allies you have or something ccp is looking at it and we can only wait to see what ccp will do
so what youre saying is add a 5th condition for treaties from my understanding treaties are more about demands from industry alliances coming from their war overlords its pretty easy to treat them the same as war decs working the other way where a payment is panned out for security status im fine with that and it plays well into what im aiming for please be constructive with post all you sound like is a carebear  whos worried his nap brigade might go away and try a main it helps lend weight to your post
yess delete learnings tia
somy first forum post because i actually felt strongly enough about this subject to posti learned about learning skills my second day of playing im about a 3month old character now from the newbie channel my very first thought wow i can actually control the speed at which i level up this is greatand i immediately went and bought the skills and started training as a 3 month old character i have most of my basic learning skills at 5 and most of my advanced learning skills at 3 or 4 man is it giving me an edgei have the same skill points as a few characters that have actually started up to 1month before my birthdatethe ops claim thatits a choice between wasting time learning those skills or being stuck training slowly has one big false assumption he assumes that learning skills are wasting time they help you do everything faster later in the game lastly of course learning skills are a time sinkevery mmo where you actually improve as you play has a time sink why do you think that for games with character levels it takes longer to reach the next level the higher you go for games with skils it takes longer to improve that skill the better you are at it the only nontime sink mmos i can think of are fpss as for me im happy with eve being a game where i improve over time and actually have some control over how fast i improve rather than having skill learning being set in stonenot supported
nicely saidand welcome to eveassembly hall
my opinion is that you either take time now to make later go faster or not that is all there is to itin any case not supported
this 
protip they dont need to spin their ships in station waiting for the learning skills to finish heck if they are not mouth breathers they realized on their own that they can train a few things to 3 and greatly increase their noobish effectiveness with little or no effect in their long term training if they even have a long term training plan new players already get more skill points at the start and an accelerated sp training period that not enough for you fine please go  yourselfi play the game to enjoy myself just like everyone else alright not everyone some make this game a second job so when i was advised that training up my learning skills first was a good idea i went with that for about 2 days then i had a whole bunch of skills i wanted or needed to accomplish whatever it was that i was doing at the time so i made myself a big ass list of skills i wanted bought them all and trained learning skills when i was logged off and the short skills i wanted when i was logged in it worked beutifully i probably lost maybe 2 days tops in stretching out my learning skill training by adding what i wantedso in conclusion dont try to change the game because you are incapable of thinking for your self and spend weeks spinning your ship in a station because you think you are not allowed to train anything but learning skills you have a skill queue now training is easy now ffs no more setting an alarm to change a skill or wondering if you remembered to set a long skill before you logged off i guess what i am trying to say is get bent
huh hello phoenixhaving said that the nerf is indeed unecessary to be honest its not that farfetched though now that theyre merging the tracking penalty into turrets base stas  dreads wont be able to hit  whether in siege or not
proposal provide an additional system defense upgrade that is similar to the cynojam currently available whose purpose is to provide a gradual degradation of the cloaking systems of neutralred defined by the sovholding entity ships in a systemthe rationale behind this idea is tied to the current rule that prohibits fitting 2 cloaks on a single ship that they cancel each other out or are out of phasethis upgrade module would over an extended period of time perhaps 60120 minutes attempt to tune itself to the encroaching ships cloaking signature and begin cancelling it out the initial effect of this could be a slowly increasing chance of being probed out and the final result be complete failure of the target ships cloaking modulesimilar to the current system that allows friendlyblue ships to utilize poss jumbridges and cynos friendly ships would not be effectedto simplify the system the timer would be reset every time the target ship exited and reentered the protected system but this would expose the ship to interdiction and destruction during that transitionthis is motivated by the incredible ease with which opposing ships with cloak can permacamp even the highest level sov system with near impunity collecting intel on insystem activities
either it affects all cloaks the same no matter what standing or this gets a noand the requirements to have this upgrade should be really high above cyno jammers maybe
i see the biggest carebears are still 00 carebears
and i wanted to be friendly and not blame him to be a carebear right away 
how to fix neutral rep altsevery time you aggress with a neutral character by repping someone in the wardecced alliance you get a lengthened aggression timer so long as teh wardec is activerep that person oncenormal aggressiontwice 1 hourthree times 10 hoursfour a weekfive and you are personally included in the wardecfor as long as it lastsif the wardec is dropped you have a 2 week period where if they pick it back up the character is automatically included in the new war dec that stops an alliance from dropping then picking up a wardec to reset the characters count
im hesitant but i have to say this is a pretty damn good temppatch for a troublesome problemi say temp because ccp may be up to something with dominion
ya i was focusing on something that could be implemented with eves current mechanics
if anything neutral rring in high sec wars needs to be nerfed even more harshly than this thumbs up to anything that fixes neutral rring
this would be a fine fix for the problem while not nerfing actual remote rep gangs with aggressions
yes please not that i fight many wars obviously  but if youre going to rr someone involved in a war you should also be be dragged into that war
neutral reppers suck
corrected some basic spelling errors  never make a post from an iphone
yeah sure
wouldnt it be easier to just make neutral rr an offensive action or does that break down when alliances come into the pictureit gets concordokkened in highsec cant dock cant jumpit gets gcc in lowsec cant dock cant jumphow does the game treat something like remote sensor boosting tracking links and such or they considered offensive or neutral by aggro mechanics

it would be awesome if the gms would sit in the noob systems and trade hubs to annihilate bots as they are born but failing that they should make reporting the spammers easier so as to fight the laziness of people who currently block instead of petition because the reporting system is clunkyi made a proposal here
eve gms are already pretty effective in their dealings with isk sellers also ones not required to petition them but doing so obviously makes the whole process that much fastermaking the act of reporting easier and faster though would make me happy panda

tracking is linear and exponential if youre talking essentially even tracking then its linear based on range if youre talking about increasing tracking compared to what it tracks at increasing range then its exponential what youre complaining about is linear either way tracking is fine in this game but gun range or damage tradeoff or some other variable needs to be looked at id personally rather see more damage for less range for blasters autos dont use cap so they win with neutsat 45 optimal a blaster mega can track about 300ms at 45 optimal a non buffed bs can track about 200ms with a web most cruiser fall under that speed unless they use a mwd mwd can be countered with point or capacitor warfare an ab cruiser can get over that speed which is intended bs v bs its hard to outrun tracking of blasters its likely if you can outrun tracking you can just as easily outrun range
i think when t3 frigates come out there should be several of course the big trick will be making them different than hacs and afsi have two ideas1 commandship frig able to fit one gang link and not much else2 smart bomb frig able to fit one large smart bomb and ruin hostile drones or function as a semisuicide ship vs blobs
i dont want to discourage ideas but i think this is pretty far in the future to start debating on what they should be
in my opinion normal destroyers should be able to fit a gang link right now there is no command ships for small frigate sized fleets
both ideas sounds a bit like not really doable1 commandships have the advantage that you normally dont want to shoot them first because of their tank having a similar tanky frigate would make it overpowered in other situations2 the smart bomb frig sounds very much like overkill having a bs size smartbomb on a frigate will make them pretty dangerous for your own frigate gangwith those 2 concerns i cant really support your idea
theyre not without issues but a claymore can keep up with a frig fleet and adds so much to it that its not even funnyto topic though i agree its premature lets hear what ccp have come up with and shout about that itll be more efficient
i think you can also set up a very fast t3 cruiser with a gang link
when t3 frigates come the one thing they better not have is the interdiction nullifier they would be impossible to catchbut frigate sized command ships would be very nice smartbombs not so much there really is no point to that
i seriously doubt there will be any tech 3 frigates destroyerscrusiers already therebattlecrsuiers battelships captials yeah now your talkingnow if ccp does release them id be a bit troubled by the ease of reconfiguring for a number of things as we dont need an omgwtfbbq frigates flying around
drake they said on the fanfest live stream that they will release t3 frigates 
oey i hope they take balancing into accountso be itbut no i dont support this proposal regardless  o pthanks darius o7
station docking games galore
naah only 90 of the time
i recently tried to start a new character using no halp at all from other accounts and following advice i was given by other players tbh it was easier when you started with 800k the skill books you get from the tutorial and starter arcs are really ing random got a load of shield tanking books and modules as an ammar char but no armour stuff and a laser boat with no energy management and no controlled bursts is unusable to cut a long story short after doing the starter arcs running a few missions and buying my first few adv learnings i was in a worse position than the old 800k days the books are very expensive to a new character and are pretty usefull to have early even if you dont train them up very high since you wont have bling implants to fall back on having somethiong you can actually work towards rather than sitting and waiting is not nessesarily a bad thing however three mil is probably a better price50mil is going to make no difference to alts this is however pretty important to genuine new playersnot supporting however till i can find a genuine newb to throw through the npe and grill for information
nothing was an error
sorry but if you watched the key notes speech they said theyre going to make it a more warm comforting environmentat least initially there will be a dark side though in the form of off the record dealings however
this is starting to get silly why arent these posted yet
i want to see if csm asked ccp about the scanner at fanfest theres 70 pages of people asking for it the largest thread in assembly hall if they didnt they can go die in a fire and we can close the csm for beeing useless to the players
didnt any one else read the hot fix patchnotes its now 13 seconds matching the visual timer to find it look under the patch notes at the bottom it says hot fixdeployed october 6 2009 and is the first item
i dont know how the csm election works and have never paid attention to it but i want to nominate barack  obama president of the united states to the council i know he has an ingame character barack obama who is a member of goonswarm can someone please second this nomination and explain how we make him a candidateedit how awesome is it that his middle name is censored by the forum software
the editing is indeed lolzi dont know if this would work barack obama is a huge care bear i mean he just won the nobel prize for peacei cant really picture universal health care for eve and my npc corp taxes are going upi think eve would be better suited for one of those horrible dictators out of africa
i have also nominated him for the heisman trophy and i urge all of you to do the same but seriously csm too who better to give advice to the developers than someone whos never played the game
id nominate the late idi amin they certainly dont make them like that anymore
aahahhahahahahhaa profanity filter for the mothering win i dont think weve had a kenyan csm candidate yet do they even have air service out of kenya he will probably have passport issuesim not sure if electing him would be a great idea the smacktalk that regular csm members get well with all the wardecs and ingame attempts on his life will end up resulting in a lot of arrests
you mean like banning 9000 of them
if you run for csm let your account expire right about the time your term beginsthey pay up to 6 months not adding 6 months to your account so if you paid 2 months they only add 4i should raise a csm issue about that
bloody hell things just keep getting more and more ridiculousme facepalmthanks for the correction
why so ridiculous
its not because its rare that its a bad ideaalso yes you are responsible of your account security but you shouldnt lose years of training for either a mistake or a hack
it would be optional right so why would it be a problem to implement it and i think you should be able to determine the amount of time your characters stays locked one week seems a bit short for me but it mihgt seem a bit long for othersa year seems like a good amount of time to me im never selling my character so a forever would also be a good option
i like the idea of being able to lock a character to prevent transfer or termination at least its one more obstacle details need sorted but supported and although i like the idea of email confirmation as well it is not a failsafe someone who hacked or stole your login details could just log into the eveo site and change the email associated with the account couldnt they
this
very good ideal one week timer on locked toons before you can sale them is a great idealif you get hacked it buys you time to get your account back and if your legit in wanting to sale off a pilot you will simply need to wait a one week time before doing so
signed
one could expand on this design a fair bit email confirmation to old address confirming move to new address adding a security question to be answered for email address change etc
bump
as a drone pilot i support all the ideas that have been expressed here
here goes nothing
ing yes
hmph  snowballslast year i was still active but had a long training run and didnt log in during the season when i did log in there was the message snowballs melted
lolz
this would be lulz
1 for egg nog bombs and christmas boosters 
great idea guys maybe we can have decoratios for pos tooals take a look at
having recently given wow a shot one thing that blizzard do well is world events which tie into real life events goings on while they can get away with it sort of in wow i think ccp would be hard pressed to write similar events into eve as effectivelysaying that why the hell not i mean really snowballs are great and everything but lets have a bit more like that if it breaks immersion slightly but people have some fun with it then who cares right
no need just go fly caldari ships they have an obsession with lots of flashing lights
please read last psot made by me before reading this thanks hello please take this seriously as i have come up with a brilliant new idea for a ship it is a caldari ship and i designed it to be a cross minerhauler for small mining operations that do not require an orca i have drawn some sketches and diagrams of it and even made a model if you want them it would have 8 turret hardpoints which can only fit mining lasers just standard mining lasers not strip miners it would have a bit more of a mining yield than a retrieverit would have a cargo hold slightly lesser than an orcas and an ore hold i have decided to call it the gull as most caldari ships are named after birds and gulls scavange in a way thanks for reading please let me know even if you do not want the ideayours faithfully oliver stoner
well some people in game are telling me it is too god to be feesable maybe a ship with half the mining yield of a hulk and half the total capacity of an orca please can i note i did not intend it to be able to fit mining foreman link modules
ill tell you why i wont support it even though it might make a miners life a little more comfortable its one of those ideas thats just too overpowered in my opinion its going to make both the hulk as well as the orca obsolete i do understand that a hulk with no storage capacity can be a bit of a pain especialy when there is no orca buddy around but getting the two ships in 1 mega mining ship is just too much im affraid an addition might be that these ships can only be used in 00 or somesuch but then again thats why hulks were designed in the first place if im not mistaken
i believe capital industrial ships can be used in high sec but i may be mistaken i thought it would be a good idea for small mining ops like 1 hulk 1 orca but if you only have 1 hulk why would you need a whole orca so this is why i made my idea
hey stonerfirst of all it being a caldari ship is an awesome idea caldari ftw raises fist i like your idea because it would be sort of a ubermining ship which i had thought of myselve a couple of times but i bet all the macro miners out there would be very pleased to have one too and believe me you wouldnt want those guys to get their hands on something like this market would just collapse me thinkson the other hand if this thing was only for low or null sec macros would prolly not use it unless there is an alliance protecting them which i dont believe any alliance would do but still there is the chance that could happeni like your idea and i hope pple will discuss this matter a little morefly safe
i think that empire macroers will instantly go for the max yield and a hulk is in that favour which pushes me to think that this ship will only be used for honest small mining ops
oh yeah forgot to suuport it
no the rorqual is the only capital industrial ship and as it cannot use gates they are unable to operate thereindustrial command ships the orca lack a jump drive but can use gates orcas operate in highsecno the barges rorq and orca are faction ships developed by outer ring excavations if your proposed ship were to be caldari then they would need to add similar ships for the other three races all ships for the one playable race has a rough equivalent in the other threeno problems this would be abused as a jump freighter if you made it slightly smaller than an orca an orca fit out for hauling t2 expanders t1 cargo rigs idc iv can move 179000m3 only 50000m3 of which needs to be ore it can move 400000m3 worth of rigged ships 20 frigate hulls in addition to other cargo  as much ammo as you can fit in there for comparison the rhea is 353250m3 of cargo space freighter iv required so 20 to the base cargo neh haulers and mining ships have been kept separate this promotes teamwork this model has not been broken in all the time eve has been out and it is working perfectly fine i see no reason to add an UFFFDberbarge that can mine for two hours by itself it isnt addressing a problem theres no reason to put a corp hangar on a mining barge carriers have them because they are combat logistics ships they can bring replacement ships to the field allow you to refit with different mods and can bring additional ammofuel to the fight rorqorcas are mining support platforms they also allow refits and can bring fresh mining crystals  ice  gas harvesters to the excavation siteall that aside if youve done concept art on a caldaristyle ship please post it somewhere everybody loves fan art
it doesnt necessarily have to have a jump drive or a corproate hangar array or a ship maintenance array as long as it has a decent ore hold i would like it to be smaller than an orca and have a yield a bit more than a retriever all ore ships have a faction just look under preview eg orca is caldari ndustrial command ship i never designed it for solo miing but small mining ops because 1 gull and 1 hulk is better than 1 orca and 1 hulk as yield is alot more and there is still a decent capacity ok
sounds like a good ship i think it will encourage afk mining but then again so does the power of 2 offer with 1 orca and 1 hulk thumbs up for sir stoer on this one
sounds good to me
i think you should make the ore hold big and the cargo hold quite small so people cant use it as a transport then trasport stays in logistics and this would be a full mining ship i like this ida same ship size but one high slot with tractor bonus but mske it a drone mining ship that give big bonuses to the mining drones mining carrier give masive bonuse to the drones so it will get as mutch as the retrever with max skills but the drones would keep macro miners from using thim becus npc normly pop thim first
great idea but you seemed to lke it so why did you not show support
so were onto the idea of being a mining carrier with small cargo but big ore hold with big bonus for mining drones is there some way we could let is have loads of drones like a normal carrier
bump
if the ship has a small cargo but big ore hold the miner will need to be at the computer all the time to constantly switch ore from cargo to ore hold am i right so that completely eliminates the afk mining problem so atm we are either thinking of a mining carrier
not supported eve is about teamwork hulksorcawin
darius you obviously havent been bothered to read this post it was not designed for solo mining it was designed for small mininbg ops and if it is only about teamwork why do people do missions on their own and do pvp on thier own
well for small mining ops the orca as is is 100 fine my corp often just have 1 miner and an orca sitting in a belt no need for a new ship
while the concept is great it does not promote a very important part of eve play which is team work either from players with 2 accoutns or with other members in a corp i do the samething using 2 accounts 1 account with a mamothand a ret while the other account is in a hulk the only thing that needs to be address here is the ability to sheild the ret better but i am working on that with my skills
well i think the whole concept of mining needs to be more dynamic rather than locking a rock and activating lasers im begin to like the whole idea of a mining carrier here and if enough people like the idea of having loads of mining drones flying around the place we could ditch the whole idea of having a huge ore hold and make it purely a mining carrier anyone like this idea
maybe we could also get a large mining drone the size of a fighter
you will get more dynamic mining see this video from the fanfest where they talk about comet and ring mining
mining rokh  jetcans  orca in station  your ship not supported
when i find ur psot i will read it entirelyterrible ideaso a rokh rokh with giant cargo gtfo
so youre a caldari player asking to ccp make a caldari only super ultra mega afk mining ship screw the other races make them train caldarithats about as fair and balanced as msnbchow about no
assigning roles to people directly causes mass confusion so i only use titlesthere is no way to grant a member the ability to assign a title without making them a directori need the ability to create titles that will have roles associated with them which will allow those people to grant other titlesthis would solve many problems in snigg and id imagine other corps as well
i think people that keep spamming the same crap over and over despite the fact that ccp has firmly stated their case and reasons need to be placed on the killrights list of everyone in eve this would both reduce idiotic spam and make the game more fun
also it is not theft saying it in your topic title will not make it true
the mission runner has created it so i consider it belonging to the mission runnerit has the mission runners name on it so i consider it belonging to the mission runnerif you shoot the empty wreck just like any other property of a different player you get concorded so i consider it to belong to the mission runner
wrong the character who activated his salvager created it you can consider it yours as much as you like but the guy who actually applied his skills and mods to create the salvage is the one who ends up with it in his cargo holdplease explain why you think hisec mission running income needs to be boosted still further
you do have that option you can mission in losec or 00 whereby you can do anything you like to salvagersor better yet you can support my proposal to make all level 34 combat mission deadspaces losec which means that you can choose to initiate aggression at the expense of a small sec hit of course so can the salvager but whoever starts the fight is then stuck in the deadspace for 15 minutes that way everyone gets what they want the current salvage laws stay the same for eg belt rats and pvp wrecks you brave bold mission runners get to shoot at salvagers if you really want to with only the minor sec hit penalty you should have sec to spare and if anyone tries to gank you theyre stuck in the deadspace for 15 minutes so you can get your fellow bold brave missioning buddies to come and help you beat the hell out of them missioners and salvagers share the same level of risk noone else needs to be affected no rules need to changei trust i have your support in this proposal since it will give you everything you say you want without affecting noninvolved parties
salvage  salvage if it wasnt available to anyone who wants to salvage it it wouldnt be salvage end of
should be more fun if the parasites would not try to sponge others off like ninjalooters in mission of other players
support implementing this will increase the possibility that a failfit pve missionboat being killed in pvp action which is a yesyes
i think that a lot of people here are drifting off topic by arguing with each other about what is logicalfor me what is logical is consistency and the way thing are now is not consistent hence why lots of people make forum posts on this subjectplease see my last post which appears to have been mostly over looked  its on page 2 for details of my views
so if i understand you correctly you will not be happy with salvage until both a can with the lootold school and the salvage spawn seperatly at the death of a ship thus the salvage will be an unowned item and can not be tractor beamed by anyone increasing the time for salvaging universally if this will make you happy i guess you can petition for that so you can feel better about the current state of salvage rights
no i will feel better only when i will be able to protect my property without concord interfering i want to shoot any fer that is dumb enough to touch my salvage the wrecks belongs to me you are not allowed to do anything with it shoot it salvage it scramble it webb it try webbing someones wreck concord will pop you even thought you are doing nothing to a bunch of rubbish bu for some reason concord lets you take the rubbish apart its simple as that you do not touch other peoples property move it around cans or fk around with it in any other way without permission if you do they have a decent opportunity to dispose you of your shipthis wll mean more pvp and loses on both sides both mission runners shooting salvagers that they cannot take on and people salvaging wreck of a mission runner that has a bunch of friends in system making game more interesting something less lame then can wars
you can protect your propertyhowever this does not include salvage until after youve actually salvaged it
it seems that whenever i scroll too far in the standings listings im all the sudden lagged by the computer trying to load dozens of avatars for the agents that i might have talked to once these avatars serve no visible purpose and could easily be switched for another iconwhat i propose is to have the corporation logo in the location where the avatar currently displays and maybe some details about the agent for instance one agent would be listed in the current system asavatar sihsad aphuka 1000 superb iin the new layout i envision it would appear like thiscarthum conglomerate logo sihsad aphuka l4 q18 1000 superb icomments suggestions

sounds like a good way to reduce highlag loads either that or make npc portraits cached on your hard drive permanently instead of temporarily so you only ever have to download the pic once
no special module pls i dont want to see the blaster moros pinning everything with two webs at undock for instapoppingweb must be a semispecialised equipment like ecmburst which is mostly useless on any ship except scorpion or energy neutralisers that do a thing only being fitted on a curse or faction shipsnanonerf almost eliminated rapier and huginn presence in gangs because 60 webs made them almost useless comparing to previous params summarizing all above i suggest that ccp can spend some time to think about changing the missile bonus for huginn to 10 web effectiveness per levelalso it would be nice to give combat inties like taranis the same bonus in counter to the longdis for ares but i dont know what to do with claw and crusader with their two medslots let ccp think about it  they always get nice stuff
that is a bit of a stretchfirst off we have just her word to go on itsecondly this sets a nasty precedent basically it means that the greater majority of us here at assembly hall can say all we want good bad ugly loud quiet it wont matter only having ccp to stand in there wayeverything we are discussing here is a colossal waste of timeanyone in the csm can make proposal and it will be passed or rejected atwilli find it a bit hard to swallow thatwhich leaves one final questionwhat is the point of having a csm when they can ignore the overall populationbecause if thats the case then why bother giving input to begin with
theres a reason people hate politics welcome
for once i actually agree with youyeah theres always politics but honestly they could have made an effort ffs
practically speaking the csm is a consultant job not a political office flying 9 csm members to iceland twice per year probably costs about as much hiring one guy full time to try to figure out wth the community wants and can do the job better too the only reason there are elections is because its the only fair way to decide which players get the tripthe problem with all your arguments is that you think this is like electing a senator or a governor the only wrongdoing a csm member is capable of is not really made any more possible the longer they stay in office youre basically electing a player opinion consultant for ccp that is paid in free trips to icelandmost of the rest of my posting here is just to provoke drake
the scope of the csmthe purpose of the csm is to represent society interests to ccp this requires active engagement with the player community to master eve issue awareness understanding and evaluation in the context of the greatest good for the greater player basetopic presentation and management by the csma topic can be anything that a player considers important the goal is to either gain the support of a representative or gain a 25 public support level on the issue from the total number of voters from the last general election if either of these conditions is met the topic must be addressed by the csmbasically if a topic gets the support of just one csm it can be brought to vote now as far as a csm starting a topic and then the same csm voting yes to it so it can be voted on by the csm counts i am unsure about if that is allowed then that rule should be changed otherwise it would be an autocsmvote on anything a csm member feels likesourcethe csmon a related note i dare not attempt to copy and paste the raw log of the minutes of the last meeting even only the discussion of this topic and how it came to be a 4 to 3 vote i encourage everyone to please read it specifically the term limits section towards the end it is interesting to say the leastsourcecsm meeting minutesi guess my question is did the csm represent society interests on this topic as per their job as described by pUFFFDtur jUFFFDhannes UFFFDskarsson of ccp
obviously no they did notaccording to ccp that is
quoting this so its in my post and not editable by mazziliu this should be reposted the next time mazziliu is up for election so people can mazzilius own words on what they are getting with a vote a player opinion consultant for ccp that is paid in free trips to iceland whos level of wrongdoing is not really made any more possible the longer they stay in officeinspiring stuff there
as an aide memoire the following csm reps voted for this proposalmazzilu proposed the topic and took it to the csm with three supports on the thread and naturally supported her own proposalzastrow j voted to support the proposalavalloc voted to support the proposalvuk lau voted to support the proposaleven though he wasnt there for the debate on the proposal i thought that if they couldnt be there for the debate on a vote the next person in line was supposed to take over and vote and if there werent enough people to make a quorum the meeting should have been closed at that pointthe next csm election is coming up
vuk lau avalloc and me wont be running next term im pretty sure zastrows support base will be even bigger when they see this thread and the fact he helped troll the crap out of you 5 or 6 guys i suggest you do what the eveo trolls did with larkonis adam ridgway trassler and write our names all over the place and generally go ape im sure that will help
utterly pathetic
qfesupport
supported
as a mini who could fly the recon ships but has never bothered to get one because they are useless i support this proposal
 incorporate market mechanics allowing market settlements at multiple price levels for one order and market exchanges to only be made within the current spreadnah if theres a mismatch in prices the benefit should go to the person who posted the order
there might be a need for a qualifier or two on this proposal in case something ndaworthy ever does come up in a csm meeting but i certainly support the principle of it
yeah everything ndaworthy is striken from the logs anyways and that is already mentioned like the one time i accidentally pasted a password into the chat ended up getting removed or like when we go off topic and agree to remove the part entirely those bits never make it to the public in the end anyways but everything else its really not worth keeping secret since its nothing but discussion between playersstuff like the results of a vote right after it happens we should be able to give it to people in real time it generates more interest in what the csm is doing and puts less pressure on the secretary to get the minutes out on time and generated less rage when the secretary inevitably does not get it done right on timehonestly our secretary does a better job then i would thats a lot of work for a fakejob
sounds good in theory but in this game so much is tied to ones name whether or not that shows up in some sort of history is irrelevant
yes but incarna is still some way out in the future so the csm has good time explaining to ccp the importance of having a cool name when roleplaying
not supported
why would your choice of name change just because you can walk around instead of flying aroundunless you can present some kind of pressing reason why this is even necessary much less desirable im gonna say no
for some roleplaying is important
if it was that important to them they shouldnt have facerolled across the keyboard when they created their character
this tbh
ive been testing t3 cruisers for a while at the sisi and flew them much less at tq very nice ships overhelming most of t1t2 and extremely expensive thats why i do not fly them a lot at tqreally i cant imagine a person who can easily afford the loss of 15 billion isks shipi think this is the time to make some changes to the t3materials price or invent some smallerother class t3ships that will not be made of goldmay be the solution hide in inventing some spacecraft enchancements that will apply some characteristics to the ordinary ships occupying their rigslots something like xx reduction in projectile turret powergrid needs per level and we could see the thrasher fitted with 720mm arties that will surprise someone a lot 5 to all shield resistances per level 20 of stasis webifier range per level etc i am speaking about all the bonuses of t2 ships implemented in separate upgrade modules applied to the t1 ships i dont think this is a brilliant idea and whilst im not a professional in game design i cant predict all consequences of it implementation but i beleive this is an actual subject to discuss
eve is not all about combat you know there is mining industry trading transport and other professions not everyone plays the game for the pewpewyes it can be boring out in the mining belts watching the roids pop seeing the occasional rat impale itself on your swarm of defensive drones so  what do we do to pass the time chat with other minerswe share stories of real life and of eve where to find good belts what corps and alliances to be wary of who can flips and who is a member of the hulk jihad now and then we fleet other miners to get the mining bonuses they are not corp mates just other fellow capsuleers out at the coal facehelpful folk get tagged blue can flippers orange and gankers redthis is where relationships start flagging people with positive or negative standings at an individual corp or alliance level is where you start the process of reviewing someone for an invitation to your corp or allianceof course it can work against you too if i get can flipped by one player good chance ill flag their whole corp orange so dont expect me to help when one of their newer miners in a retriever is under attack by rats and is pinned against roids with shield failing fast sure i could launch my t2 drones and deal with it  but  your corp is no friend of mine and well id have to recall my mining dronesif only you your corp or your alliance had a positive standing id launch combat drones start remote repping call in help from pvp corpies fleet you for mining bonuses and offer to help you haul orestandings mark the foundation of relationships and are the seeds of corporations and alliances they are a very useful tool and core to the goal of people moving away from solo play and towards team playany call to be rid of the standings system and to limit flagging in general sounds simply like a ploy for a pirate based player to hide their poor standings or negative security level
i couldnt have said it better myself my corp also marks red anyone we see admitting to on the forums or in local or actively scamming  just to help protect our members from themand here you people thought i was reading crime and punishment for the fun of it
wouldnt work people are used to forming blocs now this behaviour would not change because the ability to set people to bluered ig has been removedinstead you would end up with groups making web apps to manage their standings every time you see a target you would have to look for their name  corp  alliance in your blocs fof tracker it would end in frustration for everybody involved i dont disagree with your sentiments and i dont necessarily think what i describe above is a good thing but that would be the prevalent solution to a standings nerf that is not fun
so in other words you just want to make fleet fights harder to manage thats idiotic the standings system is if anything too simple dont simplify it further for the sole purpose of making life harder if your ship can see a pilots name and corp ticker it can check that against a standings list
ive been playing this game for just over a month i have just over 2m sp so id say im still a noobmy two centscent 1 the first thing i want to say is leave the learning skills alone they are fine and reward a long term investment in your charactercent 2 they dont take anything away from the game they add choice and difficulty do i want to run combat lvl 2 missions and train cruiser and beyond or do i first want to set myself up to be stronger in the long term with learning skills this is the fundamental choice of life do i spend my money on a new car now or do i invest it and make more money to buy a better car later the world if full of both types of peopleim just saying this is the best mmorpg ive ever played its very well thought out and very complex thats why i like it
i too would like to see some love given to lowsec i get tired of one side saying lowsec is bad because its full of pirates well it would be really wouldnt it and the other saying lowsec needs gateguns removed blah blah blahwhat it needs is some sort of boost it is supposed to be the dark underworld of eve maybe have some low powered faction police there that are bribable to look the other way a seperate black market that is lowsec only make drug production available possibly the implant trade something to warrant the fact it harbours the criminal underworld of evei like the idea of teh viceroy thing but maybe it should be more of a criminal thing like the head of a holding alliance would be like a mafia boss this kind of thing mhow the holding alliance would become the godfather type would be a problem but worth looking into
make lowsec fluctuate make that dependent on the average security status of the players in the systemone day its 04 the next it could be 01 or maybe 05good guys can gain a foothold and those who do so intentionally might manage to put up poss in the meantime or reap the resources or the bad guys can move in and drop the status down gankers and jan bradys in charge one day missionbears and noncombatant corporations the next would make things interesting
lolcarebearit hasnt occurred to the trolls that im the one flying a cloaky currently being carebeared by cloaky invulnurabilityare cynojammers carebear pos shieldsgunsback under the bridge with you
yesto an extent yesas ive stated before if one individual afk in a cloaked ship is enough to prevent you and your corporationalliancenaptrain from conducting operations in your system then you really should go back to hisec
ah i see the assumption is that i want ccp to fix some meanie tactic that is threatening to meproject muchthe proposal is purely for more interesting cloaky play not to nerf anything for my benefit aloneenough said
no waynot supported
this if you cant defend yourself or your alliance defend you what are you doing in lawless space
sometimes i think they should rename this forum crybaby hallnot supported cloaked ships cannot do anything but cloak and watch you want everything handed to you in easy mode why not go full retrd and ask for concord in 00
ok well ive apparently touched upon the sacred cow of dont tread on my cloakinessso ill let this diebut i will have it known that the idea occurred to me while bopping around in enemy space in a stealth bomber not as a defend me ccpbut as a wouldnt it be interesting if moment
oh ffs not more anticloaker if you want to carebear in 00 just do it just have friends nextdoor ready to come save you its pretty effectiveim a massive carebear dont be a poossy admit when you are a carebear just try to also point out that carebears can pvp alsojammers u betcha posshields u betcha guns not so muchseriously the new sov system is designed to give pvpers or at least the fcsalliance leaders who make isk to get protection forces out there cloakers are meaningless if you have friends nearby who are going to protect you
this is a terrible idea an no i dont have a guardianbasilisk alt that follows me everywhere twiddles thumbs
theres absolutely no difference between a rep alt thats neutral and a rep alt thats at war with youin both cases when it reps you can shoot ityou suggestion would result in you being able to shoot it even when its not repping but its a rep alt so when its not repping its docked or logged offeven if the alt also has some other purpose  role like an l4 iskmaking alt for example its very easy for him to avoid enemy combat pilots insta undocks and eyes on scanner for probestldr theres no situation in which you will kill a rep alt when its not actually repping during a fight even if you do have kill rights on it because its at war with you
it doesnt change much of the mechanics it just lengthen the aggression periods for the repper everytime he enters the fight
actually you can shoot a rep alt that isnt repping when its at war with you and these non actively repping but not aggressed alts are one of the most annoying things in empire wars fairly common despite your beliefs
now that we kind of see more or less what wormspace is roughly i think the construction of outposts should be allowed the thing is no sov in wormspace so the system has to be tweaked since no sov no sov should be required furthermore due to that change on how outposts work also with the double reinforced outpost changes in dominion they should be pretty much siegable at all times also no restricting who can dock or anything of the sort all the outpost controls more or less go away no docking fees no taxes or anythingtrue homesteading in a system that will be fairly difficult to manage
no wh space shouldnt turn into kspace 00it should be harder to live in it

lets try to get all these api suggestions in before say october 15th try to keep them short and to the pointone problem ive come across myself is with the membertracking csv output the newline characters in peoples titles arent properly escaped within the csv file so using php functions like getcsv are broken when people have titles with newline characters you pretty much have to use the xml output because the workaround to be able to use the csv output properly uses some pretty complicated regular expressionslets try to stick with simple easily implemented api suggestions that will give the greatest returns i dont have a lot of time left in the csm term to do very much followupanother suggestion made by a corpmate
api method for listing blueprints pleaseat the moment listing youryour corp assets will only tell you what blueprints you have in the hangar  ie you have a thorax blueprint it does not indicate whether or not this is a copy the me level or the pe levelcurrently you can only get that info from the industry jobs method the information here can be stale and requires the bp to have passed through one of your labproduction slots at some point in time even if you were to sort that cluster out and turn it in to your bp master list it could potentially be missing bps not a good solutiontldr give me the sis corp blueprints tab via the api
id like to see rather then an interdiction nullifier a sentry targeting disrupter this would allow frigates to engage on gates in lowsec without the fear of being two volleyed by the solo pvp deterrents called sentry guns this would allow pirates to engage people on gates with ships smaller then battle cruisers it would lead to light quick ganges of t3 frigs roaming bringing more action to lowsec this is also an advantage that nothing other then a super advanced t3 frigate has or should getso ccp i beg you please let me enjoy frigate pirating on gates even if i must pay 100m for a t3 frigate the ability to engage on gates would be worth it what does the community think
it seems too powerful id prefer changes to sentry mechanics to make frigs survivablethough not invincible not a magic t3 subsystem to do it
i think that would be pointless except maybe the opposite the focused point you get immunity from you still get pointed and bubbles still mess you up so for highsec and lowsec where no bubbles exist it brings value to warpcore stabs again perhaps even putting a bonus there to reverse the warpcore penalties gallente t3 frig could get also subsystems which are designed to use sentry drones perhaps a massive tracking bonus for like 2 sentries so the sentries become like antifrig or cruisersimilarly the other races can get mediumlarge weapon fitting bonuses to do so also perhaps we can restore the old stealth bombers with cruise on the caldari t3 friganother t3 frig setup could be a crazy tanker designed to be able to easily active tank lowsec gate guns yet not being quite as good as perhaps a hictor with frig kind of dps giving pirates small ships in lowsecalso where in the world is the 5th level of t3 subs
ok you say theres no pos nerfing ok explain me thisi find a class 2 wormhole when i enter there are 20 signals if you dont thouch a signal it lives 4 or 5 days they cant acumulate the evelopedia say thisi install a pos in the next dt i dont touch any signal there are only 3 signalstsk coincidence i suppose but 1 moth later we still havent touched any signal and i still have 3 signals o 4 maxium this is my experiment and you say no nerfing can you explain me it
someone else came into the system at another time and ran the sites 
that many other mmos have already implemented in the form of a mature language filterits not a very intensive process its rather commonplace
because the last topics on the agenda were discussed at fanfest and i was waiting for documents from ccp to finish them i now have them received in my mailbox
so does that mean theyll be published once youve written them up or do they have to go back to ccp to be filed in the nearest convenient black hole first
its still totally crap and also thats not the point i asked if csm raised this issue with ccp or notgo back the wormhole space
as has been mentioned in countless other threads we were very vocal about it at the csm summit i cant speak about fanfest welp however from what was explained to us the changes were for good reason and not to shaft anyone in particular as one of the old school scanner pros i especially hate the change and still argued against itbut as people of your ilk so often decree the csm has no power unless theres something you as an individual want changing then it absolutely must have power over ccp policy and game design
csm 3 meeting 9  sunday october 18th 1600the ninth issues meeting of the third csm issue submission deadline is october 17th 1600agenda1 scan timer dv  mazz2 csm information release mazz3 scan angle buttons dv4 character lock no resale possible mazz5 redesign sb and eccm effects dv6
ive already made a wiki page about the scanner we could use that and make the changes you want or you could make one yourself send me a convo or something and we can work on it
i dont know exactly how much the rest of the delegates during my term put in but ccp asked me for how i would envision the new sovereignty system working and i compiled a document listing my views and their application how much of this actually made it into dominion i have yet to see but it does appear that they weighed my suggestions along with other sourcesthey specifically mentioned that we were just one gear in the machine they sorted through ideas from the csm the forums and their own dev think tank to come up with the new system im eager to see what the new system is like and how null security will change because of it
sweet solutions m8
sounds sensible in fact i like the idea of a timer being userdefinedtheres plenty of players who dont want the terminate  sell functionality
small bump
the reason this isnt done is probably because of the same reason we dont have different icons for bpos and bpcs takes too much resourcesi would still love to see it and while doing it add meta 14 tags as well
nah this is different the client has all of the data available and doesnt need to make a query to the server to get a bpobpc status of an item

i think its time to break out the man eating furriers
i think you misunderstood my point was to stay involved here on the forum and keep it constructive if each person who ever signed this drops by once a week and catches up tweaks a few concepts and makes a constructive suggestion it will stay on top it will be reflected by the huge amount of posts to the thread and ccp will feel the pressure to reexamine the conceptpersonaly i applaud your efforts and the efforts of all that have contributed to the concept topic as well as those who have tried to refine it to a acceptable proposalmy comments regarding knocking csms campaining in the thread for a csm job or irrelavant and useless commentary was in no way pointed at you i am simply trying to drive home the point thatif the csm who origionaly pitched the idea dropped the ball and didnt drive the concept home properly didnt follow up didnt make proper notes then lets not associate that persons shortcomings with the whole csm project or people currently doing the job support those doing their best and if anything assist themany proposal submitted in albeit rl or in this game should be tweaked and brainstormed i think most of that has been doneformated in a way that highlights the advantages of the change the downside if any and how to minimize that downside making implementation smoother and transition to the new system as as painless as possiblethen document the support and if need be call for every pilot who wants to see this implemented to submit a petition or direct mail the development team a cut and paste support statement and request for change could be posted and easily pasted to the petition box and sent in a matter of minutes the real issue here is to be heard and stressed that as a paying customer you we feel the matter was not properly addressed and the community wants it to be looked at a second timepetitioning is a valid and constructive means to getting those that represent you to listen the trick is when they do then its essential you have it properly formulated and laid out in easy to understand concept implementation and supporti have no desire to be a csm or representative as i stated its a thankless whipping boy position however that said i would volunteer to spend the time on this idea if the current csm you or anyone with a ear to ccp will run with it i as i am sure many would sit down and write a serious proposalif those supporting this can put aside childish remarks knocking csms for doing their best and contribute by editing the proposal with constructive and workable ideas a finished product could be presented and then a mass petition organised filed or mailed to show the overwhelming support that this concept has
from the 09 keynotethis mindset needs to be applied to poss current implementation this idea fundamentally improves the game experience instead of anchoring a blob of mods it changes to building a starbase also i find it funny that had ccp actually investigated this idea when it was first posted instead of saying too tough not going to try they might have even found the ferrogel pos exploit
ill bite good job compiling the well received issuessuggestions

1 it isnt your salvage2 the loot inside the wreck is yours3 my basic assumption is ccp didnt want you cluttering up the system any more so they put can of loot inside the wreck instead of spawning 2 things every time something dies therefore the wreck obeys all the standard aggro mechanics 4 salvage comes from things other than missions4a the wreck from a ship loss belongs to the corp that lost the ship4b those wrecks shouldnt be yours4c they should belong to the npc corp you just shot4d this is actually broken the loot shouldnt even belong to you4e every time you loot from a wreck you should get a flag from an npc corp and absolutly no wrecks other than wrecks from your own corp should be lootable without a flag5 in conclusion the mission runner should get concorded for performing any aggresive action to mission loothow is that for an easy summary why your conclusions are wrong the only reason you can perform agressive actions to wrecks is because back in the day to many people got concorded for using a smartbomb when you could smartbomb wrecks you are basically making a tweak to game mechanics to keep you from blowing yourself up for doing something stupid as the crux of your argument
wrong againdear ninja looters you killed those rats  no you can salvage without kills  no you need someone who make kills or you cant salvaging you can scanning out the abandoned wrecks  no you scanning ships who make the missionninja lootersparasites
easy to prove it how you do not have truthjust the killers can tractor beaming the wrecks the others not
guys can you help pleaseim trying to get this dead horse into this thread here but its really heavy i cant manage it by myself
oh god why is this thread still going its already been resolved salvaging is not theft the devs have already said so please just let this asinine thread die
sure
ideally id love to see this as an option extendable to all characters sometimes im not as interested in seeing what an avatar looks like as i am in seeing what corp andor alliance theyre in and i hate filling my cache with images of goofy neutrals im never going to see again just because i wanted to check what corpalliance theyre inedit apparently the support option unchecked itself
makes sense to me supported
i was just thinking the exact same thing i use a mobile internet connection where i pay per mb and that is why i like eve  it is generally low bandwidthhaving thosse tiny icons load in that list serves no positive purpose really and goes against one of the major advantages for evesupported
yesagent avatars did not use to be there and standings worked much more smoothly i have absolutely no idea why ccp introduced them
yes please
good idea for this reason alone
save your rage for fall of 2010 when i will run
id say let incumbents come back after they take a term break
to date most of the people you have insulted or looked down upon mazzilliu have been informative in their messages with the exception of drake draconis who doesnt seem to read or interpret english correctly you wont have my support if you ever try for a position such as a judge ddagain the people on csm who voted for an extension of the term limits are with no surprise the people about to get the boot in many newly formed democratic nations it is common to see this its only natural  people are power hungry and like to suppress their fellow manon the issue of your position as a csm representative regardless of what you want to call yourself mazzilliu a consultant is commonly experienced and professionally educated in the field that they are consulting on furthermore they are impartial to the issue they are consulting so far it just seems like youve breached both those requirements am i wrongthis can only conclude that you must be a politician in which case your duty is firstly to the people who elected you to your office and secondly the greater player base of eve online of course this is contradictory to the rules of the csm however those rules are in conflict of being reelected i cant see any reason we would want to give you more power you clearly cant handle your present dutieson the case of the cost only 10 8 and 9 voted in years 12 and 3 respectively these statistics dont indicate that its getting better and most likely that only a small section of players know about csm these are in a sense hidden costs because most of the players dont know they are paying for them in their subscription that said a permanent consultant would be better as they would atleast take the suggestions made in petitions and what not seriously for once instead of brushing them aside
mazz your performance at the fanfest csmpanel was impressive after arriving late the only thing you contributed with was thanks for voting so i got a free trip to fanfesti can see why you are aiming for the fall 2010 term next
i was really divided on this issue cause its not pure blackwhite decisions looking for my perspective csm 6 month term is actualy extremely short and the most unthankfull thing with csm is that fruit of your csm office will be visible in best case for the duration of next office and as we saw you can wait even for 23 more terms continuity of csm is also tricky cause basicly its all up to dedicationwillingness of the delegates who are continuing their terms to pass the procedures and help the new candidates as much as i can only express huge thanks to ccp for idea of csm both as regular player and csm candidate i still think there is a lot of place for improvements in tools csm shiould have for better work and for better continuity but anyway back to the topici initially voted yes for ccp to generally reconsider 2 term limit of csm candidates but then again as much some currentpast csm delegates should have been allowed to be in csm for as long as they are getting enough votes then sadly there is more people who shouldnt be allowed nowhere near csm at the end i know there is no perfect system cause if we look our politicians its the same  as huge percent of them should be publicly crucified but instead of that they are leading our countries thanks to voterswhat is something that extremely annoys me is the people running for csm for the free trip 6 months of free gameplay trip to fanfest etc i know i would run for csm even if there is no trip to iceland at all and when i was running 1st time we didnt even knew we will get free time at the end i have faith in ccp that they will make good decision about this matter
i speak and unederstand english just fine how ironic that the one who thinks i dont agrees with me regardless even if he didnt mean tovuk  i find your insight quite disturbing in all honesty the only reason i would run for csm is to make sure that people got heard thats it and even then im not convinced its worth my timethe trip in all honesty while great and all that doesnt really interest meid rather be playing eve  o paside from meeting ccp face to face but stillim not into the drinking and partying bit but thats just me
i never thought on you when i said that but i want to throw up when people are openly talking about that during campaign get elected facepalm and then still have decency to talk around how they applied to csm just for kicks free trip
i think youll be pleased to know that right after that i went back to taking a nap and nursing my hangover i really would like to know who hasnt taken their fakejob seriously on the 3rd csm seems like everybody at least contributed something even i did it seems like the ccp guys have a general idea of who has pulled their weight and who hasnt so i am pretty sure the ccp veto of anyone over 2 terms should be pretty effective for keeping away people that dont deserve it the metrics for performance are pretty simple the number of issues and the significance of the issues raised
welp in the end each person on the csm was voted for by playersif the players vote for the village idiot and then are up in arms because that persons decisions are stupid then all i have to say iswhat did you think was going to happenterm limits are a double edged sword you restrict the time you get with the good ones and restrict the time you get with the bad ones all the events that have unfolded in these last several months reflect that having a two term limit is a good thing
this if nothing else convinces me that there should be no change to term limits csm should not be a recurring free holiday for powerblock idols prepared to put pictures of themselves on the internetthe term limit keeps things honest and it challenges the community of eve to keep finding new representatives to serve their time on the csm and then go back to the player base and enjoy the gamethis thread was quite illadvised and the discussion of this extremely unpopular issue cannot be other than a waste of csm and ccp time
can u elaborate please

hey back when ships had 25 less ehp then a 1 minute aggro timer to redockjump wasnt completely retarded but now that every single ship with a trimark or two on it takes at least 2 minutes to die then 1 minute aggro is dumb as shitpersonally id like a 15min timer on aggro for docking since this would even make it possible to kill nerds who camp undocks in capitals but whatever change it so i at least have a chance at killing a trimarked abaddon with less than 5 ships and ill be happythanks
woah radical awesome idea bro totally supporting this
15 minutes is maybe a bit extreme personally i would also like aggro to follow you through gates but we
hey thanks man your support means a lot to me
supporting this least 5min on station docking if youre gonna change gates max 2min changing it for gates has its bad sides too just dont mess with the redock timer when not agressing
frigate 60secscruiser 90secsbs 120secscapital 240secs
yeah not sure if it makes sense to change gate timers too much since its possible to have tackler on the other side of the gate but station hugging is just all around gay
something like this would be great
i second this a much better idea than a fixed timer especially for cap ships which can take alot of damage before dying
nobody has suggested fleet target and fleet fire i think youre trying to make mountains out of molehillswere just talking about an align option for the fc and an align option to bookmarks that is all
supportedthose who are against it are showing dissent only because its getting so much support in other words get out you are the minority
sorry but no an fc is a commander not a controller why not added fleet target and fleet engage while were at it
because those dont make sense dimwit
if you cant convince your fleet they should be aligning then you shouldnt be fcing or your fleet should be playing attentionall im saying moving a fleet should be an exercise is fleet command i think commanding a fleet takes a certain amount of skill and making sure you can get your fleet to stfu and pay attention is part of that
fcs have enough to do without worrying about idiots lagging behind because they failed to align as commanded this feature would take one less worry off the fcs shoulders of course there will always be morons who  around with their ships and get out of alignment or otherwise dont follow orders for that we need a kick from fleet and pod right back to their clone but i digress supported
there is a kick people out of fleet and send them back home to a pod option its called making them primaryhonestly though supported you armchair fcs can sit there and say oh fcs shouldnt be able to control the entire fleet or why not just give fcs the fleet target and fleet fire option but when you get right down to it having a a fleet align option can save your pilots ships when they need that splitsecond to avoid a doomsday or a bomb
nah if theres a mismatch in prices the benefit should go to the person who posted the order on market not the one who did it instantlythere should be no benefits to standing order posters nor to those filling the orders if i want an order filled instantaneously at best buy or sell orders posted 1 order should be enough and able to fill this order at multiple price levels that people are willing to sellbuy it for having to enter each order individually is cumbersome and far from a well designed market mechanic who cares if someone wants to do this to manipulate the averages and pay 1 on their fake trades to do it more power to them rl stock markets are trying to be fair eve stock markets are trying to be amusing and rl stock markets dont charge fees by the individual tradebrokers do but the market doesnt so theres actually a bigger disincentive to this in game than in rlactually its a big flaw and the percentage sure is an disincentive another would be to ban trading with yourself there would be no harm in incorporating such a counter measure im not sure where you get eve markets trying to be amusing the market is there to ensure low exchange costs transparency  good information not to be entertaining eve sure has other features to handle that even if it wore entertaining i rather have it make economic sense then randomly designed care to elaborate on and rl stock markets dont charge fees by the individual tradebrokers do but the market doesnt so theres actually a bigger disincentive to this in game than in rlindeed its the brokers charging the fees such independent market brokers are absent in eve such fees are thus injected by the market mechanics who charges the fees has no impact on the incentives of economic agents those broker fees are more properly listing fees you want an order to be posted publicly on market you pay a fee you want to just fill an order you pay no fee the cost is for advertising not for tradinglisting an order and filling an existing standing order on the market has the same basic mechanics behind it looking for an exchange the only real difference is the price askedoffered there is no advertisement involved you compete solely with your price the price is your advertisement and there should be no penalty for askingoffering for a higherlower price for a good working market there should be little to no barriers to trade inconsistent broker fees are exactly the opposite within some price intervals forcing sellers  buyers to accept posted prices if your price is to highlow youre likely to be underover bid and you have enough competitive incentives to change your price
the only market change ill support is allowing all items to be tradedyour changesno waynot supported
what 01 isk buyorders are badhow is that a problemhow is thatsure ranging from 01 isk to 10billionshould but usually doesnt the whole trade of traders who go around making isk by those who are selling their goods below the price of buy orders elsewhere is goodya and thats why theres no such thing as wallstreet oh wait its called wallstreetcostly mistakes in my eve nevaralso market manipulation bahahahaa i so wish i had the kind of isk it takes to do that if someone has the isk to do it i hope they doso they are avoiding the fees by having the other person pay them ok sounds good to me
simply there would be no avatar pictures the size of the person in localchatfleet would be like 13 the height and no picture it would show everything else like the name and related icon like a skullbluered for standings and stuffthis would be less load time i assume so im no programmer and would allow to see more intel without having to scroll as muchsound goodedit also there would be an option to go to classic avatar mode
yeah there is currently too much advantage for guys like you that hide towards the bottom end of local meanwhile most of us ae guys show up in local instantly without people having to scroll
so you giving support if so pls give thumbs up
leave it as it is i say and having an s name has nothing to do with me not supporting it
it wasnt important 6 years ago but it might be important now
i am sure there was also role playing 6years ago
that is true and completely out of topic
not really your reasoning for the name change is you need new names because of role playing but role playing was already there when the picked their name so nothing changed no need to change names
people change everything change thats the way of nature
i propose that the current system of security ratings be changed so that in low sec you can only read a characters security rating when they are on your overview or in the case of a 10 flashing red consider piracy at sea how can someone spot a pirate ship a 1000 miles away it is only obvious that some other ship may be pirating when they start shooting or ignoring radio communications to keep their distance solo 10s currently have too hard a time as people read their sec rating and dock up or leave the system
indeed or perhaps extend it so that you can never see the security rating on a players info but only the colourtag on the overview tht way when someone is on grid theyll appear yellow or red if their sec is low but otherwise all players appear equal unless you know otherwise
tissuesnot supported
cry more thats what you get for going 10since were looking at this from an rp point of view local is not dependent upon onboard sensors  or else local would exist in whs instead it is provided by the stargates and supporting infrastructure and notification of recent criminal activity and longterm security status is a feature of that systemstrongly unsupported
ahem to the above trolls im not 10 i was starting a debate on what could be done to make the game more fun for many solo players prob doesnt concern you
im really not clear how this would buff low sec solo piracy it would seem to be more likely to result in people being more paranoid than ever in a better safe than sorry kind of way
here is why this wont work1 players stay out of low sec because once they jump into a low sec system they are blobbed by 10 pirates2 once player is blobbed they either dont have the isk for a new ship or learn from their mistakes and dont enter lowsec3 player never returns to lowsec meaning less targets for you even if you ransom the player any kind of ransom will usually make whatever their doing no longer be cost effective meaning once they leave low sec theyll never return if all level 4 missions were moved to low sec only players would just stay doing level 3 missions within 23 level 4 missions done in low sec theyd get their mission battleship popped not very profitableuntil there is something to do in low sec that is absolutely massively profitable that so many players go into low sec low sec will be empty its not profitable
so im a troll because i disagree with you and use logic to support my pointi didnt realize that eve forums were slashdot
how about remove keys all together eve isnt for dungeons
in my experience the keys are not so much a problem as static complexes areit doesnt make any sense either why would the angel syndicate put a drug trade post anywhere where it gets raided each and every day every hourremove static complexes entirely and most of the key issue is gone
go further  kill statics and make exploration a little bit more profitable make deds have a bit better drops or even a few more of them within new edenabsolutely agree static plexs need to go
a t2 fittedt1 rigged t3 cruiser costs you about 700m atm depending on your raceyour suggested ship changes would make it too overpoweredthat said  not supported

too overpowered really
well if you go look at ammo you can find faction ammo go look at scan probes you can find faction probes why is that well the items value is so low per unit contracts would become extremely frustratingso how about adding all the cheap mods to the market price out centii atype thermic plating its worth like 1mil how many dont even get sold i suggest putting them on the market much easier that waythe same thing can be said for even the expensive faction mods raven navy issue why not list it under ships  battleships  caldari not much else is there on the list not like you are necessarily spamming market with itwhere to draw the line im not sure exactly should we have a new category ships  battleships  blood raiders then have only 1 listed should the category just become pirate or something or just leave those outhow about officer modules should they stay on contractshow about uniqueish things interbus shuttle guardian vexor pretty sure they shouldnt be on there
supported
how about this  the market is for buying and selling stuff not stuff as long as its common enough just stuff all stuff
yeah but the option to sell them on contracts should still be there i dont see any reason why stuff shouldnt be available on the market unless it was contraband funny thing is you can sell contraband on the marketsupport for what hersch said
all items should be on the market
im not so sure how its hard to manage if things were to stay exactly the same with these changes sure it would i anticipate that things would change dramatically politically it creates a newer political landscape it revives the role of corp within alliance rather than alliance within a block i have trouble believing with these changes you would see the political landscape stay the same do you realize that when alliances first came out before standings were introduced and log before ccp had the player population it does today alliances were similar or the same in size shouldnt they naturally grow larger as the game grows largerinstead because of the blue mechanics blocks have been the path to growing size most of the major alliances have migrated to much fewer much larger corps essentially reducing the political mess that is large corp management schemes making alliances virtually 1 voice sure corps still do their own thing but not like eves past if people make war hard theyre doing it for 2 reasons with these changes lack of organization and lack of communication right now the extent of communication with other entities is as complex as were at p5 fighting warp in and shoot the reds even with the largest of battles with multiple fleets its very simply a matter of getting friendlies on grid then they shoot whatever the only time it becomes more complex is when you have to focus fire on a very strong rr group usually carriers and all that requires is coordinated fire this would push warfare to a new and more engaging scheme it would require planning when and where other alliances will come to the field it will require more understanding and identification than the simple point and shoot non blue philosophy read the forums and typically youll find the most fun battle reports are 3 way engagements where it becomes a very awkward question of who to shoot and when it creates tactic political interest and a much more significant role for corp and alliance structures rather than blue structuresright now the question is are you willing to blue someone it becomes a much harder question if you have to let them into your alliance to get the benefits of standingsfor those in empire who set red standings to thieves and gankers thats an issue with game mechanics and the harsh reality of what eve offers a red list dumbs down the game the point is to have risk and reward a red list removes way to much risk can gankers rr out of corp and all those ty tactics are mechanical issues they have nothing to do with a red list problem
first off anyone who supports this needs to just stop crying this what i saw as the benefits to the learning skills which take whata month to get everything to 4 which drops everything else from 16 days to 8 days or whatever with implants1it lowers your training time you dont want to train it then dont2while your training it you can get aquianted with the game more reading the market about other skills and other things you might want to get into why does everyone assume that everyone knows exactly what they want to train from day 1 im a 06 toon and i still have trouble what i want to train next when a long skill is coming to a close its not a time sink its a time buffer you are gaining something while basically putting the game on pause take the time to ask your corpmates questions look at the different items in the market read the description on all the different skills you can traini actually have 55 training time i put in a lot of time for that i chose to do it and im satisfied new players complain about everything i dont want to lose my stuff i want to be completely 100 safe wherever i go i want to pvp when i want to not when someone shoots me yet you pick this topic because you dont want to train the skills because your lazy train it or dont nobody is forcing you thats my rant
ok problem is those who have spent months training all to max suddenly get hurt those who plan to train soon could be hurt those who havent trained at all are being hurt newbs who want to know what to train are told learning skills even if thats a good idea for an alt its not for new playersthats more or less the problem in a nutshell remove them so what i spent months of my training to get them all to lvl 5 suddenly im just plain old losing them thats like just randomly taking hac recon carriers and 2 other skills at random you think maybe thats a bad thing time and effort people put inreimburse them so i trained them all to 5 now you reimburse meaning char upgrade so just for having the opportunity to have in the past trained it i get to keep it while those others who in the future were planning to do the training get railedor reimbursed as in skill training time applied to skills at random or by choice no thx rather have learning skills and be able to train fasterchange them to whatall these suggestions though would royally  me off after all the nerfs ingame it has been very very rare for them to take something from the players directly just look at the highsec capships quite the threadnaught came from that onelearning skills arent a problem really best way to fix newbs is sort of boost that 100 training time thing they get 100 until 15mil sp or something make it 200 so long as they havent trained learning skills or something if they try to train learning skills they get warned that they will lose their 200 bonus perhaps even bump it down to 100 if they do they can even make it  15mil sp that they should go do the tutorial on skill training or something which  15mil sp to 2mil or 25mil that they should train their learning skills so from 15milwhen they lose their skill bonus to lets say 2mil sp by training learning skills then they retain the 100 bonus thenhell if you do that you could even leave the 100 bonus from 0 to 15mil sp it kinda impresses upon them to train learning skills after 15mil sp which is what they are doing during their first month of playing then they train for those better guns and such
no learning skill should stay as it it now
agreed learning skills should go but i would like to get something out of it as the 2mill sp ive put into them represent a huge chunk of my 10mill sp charactera possible solution would be to give double training speed for double the amount of sp that one is loosing that way you get everything reimbursed im not sure if this is technically possible but it sounds to me like the closest it can get
thats a losing argument the game designers have decided that it is in fact broken they just havent figured out a way to change it that doesnt  everybody offdont take my word for it heres soundwave and eris discordia responding to question about the learning skill problem during the new player experience presentation at fanfest earlier this month
i have trained all but one of them to 5 and i would do it again but alas i realize how silly they actually are im aminmax kind of guy but i can totally understand that other people arent i can understand if people are agianst a reimbursement but i wouldnt mind getting something in return if they where removedeither way i support a solution whatever it be
now im not gonna get into any sort of huge elaborite story butheres a few ideas i have for changes the buysell order screen needs to be broken into a skill tree setting just like when your looking to buy items you click on a section engeneering and then other options drop down to choose from if our market buysell orders were set up the same way it would be a lot more helpful instead of having them all in alphabetical order it would help you better manage what your orders are and keep things more organized second would be to give us a greenred percentage on our products we are buyingselling i know there is one when your selling but i wanna see them all the time last it would be very good if we could see what regions our trades were in for example if i place a buy order in verge vender and then i jump to amarr and place a sell order id like to be able to see in my buysell orders what region thse are in thats my 2 pennies i welcome yours
revived and updated yay
this could work lets assume a corporationalliance group a wants to be active in a lowsec system group a will pay rent to the sov holding empire faction they exploit the system to repay their rent and make a decent profit by being active in the system they make it save enough for new agents to settle in migrating agents rpwise the agent couldnt settle down earlier bacause of npc pirate activity in that systemthe agent supplies missions 30 in current system 70 12 jumps out in another lowsec system with the agents the lowsec system will be able to nurture more players making it a safer system to be active as a playerbecause the system keeps its original security rating rivalling corporationsalliances group b will be able to raid the system without npc intervention except when at a gatestation or sec rating loss for a playerthis way pirate corps or players can have their share of small fleet pvp while carebears are able to improve their profits to make this work titans and super carriers moms should be restricted to 00 space give alliances the time to prepare for 00 by building up assets50 of all station profits should be given to group a since they are providing security for neutrals in the system neutrals in lowsec can be like renters in 00
with teh introduction of saving and trading fittings why not allow us to buy and sell fittingsi thought of this as i was workign on fitting my typhoon last night and couldnt think of a fit for a rr gang so i thought wouldnt it be conbvienint if i could go to the market and buy a typhoon fitting perhaps sell them in packages you get the fitting as well as all the modsit could use some refinement but i think it would have benefit to eve
sadly no unless it came with some kind of rating option so that people could rate the fittings after they bought them theres too much room for abuse where people make crap fittings or joke fittings and put them up on the market or on contract as l33t fittings scamming poor suckers into buying the crap plus the price would drop to a few thousand isk instantly as theres no limit to how many copies of the fit could be made and in reality everyone and their dog can make the same fitting and put it up online turning it into a useless endeavor overall
simple allow us to input and save orbit preferences and keep at range preferences allow us to type in say we want our ship to orbit at 50km or 4km because that where our optimal is its a simple enough request not asking for uber god mode modules or i win buttons just asking for the ability to set my orbithelps missioners so they can orbit with long range weaponshelps pvprs so they can orbit with medium to close range weapons
you can already do that
try right clicking the orbitkeep at range buttons
they only give you a few options for keep at range its 50m 100m or 500m when will i ever need to be 50m from something for orbit the max you get is 30km what if my guns optimal is 40km what do i do all im asking is ccp allows us to imput our orbit ranges maybe in station you can type in your default orbit to be whatever you choose so when you undock you still get the same options but also you have the ability to set orbit at your optimal
on the selected items window you got an orbit and keepatrange button right click on those
uber fail on my part absolute complete fail im sorry im a noob self desctructs
how can any new alliance be able to claim a system in 00 space if they are all takini lloked on the map and all the systems were in sov except a few by the jove empireso what now
in b4 flamingtons of sov up for grabsonly a couple sov 3 jammed systems at allsov is wide open lots of places though yes its very static aggression is bad for business so the more friends you have the better it isthe new sov system in dominion will fix all this
how so
how sowhat are they doing exaclti saw fanfest on youtube but i didnt understand the new sov planwhats going to be differntcouldnt the wealthy and powerful corps and alliances just come in and take it all
this forum is not about asking general questionsmaybe try it in the general discussion forum
the point is that in the new system the incentive for alliances will be to compress into smaller spaces and develop their systems rather than sprawling across half the map that paying ccp a sovereignty tax for 100 systems that only get used by one guy every other week is a pointless waste of isk and that without having massive r64 incomes attached to a many million hp space needle empty systems will be much more easily disruptableand yes this is the wrong forum for this thread
how do you get to the systems east of the jove empire
set destination go through gatesof note the 3 jove regions you cant goto well most people cant goto there is legitimate ingame methods of getting to jove space though i dont suggest going nothing has been updated in awhile and everything looks prepremium clientin the off chance youre speaking about cobalt edge or perigon falls refer back to first sentence
this forum is not about asking general questionsmaybe try it in the general discussion forum
i tried to set a destination but something went wrongidk
how do u get to here ua7u4
moved to general discussion
you ask even louder
how do u get to here ua7u4
you have to go here
whats with the major recruitment drive lately
they abused their interns too much who knew theyd die so quickly throwing em in a meatgrinder was just a practical joke
incarna  dust will require a lot of additional staff and the plannedexpected subscriber increase incarna will bring will allow ccp to recruit more peopleif you were smart enough you would also have noticed that dust is nothing more than an alternative marketing plan
when are you going to hire a new office runaround its all im qualified to do 
i know people have asked about larger tractor beams and have been suggest other ships were the bigger sizes etcwhat im wondering is if there was a down side to have a skill or something that makes the tractor faster bad idea ive thought about it as how it could be exploited but you can only tractor your own wrecks and loots anyways so why not just make it fasterthe other thing is that i was wondering if we could suggest since eve is getting somewhat old and pretty stale in animations not that the graphics havent been upgraded which they are and they are very pretty im wondering if they could somehow work on some of the hulls for certain ships or even the color of the exhaust i love the nyx and the megathron abaddon nextactually most amarr ships are pretty i fly gallente so no bias here also the deimos with the green look and the green exhaust make it a very pretty ship to look at some of the ships can be worked on a little complete hull overhaul or something i dont know exactly if this would require a lot of work code wise i dont doubt that some artists out there would like to put a touch to it thoughyay or nay
well the issue is doing this would make lewting easier and thusly more people would do it this devalues lewt and salvage so theres a pretty much double edge there when just looking at those salvaging now calculate the mineral changes due to the extra lewt or even meta 4 stuff mineral changes due to mod reprocessing would hurt miners more meta 4 stuff hurts 00so just by adding this one mod to make lvl 4 runners more convenient it hurts so many others so why would they do that of note the module exists already they only need to publish the item basically they chose not to for those reasonsyou must be new to eve because it has been brutally changed several times now the issue is that they want to keep the minimum requirements low for crappy computer people to keep playing doing any drastic in bring uber quality to eve can have subscriber issues that being said you should check out
there are actually 4 skills for faster tractor beams1 marauder  ships golemkronospaladinvargur2 industrial command ship  ships orca3 capital industrial ship  ships rorqual4 strategic cruiser of your choice with emergent locus analyzer electronics subsystem  ships legionlokiproteustenguhope this helpsand you ship changing suggestion is too unspecificnot supportededit i failed at counting
sorry i was unclear it seems im not saying graphics wise i do understand that eve is a lot prettier then it was in the old days that i realize however no matter how many shining lights you put on  it still is my point about the ship change is that we all have ships we hate looking at and wonder how did they make it mine is the dominix and a few other ships leave the ship basically the same just change the hull design on it thats what im suggest is just a hull change thats all not a huge graphic overhaul to make the image come out of my screen and hit me in the face just that there are some ships that look really bad and some that look really awesome how about changing the ones that look bad into something that looks awesome or at least decent on the eyes scorpion looks ugly too edit you were also right on the velocity increase on the maruaders didnt realize that always thought it was just range lol since all the arguements ive read about salvagers was about range i never had a problem with range just speed apologies
i consider the basilisk nice my corp mate thinks it is the most ugly ship in eve and i think his beloved dominix is just ugly still not supported
theres no pleasing you is there lolthey could make your basilisk look even more awesome and the domi even more awesome change isnt always bad  but if you dont support it thats fine just suggesting
these screenshots demonstrate everything that is right and wrong with eve onlinebefore i explain allow me to make two introductionslogit probit is a scumbag who ninjasalvages other players missions near a highsec mission hub hes a parasite and a griefer on top of that he doesnt honor ransoms he runs an association of similar players who choose not to incorporate mainly because it makes retaliation difficultim a 29yearold phd student at a midwestern american university im married have a doberman puppy love to ride my motorcycle and i help my landlady take out her garbage im a researcher in the areas game theoretics and mass behavior and i love playing eve onlineif you are a missionrunner logit deserves your scorn however give me a chance to convince you that logit is your best friend at the same time hes the biggest pain in your backsideas ccp is well aware eve is great because its a sandbox the lack of constraints on us ingame allow numerous steady states of group behavior to arise in fact there are so many different behavioral equilibria that it is difficult for any one player to experience more than a few of them even within one profession you will see different tactics in different regions even if the strategies are the same mining ops in one area will be organized differently than ops in another area fcs in the north operate a little differently than russian fcsmultiple norms of behavior allow the events to occur that make eve amazingarmageddon singlehandedly destroys a 40man highsec mining fleet with a surprise suicide attacktrusted brokers conscience gets the best of him commandeers stolen unique ship and returns it to the player it was stolen frombank ceo absconds with hundreds of billionslegendary alliance destroyed by espionagein other words eve is great because the unexpected occursthere have been other games like eve sandbox games that were great but were ruined because wellintentioned changes rippled through them destroying behavioral equilibria a classic example was the addition of rare tools into star wars galaxies that could prevent gear from decaying to the point where they were unusable this change was meant to preserve the hard work of some of the games most dedicated players and to encourage rare item use in pvp however the change disrupted the playermade economy demand for highend crafted gear evaporated incentives to hunt for looted crafting components disappeared and swg was soon hemorrhaging 10k subscriptions per month swg had unintentionally constrained the variety of fun behaviors and interactionswhile ccp has maintained minimal constraints on behavior its track record is not perfect for instance the introduction of jump freighters has reduced the number of viable behaviors available to those who enjoy the challenge of longrange heavyvolume commerce soon a comprehensive set of structural constraints will be introduced into 00 while the changes may turn out for the best it is a fact that increased constraints reduce the possible number of behavioral equilibriain other words with more rules the unexpected becomes less soon the 4th csm ill dedicate full effort to exploring the unintended consequences of the big changes that are coming to evelogit probit may be a horrible bastard but ill be on my best behavior and ill do everything i can to preserve that sweet spot in eve where the learning curve is just a little too high and the barrier to making horrible mistakes is just a little too lowtrust me that spot is where we all want to benow get out there and run some missions
you dont have my vote
ill vote for you if you go and gank another csm candidate

things i learned form this thread1 that logit probit is afraid to face the people he es off so he hides in a npc corp very pirateish yarrr and a few 2 nerds in real life tend to be asshats on the interwebs3 even guys with small pps can and do get married i assume you are married to a female if not nothing wrong with it i live in sf it smells of vaseline around here all the time4 that a moped and a motorcycle are the same thing when talking to people that dont know you in real life5 that he really considers or most likely wishes others would himself a scumbag and a horrible bastard6 you have no chance in hell to win so go pet your puppy hop on the moped with you gay lover and put this csm silliness outta your pretty little bald head  kissesmoranda
this thread makes me wish i hadnt already promised my vote to larkonis
but mal you have a lovely alt you keep specifically for all those things you want to do but cant do with you main
thats very true lets see how this turns out
so after your first thread in cp failed you try again herefake editalso those 2 screenshots seem to be the only ones you got
link to geddon thread
you get my vote 
a csm manifesto thats wellwrittenalmost deserves a vote
this is a far better post than your ill thought out attempt to get cp on your sideallowing multiple behavior patterns to evolve and flourish is a worthy goal and keeping eve from becoming a wowstyle themepark mmo should always be encouraged my interest in that game died when blizzard banned players from jumping on rooftops to pvp in neutral towns which had lead to encounters that were far more thrilling than any bg however simply being antirules doesnt lead to the full spectrum of potentially interesting behavior emerging because a certain amount of rules are necessary for complexity to flourish eves economy is primitive  bartering and a simple marketplace system because institutions like the eve bank and any stockbond offering have to store their isk with the directors having access the potential for fraud or theft limits the willingness of the public to do business with them a characters reputation is the only safeguard and thats been proven over and over again to not be an effective deterrent a stronger financial sector could allow banks or investors to finance corp wars so that a smaller alliance would have a chance against a currently dominant one offer different types of insurance have more bond and stock offerings from industrial corps etc a futures market puts and calls would allow far more interesting options for manufacturing and market manipulation contracts could be enforced by allowing the betrayed party to sell or offer the right to a certain number of characters or merc corps to have kill rights on the contract breaker up until the insured value of destroyed ships equals the amount lost mercs could bid on contracts to pod a certain number of players from a target corp etcthere has to be a way to allow the corp theft and betrayals that we all love while still giving some greater security to these sort of interesting interactions id recommend creating a second corp type financial with a different rule set allowing for greater security but also limiting its options so that it couldnt simultaneously be a merc corp for example further complexity would come from things like putting rare types of asteroid needed for planet development only in a few systems in lowsec and moving all ice and dense condensed etc asteroids to the rest of lowsec risk vs reward
actually a radical anticarebear elected to the csm will do less damage than one that presents himself to be more balanced for this reason alone i encourage all the carebear haters and omg im s0 ub3r h4rdcore pvpers to vote for this guy theres nothing like an idiot elected by idiots to represent them
wait a second you call people ultra carebears and gank people pvp pew pew etc etcbut you hide in npc corp where you cant be war deccedi was trying to find a word to describe it so i looked in the dictionary found your picture under hypocrite
thats odd i could have sworn the caption read pragmatic not hypocriteso logit since you so politely invade my sunday brunch and forum browsing i shall ask you a question regarding your plans for your termwhat do you plan on doing to get rid of this silly charade whats that none ok well ill see you later then o
sorry probit but ur just as  as those you prey on if you want any support get out of the npc corp and quit preying on dyslexic pts afflicted carebearsdisclaimer i dont like carebears but hiding in an npc corp to avoid the wrath of said carebears takes the cake imho
i know my ninjasalvaging and carebearkilling isnt going to win me any support amongst the carebear community and my lack of ehonor is going to turn off lowsecpirateswithahintofrp typesim not a pvper im a salvager and not a nice one as far as exposing myself to retaliatory war decs ive been there and done that and it while its all good and fun it prevents us from doing what we like to do ingamethe fact is that anyone who i or my mates have ever destroyed has deserved to lose their shiprule 1 of eve is dont aggress in a ship you arent prepared to losethere are multiple multiple ways to make ninjasalvagers go away warping out shooting wrecks or leaving and getting in an actual pvp ship carebears that shoot salvagers expecting an easy kill or no retaliation are making a mistake and im more than happy to take that to the bank its part of the gameas far as the idea that some of these carebears have something wrong with them and should be left alone you said it i didnt the internet is full of characters and its not my job to prescreen people for emotional problems before i return fire if you dont think someone melting down in local over some pixels is funny well maybe eve isnt the place for youfinally i find the idea that people cant separate their ingame persona from their rl behavior disturbing personally when i see a vehicle wreck in real life i dont run up to it and break off a chunk hoping the owner will then pick a fight with me over it so i can punch him in the face and take his wallet too and i wouldnt do that even if the rules of society allowed for itid like to keep eve fun for everyone not just myself part of that is making sure the implemention of wellmeant changes doesnt ripple throughout the game environment causing unintentional problems ive got lots of experience modeling just those types of problems and i hope that the eve community will give me a chance to contribute what i can it would be the least i can do and perhaps a fitting penance for my parasitical ingame activities
is there a reason why you keep spamming the forums with elect me plox1 threadscouldnt you just start one and stick to it
csm lol
what can i tell ya troll threads attract troll posts
nosce te ipsum
wow that is impressive you know latin but what does that have to do with you crossposting threads on the same topic is it necessaryand a carebear hater whos a carebear himself uttering that phrase is simply ironic
this question will determine who gets my vote are you for or against the stardrive on certain ships t3 mainly
there is something else im finding interesting about this guy he states there that he isi remember reading about some other researcher who actually went as far as creating a paper based on his jerky and griefing behavior in an online game city of heroes or whatever that game wasit appears to me that some of these social sciences researchers take great interest in acting in the most disruptive way they can come up with in the name of their research i guess that is just as good an excuse to being a jerk as any other
pretty sure cp and eveo general are separate audiences at least for the most partalso of course i dont know latin ive just seen the matrix and i meant it as a complement since you indeed seem aware of your natureill be chilling here all day whilst i watch football nice to see culpepper on the field again i always enjoyed watching him when he was throwing to carter and moss even though ive never really been a vikings fananyway matrix skye let me ask what is it about me specifically that attracts you to my threads is it my desire for attention my love of tears the fact that i hide in highsec in a noob corp arrogance hubris a crappy portraitstupid name did i blow up your alt now is the time to reveal your beef drama ahead
yes yes yes i find this particularly hypocritical and thus interesting yes yes noi dont think so no beef i just like calling out bull when i see it consider it my research by the way have you considered posting your anticarebear propaganda on the jita park speakers corner where it belongs instead of aimlessly spewing it everywhere else
everyone from charles manson to jack the ripper convinced themselves their victims deserved it too the ability for some people to rationalize like that allows them to do terrible things and not see themselves for what they are
umits a video gamenot denying im mean in the game though
why would you decide to be mean in a game though is it safe to assume youd act that way in real life if you could get away with it as easily and have these desires and urges in everyday life but hold them back and wear a mask simply because you fear your true self being revealed
yea no
1 the npc bad guys in this game arent particularly convincing if the sandbox is to function in any interesting way somebody has to play the role of the antagonist2 the barrier to entry for being a baddie in eve in terms of moral turpitude really isnt that high should one also feel bad about beating somebody at chess3 all that said though from having read many of logits posts here and used those to take some admittedly internetdistorted this forum in particular brings out the worst in people measure of his personality im prepared to allow that the guy behind the toon may well actually be a jerk of some description or another
you get my vote
i suggest that you get a dictionary that doesnt have pictures in it something a trifle more advanced than a is for appleedit vote logit he may be a hypocrite but hes probably not an idiot which is probably the exact opposite of some of the other candidates ive seen also vote lark just because

apologies if the csms already brought these up but how about these issuesfix rocketsa lot of constructive ideas in the threadlearning skillsthere are a few threads about this but theyre all filled with mass trollingnew players accessibility in eve or lack thereofagain several threads about this but all are filled with mass trolling what can i say ive got a soft spot in my heart for newbieseasier tool for reporting isk spammerscouldnt find a thread that didnt result in mass trollingcompetence of the gm departmentsurprisingly very little trollingalign fleet to optioni like the idea as its simple and seems to go over wellmove the recover probes button away from the scan buttonive seen this thread a while ago but cant seem to find ittheres a few more issues id love to bring up but theyre less than popular with other eve players again i apologize if these have already been brought up
it cant possibly be right that the all the asteroid belts from entire systems are stripped within 12  half hoursthe karnola constellation in lonetrek is already strippedsurely the belts need bigger populations
unlike agents asteroids only have so much to give if an area is too populated with miners find another there are over 5000 systems in the game so finding an outoftheway one even in highsecurity space should be relatively easysupply and demand economics even apply to mining good luck
all you have to do is simply ban anyone who posts a gold spam it is very easy to do

got my vote always thought they were a waist of a ship class as is right now
i see a lot of people have the misguided idea that the thrasher needs to be using arties please dont change it for thatits the ship i have the most of my kills in and 99 are with acs its great fun for solo pvp sure you will lose several but it is cheap and easy to fitthe only thing i really see it needing is a lower sig radius to last just a little longer
problematic however if for some reason the old email address is defunct for legitimate reasons
optional tools to help with account security are always good i personally am fairly careful about where i go online but my wife isnt and if her comp dies its marriage hell if i dont let her use mine
the problem with one week timer is that i know the cases when owners petitioned their stolen accounts and after 10 or even more days characters were sold without any actions taken by gmsi would petition the gm who didnt banned the account imediately after youryour friends account was hacked and then after you receive the answer from senior game master there is nothing they can do then send mail to internal affairs and human resources accusing both gm who initialy handled your petition and senior gm for covering his mistakes for doing ty job hopefully ccp will start sacking more rapidly bad apples in gm department
i think the security question is a valid idea along with the email confirmation another thing that may or may not help is to not allow important account info such as email until a safeguard has passed
supported everyone can be the victim of account thievery no matter how much security measures you take
drake is right we are responsible for our own account securityhe is misguided thoughthis is why we should have an option to lock a character to an account to prevent transfer to another
its certainly not going to create any problems
supported the o and d need to be easier to differentiate between though
great idea

let your voice be hearddrone power o
heck they could make smart bombs that dont do any damage consume no capcpupg so all they do is the effect and wed have pretty light shows
yeah christmas cheer the question in all of this is how would ccp disable them after the season spill the egg nog burn out the strobe lightsmartbomb wannabei love the smartbamb idea but i will bet a fair amount of isk that it will never happen and heres whyfit a bunch of them to a ship in highsec preferably a starterschool system arrange for concord to be at a belt by having someone suiganked announce in local that the last patch broke smartbombs so concord wouldnt be aggressed by them and that you will demonstrate wait for a bunch of noobs to show up in belt fly up the the concord ships and fire up your rack of smartbombs wait in your salvage ship for the inevitable rush to try this out by everyone else profit and lols
yes
ehem
got a good point on the maelstrom tbh however the hardpoints hp and drone and most of all grid differences makes these ships a class apart also with the additional lowslot the maelstrom is also somewhat easier to mission tank too although i wont deny that i share your concernsupdates tempest and fleet tempest tracking bonus improved to 75
revisions look good nice to see you refining the ideas both on player feedback and based on what has worked and what hasnt worked so well on sisi
totally support this initiative
i feel obligated to bump this topic since with the poor quality of the search filter it will never been seen again at this rate and i have gotten some good feedback on this issue
agree cans or wrecks r the same thing ninja salvagers should get a job 
your wrongness if off the scalewhere did you get that stupid idea in the first placethese are not arguments backed up with anything neither is it constructive criticism of why what i suggest is bad it is simply a number of statements ideas and facts with half of them being false could you please answer to my arguments rather then stupidly repeating that the salvage does not belong to me over and over again that is the only argument i heard so far pretty much and no logical reason why it should not be done like why it would be bad for gameplay or anythingall npc wrecks belong to the killer full stop you are not allowed to tamper with them without the owners permission
sorry i assumed you took ccps statements as fact not your wants and desires as facts the loot is yours without a doubt the salvage according to ccp from day one has been a free for all this is why you do not get a flag when you salvage a yellow wreck be it mission spawned or pvp spawned i dont know how else to explain it to you simply because mission wrecks do not follow the standard game mechanics for belonging to the personcorp that lost it you can decry that everything in eve that you come in contact with is in fact yours but that does not make it true nor should it maybe a game with instances might be more to your liking i say that because if something as small and insignificant annoys you so greatly that you will convince yourself despite the repeated counter statements by ccp that your opinion counts as fact when you are blatantly lieing to yourself and others by trying to claim possession to a universal good but discussing facts with a person that is beyond reason is in fact pointless i wish you good luck in your efforts to find more ways to isolate your self from contact and influence by external forces but i warn you that is a fools errand in this game and more often than not when a isolationist idea actually goes through it has the tendency to bite the bears smack in the assbut seriously can you actually qualify thisim reasonably sure if i flew up to a npc wreck i didnt kill i can loot and salvage it the only time something in this game is yours is in your hanger anywhere else aggro mechanics aside anyone with the appropriate cargo hold can do whatever the heck they want you can call me ignorant or whatever you please i know and you deep in your brainskull know that you are just trying to lie to yourself and get others to believe your lie it is an old tactic find a small basis of reasoning and pound on it until you believe the whole game revolves around it however if you do manage to succeed and get aggro mechanics added for npc salvage loot you are the first to lose their mission ship to the new can flippingpot kettle etc why is your suggestion bad honestly i dont care about salvage rights however i do react badly to individuals trying to prop their ideas as proper game mechanics when they have no basis in fact or any stated fact ever made your premise is false 100 wrecks have been open for everyone to salvage from their inception in game prove me wrong the only thing that belongs to you aggro mechanics wise is that can that is left over after you salvage a wreck
ok i did not want to repeat all the reasons that i already named 3 times in this thread but apparently noone ever even reads the first page of the threatyou are looking for minor faults in my statements rather then talking about the point of this thread so first of all i stated that all npc wrecks belong to the killer now you said salvage did not exist on day one but whateverthat does not contradict my statement you are allowed to salvage my wrecks that is how game mechanics works even though it is mine skipping next 10 sentences as it is just insults yes that is a fact and you can check it by clicking show info on the wreck you will see my ugly face on it and if the owner is nearby he can kick your ass owner has the right to protect his assets that is what i am asking for well if you realized that is the sole purpose of this threat so if you do not care about it why are you arguing gameplay is the only thing that matters and it makes sense game playwise to have the opportunity to protect something that you have createdwhy should ninjasalvagers be able to make millions with a 1day character absolutely riskfree they gate almost as much as a mission runner in his battleship and they dont even have risk of ai shooting them they do not need standings or anything why do they deserve easier life then mission runners that is what matters the most not whether it shows owner of the wreck or minor faults in my arguments ui or game mechanics it is gameplay that matters
supporting for kills lulz and failbear tears
from an earlier post just for all the fail carebears
signed  i play in english but ive been in french corp and fly with some german guys on occasion i love the huge international mix of eve and dont think that other languages should be neglected especially languages which have a large player base such as spanish
not supportedlearn english or another supported language everybody speaks english german or russian here basicallyso learn that and how is it racist the language spanish is not a race spanish as in from the country of spain is racist and brazil speaks portuguese so how about that too so all of south america is covered along with the other languages
supportedjust the corp name though not the logo
oh my god this
so say im flying an avatar i pretty much should be using highgrade slaves they work so well same with the endless number of passive abaddon slave evevids so say im flying a dominix in lvl 4 missions slaves are worthless to menow say im flying
slavescrystals ccp already said in the testserver feedback forum they will look into that imbalancesnake still make sense their boost just isnt as good as before but the extra 1520 can be life saver it will be interesting to see what afs with the speed boost and snakes will dohalos they make more sense than before sigradius tanking is very important now try afs try t3 cruiser try hacs they really benefit from their sig radius commentators on the tournament were also assuming that pl was running the gang link for sigradius to make tanking the stealth bombers easiercant comment on the talisman
okay from what i understand from larkonis and vuk laus posts was that the continuity is terrible in the csm and that the first term is more or less training well sounds like you want longer terms or a method to fix the continuity and csm rookie issue i dont see why you need to have unlimited term limits to fix those problems if anything this creates more work for ccp as they now have to monitor the csm to determine if they are doing their job or not because they have this ridiculous vetoi would gladly support terms changed from 6 months to 1 year or an overlapping system so the outgoing csm gets to teach the incoming csm but i definitely do not want to see anyone on the csm for years upon yearshave you read the eveo forums or played eve online recently thats all players do mostly they want themselves boosted and the bad guys nerfed so that they win there are no formal organizations like real life political lobby groups yet but i am not so naive to believe that it cannot be done or hasnt already been done to some extentlastly this thread should be renamed the spazzilliu and drake rageconis show
in the sense of this issue you need to define formal formal in whose eyes im fairly certain goonies have formalised their voting process to get 2 folks in the probability of two getting in is lowon that note mazz stunt speaks volumes of information to major alliances namely that they can do what they want and get free cookies in the process for casting their votes in an organised fashion prior to this thread i was unaware that csm gets free play time not that it matters much  a good trader can make 6 months worth of gameplay creds in the same time but its the incentive which is problematiccsm gets too many incentives to increase the time frame they can run for next thing youll see is ccp paying for body guard protection on the flight and transportation to and from iceland if your going to volunteer to do something thats what it should be  volunteer work
sums it up nicelyhalf year terms seem to be short when it comes to digging into the matters and red tape initially when i read the subject i thought it was about extending the half year into a full year and pherhaps cutting down the terms to just onehaving csm noobs is a good thing since it minimizes the chance of personal agendas being pushed since csm arent eve noobs there is nothing against having other perspectives from other players this outweights the having to read into csm to get the job done imhobesides if you want to have a during influence and go to the fanfest every year you should apply for a job at ccp
i think i will run for csm for the fall term too i could use a free trip to fan fest free 6 month of eve subscription all kinds of stuff for myself also the ability to push forth my own agenda even though the voice of the eve community doesnt want me to after all i know what is best regardless of their opinion and just do this over and over and overand once in a great while bring forth something to the voting table that some noncsm low life so i can say i am a voice of the peoplemy people of course muahaha muahahahahaaha
as i already said somewhere big powerblocks will always have their candidates in csm and i dont see nothing wrong in there if you could actually spent hour or two of your life instead of smacking 00 reps you would see that most of the changes we will see in dominion and most of them were proposed by either goon reps myself and i think jade constantin in csm 10 i am talking about incentivizing 00 supercap changes and such the funniest thing is that the big alliances like goons or morsus mihi will suffer the most due to all this changes proposed by us so all the whine that we are pushing our own agenda before trying to make eve better place for everyone is pure bullextending csm term to 9 or even 12 months was my idea aswell but i think ccp is against itat the end i will repeat myself there isnt perfect system neither in rl and naturally not in internet spaceship game but there should be room for improvement for current one
thing is vuk you shouldnt pretend that pushing the agenda of the people who elected you isnt a big part of the role eve players are voting for you take their issues to ccp and try their best to get them into the game this ranges from the little things like ui fixes and ship tweaks to the medium stuff like boosting blackops and bombers  right up to the reinvention of 00 as we will shortly seethese are passionate subjects and players expect their representatives to carry that passion to ccp if delegates were really only gotoguys collecting forum posts and copy and pasting into the wiki when why bother having elections in the first place ccp could just hire an intern to do that job and have done with itthe best thing the csm can represent is a vital and enthusiastic debate where many sides of the argument get presented and all the talking turns into good stuff got to say i was pretty exhausted by all the butting heads i had to do with goons in csm1 but at the end of the day we managed to get stuff done and promoted the issues that the voting eve public wanted us to present though ive not yet had the urge to do my 2nd term mainly because im really looking forward to playing with the changes in dominion and frankly the csm is hard work if you do it properly  i can say im glad i did it i think it needed doing and frankly somebody did need to confront the status quo of the big powerbloc alliances and say what was wrong with the current sovereignty modelim against it too i think six months is fine and two terms means you get a second bite at the cherry in a while perhaps to see how your issues helped shape the game down the road but keeping the terms relatively short and avoiding delegateforlife rubbish keeps it fresh gives everyone a chance to take their term and prevents the abuse of csm status by power bloc favourites treating it as a free holiday and beer festi cant disagree with that but thats a long way from supporting a motion from a sitting committee to extend their tenure and privileges that got less public supports 3 than it did council members 4 to be honest that vote was an embarrassment and i think several of your current csm delegates realized that in the course of the discussionthis issue certainly doesnt represent anything the community is asking you to take to ccp and seems more about maz trolling people than actual practical reformyou should strike it from the submission list and pretend it never happened to be quite honest
can i be one of your peoplepleeeeeeeeease
glad to know im not the only one here seeing this
cross posted for emphasisthis reminds me of a recent us congress vote for pay raise even when were getting lectured on how broke our country is from these same people its in nobodys self interest except the members of the body of voters the players are obviously happy with the way the system works even if the system is horrible come up with a better proposal or throw it away totallypersonally i think the entire election system is a crock its not well published its not well maintained and its very much in favor of large alliancesits sad when i read goon responses to a goon csm on here where they blatantly say i was told to support this so click same goes for all the other csms most of the major support threads on here are a csm and his alliances backing after they were told on their private forums to go support it if you look through the actual supports its 10 or less of independent voters even commenting on most issuesthe forum is woefully under read woefully managed and poorly donei think before the csm tries to force longer terms maybe they should take a harder look at what makes this system so badfor starters how about an option to support or disapprove of a thread ive seen 1000 post threads get 100 supports and 900 alts or replies detailing the thread more surface value would say that there are 900 rejections of the topic when really its just a stiff debate between posters how many threads get passed up because of this mistakewhat about better publicity and handling of information from devs and csm open ts night 2x a month open csm only forum where topics can be debated by them for everyone to see open askadev forum where issues regarding csm get a post and no replies allowed until someone in the know answeres the questionhow about an updated csm section on the websiteopen csm debate sessions on ircetcall those issues are far more important than the longevity of a csm
and yet again agreed
dont you think we didnt already proposed bunch of thator similar stuff it had to pass 1 year to get semiworking csm emails and part of the forums where we can discuss issues internally i dont want to sound as little whiner like yaay is d especially cause concept as csm is something nowhere to be seen and only having it live and going is huge success for a ccp as a company but the fact is that csm delegates esp csm 10 hadhave a lot of difficulties on their path as mentioned we are still experiencing lack of support from ccp yes i am whining again d  but i assume exclusively cause i think that ccp is undermanned not due to lack of will to support csm as project thats the same reason a lot of things yaay mentioned above are still dead on a paper anyway this is bit off topicas i already said i was and divided on this matter sadly i had to leave the meeting due to rl crap before this issue came to the table so i voted yes but mainly cause i wanted to see ccp view on this matter
i will support any changes that will enhance the csm ability to do its job betteri absolutely will not support anything that removesextends term limits the reason they are there serves a very good purpose only 3 terms into the csm and you want to remove the biggest safety feature this seatbelt chafes my neck while im driving lets remove it so i am more comfortable the solution would be to adjust the shoulder strap on the bpillar lower so its not on your necki will not support a ccp veto on a csm member because they think they will suck as a csm member the players voted them there so they should be there the moment some csm member from say a power block is disqualified because ccp decides they are not good enough that power block will be up in arms shouting that ccp is bob or some stupid crap i highly doubt ccp is sitting over expenses wondering if the free stuff is cost effective on your input they make plenty of money and are doing just fineyou really should have pushed forth changes to help csm members do a better job during the two terms and you would have gotten the support of the eve playersyou still have time to redeem yourself with the players and bring forth the needed changes you need to happen so the csm can better serve the players within the two term limit unless of course you dont give a 
vuk you dont need ccp to implement most of those changes there are plenty of csms plenty of outsourcing that you can do in your alliances etc to get most of that done hell be would probably host a ts session or 12 considering they do it every patch anywaysirc is like lol freethere are forums outside thesewiki could be vastly updated and more timelyif ccp is behind its up to you guys to make your positions work if you dont have the resources from ccp create them yourselves you guys make it sound like such sacrifices you have to make to do this stuff first its optional second youre reaping plenty of reward to justify the extra effort hell a trip to iceland is what about 3000 dollars american pay roughly after boarding food etcyou cant blame us players for not having sympathy with you guys right now csm is a glory  position if we got rid of all the alliance leaders who do it as a sidebar to everything else and got the less well known passionate players to do it maybe we would have already seen these 2ndary changes occur all we ever hear from the csm is lots of talk and hype and not a lot of result maybe you guys should realize you arent doing things right or efficiently
thats true aswell
please yes why its not there already i cant imagineall those things would support continuity and encourage more player participation lack of proactive outreach to the player population at large is the csms biggest failing from my perspective part of being an effective voice for the people is reaching out to inform the uninformed so that they too can step up and be heard i dont see any of the csms doing anything to accomplish that and its not a lack of tools the tools and mechanisms exist and are free blogs and twitter come immediately to mind relying on the ridiculously tiny viewport to the playerbase provided by this forum is pathetically shortsighted and frankly lazy despite im one of csms biggest supporters all i seem to see are people doing the bare minimum required to get their free trips to iceland maybe i have a skewed perspective on what we players should expect from csms since it is based on how id approach the job however i am not impressed with csms lack of efforts to inform educate and encourage players to participate in the process of getting heard ccp hasnt really put their shoulder much into the yoke in this area either but hey they are footing the bill given that and their familiar its your sandbox play in it mentality i can forgive them for expecting the csm to step up if indeed thats what is going on behind the scenes if there is evidence out there to prove me wrong please by all means share it and i will cheerfully admit that i am misinformed and ignorant wouldnt be the first time
great idea alll my fives
i dont necessarily support this but i do support a fix to the station docking games mechanic if you make the period too long then the cooldown time after any fight is going to just suckdont artificially expand it to an arbitrary limit i like this guys idea oh  wait thats my ideaif you go with that then no buff to the ehp of any ship is going to cause this problem again you want to fight or you dont want to fight  make a decision
not supported
sounds awesome go for it
pretty simple make iskseller reporting quickereasiera way to do it directly from chat would be nice they tend to spam in channels where the chat is already moving pretty quick right click report isk spammer would be cool
this suggestion has been brought up many times and it boggles my mind why it hasnt yet been implemented definitely supportedalso if you rightclick on their post in chat and choose report isk spammer preferably it would log that chat post that you rightclicked so ccp can clearly see that yes they are very identifiably an isk seller
sounds like a good plan along with the chatlog idea
what would be great to have is the ability to multi select items and sell them instead of having to do them one by one if you have many items that you would like to sell it can be tedious going through each one at a timethx
yes please bad design is bad design
i think the issue was moreso you sell something it comes up tell you the price of each item and the regional average and blah blahdo you really want 200 of those windows opening up all at once not really but how about a sort of window like the reprocessing window you can still see the important info you can uncheck any that might be at bad prices or bad average then sell the restwhile leaving the same 1off window
supported as long as it takes into account the fact of creating sell orders what the advanced button does today
supported but you should still have to create sell orders 1 by 1 in my opinion as youre going to need to set those prices by hand mass selling to buy orders can be more or less automatic however
oh yea of course i didnt mean have tons of windows but thinking on the same lines as you with the repro windowsell items similar but ablity to edit prices of course
i can agree with this so long as there is other fields than just what to sell have a checklist of all items with the price people are offering to buy it at and the variance from regional cost should help ccp might turn this down due to the additional load on the market server though so well have to see what they say for now agreed
i have been waiting for this for a long time but there would need to be assurances that 1 it would always pick the highest available price and b that any items that are not sellable will be put back in your hanger and not do that bull where it freezes the whole operation midway through to  at you
a much needed improvement
im surprised this didnt come up during pvp roundtable or maybe i did and missed it while watching
seems reasonable if warp fleet exists this should too
supported
yes
sorry just cant support this you might as well turn fleet members into drones if the fc can do anything for them
yes
imo the usefulness of this idea seem to outweight the negative notion of puppeteering
supported
i love this idea
as ive played other mmos ive noticed that some games have a tendency to give special items to longerterm players and i thought eve could possibly do the same thingthe problem the reward would have to be something that wouldnt mess with game balance but would be cool enough to be worth havingthe problem perplexed me until fanfest when i was struck by a bolt of inspirationnew players who buy the boxed game get an interbus shuttleso that is something the devs feel wont imbalance things but since newbies get it what would make it a good reward for a bitter vetnothing unless of course the bitter vet shuttle was reskinned to look like oveurs beer ship as seen in the video hereso i propose that all players who have played for a lengthy time my personal selection would be 5 years but im sure the timeframe could be negotiable should get their very own beer shuttle with which to fly amongst the stars
you have played for 5 years but do not remember getting the apotheosis long time vets play eve because it is one of a kind and fun to play new expansions are probably the 1 reason why people play eve for so long not because they get some worthless ornamental ingame itemif anything people need to be rewarded for turning their trial account into a paying account and some rewards for new players to keep playing for the first 36 months to get over the newbie hump and understand the game fully and realize how awesome it is vets dont need anything really
actually i wouldnt qualify for the beer shuttle if it was set at 5 years playing im not a bitter vetmerely slightly cranky working my way up to bitter although i remember my apotheosis but that was a ship everyone got not just the vets not a complaint it was a nifty little shuttle merely a statement of factimo the reason vets play any mmo for years is because they enjoy it and not for the trinketsbut little trinkets can be fun
id go for the i played this space mmo for over 5 years and all i got was this tshirt tshirt
according to the gms a csm member can bring any idea to vote even if it has no player support id like to see this changed main reasonthis forum is useless to a point with these rules the csm do not need player support on anything to bring forward so whats to stop them ignoring this forum all together and just voting on ideas they have all the time the players might as well stop supporting ideasextream view yes it would be bad thing but it cancould happen as there is nothing inplace to stop itdetails can be hashed over but something like a csm member cannot bring to vote an item that has less then 2030 player votes of support
agreed maybe something like this for a proposal request idea or demand the thread in question must be at least a week old and have a minimum support of 50 respondents to that threadhowever just before we get too deep into this topic i would like to point out a good reminder about ccps actionsmazzilliu pointed out that a previously unsupported topic was picked up by ccp regardless of the lack of support simply because it fell in line with something they were doing this indicates that they arent serious about making csm a strong political body to promote ideas and suggestions that the players themselves find would improve the quality of the game on the same token not many players have the time or resources to play watchdog on the assembly hall either therefore i dont see anything really being contributed from this
basing any hard rules on what the csm is allowed to discuss on the number of supports is absurd that number is so easily stuffed that it isnt funny
the least problem is bringing any issue for discussion due to simple fact that if issue is not valid it will be voted down
while i like the theory behind the idea the problem youll find is one of vallot box stuffing by alts
not supported the entire point of csm is that you elect people you trustbelieve in and they have freedom to show themselves
this reminds me of a recent us congress vote for pay raise even when were getting lectured on how broke our country is from these same people its in nobodys self interest except the members of the body of voters the players are obviously happy with the way the system works even if the system is horrible come up with a better proposal or throw it away totally personally i think the entire election system is a crock its not well published its not well maintained and its very much in favor of large alliances its sad when i read goon responses to a goon csm on here where they blatantly say i was told to support this so click same goes for all the other csms most of the major support threads on here are a csm and his alliances backing after they were told on their private forums to go support it if you look through the actual supports its 10 or less of independent voters even commenting on most issues the forum is woefully under read woefully managed and poorly donei think before the csm tries to force longer terms maybe they should take a harder look at what makes this system so bad for starters how about an option to support or disapprove of a thread ive seen 1000 post threads get 100 supports and 900 alts or replies detailing the thread more surface value would say that there are 900 rejections of the topic when really its just a stiff debate between posters how many threads get passed up because of this mistakewhat about better publicity and handling of information from devs and csm open ts night 2x a month open csm only forum where topics can be debated by them for everyone to see open askadev forum where issues regarding csm get a post and no replies allowed until someone in the know answeres the questionhow about an updated csm section on the websiteopen csm debate sessions on ircetcall those issues are far more important than the longevity of a csm
mazzilliu says alot of thingsnone of which where said by ccp or quoted or documentedas for the op not supported you need to outlaw alt posting in assembly hall before you can allow such things to take placenot that it prevents people from using alternate accounts it still eliminates the problem of alt postingand ironically i have to agree with yaays sentiments the csm should be looking at other things other than prolonging there lifespangood idea but you got a few roadblocks to bust up first
during one of the fanfest videos posted on youtube the browser team says someone said something about oauth and openid we may make our owncrack smokingso how did making your own browser work outstraight off on the same path again brave and stupidevery single social network is going openid and oauthwhile ccp walks off in their own direction with nothing in handmost of the new functionality being talked about is exposed through javascript hooks so 1990s which means only ccps new browser will work outofgame most sites designed for this browser will simply errorthis could mostly be done with standard remote authentication schemes without locking any browsers outthen the social network has none of the features of any standard social networkno opensocial without openid and oauth api access there is no real increase in functionality for api userswhy bother if users have a choice between ccps dodgy social network that fails at most things and a 3rd party that offers all the modern convienences why would a user visit the ccp wastelandneed a clear picture from the social network and browser teams explaining why they are deciding to go off in their own direction are they infact planning to not implement any open standards like they keep hinting

fully supportedthis cosmos thing could be so much more useful if ccp would ditch the whole notinventedhere mindset
i did some easy readup on openid and oauthsince i know nothing about how these mechanics works i can only asume that openid and oauth somehow interacts with the client during the sessionsince the ingame browser will bah all those layers using awsomeium they said something about the site not being able to interact with the client or at least not send stuff to the client since it all gets rendered into a picture perhaps thats the reason that this will not worki do however think that ccp is a bit overprotective with their whiteblacklist
i would like to know if it would be possible to have the logitech g13 advanced game pad supported by the client one of the main features i am looking for is to use the analog stick to control the drone cam it would also be nice if the client would register the g keys when pressed so that i do not need to assign a controld key assignment to use the short cut all drones engagejust a simple requestthank you for your time
wow thats a great idea i second that

its not about flying with the analog stick there is a bit more to it than that looking for eve to recognize the g keys and that the analog stick will move the drone cam
this should be an option yes
soz i had to bold the important bit
so lets kill the game experience even more then i mean jeez if your having to remove avatars just to make the game load quicker then might as well give up nowat least make it optional
nuff said im tired of having to play with the windows every time i join a new fleet
in all honesty role playing may be the reason why this should be supported what if characters were to be married what if there were a corp that had an initiation ritual and all members got unique nicknames such a sharkbait ooh ahai cant say as i would support this as it it needs some serious consideration but yes i think something should be doneno i dont think id ever actually use it since i wasnt silly enough to pick redlion so many years go
well im living in hope for ccp to follow up on their nice words during fanfest about rpbut i do think ccp needs a push by the csms
i refuse to agree with larkeven though in this case hes rightsighif you really came into this game with the idea of role playing and hey i love role playing  been playing dd since i was 12 which was too long and too many kids ago to remember clearly then you would have actually put some time into coming up with a name that isnt darth fubarl337dud3 or some crap like that
i came into this game for 14 days trial or was it 10 back then and made a stupid name and an ugly face
im for anything that reduces the population of lo sec ratters and miners even more lo sec is just way too populated with prey right now anyway
worst reply everwhile i agree that this change is not going to work not posting why or any kind of explanation whatsoever is just as bad as trollingi think it would not help pirates at allnot being able to feel safe for a carebear is probably the reason why they dont go to lowsecsee what i didyou say they will not be able to see the piratesi say they will think everybody is a pirate unless they can see their high security status
in 00 it makes sense no lawin low sec doesntconcord may not show up but they still enforce the lawvia your sec rating and opposed to cocorddokenfaction police that means if your flagged as a 10 criminal your going to light up like a christmas treeconcord paints you as a pirate to everyone else or more accurately a criminal as some 10s are not entirely pirates not that there would be much elseso your real life comparison is reaching at besteither way role play or not not supportedyou wantted to be in the career of piracy you pay the consequences for itunless your talking 00whs because concord doesnt give a crap about it  other than just watching and keepin stats
i dont think your real world analogy is very strong here concorde monitors the stargates they know exactly which ships and pilots are in a system at all times as long as the technology would exist to know which pilots are in a system it would necessarily allow them to determine which of those pilots were pirates pirate in the eve context simply means someone who has commited sufficiently numerous acts of piracy in the past which you could tell at any range you could identify the pilot
eve is all about choices and consequences you choose to initiate battle on players you suffer a sec penalty there is a way to keep your sec rating above 10 but that involves shooting down npc rats ie showing to concord that youre a good guy too and take out rats they dont like it might also involve not podding pilots as that suffers the sec status even morethat too boring for you thats okay thats a choice and there is consequencebuffing something by removing the consequence of choices has never been supported on the forums from what ive seen
what you really want is for local to be removed or put into delayed mode for lowsec and for some improvement to the directional scanner by which we can detect that someone is in our space eating our cookies and popping our friendsid even support thatwhat youre asking for wont help because youll soon be marked red by any corp thats dealt with you
heres a solution that may workthe plex can stay in the same system or even open it up to the same constellation but it respawns after all the rats are killed and players can only reenter the respawned plex every x hours or x days a gate lock after youve already done the plex that drops after alloted time has passedthis would allow players to go thru the separate respawned plexes with random alts but at least it would make them work for their money
i dont like invincible plexxers and if cloaks are a problem in plexes simply disable cloaks there not like the game needs more people using cloaks to hide from a fight
a changea change that we can all believe in brofist
nvm
pretty self explanatorycans help to organize inventoryfor example you can havemissionloot in one canfitting modules in one cantreasures and useless items in one canindustry stuff in one canitems you trade in one can and so onits somewhat annoying because now all the fitting modules have to be in main hangar which really makes inventory management harder it may not apply to everyone but i am sure many would benefit from this
pretty simple question how would the fitting manager know from which can it should pick the modules
you could tell him select container from list
its still a mystery why we dont have all factiondeadspace stuff on market
if you genuinely believe that youre living in a fantasy land alliance blocs didnt happen because it was easy they happened because it was necessary  you and your friends made them necessary alliances that stood alone got smashed by a certain band that was big at the time alliances that worked together didnt in the end them working together destroyed you essentially solo coalitions work and any strategy that works will be replicated you seem to be suggesting that if your proposal passed pl goon mm rzr tcf ra and a halfdozen other alliances would either merge or become enemies thats just not going to happen and you know its not going to happen ultimately youre trying to use the csm to implement your nostalgia into game mechanics not only is that a doomed effort from the beginning but even if you succeeded youd fail the game has moved on and you cant bring it back to the way it was you may have enjoyed your model of alliance structure but 00 is a pressure cooker that destroys inefficiency and your ideal has been found lacking it might conceivably be possible to take enough of a hatchet to the game mechanics to make it optimal to build that way but removing colourcoding of names in local please
intention  goodidea awfull
i dont assume that overnight blue would turn to red i expect that the greater wear created by maintaining blues in a structure thats not easy for them would over time wear relations youd see more friendly fires less coordination on the battlefields ie less need to have friends and less overall wellfare brought by having an obvious friend in that blue square uncertainty creates destruction one of the truths now is people hate dealing with long blue list because its a constant necessity to maintain and coordinate everyone on who is blue imagine how much harder and therefore less likely it would be to have large naps when the ease of blue is gone one mistake that people make imo is that bob died to the swarm of enemies that came upon them yet those corps are still blue theyre gaining strength every day and they are certainly becoming a threat again bob collapsed because its core values were degraded old hated new new hated old nobody understood what the purpose of bob was and it was a lingering image of something that was once good if anything what happened will be lead to a renewed restructured bob or it now some people who were once part of the old ways will be gone and the new found image and culture can thrive good for them the nap brigade on the red side didnt break bob it kept them alive longer than it should have the blues destroyed the old bob it was not their way it was not their philosophy and it created a huge internal grudge between players and that all powerful threat that was bob it destroyed alliances 45 times its size i dont consider that a reason for people to react with 20000 man naps what it did do was force entities like the northerners to reassess their weaknesses and fix them the mm and rzr of today are so much better organized and combat hardened than the old theyd present a much greater challenge solo
trollyaay you should be more then happy with all the stuff ccp abathur and ccp greyscale did in ccp new expansion dominion internally known under codename the return of the mollenow on more serious note you idea is awful and i would ask you would you propose the same 12 years ago when your alliance biggest strength was the zoo you were bringing with you in your campaignsregardless of politics i proposed on iceland even more ingame mechanics for maintaining coalitions but its bit offtopic know and my lunch is waiting for meedited cause i suck in grammar
actually vuk yes its pretty well known that my personal feeling in bob caused a lot of head aches especially on the last run but it wasnt just me ive truely hated what blue list are doing to this gameone of the reasons rqm failed so miserably in fountain was sels aka abathurs take on how to run a coalition he blued wo reason caused a lot of problems doing so and the total cluster that resulted was the final failure of rqm rqm had a lot of potential both before and after the split before it all came down to communication the leadership were all being told different things that didnt match up and that lead to a lot of decisions that angered a lot of people the second wave of failures came when sel decided to play numbers anyone who knows sel knows he could run a good military but wasis horrible with the political landscape of this game that said i like the ideas behind the new sov im holding judgment on the actual execution and thats partly because ive had to work with the source something a lot of people dont know is during the first major attack on bob back when we held feyth i was very adamant about letting that space go early on probably about 23 months before molle actually ordered the withdraw i was constantly pushing for a withdraw and refocus i hated what we were doing trying to hold onto allies that didnt deserve to be held onto i hated losing friends who were much more powerful because of the idiotic politics that so famous speech where i was effectively telling rise to get their  straight and use some common sense was a reflection of that frustration i did not like the huge territory we held i didnt like the long blue list and i hated everything that resulted from it even more so i hated the major wars we had to fight against 3000000000 enemies it was fun the first few rounds when even with everyone attacking they hit different regions and we could respond to smaller fights all over it got miserable when it simply became about stacking numbers to win the joke of warfare today is the temp blue crap enemies become friends in an instant with a standings change to server a purpose its impossible to deploy any small army against someone because the fear is not the known enemy but rather then unknown invited guest order needs to be brought to the list of blues and reds it needs to be more about coordination and not just something as simple as shoot the reds ignore the neutrals and dont bubble the blues it needs to be complex confusion that requires more effort than figuring out whos color blindi dont fall into the usual category of the people ive been around in this game i look for the fun and the challenges im not one who waits for fights that i know are winnable every time i take fights where it comes down to opportunities and execution sometimes i win sometimes i dont sometimes its my fault sometimes its just poor execution from the pilots sometimes fights we should have never won we come out with an unexpected of flawless victory i dont mislead people everyone knows that about me while i may have been around people who do exploit the facets of this game that i hate it doesnt mean im one of them
10 to attributeskill the learning skillsnothing else needs to changethats it no point refundnothing es lots of people off so probably the right answer
i have no idea what you mean by this you mean in the order list a bit wacky but maybe a region column in the order list i can definitely support
well exactly what i saw coming has happened they buffed the guns a bit to make up for nerfing the gunsfactor in reload time and the still limited range of the drones revelation is still the wordfilter for dreadnoughtadd on top of that gallente dreadnought skill bonus 5 bonus to capital hybrid turret damage and 20 bonus to drone damage and hitpoints per skill leveltraining that to level 5 sure isnt worth it nowwhile say revelations bonus makes a big difference moros now is revs weaker brother
i like many perpetual low sec dwellers dont view low sec as a stepping stone to null sec as it is often referred to my desire is to see it offer a unique game experience that is not available in either null or high sec nor is some confused hybrid that experience could be created from tweaking a wide variety of existing mechanics the natural resources available mission plex and exploration sitesdrops market offerings manufacturing capabilities and shippos bonuses or nerfs to name a few some kind of interrelated system or station control leading to increased profit opportunities but which is contestable would be cool too coming up with a holistic and balanced set of features would surely entice players from all play styles to make low sec their homes however until someone puts in that kind of thinking well continue to see what were seeing now either unrelated but highly focused proposals for specific mechanics changes like reducing aggro timers or more nebulous idea collections like the ops a comprehensive makeover is whats needed to make low sec unique in its own right rather than the mediocre middle child that it is now the op and other posters hint at some good ideas for this and im sure there are many more in other posts the question is to what extent ccp is willing to consider changes to low sec guess we wont know that til a feasible big plan gets formed up meanwhile i hope people keep throwing ideas out there for everyone to chew on
i like your ideas and i think lowsec must be made profitableimplants manufacturing is a good idea but most important rats in lowsec should be the same as in 00dominion is supposed to make 00 interesting for organized carebears i think lowsec with good rats and no bubble is going to attract a lot of rattersabout the battleships gatecamps i think its the best we can get instant locking ceptors are too much for the poor little carebears the real threat right now is all those sensor boosted hics
how about someone who runs around asking everyone wouldnt it be cool if or will this work i can come up with lots of ideas cant guarantee their quality though cant program them either my best qualification is a rather darkly vivid imagination unfortunately that is coupled with a rather undeveloped ability to actually write things down so they dont get misinterpreted
i could go for that job as well dark nasty ideas sure some people in the game would hunt me down at fanfest but hey lifes short why not make others pay with my ideas

we do have offices in europe iceland is in europe
east is not a direction in space
to answer the questions about verboten spacethe jove have 3 regions that are inaccessible to the players theyre just there for show really just east of these regions is ccps playground where they observe the game from afar test out ingame features ingame in a safe environment ie away from curious players and strap large afterburners to small moons and play chicken with them when nobodys looking
giggles
awkward silence
it is when you view the map in the flat mode its not a written rule its just the way folks commonly refer to the general regions of the maphence how certain entities are called the northern coalition or that fountain is in the west feythabolis in the south and so on
im keeping my eyes open for a entry level it position id even be willing to do front line tech support if it got my foot in the door so to speak though given its a game company it might not be so bador it could be worse
similar things have happened in many other decent games to what is described in the op tbh ultima online for example
snipim gonna call shennanigans on you right here youre utterly fos
actually if you read the study that came out of that particular incident guys name is david myers it is quite fascinating the idea was to examine how digital cultures in online games developed moral codes that were actually contrary to developer intent and establish whether they were valid as something of a test lab for sociologists in that particular case it wasnt particularly that twixt was a bastard which he was but rather that cohs players had developed a code of ethics around pvp that were not by design and would be considered completely ridiculous in other games the standard eve player would laugh in your face if you complained about half the stuff he did in essence he simply used the game engine as designed and was nearly unstoppable as the social boundary ingame was such that no one on the other side of it stood a chance
yes i have an idea  you shoot me in lowsec you gain gcc i teleport you to highsec i win that is exactly what he did lamest excuse for a pvper ever
note i said half while that particular tactic wasnt exactly high skill it was permitted by game mechanic a better example of why he was hated would be more akin to you ratting in 00 me jumping in and killing you without so much as a hello and you complaining that i was somehow outside of acceptable behavior as i understand it coh had developed a gentlemans code for the pvp area that actually made pvp unacceptable without both parties agreeing to it myers made waves by ignoring that particular bit of the code and sticking to the developers stated reason for the areas existenceedit while i think the op is a bit of a bastard online and i personally think that how you conduct yourself online says a lot about you in rl at least on some level he at least puts forward a coherent argument which is more than can be said of others if his qualifications arent bull hes probably the kind of person that should be involved in examining game mechanics changes
the guy didnt pvp he teleported people into cohs version of concord it would be more akin to someone with a 10 sec status getting thrown into a 10 system but even that isnt a fair comparison it would be like throwing someone with gcc into highsec ohwait i just ing used that analogy because its right i read the article and it basically is him being a troll sure game mechanics allow it but thats because nobody abused it like he did if more people did that than you can surely bet that it wouldnt be a game mechanic anymore
screw the article its trash read the study itself
miscommunication here in the world of intellect what you just linked is called an article in the world of the common man the crappy news stories on websites are often called articles as well
yeah he is doing an appeal to authority fallacy by appealing to his personal position as a phd nice guy i suppose that is the opposite of an ad hominem attackyeah ninja salvaging might be a nasty thing to do but i dont give a damn if youre a phd nobel prize winner or a homeless drug addict with an internet connection who sells the organs of newborne puppies to pay for his gtci just dont like people who claim to be better than other people because most of the time on the internet its a lieeither way the op makes me want to go ninja salvaging after reading that wall
confirming this
the appeal to authority fallacy is when someone claims that they are correct in an argument because they are an authorityi just indicated that as someone who researches behavior eve online holds a lot of appeal for me i also suggested that i would have something constructive to add to the csm experience modeling behavior systems at no time did i announce i was right about some argument simply because i am in graduate schooli presented so many pieces of evidence regarding my ingame activities that could be used to argue that i am a bad guy great job not using any of those in your crappy argument
then why bring it up as you have something to prove your character i know plenty of people who are saints and good guys in real life but do pretty mean things in online gamesand i know antisocial people who dont talk or lift a finger who are saints online so it cuts both waysthat doesnt make them bad people because no one calls a quarter back who tackles someone extra rough a bad person its part of the game

as a carebear i will full heartily not support younononoplease be a trollhtfui rather vote for cat then youbtw where is cat
this guy seems a 100 legit
how will you petition ccp to change things in place that they put in and want in this game to further complete their vision for the world we play in hasnt happened so far what makes you think you can change that by getting whiners to hopefully vote for you in droves
im sorry but you want to change what eve is about im a carebear in my hulk and ill be quiting if what you say comes true
i must say that as a carebear i care for the carebears in my term i tried to give them an enjoyable game not a game they could play afk pves problem is that its too easy currently so most people dont care about participating unless theyre also working on homeworkreading a booketcpvp and pve in this game are uniquely intertwined each of them reliant on the other for the success of the game while aspects of both sides need improved wardec system mining suicide ganking mission running etc they do not need to be made easieri endorse the survivability and enjoyability of this game therefore i will not be voting for you
hrm now that i think of it protecting my faction hulk is okay and all but what sort of guarantee can you give me as far as faction interdictors go i mean are they okay by you too or must all such ships be reworked
i agree with the above poster also note imo high seccers make to much moneythey should limit it or raise low sec isk gaining from ratsminingmissionscomplexes and 00 so there will be more incentive to go out into those areas anti pirates will start to come alive againright now the risk vs reward is bullcrap because you can get more reward in high sec then lowsec and set a macro to do it for you with no troublekind of lame and goes against what eve is about
you arent a csm member so please dont raise issues in this thread
hiim aynen in real life known as matthijs and i have a question to you the playerbase of eve having researched the csm in an attempt to learn how it functions and how it was intended by its creators i discovered what i consider to be an indiscrepancy between the twoin a documentary by femke wolting and jorien van nes there is a small bit about the csms creation and it was stated there that csm members would be similar to chieftans representing their people which in the case of eve is the playerbase as a whole however i do not believe that this is the case with all of the members of the csms that have come and gone as stated by a current csm member in a csm panel at fanfest 2009 he and other members where ensured a seat on the csm by being backed by their alliance this to make sure that said alliances interests where well representedanother thing that was stated during that panel was that some csm members would run having a certain agenda which they used as a filter when looking on the forum for issues raised by players this means that only issues that fit into their personal agenda or that of their constituents would be represented or at least would get higher priority in spite of the fact that groups who can ensure a seat on the csm have to be pretty large to make this happen and therefor represent a decent chunk of the playerbase there are casualties to this tactic a csm member without prefered constituents or a personal agenda which heshe may apply as a filter to choose which issues to raise as a csm member would theoretically be less vulnerable to leaving some groups out in the cold to favor otherswith democracy being what it is you cannot prevent alliances from backing up one of their own in an attempt to gain additional power and it remains to be seen if a csm candidate without his own agenda or prefered constituents would get voted on at all which brings me to my questionwould you vote for a csm canditate who has no agenda or alliance background whos approach is to raise issues based on number of votes on this part of the forum onlyim considering to run for this reason but there wouldnt be any point if there is no demand for such a csm membermy personal background as a moderator on a selfharm forum has given me years of experience in seeing things from other peoples perspectives and mediating for them regardless of wether their views are similar to my own that experience has tought me that democratic systems benefit not from fractured politics which you get in a constituent system but from unbiased representatives of the peopledo note that im not asking if youd vote for me per sUFFFD im asking if you agree with the premise that unbiased csm members without constituents would do a better job of representing the playerbase as a whole and thus be more effective at making everyones eve experience better which might lead you to voting for such a candidate in generalif you have conflicting opinions about this topic please post them here so we can all debate about themthank youaynen
hello ayneni can say that as a member of the npc corps i didnt have anything close to a support base the only thing i ran on is a level platform and my reputation in the game and i still made it barely its much harder for somebody without a major alliance to succeed but its not impossible look at for instance ankhesentapemkah or lavista vista they had reputation in the game and this helped them get into the councilas long as there are alliances there will always be a pretty sure seat for them on the council if they choose to run bob didnt run for a seat in csm2 thats politics and the system works
couple of questionswhat was your policy on picking which issues to bring forth while you where a csm memberdid you ever feel overshadowed by the csm members who reprecented allianceswhat was your agenda

everybody i assume has their own stick i have brought the dead horselets give it a whackive searched and searched and though ive seen millions of threads about the issue ive never seen any reason that it has a not been answered by ccp directly or b not been addressed by any of the csmsits trivial in the long run but its such a simple fix that it baffles the mind why it has gone so long unaddressedthe assault frigates are designed to be heavy tacklers able to withstand punishment that inties cant take they get in close lock down a target and hold on for dear lifeall of the assault frigates can properly do their job with the exception of onethe poor retribution with its single mid slotlets be honest if your an fc or a pilot and somebody brings a retribution to your gang you know that you have just been given mediocre dps and an extra target and that is it it brings nothing to the table that most t1 frigates do not bring on their ownthis is not to say the retribution doesnt have potential and in small gangs with other people tackling it can do a task its just currently a task that any cruiser or frigate of the t1 variety can do as good or betterthe ship post dominion will get an after burner bonus that makes up the af 4th bonus that has been missing the problem arises when you look at the slot layout on the ret which is different from every other af it has one mid meaning it cant utilize its ship bonuses and still tacklei know some will say bring a friend its an mmo but at that point your just trolling simply because why would you ever fly a heavy tackler that cant tackle dont fit an ab and fit a point you say ok sure let me go out and tackle at the whopping 300 ms a fit retribution can attain im sure people will just sit still and wait while i motor over and pointscram themthe solutionsimple the ret has a 5th high slot that is arguably useful some people like salvagers some like nosneuts to help power the ships systems none of these things will serve the ship better than having a second mid slot to tackle with in conjunction with its ab bonus bringing it inline with the other afs in its role as heavy tackleso we move the high slot to a mid slotthe cpu may need to be adjusted a bit but tbh i doubt it the wolf has the same cpu as a retribution the two lowest by 20 cpu btw so perhaps they both could use a mild cpu buff in comparison to the other 6 afs but can easily fill its intended roll of heavy tackle with its fitting numbersi know this has been done to death and that its probably a bit late to get it into dominion but if your buffing afs how can you possibly over look the black sheep of the family and not see it needs to be reviewed so that it can do its job properlyif they change wont happen im curious to see a response as to why one ship is being denied in its intended role

pretty sure we mentioned the retribution in the assault frig topic at the csm summit in icelandif it doesnt get looked at well amarr need at least one fail ship
they have the legion too so that makes 2 maybe more i approve this message
not supportedi disagree with the original premise that the assault ships are all designed to be heavy tacklersthe retribution with its single mid slot is one of the heaviest tanking and heaviest hitting frigates in the gamei personally fly one on a regular basis and yes while i get some funny looks in fleets when they see me drop out of warp and watch that ceptor stealth bomber whatever that is frigate sized engaged literally vanish int two volleys they change their mindsi can take out cruisers easily all i need is some tackle support if you want a heavy tackler use the vengeance it has low dps but a high tank and tackling abilitythe only thing the retribution needs is a hair more speed to make it a more flexible tank and spank platform if you give it a second mid slot even at the expense of a low or a high it will become over powered to an insane level
in one of the videos of the fanfest ccp pretty much admitted the retri sucks in every wayso im assuming they are now gonna do jack all
i understand you like the ship i like it too it was the first thing i ever specifically trained for when i started playingbut whats your role in fleetdpsok you do dps less than the cheaper omen in fact your only barely doubling the dps of an ac punisher with similar hp numbersarent you tired of being the only af in the game that cant tackle if your first on sceneyouve limited your role in a fleet to over priced underpowered dps targetthe ship is sadly lacking in its practical areas of use because it is almost always outperformed by a cheaper shipliking the ship which i do does not mean that you cant admit to its faultswith the ab boost currently in place for testing the afs become quite frightening with a scram fit often times youll find them killing vagas curses and all manner of other ships in the ffas bs get bent over fyiall save one because the targets they are fighting simply mwd away or warp out the top speed of the ret when comfortably fit with tankdps and an ab is around 800ms and while bursting that may jump you into range to apply a scram to help you hold your target so you can apply your dps you sadly dont have any way of making that happen at allevery combat ship in eve can hold a target down save one and that just seems wrong somehow
ive simply never used it to tackleand the comparison to the omen is bad because the guns on the retribution hit everything far more consistently focused pulses only go so farive always run mine with support from a crusader or a veangeance our corp is crazy amarr heavy but any tackler will do it does have dps issues ill grant you that because it can be out dpsd by a crusader easily the enyo has the same issuebut i am forced to agree with you if all the afs get more speed there is no point to field the retribution anymore
you know how it is with these things one bulb goes bad the whole blasted string goes out

support this thread or puppies will die 
simple case some guy is going around a trading hub lets say jita in a nano fitted shield buffered battleship with plenty of smartbombs in his highslots getting chased around constantly by concord is not discouraging him in the leasthis ship is fully insured so it costs him peanuts to do this concord dont pod and hes only doing it for whatever goes for satisfaction in this line of workhe has an alt in fleet that he warps to so that he can smartbomb escape with his pod and the alt loots whatevers leftmy suggestion would be revoking insurance rights to people with 10 standings i dont get how someone whos an enemy to every legitimate player in the game and if you want to stay in character an enemy of concord and the state can still receive insurance serviceslet the flaming begin
simple insurance is not about roleplay its about making pvp more viable for everybody including 10 pilots
first lets clarify what youre actually trying to accomplishdo you want to get rid of people smartbombing the exit lane on jita 44do you want to revoke insurance for certain playersactivitiespick a proposal and discuss it you may not be any more successful but you might actually get some debate on the topicthat being the case why cant i insure the contents of my freighter i mean that would make pvp more viable to me and other people who are subject to being ganked while flying slow lumbering beasts of burden at that point i could adopt the same whatever attitude that the gankers have because my actual losses will be as minimal as theirs
last time suicide ganking was balanced ccp had the choicebuff concord response timesremove insurance for concorded shipsthey chose the formerdo you think if insurance is removed it will discourage the act not likely those who gank for profit may have to tighten their belts a bit and go after higher value targets or work together in smaller cheaper ships as for those who do it for fun well to purchase and fit enough destroyers to take out a hulk costs around 55 mil if that thats pocket change even without insurancetldr if youre carrying anything valuable then tank your ship dont fly afk and get used to the fact that its very cold in space
why do you keep posting stuff i agree with it makes it very very hard to continue to think youre an i did make one minor correction to your post though
i am pretty sure smart bombing jita 44 is a bannable offence just as baitinggriefing in beginner systems is petition anyone you find doing itpenalising 10s is hardly a solution to something that is completely unrelated to piracy something that might be worth adding is removal of insurance if mail has a concord npc on it hs to be npc not sentry highsec suicide squads have zero risk for what can be huge rewards 
thanks dear youre not as much of a tit as i used to think either
protip due to the station size you cannot smartbomb at jita 44 i do believe it is possible at the main stations in amarr rens and dodixie or at least one or two of those the myth of it being a bannable offense i believe comes from either zombie corps blockade of yulai or miz cenuijs massacre in jita icebeltsstargates both of whom ceased i believe after a warning from gms and only because they were spawning so many concord it was lagging out the nodeshisec suicide squads risk everything they risk sitting there for hours and not finding a target they risk their target having a sufficient tank on his vessel they risk getting a terrible drop ive had upwards of one bil go up in smoke with only a patheticly small drop as money making activities go it is probably on a par on average with ratting in a good 00 system or cruising through level 4s with a tricked out marauderregardless it is still relatively uncommon its only because those that get ganked are hysterical morons who feel that their important internet pixels shouldnt have been taken from them by ebil piwates in safer space if these things were that important to you then why didnt you protect them better yo
what can i say i was rather irritated with you and i never learned to bite my tonguei got over it i think
trying to promote discussion on an issue that ccp is failing to address thats allmainly bringing up the issue itself rather than a catchall answer to the problemregardless the idea that someone who gets attacked by concord not receiving their insurance payout is a great idea in my opinion and id totally support that
can i come to the weddingoh not supported
they are not failing to address anything in my time playing eve concord have had 3 major buffs the only issue is that youre not willing to take the steps required to protect your investments
ditto to this if youre that worried about the contents of your freighter get a corp mate to fly by you in an interceptor with dual webs that freighter will be in warp before you can blink and never sit in a gankable position long enough to be a targeti dont want pirates to have it easy but i also dont want carebears to think its ok to just wander the cosmos risk free semitrucks with valuable cargo are hijacked all the time in the real world get with it life isnt safe wear a helmet
it wasnt a freighter that got popped it was a t2 frigate and a podi think were agreeing on some things and disagreeing with others thoughwe both agree to some extent that we want other people to experience the game differentlymy position is that i would prefer not to have people who exploit weaknesses in the insurance and clone system to enjoy their game at the expense of othersyour position is that you would prefer people who dont exploit the game at the expense of griefing others to suffer the exploits of others i think its safe to assume that we should agree to disagree on whats probably a years old dispute between people who view success in this game differentlycomparing a suicide bomber to a carjacker is kinda lame though
i can see how that is some pretty bad griefing concord are after him for absolutely no reason and are going to kill him for no profit at allthats a good thing those bastard concord are out of control at least when concord is griefing they arent doing that much damagedamn concord always thinking of the easy cheats they just show up from nowhere and start shooting its terriblewhat does that have to do with concord griefing
if you do not give these people the opportunity to exploit the game at the expense of others then they wont im assuming you were carrying some valuable cargo
from an earlier post just for all the fail idiotswhat do you prove it salvage is the mini professionbut salvage from other players wrecks not is a mini profession nothing talk about exploit exploit and stole salvage not equalccp told many things like when they change ghost training after 5 years and we will work on it ccp change this unlogic rules while it is not modifiedand i tell you againninjasalvagersparasitesthey cant kill anything they cant scanning wrecks just the mission runners ship if the salvaging is a mini profession they why cant scan the wrecksthey cant use tractor beam on those wrecks if not belongs for anyone the wrecks why just the killers can pulling them they cant pick up loot from wreck without criminal flagand they make more money shorter time risk free than as the mission runner
not supporttedsalvage belongs to anyone who salvages any wreck got itbecause it cant be spellt any simpler please note that it really has nothing to do with wreck ownership anomaliesthats why salvage material is created in the salvagers cargohold its really more like mining than looting cansand for the parasite argument thats rich they are just competition for the salvage profession oh right some poeple just cant grasp the fact that its a multiplayer game where you cant go soloyes they just dont know what they ask for arent they
try to destroy those wrecks in highs sec if those wrecks not belongs to anyone just who salvaged themoh no you will die from concord but who killed the rats can destroy them because belongs to him those wrecks and more thing try use on wreck right clickyou not see everyone on info panel just one person who killed the ratits a multiplayer game where you cant go solo oh i see the ninjasalvage its a multiplayer profession lol and salvage items created salvagers from wreck not from your empty cargohold so the parasite its true because your minininjaprofession not equal with simple salvage skill need a person who kill the npcs but not you did because you have just a salvagership and salvager not kill npcs megafail againyou said just competition for the salvage professionif just competition a salvage profession tell me what happen when someone kill the npcs in own mission and want to salvage the wrecks but cant because someone stole his work under five minutes which he worked lasting until thirtyfive minutes your body does not produce the blood in order that a leech sucks it out it is not necessary to remove these parasites from yourself according to your notioni hope for it you will live with many leeches hence on your body because of tomorrow which you do not want to remove
allright let me repeat myself salvage belongs to anyone who salvages any wreck where did i say anything about wreck ownership oh hereaww did you just read too much into my post didnt youthe wreck ownership refes to the owner of the loot not the salvagepve  loot belongs to ratter  wreck flagged as his because loot is spawned and had no prior player owner pvp  loot belongs to victim  wreck flagged as his because loot has a player owner whom just lost his ship but not his ownership rightsthere are some anomalies like shooting empty wrecks true they should be adressed so everybody could destroy an empty wreck erm yes it is so your point being regarding thisedit spelling
hunhow many times do the devs have to say no to this for you to accept that its not going to change were up to 6 or 7 flat refusals from them already with supporting explainations but apparently thats not enough for you whats the magic number how many times do they have to say salvage is free for all before you accept it as a fundamental part of the gamejust let go of the apparent inconsistency eve is full of inconsistencies  its notorious for it in fact but one thing that ccp has remained consistent on is that consistency is not as important as game balanceccp prismx said noone with any perspective thinks that hisec mission rewards should be increased that is what is at the heart of this issue you need to make a case for mission runners deserving better rewards if you want to reserve the salvage rights for themgood luck with that seriously man just accept it and be happy with your bounty mission reward loot standings loyalty points and a head start on the salvage
this is terrible did you read what i said above your post does not say why it is bad to do thisyou post does not say why it should be that way it is it just describes how it currently works if you do not read even the first page of the thread just do not postthe entire point is that if it is illogical and does not make sense it should be changedno it refers to the entire wreck because other person cannot shoot the empty wreck now for some reason you can destroy my wreck byother means salvagingthis is irrelevant as i am not asking for a pay increasecan anyone tell me a valid reason why i shouldnt be able to shoot a ninja looter not just state that i sould not but state why
oh man now just anomalies when just one simple person can destroy those wrecks without concorded ddddwhat about your tractor beam why cant pulling my wrecks  d because belongs to multiplayers  ddddddddno because belongs to killer  thats it not anomaliesinfo panel tagged for killers wreck tagged for killers for tractor beam and not tagged for anyone else i told just destroy those wrecks in high sec if belongs to everyone if belongs pve rats if do you wantbut cant because your post as i told megafail and you just making ones apologies nothing otheryou keep silent about the parasites of course and one other thing morethe ninja salvager earn more money than mission runner without riska blockade time for an 610 months old charater is 3035 minutes with one ship earn 1820 million from bountya ninja salvager earn from salvage items if he just salvage the bs wrecks in mission 610 millions under 10 minute or shorter time and not need 2 months learning timeand the parasite ninjasalvager not waste his ammo not need 100 millions for battleship with full modules etcso ninjasalvager parasites worsen from agentrunner because they earn more money without risk from the work of other ones
kids let me tell you a storya long long time ago when you killed something in eve there was a can with loot wich belonged to nooneif you dropped a can it belonged to noone miners got their ore stolen and couldnt do anything about itthen the carebears started to whine about people stealing their stuffccp changed itand now carebears defend their cans and get killed doing soor they ignore the thief and whine even more on the forumsnow we have the same problem with salvagedo i support the change to ownership of salvage hell yes 
you can read ccps view on ninja salvagers here
please explain me the purpose of this post it does not contribuyte anything to the discussion i am well aware of ccps opinion on this if you did not know this game is for players csm is there for a reason this forum is there for a reason if we clearly state that this has to be done and give good reason for it it will be implemented ccp isnt making a game for the hell of it it is for subscribers mechanics get outdated and times change now times changed the mecanics need to be changed there is nothing that cant be done if we raise our voice as onethat is exactly what i want the smart mission runners that know how to protect themselves will get rewarded the smart ninja salvagers will make even more cash the stupid ninja salvagers will suffer the stupid mission runners will suffer smart people get rewarded that is what i want to happen there is no longer excess salvage lying around therefore there is no need for mechanics where you can salvage everything now salvage is a valuable resource that players are competing for but it is not a good competition when it is all about who will click the button salvage first lets let the cannons speak almost every singe character has ability to salvage so there is no need to it to be the way it was it is time for a change now can all thick sculled people that have nothing to say except that ccp will not change it leave i dont ask for concord protecting salvage i ask for concord to stop protecting ninja salvagers and i cannot see how they deserve this protection
its not meant to its meant to reinforce my point that the discussion is meaningless ninja salvagers are exactly what ccp had in mind when they created salvage in the first place theyre not an error or a mistake or a problem theyre an intended result
i have an easy solutionspawn the loot can separate from the wreck now there is clearly no ownership on the wreck only on the loot can viola problem solved
this issue is one that bugs me not because people ninja piracy is piracy and its spice to the gamewhat bothers me is the available recourse to the player stolen fromive run small corps and allowed ninja work to happen however ive always had the standing rule that if you are to ninja a wreck you are required to take loot toothe issue isnt the salvage being taken the issue is there is no recourse if loot is stolen the pve player has the option of bringing his corp in and smacking around the ninja if the ninja gets a pvp ship out so much the betterso if there is a change that needs made in my opinion it would be to simply block the ability of a salvaging module to lock onto a wreck that doesnt belong to do while youre in a noob corpat least that way if you get people stealing wrecks they are in a war decable corp and your corp has an option do deal with themin my view the real issue are the pirates that hide in noob corps like cowards
that is exactly the issue ninja salvager is not attackable or declarable if he comes in and steals you loot you cant shoot him declare war on himhe is absolutely invulnerable unless you want to suicide gank himdeveldrin i repeat my question again why should the ninja salvagers make as much money as mission runner after just 2 days of training and be completely invulnerable and risk free i might not understand much but the little that i do know is that ccp did not mean to create an activity that is easier and more profitable then lvl 4 mission running while being absolutely risk freeevery single activity in eve has a risk to it even mining and trading the market you can get can flipped suicide ganked or prices might not behave as you predicted and you will loose isk it is a effortskill vs reward and risk all except ninja salvagers this is the only profession that involves absolutely no risk and brings more cash then mission running with no skill involved 2 day training
actually ninja salvaging isnt that profitable especially after the new rigs went in and the salvage prices fell it takes time to scan down a bs all to get just a wreck or two if the mission runner has half a brainthen you have the ability to warp in and out causing the salvager to use more time the time to isk return on ninja work is pathetic i can make more isk running level 1sthe mission runner is going to make more than twice the isk on the first bounty payoutsalvage isnt that valuableof course then there is the ultimate solution train to a marauder and salvage as you go or learn aggro control and use an alt to salvage if no wrecks are on the field there is nothing to be lostin that regard its like mining into a can foolish
your question is based on the mistaken assumption that salvage belongs to you before you actually salvage it that assumption has already been addressed ad neaseum in this thread im not going to rehash it with you again
why would you answer a question that clearly shows that you are wrong
i think i should really support this thread now and then get tons of popcorn for all the i shot the ninja salvager and he killed my faction fitted faction bs threads what do you think
you havent given a good reason for it other then the old reason of the salvage is mine and i want the isk from it ccp feels that mission runners make to much isk already be thankful that they have made level 4 missions easier and faster to runmy experience with mission runners when it comes to taking loot has been the followingthe stupid ones shoot and the smart ones dontif ccp makes it a flaggable offense for taking salvage out of a wreak its just going to be a lot more of the same nine times out of ten that lone rifter taking your loot has five guys in the next system over with bigger and badder ships then yours who have shieldarmor repping bots just hoping for you to pull that trigger and stupid enough to not watch local all because of a little salvage
this
ok now this is getting personal first of all i want to make it clear that i am not a carebare mission runner i might not be a professional pvper but now lets respond to you post1st of all i do need have to be grateful for ccp making missions faster as i barely run missions 2nd out of all missions that i ever ran i never had any salvage stolen so ninja salvagers do not decrease my income in any way so letting me shoot them would not increase my income ofcource if you are dumb enough to shoot something you cannot kill you will probably die that is obvious i cannot see how that is bad what do you say if i wait for 4 of my corpmates to arrive in pvp ships i do not shoot what i cannot kill or at least what i cannot escapeyou know that i could do it just another way round station a small fleet run a few mission in a hub and wait for someone dumb enough to take the salvage even if he has 20 friends 910 times they would arrive too late  my reason is that ninja salvaging is completely off the scale on reward vs risk vs skill required like comparing to all other professions i still do not see any reason for ninja salvager to be protected by concord
ok maxsim you would think absolution vs hurricane  the command ship will come out on top wont you or your super mission battleship with almost 1000 dps will also beat the battlecruisercommandshipbattleship the ninja lootersalvager throws at you it would nohint the absolution lost to the hurricane neut and tracking disruptors ftwand so did many of the guys in battleships to the much smaller ships often you cant really say my ship will beat his
you know competent mission runners can make 20mil in an hour or less off bounties alone right risk dcing doing something stupid and dying i really doubt that ninja salvagers make thatthe risks for ninja salvaging have already been outlined somewhere else and i dont feel like going into it
it is not up to the detractors to prove their point it is up to you to prove beyond the standard hurrrr the wreck shows up as mine in the overview so therefore salvaging is clearly broken nothing you have posted shows that this is an idea of such grandness that having ccp rewrite their code is called for though honestly im quite fond of my the wrecks should belong to the npc corp idea but it would make tractor beams useless so i guess it is not such a good idea
we would have already checked who you have in the surrounding systems and good luck in getting 4 of your buddies sitting around doing nothing while you run a mission hoping that a ninja salvager would come in in my experience most mission running corps will not do this they get bored after about 10 minutesagain good luck with stationing a small fleet on the off chance someone will get into your mission and ninja salvage it they will get bored real fast and if the people getting into your mission do it specifically to farm mission runners they will not arrive to late the guy in the salvage ship will be able to tank you long enough for them to show up they will be watching local specifically for your small fleet and will disengage if local spikes to muchi am just telling you based on my experience in farming mission runners what will happen if you get your way in getting salvaging to be a flagging offense i hope you do get your way there are a lot more stupid mission runners then there are smart ones and the stupid ones seem to always have faction mods on their ships
ill say yes that means therell be more idiots to shoot my salvaging ship and more people losing their valuable mission ships
where is this i havent seen thisthey really dont the extra 1520 is easily defeated by overloading andor simply making them run away which breaks transversal and kills you at the same time the speed can actually muck things upthe difference is noticable for the snakes the advantage isnt there really as you still need to operate in the 20km range this is why from a game balance pov it isnt unbalancedthe ishkur goes from 39m to 30m the small weapons generally go from near full hit from size to 34 hits which isnt that bad though in my experience its more of a tracking issue most of the timethey generally will benefit with the other implants crystals vs slaves for examplepretty sure they commented that due to their sig you pretty much cant get lock fast enough to stop those bombs from happening not that the command link necessarily will improve that not to mention pirate implants arent exactly allowed in the tourny
i totally agree with mynxee on this finally people are putting forward the fact that csm should be proactive in their approach as a body to do good rather than harm and without the need of assistance from ccp all games are to some degree a sandbox in which the players can create and destroy empires based on the actions on one or more people for example take that eve university group that teaches new players how to play the game they have by no small feat achieved something even csm has failed to do and without any assistance from ccp might i add perhaps its time someone builds up another corporation that teaches people about csm and its importance and the importance of continued education of csm and evefurthermore i dont post on any other characters and i think ccp should make it that you must elect one and only one character to troll the forums with
you guys are supposed to be player representatives not some kind of junior game designers you know that right  ccp has plenty of qualified payed experienced people doing that if youre going to bring your own personal ideeas to the table instead of what the community actually wants we might as well disband the whole damn thing if you want a job at ccp apply for that insteadas far as im concerned csm members shouldnt even be allowed to make any kind of proposal that is not directly related to the internal workings of the csm meetings because  like this happens they post a thread about it they ignore all feedback and decide ofcourse that their proposal is awesome and should be brought to the devs attentionwhy even post threads like this at all  next time just ask your own alliance on the internal forums what would help them most and what kind of insider information theyd like to have thats all you guys are good for anyway officialising the kind of crap the csm was initially thought to prevent
can ccp do anything about losing drones when disconnecting even if its only in missionsi think ive lost 4 or 5 sets of ogres in the last 2 days 
after you come out of emergency warpfly back to your drones  right click on them  scoop to drone bay  donenon issue and yes i am heavily using drones myself but i usually forget more drones to lets fly to next belt and forgetting to pull my pets
vincent when i was in the csm we brought this issue up ccp is going to fix this and said the fix should be relatively simplewell see i dont expect them to take too long on this issue as this is a pretty common complaint
op seems to be losing these drones to mission rats doesnt take mission rats long to shoot down stationary ogres so there are none left to scoop up when you reconnect
unfortunately ccp takes their sweet time with some complaints no matter how popular i mean without knowing how many employees they have and exactly how many active projects they have going it still seems like they could allocate a few coders for couple weeks to little issues like this
how about thisyour redock timer after aggro is your signature radius simple fixmaybe adjust it a little bit so a bs isnt stuck outside of a station for 10 minutes but enough to keep them in space for a bit and make capitals killable inside dock radius
just adding rr  agro would work just fine for caps at stations thanks
the lolsilly 15 minutes suggested would make it practically unfeasible for everyone in a noncloaky ship and a life to actually you know pvp so you get a hearty bugger off from methe ehp was lower argument fails to mention that the timer was lower too and 1 minute is really enoughcapitals are killable on stationthe only time you really have a problem is when youve got rr gangs and such fighting other rr gangs and they deaggrojump but if you cant break the rr to kill a single bs in the timeframe capital rrs excepted but meh for breaking everything to be able to do capital rr gang station hugging gotry you cant break the rr anyway
disallow any offensiveremote module activation within docking range no more docking games no more lame neutral docking rr no more need for undock camps problem solvedtreating a symptom is never better than destroying the disease
great idea especially the individual timer
yes do this help channels are full of these spammers and it takes way to long to report them having it log the post thats reported would be great for helping to prevent people reporting innocents
good idea but what if you get people who report falsely
supported only if ccp is sane about itit needs to log at least 5 lines before and after the reported spam it needs to log who is marked as the spammer as well as who did the reporting ccp needs to clearly adopt some sort of policy to allow them to automatically ignore accounts that are repeatedly wrong when they report spammersi think they do all of this anyway within the petition system so perhaps the best idea would be to simply auto fill in the required petition with the relevant information before the player gets an ok button to send itright click done is nice until your mouse aim is off dont forget about all the people who play while intoxicated p gms have to sift through all that insanity
if it were me doing the program id handle it in two phasesfirst there has be a threshold to what flags you as a isk spammersay if 25 players report you in 30 seconds then you and everyone on your ip address gets muted for 6 hours and the logs forwarded to ccp to verify the truth on the matterthat said it shouldnt ban your account so if a bunch of goons decide to hop on a public and target people then they wont be auto banned from the game but rather mute you publicly for a whilethat said if you constantly flag someone like this who is not a gold spammer ccp she take the privileged away from you or mute the person who reports falselyand when ccp has reviewed the logs and determined the isk spammer is really one he bans the account rather than mutes it revoking all transactions from that ip
i like it that said it should only copy the post in question into an automated petitionand maybe do a 20minute block if thats not too much work no bans no mutes just a petition let the gms ban you if you need banning
there is a thread in general discussion where there is a guy asking why he cannot use ecm to stop a guy from cargo scanning his ship to determine if he would be a good suicide gank targetnow being able to randomly ecm folks without it causing concord intervention sounds like a bad idea all around with that being said why not have cargo or ship scanning generate aggro and not corp wide aggro either just between the scanned pilot and the scanneryou dont like your ship getting scanned you can do something about it and scanning everything as it passes by suddenly becomes a bit more hazardousso what say you all good idea to help try and curb the suicide gank rate well the targeted ganksthe random ones wont be covered
no scanning should not trigger aggression just stop flying on autopilot if your stuff is of any value if you use ap you deserve to be suicide ganked
while im sure youd relish this change zedrik others would notjust remember that agro is a two way street if the hauler pilot decides to go and ecm his scanner hell a change like this would make me go and train my alt for a bustard and fit a rack of remote eccm onto it given the amount of grief that the change to can flipping mechanics created i think on balance the carebears dont know whats good for them and should leave things as they are
why is this a problem are absolutely zero miners and zero haulers existing in eve because 100 of them are being suicide ganked i see the smartbombing bs gangs in jita and more often than not they dont kill a darned thing and i km  for great justicethe thing is that cargomodule scanning is not an offensive action and should not be the same punishment as stealinglastly this will cause more lame high sec aggro problems like pilots freaking out when someone goes red and shoots a beam at them but isnt really attacking etc etc
i posted this idea here a long time ago but i explained in a bit more detailgot a lot of support and didnt see that eaven mentioned by the csm later onso again supporting mythis idea and also i dont think im the first or that the op is the last to think of thisand hope someone in the csm notices this this time around so we atleat get an official answereditdid a searchmy thread on this
ability to set mass sell orders up on different items on the basis of market average and lowest sell price would be cool
i think initially is dont get too complicated or it will never get through just something simple to start with then constant improvements thereafterlets get it in there first
it will never happen i think the database hamsters would go on strike if it was implementednot sure what use it would be as you would be throwing away insane amounts of money over timea majority of buyorders are a fraction of the realmineral value of items so a multisell would just line the pockets of the profiteerscheck the buyorders for anything not best named and youll see what i mean even a taxedtodeath reprocess is better than the nickels and dimes on offer for most items
well the point people have made is that they have they options to decide what to sell for etc and not just sell from buy orders the point the ops is making and which i agree is that we just want the ability to sell multiple items at the same time so supported
would be a welcome addition
yes please
vv
let me start by saying i love the way local works in whs id love to see the same mechanic applied to 00 but the idea has been shot down enough times that i wont waste time suggesting it againinstead how about something of a compromise i suggest removing covops cloaked ships from local keep the local count uptodate but remove cloaking individuals from the list doing this players will still be able to tell that there are cloaked ships in system but they wont be getting free intel on pilots who really should be invisible im also hoping that this might give blackops ships some love as a fuel bay just doesnt seem to do it
i agree with this and have suggested similar beforecov ops cloaks being removed from local makes total sense they are supposed to be cov ops after all no point to black ops if everyone can just look in localit would allow people to truly do sneak attacks and stealth missions
watereddown solution full recent speakers mode local in 00 is the best option by far
watered down sure after seeing the flame fests that anyone suggesting applying wh local to nullsec im not eager to go down that path i also think covops ships should have a bit more going for them other than being able to warp while cloaked and some sort absence from local might do the trick i really want to see blackops used on an alliance scale and a change like this may encourage thatill have a look though to find the idea you mentionededit forgot the switch to liao xxedit two i think youre talking about this
fwiw so were warp to 0 and the skill queueill support this idea though anything that takes away from the reliability of local as an intelligence tool is a step in the right direction as far as im concerned
how about a change to this ideathere already is a fleet align optionit just dosent align a fleet it just brodcasts a marker for alignmenthow aboutwhen a player sees the broadcast to align to he just has to cick on it and his ship alignscurrently the broadcast is useless because if the fc uses it you spend more time searching for it on the screen than aligningso noone uses it insted they use voice and then you have people who dont speak english well and eaven worse fcs who dont speak english well sound problems bad mics etc etc
i like it its an interesting twist on the idea
i love this idea d
sorry not supportedwe shouldnt need to write in tools to compensate for lack of discipline of individual pilots in a fleet
not supported honestly we shouldnt even have the warp squadwingfleet option its too easy to misclick and ps off a bunch of fleet membersnot that i know from experience or anything 
the reason you see vet rewards in other mmos is because they are trying to hold onto their subscriberstake ultima online for example since it started losing its playerbase around 20022003 its been throwing vet rewards and holiday rewards game anniversary rewards etc at the players its gotten to the point that the vetern players still playing uo have started ing because they still havent gotten this years gifts pi dont think eve has a subscription problem and im not sure a shiny new module or ship that would nevereverever leave the hanger would draw in new players or keep those intent on leaving
sentry drones uses 25m3 each my proposal is to reduce the size of them to 15m3 on bonused gallente ships on this way u can carry some more sentry drones in the dronebays so that they will be used more oftensentry drones have different optimals and for pvepvp it requirs sometimes to carry 2 different types expecialy t2 versions a set of 5 takes 125m3 a third of the dronebay on l4 skills sentry drones get left behindkilled alot because they cant move very fast back to the drone bay it would only apply on the ishtar dominix sin eos
so were going to unbalance these four ships so you can carry more sentries sorry no by your own example on the dominix i assume youre only using up a third of your drone bay to carry a set of 5 which tells me you can carry at least two flights of sentries plus one of the followinga a flight of heaviesb a flight of mediums  2 flights of lightsc a flight of lights  2 flights of mediumsd a third flight of sentrieswhat the hell else do you need
ditto the previous if anything i would argue that the sentries needs a slight increase in size to reconcile against the fact that long range guns use more pg to fithere lets get back to a reasonable change request i request that your characters name be chanced to caldari citizen blah because cick lunt is simply a letter transposition to a series of words in direct violation of the games tos
eve is about making decisions and compromisesnot supported
this has been brought up in a related article csm term limits page 5 which is concerned with gaining greater coverage presented before the masses of eve online so that everyone not just a few big alliances and independent voters with spare time on their hands can understand and comment on csm issueshere are the current problems which have caused this issuepoor eve online search browserlack of ingame advertising a simple popup randomly on the startup screen isnt enoughlack of structure information about csmthe search function on eve is a joke lets face it who here will try to rebut that i can search for a friends posts by typing his name into the search bar and ill get about 50000 hits his name isnt smith so what the hell is the go recommendation is to improve the search function like ccp is doing with the mail system etc or remove the requirement to search related articlesthe second issue is that the only advertising for csm i have seen is a random popup that comes up maybe once or twice a half year for me does this really get the message across that ccp wants our ideas and opinions imo not really advertising should be a consistent thing especially for something important like csm unless its not important like i would have a lot of people now believelastly evelopedia is a shocking mess im more comfortable reading the australian tax legistation acts than i am with evelopedia and if anyone has seen the itaa 36 they know what im talking about a simple restructuring so that everything important is given a title for examplepurpose of csmthe purpose of csm is tobenefits of csmpolicies csm must followfurthermore the csm link given on the eve website has very little information because it is most concerned with elections rather than providing information
structureetc of the csm is ever evolving and the people working on it 1 year from now will not be the people you are talking to now the people on the csm 3 do things completely different then the 1st and 2nd csm do things csm 4 will probably also do things completely different csm 5 is right outwith everything turning on its head over and over again you are not going to get solid documentation much less documentation that is accurate or up to date organization of the evelopedia is not the major issue we asked for a devblog to write about our experiences and what we did and we havent gotten it yet we dont really have a lot of tools to get the word out except to a few people who are interested and paying plenty of attention in the first place
mazz explain to me how not having a devblog is keeping the csm from documenting its own work because i dont get it there are any number of mechanisms you could use for that blogs the wiki the forums come on also there are plenty of channels for getting the word out that dont involve ccp doing the work for you twitter facebook links in your ingame bio other everelated forums and web sites the blogging community ingame channels do you guys ever even consider these alternativesto the op the problem of players being unaware of the csm or how to engage in the process of being officially heard by them has little to do with ty forum search functionality it has everything to do with a nonexistent effort to reach players share information and encourage their contributions in making eve online a better game certainly ccp could use official channels to help correct that but even if they didnt lift a finger the csm delegates are empowered and in my view have the primary responsibility for doing it themselvespersonally id like to see the csm charter require delegates to contact a minimum number of different players ingame each month to share information about csm just a quick chat to share key links and answer a few questionssimilar to the way in which isd stars greet new players to make sure they have the info they need to get started if each of the 9 delegates contacted 25 players thats 225 players a month who become informed how many will they then inform what might be the impact over the course of a year with such a proactive approach theres nothing like personal contact to make a memorable impression and encourage folks to get involvedalso why is there no official csm chat channel ingame can csm delegates not be trusted to conduct conversations with players in a civilized fashion are csm delegates too busy to talk to players do csm simply not want to interact with players any delegate for whom those answers are yes is unworthy of their position in my viewas for the wiki any active account can log in there and edit its pages add categories etc taking the initiative is all thats needed this entire issue is a real hot button with me because it all ties into my philosophy of how csm delegates should do their jobsone expectation of which is that they be very proactively engaged with the player base i am disappointed that doesnt seem to be happening and really tired of hearing excuses about ccp not providing tools and support stop relying on ccp and make use of alternatives just get on with it
argonis totally agree with you with cosmos coming hopefully all those issues will be solvedfor 1st two terms we were using ankh wiki and then at the end we migrated to eve wiki but i think that we are still missing some issues on eve wikimynx  i a
if csm is incapable of writing a clearly structured format for all csm which contains the vital information about csm from its activities to the conflict due to its incentives then all csm delegates should be removed from office and new ones elected eve online has massive super corporations that act much like business i know i invest in some we have share market websites player video advertising almost every decent corporation in eve also has the following corp website vent forums wiki some killboardas for the search function it wasnt to improve player information but to actually find articles on eve that your looking for eves search function is like typing in raven and getting hits for baby lotionits ridiculous and needs a serious overhaul
poor troll 210problem with structure maintained by delegates is what will happen after 6 months when delegates running mail server wiki forums googlesheets or whateva leave the office there was never lack of will of csm to maintain their own tools as csm 1 and 2 had their own wiki and csm 1 had their own emails but if csm needs to migrate all of data every 6 months its huge waste of time especially cause we were promised certain tools by ccp which was supposed to be implemented soontmor even better you can run for csm and ifwhen you get elected you can give a shiny example to all of previous and future candidates how csm should operate
i would like to point out that the evelopedia can be edited by anybody with an active eve accountget crackin op
didnt think you could anyway going to look into thatfurthermore on vuks post are you implying that your incapable of structuring the basic details which never change for csm specifically purpose of csm benefits of csm delegates etc i consider that ive explored quite a bit of the eve website in search of csm information compared to the avg user and earlier even i didnt know that csm delegates received free subscription  only the payment of travel accom and meal expenses the amount of money ccp invests in csm is ridiculous for the little work weve actually seen occur in comparison to other volunteer fields such as isd etc
are u incapable of reading what i am trying to explain you basic structure of csm is there and exist from day one till now there were always delegates who were doing two terms in a row so there was not much problems with basic procedures tbh if u go tru couple of meetings minutes u will be familiar with the way csm is operating also there is more information here and even more herewhen it comes to the tools for csm i firmly believe they need to be provided and owned by ccp to prevent any potential problems or misuse of data which will be stored there and if you are just mad cause of 9 ppl who sacrifice their free time to make game better on the best way they know get trip to iceland and 6 months of game time free then i can only recommend u to run for csm again take place from those incapable delegates and prove you can do the job better
argonis valentio trolling the csm and calling for the disbanding of the csm at the drop of a hat ittweve already given you the answer if you cant understand or dont want to understand we cant really help you any further if you think you can do a super good job you should try to get yourself elected you definitely have the charismai didnt know we got a free subscription until they sent me an email directly saying i got subbed but its really a tiny amount of value compared to the trip to iceland and just to make sure that every csm member can show up for meetings during their termtheres only a couple of constants for the csm we tell ccp to do stuff and ccp tell us yes or no we also get free trips to iceland
where are the benefits csm receive clearly outlined in the document hidden among the data you will find the free trip to iceland etc but you have to be looking for it furthermore the 6 month subscription isnt even listed in there under sensitive topics such as the one mazz raised earlier players dont have full information which often enough can lead to major lapses in judgmentfurthermore heres a bit from the scope of csm this requires active engagement with the player community to master eve issue awareness understanding and evaluation in the context of the greatest good for the greater player base where are the policies and procedures ccp has put in place to prevent the abuse of such a systemthe ccp council is responsible in part for preventing this because they review the work of csm however here is a section under the role of the ccp council it is however necessary for the csm to prioritize its topics should the ccp council not be able to accommodate a reply to all topics i would like to now point out the obvious flaw in this approach theres no one monitoring to see if csm are doing their job for examplei become a csm representative and i want to extend the time of a term from 6 months to 3 years i create a topic to push it through it goes to the csm delegation and passed how do i hide the obvious lack of eve player support for the issue i create a list of the lowsupport topics and prioritize them based on support i dont place the least support on my priority list because then it would seem blatantly obvious but i choose something in the middle now i and the other csm delegates have a good list of prioritized supportlacking topics for ccp to shuffle through making the absurdly unsupported topic seem normal while you may be genuine in trying to make the game better i can tell you there are a lot of people who dont want to do you think the accoutants for enron had the best interests of shareholders at heartim not saying i would do a better job in fact i might do a better job by making sure i do the worst possible thing so that ccp is forced to review the csm tbh that could possibly be the best thing you could do for a company like ccp what i am saying is that everything of significance about a topic should be brought to light even if it seems like the most unlikely contributors to the decision to be made basically more accountabilityas for mazz yes i believe the csm should be disbanded the truth is assembly hall is nothing more than the features and ideas forum the only difference is that elected players spoon feed ccp with dribble such as extended terms csm is a face for ccp to say that they respect the players they could do this simply by giving a damn when it comes to customer support services etcwant examples heres the only moderated thread on this forum which is supposed to be moderated constantly for off topictroll
re your first part it doesnt work like that every issue is considered and no issues are rubberstamped just because of their position on the priority listre your second part you are throwing a fit on the forums i think you ought to do it the drama will be awesomesupporting this thread for throwing a fit
lets focus onto this cause this is something which bothers you the mostpossibility a ccp are s so when csm says give us 3 year terms shares of ccp and huge fish tank for each delegate they will just agree with that and in 6 months you will have darius and myself sitting in ccp ceo office while nathan and hilmar will massage our feetpossibility b ccp knows their job so when csm bring some utterly selfish of stupid issue they will just say noktnxbyethe fact is that csm has no actual power in decision making whatsoever ofc if 9 of us scream that something is horribly wrong ccp will for sure think about it but ccp has final word on any issue we raise back to your subjectthere is remote possibility that in the future csm will be consisted of 9 horrible delegates ccp will for sure be aware of that so dont worry your game is safe from glory chasing csm delegates

its a bit cumbersome but its so rarely relevant there are times i buysell from 34 orders at once and i generally just trade with the last order on the list and let it fill from the top three as well oh no i spend an extra 2 isk on my halfdozen battlecruisers i cant see this mattering enough to be worth the extra lag or the annoyance of players having to learn the different system sure thered be plenty of harm the eve markets make millions of transactions per day you want to incorporate an extra check into every single one of them the server people would hate you besides it wouldnt help anything  people would just trade with alts if they had any reason to do it in the first place my point being that while you and i pay fees to trade on the nyse there are people who dont and theyre usually the ones with the hefty wallets i dont know the exact mechanics but im pretty sure that most stock markets charge fees by the year not by the trade in other words the marginal cost to a selftrade is zero in eve its about 1 depending on skills and standings if anyone was going to try to manipulate a real stock market with selftrading theyd be someone big enough to have their own traders naturally meaning itd cost them nothing hence rules in eve it costs and were also entirely accepting of things like insider trading that would land you in jail irl if you pay the broker fee i see your order when i do a market search if you dont i dont that sounds like advertising to me and if it forced people to accept the posted prices thered be nobody actually posting those orders in the first place judging by the fact that it works just fine id have to say that your criticism is misplaced
more like people will just go to motsu instead of staying in gallente space amirite
if you run for the agents in dodixie at any real rate you lose access to the ones in motsu
stupid idea would only lead to even more imbalance in the militia numbers no carebear will suddenly start to pvp to keep his mission income they will just sell the character and buy a new one or create a new one exclusively for mission runningwith the minmax attitude of players newly rolled characters would be more likely to be running caldari missions thus we end up with a ton of players that have the standings for caldari fw and very few with those for gallente fwive got another idea though for improving rewards that also would solve the problem of overcrowded mission hubsif a faction occupies a hostile station system have the stations change ownership to a corporation of the occupying faction and move the highest quality lvl4 agent of that corporation there only moving agents from highsec space no shuffling around lowsec agentsrewards will be improved as the missions are gonna take place in lowsec instead of highsec
you are in fact rite
1the idea does have merit though imho there should be some sort of economic knock on effect that carries over into hisec through occupancyedit i will add while the squeeze on bears under the proposed solution will not push them into pvp some of the mo
the ability for csm delegates to tie up meeting time with frivilous concerns is similar to the filibuster ability of the us legislative branch while i think a lot of these issues being presented by certain candidates are pretty inane they are who we voted into office and were suffering for the vocal minority even the largest alliance has a mere 2 of the total playerbaseccp designed the csm as ambassadors between the company and the players and thats all we are ccp still has their own release schedule and will continue to be their own think tank as well this is not to say that the csm is without power but youd deceive yourself if you think ccp gives them any more power than any member of ccp has individually were simply spokespersons and i was honored to fill that role during my term
not supported the purpose of the csm is to bring up player concerns their own ideas are just as valid as a forum is a bad place to have this sort of conversation anywaybut all of this pales to one basic fact ccp owns the game their ideas come first their desires come first they will do whatever they want to do and no amount of player complaining is going to change thatyou can say well im a paying customer they have to do what i want and your logic is flawed you subscribed to their content ccp defines that content and the day it stops being entertainment your real vote is to desub when ccp sees mass amounts of new accounts pouring in after a change they assume success mass accounts leaving they assume failurethe csm means nothing this forum means nothing its all in the money
haha me and my dozens of alts support this
hey where is my public outrage for raising this csm issue that got very little public supportit only got 2 supports omganyways this will show up in the next meeting
1im adam ridgway
no youre not
i am ingame support the thread at leastps i sell you the char if youw ant it 
you cant raise this issue before it is week old
whos your main bro you can keep the char i do enjoy being stalkedbut yeah good idea
noopenid would allow you to securely login to other sites using your eve credentials without exposing themthen using oauth the 3rd party site can make hits to the eve api on your behalf without any further api keys or the likeopensocial allows you to run social graph aware applications that can be installed on any social networkthese technologies are the basis for any social network being built today there is no one except ccp considering doing a social network without these technologiesa crapton of existing contentworktechnology out there and ccp is rolling their ownso ccp is making a calendar great why not just implement opensocial so i can choose from the 5000 existing calendar applicationsccp will be in the same boat theyre in now in another 8 months dealing with a custom built nonstanard system that doesnt play well with othersthe other half of the picture is most of the features of the social network are only accessable using the igbit could all be done in any browser all browsers including igb instead everything is locked into igb no choice
heres some scenarios for the nontechaim at the office i have an idea i want to add it to my calendar i cant open the black background ccp site at workreal worldi open up my google homepage and add it to the calendar app running there or on my desktop or whereever it might bethese changes then appear on my avatarsunited facebook myspace and cosmos pages instantlyccps worldi write it down on paper and remember to add it when i get homebim browsing an eve related site and encounter a showinfo linkreal worldi click it and the eve addon to my browser sends the command to my eve clientccps worldi click it and get a javascript errorcopy paste the url open another browser ingame renavigate to the same page click it againci wish to write a web application for eve usersreal worldi can choose opensocial and will be able to install the application in many different containerssocial features for little extra work user registrationconfirmationlogin is all handled for youi can use oauth to access the api without further api keysi can interact with the eve client from any browserccps worldyou must rewrite your application to use proprietry hooks provided it can not be installed on any social networksit will not work in any other browser except igbusers must register confirm separatelydi have an existing application id like to use with the eve social networkreal worldinstall it opensocial will understand itccps worldrewrite it just for ccpyou cant install it on the social networkyoull need to write all the user management and your own social featuresmissing out on so much potentialits quite amazing that someone could decide to make a social network without properly investigating the technologies that all social networks are using
i think youre exagerating any site can check if the client is the igb or not so theres no reason for you to ever get javascript errors cosmos as a ccp site will have internal access to the eve database beyond what is safe to be exposed through the eve api or sent through igb headers so theres no reason for cosmos to be dependant on the igb and not available on other browsers having third party apps access the game client directly is a horrible ideea
im sure i am just putting a spin on it to show how poor things can turn outjust lack of functionality insteadnot so much that its dependant on igb but that half the stuff only works in itno more access then is provided to a web page when the igb is used just the methods like showinfo
i dont really have that many suggestionsok heres a few more taped materials released after fanfest when someone from the audience asks a question you should give them the mic even though they may be perfectly audible during the session way more people are probably going to view it on youtube later you need to make sure the taping works for them i dont know if theres still stuff that just hasnt had enough time to be released yet but if thats all there was there should be more events taped and released
the only suggestion i have is to move the venue from year to year ie iceland england then the usa this will give many more people an opportunity to attend fanfest btw i will be attending next years fanfest but as an australian its gonna cost me 8k aud approx which is out of most ppls reach for a 3 day event if it was in england i could do the same trip for half that
look carefully folks you wont see moderation like this on this forum for perhaps another year furthermore i would like to point out that what develdron and drake draconis said are considered trolling and off topic whats the definition ccp is using for thatanyway so that this post doesnt get wiped clean by ccp heres my suggestionsfanfest guide whats coming up  so that we dont have to wait on a live feed for the next show

yeah i never need to see someones picture it is completely useless
that is what i meant when i did my edit on my op option to go from the current state to my slim suggestion players preference

the reason i brought this up is because im not a mission runner by heart but ive had to recently endure the tedious task of building corporation rep to get my research agents running efficiently what i have noticed is that all the rewards are the same mainly geared towards mission runners and a few being all implants geared to the general population thats fantastic but id rather see something more interesting here are a list of examplesr  d corporations rewardslike carthum conglomerateoriginal blueprints for general items based on the corporation ie caracal for caldari rd stabber for minnie rdcopy blueprints for t2 modulesships at different ql than invention or similar lp for these items would have to reflect a week or more of grindingexplorationmining etc sites bookmark that you can exchange for lp  this doesnt guarantee that someone hasnt pilfered it before youstorage  distribution corporations such as imperial shipment  amarrfree hauling done by the npc corporations new feature would be supercargo expansion rigs and modules and perhaps faction types including t2mining corporationsminerals  oreindustrial shipsmining shipsexhumers  bpcsmining modules and gearmining implants onlymilitary corporationsall the current crapi understand that the old mission running system will eventually be kaput due to the new epic arcs but that is far into the future lets face it not many have been introduced yet that means that these kinds of rewards can still be a reality
one thing that im hoping to see happen because of the walking in stations expansion is the adding of human characters in fanmade aswell as ccpmade machinima without using third party software such as halflife 2 im hoping the expansion will also increase the amount of machinima being made this wouldnt really be a direct feature of the expansion but more a consequence although im sure there are things that ccp could do to make it as easy as possible to use walking in stations in the creation of compelling machinima additions to facilitate this would also facilitate roleplaying within the game itself so you hit two birds with one stone im thinking about such things as roleplay oriented character animations and such
im not sure what voice of the people you are intending to represent but your only intention with your fail post in cp was to keep your macrogame griefing multibillion pve fits easily from getting nerfedalso get new ss dudei have a more effective strategyvote lady spank for csm or 1000 puppies will meet with an unfortunate accident irl ingame
ooh perhaps if i like it ill sell you my vote for well make me an offer
actually if someone sends 10 million isk my way ill be more agreeable to their credentials
well thanks to logit probits efforts at least one person emoraged in the scope so much he went on to immediately prove that not only he is a clueless newbie 2008 or so player so take newbie as hopeless noob not as new player with a attitude problem but wishes to remain a clueless newbie with a attitude problema short excerpt from chatdont shoot ninja looters theyre just trying to get you to aggro them so they can kill your shipbut he was stealing my lootlook its done to gank people if you shoot ninja looters they will gank youbut he was stealing my lootif you shoot you will not only lose your loot but your shipbut he was stealing my lootmy lootepicfor that he gets my vote

youre on to mealso i have many many screenshots but im saving them for the next phase of my campaign send logit to iceland angry mission runners youve earned itthe nice thing about eve is that i dont have to care about your norms because there are plenty of others to choose from id prefer to keep eve that way
pity for you that the sociopaths are already so well representedyoull need to find something to set yourself apart
if you promise to dedicate a significant portion of your csm time to bringing delayed local to 00 youve got my vote
any newscj
the csm cares almost as much as ccp
i dont think they have much options to accelerate this process nevertheless its getting a little
before anybody else feeds the troll please check him out ingame corp standing bio quotesif he runs decide if you want such a person representing you id love to see a csm meeting ruled by trolls rolls eyesmike
im a fairly big carebear 59 sec status 99 amarr standingnone of these are issuesit actually happened a couple days ago for the first legitimate time i pulled in my orca and pulled in everything close for him alsohow many times have i gotten guys who came to get flagged so i shoot them allowing them to go back in pvp ship to get me few times i even shot em once warped out grabbed neut domi killed their geddon wasnt even a good fight they never did post their loss dying to a carebear is to embarrassing it seems
it sure does before people would post their ideas and it was ccp denying them now its the csm denying them1 less work for ccp iow they dont have to read posts2 ccp isnt the bad guy3 csm takes all the blamegm issue is a funny one they get spammed with so much crap they have to copypaste but that copypaste almost never answers anything infact hardened petition metagamers have devised ways to break the copypastefurthermore gms have been tricked into so many things so many times they are on epic short leashadd on top of that leash they have been given a set of rules so vague that if you take the smallest thing out of context or have a legit char screwing up the innocent person gets penalizedjust think of this someone isk spamsor says something racist or something rookie helpwhy ur in there i dont know you copy paste and hit enter ingame after ud opened the petition window but it just went to local you notice you didnt paste into window you never even notice local because its uber tiny someone else petitions you for isk spamming you then get muted andor banned sorry but the rules are rules you stay banned andor warned happened to me though not banned obviouslythe other good one ive seen person x petitions wartarget y saying its very unusual for my war target to be on  this time i just killed a bunch of stuff i know him irl though we havent talked in years and he wouldnt do that y just happens to be using vpnproxy iow unusual ip address banned
thisbringing democracy into eve as if we needed it is both pretentious and idiotic a metagaming democratic system functional or not this one isnt is the opposite of the sandbox philosophy of eve and well ms gossip summed it up pretty well really
i better read ur post or elseif theres no fighting happening then theres no issue relative to the wardec creating limits to the system wont suddenly generate more attacks they can only limit the amount of destructionthe problem is sure its pretty stupid that there can be literally no reason for some wardecs would love to develop a new wardec system that brings in at least some layer of diplomacy ingame as a mechanic but thatll be just fluffthe problem isoh please ive had some of the best empire war people wardec my alts where do we go wormspace and 00 wardec people arent going to 00 the few who have tried which tbh was hilarious got killed by our enemies lol was pretty funny wardecs are lame and can be ignorednot really canada is at war in fghanistan but we arent exactly attacking them ww2 style or something my point is that war isnt exactly a destruction thing it can just be a we beat you
why make the thread public then go do this on a mailing list or private channel or irc channel wherever jita park speakers cornera less formal venue to discuss or debate whatever you wish regarding the council of stellar managementseriously whats the issue let noncsm elect issues during the meeting you can divide the issues csm elected ones first and well derp last just set the topic up and see if any csm would like to comment then vote very quick and easy
dont worry the noncsm players voice is already being ignored read the whole thread that is linked and then you will realize resistance is futile
if you dont want community feeback dont do this thread in the public side of the forumand sort the csm x ccp meeting minutes out
if you put away your kneejerk doginthemangerism for a moment you might find that cyprus black was merely suggesting relevant issues that a current csm might consider looking at before raising to the council if they wanted to advocate themgiven your own recent penchant for advocating threads with extremely minimal public support it might be novel if you found an issue bring to the csm that the people did care actually care about
cry more he needs to convince a csm member 1 on 1 to raise the issue not spam the thread with issues its just a bad thing to encourage since people just end up spamming up meeting threads to hell with their pet issues
mazz i need to remind you that you cant raise issues which are not at least week old
its going to be a week old by the time the meeting happens thats all that matters
you sound a little bit peeved there mazzilliu maybe you should try and get a bit of fresh air
sry my bad i was in troll mode today so somehow i messed up the dates sry one more time
its ok i think everybody is in troll mode including me
while i was a csm delegate i had to carefully weigh the potential effects of each forum thread before i could endorse it i managed to eliminate about 80 of threads just on the impact on the game or the practicality of programming the new code after that i gave my support to some threads but might not champion them based on my own opinion from years of playing this game the ones i did champion were sometimes knocked down by other delegates but sometimes made it through you have to have a very level head and a very thick skin to be a delegate as you are going to be flamed a lot for the choices you make whether wise or notquite often to be honest i felt my major friction was with darius steel during my time in the csm as he had a very pvpcentric approach and i endorsed pve thats not to say that we never agreed or he didnt surprise me but he seemed the most often at odds with me in my term the only other alliancerepresenting delegate was vuk lau from morsus mihi and he was pretty laidback most candidates really didnt represent an alliance but more represented a playerbase ankh represented fw lvv was financetrade omber was veterans etcwhen i first composed the website that demonstrated my platform i made clear a lot of items which i think should be in the game and was honest about forum concepts which i supported i feel this honesty helped me at the voting booths one thing you should always keep in mind is that you represent the players so asking their opinion is a good thing and being involved in an npc corp meant i had a large group of diverse players to get feedback frommy agenda was to improve all aspects of pve  trade mining manufacturing etc i feel i was able to provide some input to ccp about these issues and got them promoted on the items ccp also asked me for my input in various features they were planning on implementing including dominion and i provided it where i couldif youre planning to run i wish you the best of luck its tough to get elected and even tougher to constantly endure the mudslinging while working your butt off to represent your chosen constituency to the players your heart has to be in it or you will crumble or make a mistake such as has been displayed already
this is exactly what has been bothering me since when i first heard of the csmif your name is on the list youll get my vote more i cannot do unfortunately
in my experience as a betatester for lionhead studios i had the oppertunity to talk with game designer peter molyneux on several occations one of the things he tought me was the importance of leaving things in the hands of the right people theoretically the average game designer is better at coming up with gameplay solutions to gameplay problems than your average gamer this is why i would try not to represent proposed changes from the playerbase but the underlying problems that promted the need for change this means that id leave it open to the game designers exactly how they wish to fix the issue without attempting to enforce a playerissued solution when browsing the forum for proposals for the csm id attempt to find the underlying reason for the proposals instead of arguing the effectiveness of the proposal itself this way basically all proposals have an equal underlying base the reason they where proposed in the first place that something is bothering the issuer of the proposal what the solution turns out to be is practically irrelevant as long as it gets fixedthats the theory behind what id choose to do as a csm and what i encourage other csm delegates and candidates to do aswell
this concern is exactly the reason why i founded take care and why we have succesfully had a candidate in every csm to datea candidate with no ingame affiliation and no personal agenda that would respond to emails and personal chats and who does what is right for the eve game as a whole we have advisors that represent different playstyles and who inform our csm whenever there is an important issue or problem which they feel should be brought to ccps attentionif you want a neutral person to look at your interests contact erik finnegan the current take care csm or any of the take care advisors and well look at it
do you feel that additional csm candidates following similar philosophies would benefit you or would they only devide the votes making the chances of one of them reaching the csm less
sirens wrongif myself goon or pl reps were watching for particularly morsus mihi pandemic legion and goonfleet interests we would vote for more powerful doomsdays cutting some 00  empire entry routes increasing demand for dyspro and prom introducing sov5 and untouchable regions etcthe most important issues 00 reps raised and the most time we spent in brainstorming with ccp were actually about promoting and opening 00 to more ppl and making it actualy more funwrong again it is totally irrelevant who will raise what issue as long as it is raised and tbh i thing that 3 csm offices raised like 90 or even more of all including semi relevant issues posted in assembly hall for the iceland meeting we covered all 65 issues regardless of the area of the game covering it or personal agendas alliance background is irrelevant at least in my eyes i need to dig up my quote from rawr forums where i said to my members who dont want to vote for me from whatever the reason are they should vote for fe meissa herschel oz and several other guys who showed me that they have enough of game knowledge not huge egos and ability to maturely discuss about all aspects of the game and none of them have any significant alliance or political backgroundthe only problem i see with empire candidates is that they suck more or less in 00 esp endgame and pvp knowledge while most of the serious 00 guys on top of nulsec knowledge knows a lot about carebear activities aswell in short i would recommend you to apply for csm
vuk lau you said about 90 of all proposed issues where raised by the csms where there any time constraints that made this difficult to achieve or is the length of csm meetings flexible enough to accomodate for discussing all features in other words is filthering even requiredi suspect that if issues where raised based on the proposed solutions rather than stricktly the underlying problem only then youd often find ccps response to be weve allready tried this solution weve allready discussed that solution and yah thats not gonna work in the experience of past csm members is this true
sometimes we had extremely long meetings hi omber zombie but the ammount of the issues was never a big problem i was always trying to look impartially to all issues and only thing where i lacked knowledge was faction warfare but both csm 20 and csm 30 had delegates who were kind enough to get me into details from that point of view i think that we were discussing most of the issues raised with adequate dedication or fe if its minor ui tweak which is perfectly logical we spent one or two minutes on the issue but for certain issues we spent a lot of time discussing themsame goes for meetings with ccp we spent minutes on some issues with simple yes we will implement it in next patch yes its in backlog or just simple no and sometimes we spent hours
personally i think there should be some way you can interrupt the macro miners from their nefarious actions there are 25 belts in my home system and rarely more than one miner in each one day last week i logged on within 6 hours of downtime and every single belt was 100 mined out this isnt a case of too many miners rather macro mining locusts
simple if someone gets more than 25 blocks within 10 seconds then it should flag him as a gold spammer and auto silence them for and 6 hours on public channels and auto petitions a gm to review the text to make sure it wasnt a troll or a collective attempt at getting someone banned
i thought of this too then youd get a large corpalliance griefing legitimate people
and now atiamds new eyefinity tech is out which means i can turn 3x 24 monitors or 3x 22 which i have into a single monitori cant imagine the text at 3600x1900 or 5500x2750 or some nearly unreasonable resolution depending on whether you leave your monitors horizontal or flip them up to vertical but eve on 3 monitors as a single screen

what a rediculous idea however as is the norm with games console releases come first to create a cash flow and then pc release afterwards to all those who mentioned the macro thing with farming accounts or whatever using multiple clients 3 words  power of 2 they encourage multiple accountsbut either way i think it will end up on pc maybe a year or so after the console release i really hate this whole console takeovertheworld thing though because ive invested a hell of a lot of money into a computer which apparently means nothing if theres no games coming out on it and not a snowballs chance in hell am i getting a ps3 or xbox for any one gamebut for the record opening to the massive console market is a good business move but they wont risk screwing the thousands of pc users that pay them so patience
ccp shooter on a console are different as shooters on the pc we want to concentrate on developing a good console shootertranslation making a shooter compatible with more than one system is too much hard worki support this topic not just as a pc gamer or a console gamer but as someone who sincerely believes this will be a massive failure if its not released on pcdistribute it via steam or something its worth the hard work ccp
this thread still drawing epic emo tears
i agree i dont own a console and i dont want to buy one but id love to play dusti like to play fps on pc not console
i mainly play pc games and only own an old xbox so wouldnt have access to dust 514 so i agree make it available for pc users too as it looks great and i prefer a mouse too a gamepad any day playing a fpsaluthin
i think everyone who supports this is missing the point ccp is making dust a console only game to bring in more casual gamers eve already caters to the hardcore gamers out there dust will bridge the gap between the hardcore and the more casual gamer i have introduced some of my xbox friends to eve and they played for a month and quit the same guys will play cod4 halo red faction cod waw nonstop for weeks they enjoy the ability to jump into a game play get some action and quit they didnt enjoy jumping on a vent with some serious business alliance membersthere are plenty of shooters available out there on the pc let the console gamers have this one i for one enjoy console fps over pc fps any day

this would be a massive improvementsigned
i supported it almost exactly a year ago and ill support it againits frustrated that it still hasnt been taken seriously by ccp
sound oriented with regards to the ship is my preference so how about having a feature of choice here the object i view with the camera should not be binaural but rather mono through the front speakers onlyim surprised by the lack of feedback here perhaps enough has already been said in all of the previous post apocrypha forum sound threads already and perhaps that ought to be enough for ccp to go by
the retribution is an odd little beast because its a frig thats completely unusable solo that said as part of a mixed gang its the scariest frigate in the gamebar possibly bombers but those are a whole other kettle of fish im not a huge fan of frigs in general but the ret is one of the ones i actually like more than most there arent many ships that can apply that kind of dps to frigatesized targets if the ship isnt good enough at its role boost its ability to perform its job dont change the job give it a fifth turret slot and fitting to match i dont think it needs it but i dont fly amarr  if im wrong thatd be the right boost but personally i love the idea of a onemid ship being somewhere in the ship list its an interesting design challenge see what you can do with that limit and still have a usable ship similarly id be all for a 01low caldari af existing just to see how scary the rest of its stats can be and still result in a balanced ship
and assault shipfrig is meant to assault targetsnot tackle themnot that im saying you shouldnt or cant just pointing out that the original designed intention is to provide dpsnow ive not looked at the specs for a retribution but most amarian ships typically have very few mid slots due to the fact they are armor tankers and tend to favor low slots over themodds are its much like the destroyer hull in this casecant support this as your attempting to slap a sticker on said ship to make it just like the rest of themif it dont work get someone else to do it or use a different shipnot all ships are equal equalizing them tends to be a big mistakediversification is what makes this game so greati will not deny however there are some ships in need of some boosting but this is not one of them as far as this context is concernedif your going to change this ship boost its role not something outside of its intended scope
supporting a second midslot for this terrible ship
give it another mid yo
supporting the support in this supported support threadamarr are seriously lacking in the frig department imo retribution has single mid vengeance has lolrockets giving retri another mid would go a long way to fix that then its just the issue with rockets

supportedalso more cpu also for wolfenyo which have cpu problems themselves current fittings are beyond stupid you cannot gank when you cannot support enough damage mods cpu wise there is little point in a af which can neither gank nor tackle and only very marginal usability in a af which cant tackle
yeah i agree that the retribution is somewhat gimped in purpose especially since its clear that ccp has abs in mind for afs having that second mid would be necessary for a scram

hope you meant faction police concord dont chase they show up and kick yo ass on the spotas for the main issue your obviously implying i think restricting it to 10 people is not enoughrevoke insurance for all instances of criminal actions in any cases and you may dent itbut as its been pointed out this doesnt stop them just makes it harderso i cant really support this due to lack of foresight but yes it is a problem nonetheless
who pvps in a freighter i thought freighters where meant to have an escort or somethinganyyhow get a friend with a logistics ship to rep your shields and move onyou can not do everything solo in eve and expect to be safe all the time
i do not supportth eops post as people need to insure their ships to pvp that includes 10 peoplewhat i believe should happen is that if your ship is killed by concord or the police then your insurance is invalidated
youre familiar with the concept of nonconsensual pvp right i mean no one pvps in a freighter by choice and the shield repping idea is great unless they bring enough alpha to the party to make it uselessmy point is if the purpose of insurance is to make pvp more viable then lets make it actually do that let me insure my cargos so that i can care as little about what happens to my ship as you care what happens to yours
honestly i do not see highsec suicide gankers as a big problem i think they are well withing the cage attacking only the targets that has disproportional amount of isk carried vs there tank nothing stops you from putting 24 meidum shield extenders on your industrial ship and warp core stabs everyone can do that if you are carrying a blueprint use a fast ship or a tanked ship that will save you from vast majority of suicide gankers
some subjects people discuss because they are involved in it and some people discuss even when it doesnt affect them just in principlethis ones pretty simple if you run missions or are not a troll you agree that salvaging is theft if youre a salvage thief or a troll you argue that its noti support this thread
i do run missions to make my isk i am strongly opposed to salvage flaggingnot everyone is prepared to wreck a whole profession just for their own selfish advantagestill luckily this is all moot since ccp have made their opposition to this extremely clear theyre not going to make salvage flaggable no matter how long and loud you whine and if they do theyll do it in some way that gives you what you ask for but not at all what you want eg making combat mission deadspaces losec reducing mission income in some way or some other more devious amendmentmake no mistake ccp have realised their error in making hisec missioning too good for the level of risk and they will not do anything that skews the equation even further theyre far more likely to increase risk and decrease reward
please do because i would really like to know what they aresalvage yield is highly variable because yield of every singe wreck is random withing certain limits but you can make some healthy amount of cash from it traidor disloyal i know that the odds are not in favor of a mission runner but killing a ninja salvager is nothing impossible and isnt even that hard if you are ready and know what you are doing that does seem to be true so you are telling me that every single ninja lotter and salvager that tried to steal something from my corpmates checked all 5 system around dodixie with the total population of about a thousand people before stealing the loot you might be doing that but i am absolutely sure that not all of them do
thats a pretty bold statement its also false since i can offer at least one case that proves its wrong that being melately ive been spending a lot of my time running missions building faction standing and cash i have had a ninja raid a couple of my missions  i still dont think its theft annoying yes theft no
maybe but the people i have been playing this game with for the past 2 12 years know what they are doing when it comes to farming mission runners unless we are activly hunting war targets there is always someone there to give the mission farmer help if he gets in over his headmaybe not all and sometimes we dont the trick is to check the attributes of the corp the mission runner belongs to you take the number of people in the corp and figure that at most 12 to 13 may be on at any give time you also look at the age of the corp and the person who started it and take your chances from theremy experience has been that a majority of mission runners are by themselves with no backup and even if they do have people in the same system they usually wont get help and in the off chance help does come to them the help has no idea what they are doing except how to explode spectacularlyand by the way i dont like farming mission runners its like work to me ill take two hours to hunt a war target down ill make 30 jumps just to kill a war target mining in an astroid field but farming mission runners is not fun for me you can get very wealthy doing it but its not not my cup of tea
ok out of interest would it be bad or good for you personally traidor disloyal if salvaging would result in aggro
i would be for it due to the fact that the people in my corp use mission busting taking loot to cause the mission runner to go temporarily insane and shoot at them and thus causing the salvaging of the mission runners wreak but that is just me im more into war decs and salvaging ships that wayi also understand where people say that mission runners do make a lot of isk for very little risk and thus mission runners do not need the extra isk i also understand where ccp is coming from in that they seem to like conflict and that salvaging wreaks from missions by people who did not generate that mission is a good thingthere really is no downside to mission running you can be half asleep watching tv or rubbing yourself and has long has you pay attention you will not loose your ship traders can miscalculate on trades miners can have the mineral floor fall out from under them industrial people can have a bad day at selling stuff mission runners could fall asleep at the keyboard and if they have a good tank nothing will happeni have a character that mission runs besides being a cov ops pilot in the 3 years i have had that character running missions she has never lost a ship she has bought exactly one frig a drake a raven and a nighthawk to run missions she bought that nighthawk a year ago and she has never come close to loosing it mission running is an easy no brainer way to make isk in game the npcs are a joke if you know what to do the only thing that adds spice to it and causes me not to fall asleep is the chance that a ninja might come into my mission i doubt that will ever happen i can run missions for a multitude of agents for all 4 major races the agents i run missions for are not in mission hubs and they are high quality level 4 agents i dont run missions for caldari navyi dont want to take isk away from the mission runners but mission runners already get lp buy stuff from store and sell on market they get bounty and they get loot and if you are fast enough and not in a mission hub 9 times out of 10 the mission runner will also get the salvagea little bit of risk for the mission runner is not really all that bad
re slavecrystal ive always thought it was sort of nifty how they separated those two im all for crystals working on capital modules though re talismans i find them incredibly nifty though ill agree that rof is a bit weak on a set of modules that tend to be good at capping out the person using them perhaps a multiplier on the effect would be a more interesting ability though itd run the risk of breaking cap transfers this seems ridiculous to me if a 20 speed boost doesnt matter why do people fit overdrives its a free boost to your tracking and lets you engagedisengage faster im not convinced that theyre worth the isk unless youre a machariel pilot and i think that the quantum rise nerf was a touch too severe but saying that theyre useless is dumb you dont know how the tracking formula works it seems resolutionradius is not a separate calculation its a multiplier on tracking capital guns hit frigates 100 of the time if both are immobile and in range shooting a frigradius 40 with a battleship gunradius 400 just means that your effective tracking is divided by 10 dropping your sig radius to 34 of what it was before makes your effective radial 43 of what it was before which is a nice boost it still feels like a very weak bonus to meunless you pile on a gang linked ragnarok or something equally absurd but it doesnt do what you think it does to turret hit rates whether pirate implants are allowed in the tourney or not is kind of irrelevant he was using the tourney to give an example of possible tactics not commenting on what modsplants were used to implement those tactics
you forgot how pathetic virtue implants are now that probing is so easy to do
you forget how easy it is to hide from an unskilled prober
is the csm still going to bring this travesty of an idea to the attention of ccpplease tell me after all of the replies to this thread your still not going thru with it are you
already did muahahahahahahaahahah
so what did ccp say
i would scoop them but it takes my dominix a long time to travel sometimes 50km to them usually theyre dead before i can get back into the room
are you a noob or whatif you are in a mission you can be far away from the warp in pointnot talking about the multistage missionsstfu if you dont know what the f you are talking abouti support this idea its stupid loosing the main weapon nobody else loose anything while warping out and camera drones warp with the ship so
a simple recall to bay on disconnect would be nice granted drones might not make it back in time but youd have no balancing issues
i have noticed that if you warp out while theyre returning they do stay connected but its kind of hard to click return when youve been disconnected 
awwwww did some one get ganked i personally dont see any problem with high sec ganking thats why you dont play internet spaceships afk
this
assuming that this doesnt make the server people want to punch the lot of us im all for it
definately would help out in the long run
i say remove sisters of eve and other ways to get tags up for empire factions or allow pirate faction to be raised like tags or running for sisters ect
i like this
that would be very stupid from a game mechanics and rp point of view cloaking hides you from scanners not from local if you want it to hide you from local i say youre gonna need to show up on scan you cant be hidden from both and hell say the cloaking produces a large amount of interference thereby greatly increasing your signature radius and making it easy to probe you outcovert ops ships are hidden enough people need to stop complaining about how nullsec is the same as highsec because theres no reason for it not to be
the current implimentation of local as the omniscient intelligence tool is what is stupid  from a game mechanics and rp point of view
well not really it follows basically the principles you got atm in air traffic if you enter a certain controlled space your plane sends an identification number and some more details about your flight similar in eveif you enter a system your ship broadcasts to a system beacon that relays to the other ships
thanks for the support more importantly thanks for civil discussion
an idea that i had pop into my head a few days ago ive been refining it since thena tier training system tier a row or level of a structure typically one of a series of rows placed one above the other and successively receding or diminishing in sizeso the current training queue is already the largest tier tier 1my proposal is to implement a second and possibly third tier three is probably overdoing it and wouldnt serve much of a purpose due to the slow speed i have includeda two tier example would be thistier 1 training at normal speeds  normal 24 hour training queue originaltier 2 training at one thirdquarter speed takes three or four times longer to train  6 hour training queueas you can see the second tier is much smaller one forth the size and one thirdforth speed overall this would allow players the choices of a work a long skill in the first tier at normal speed while also sidestudying a shorter skill taking three to four times the normal speed b work faster skills in the first tier while chipping away at a longer skill in the second tierc work on their main specialization mining for example yet also work on a alternate skill set industrial or fightingive thought of including an isk priceneeded skillset to unlock the second tier or you rent the second tier for some price i am not too sure about implementing that part of the idea thoughin summary the purpose of the tier system is to give players the opportunity to either diversify or specialize easier it would also serve to make players log in more during the longhaul of one month or even multiple month skills during which players may leave the game until the training is done or quit entirely because they feel they are getting nowhere
while the idea has merit i cant support itthe training queue makes eve the most unique game aroundby allowing players to train more than one skill on a single character would cause alot of issues for those of us who are training right nowthe only way this would work and i stress if on this one is if the training time would be penalized for the first tier for use of the second tierin reallity you are abusing a system that was designed for one skill a at a timepeople would achieve skills much more quickly not goodthe only thing i find rational in this case is the ability to queue up skills or share rather between altsnot sure if its currently doing this but ive heard its a rather likable ideayour likely to get trolled so ill throw in the obligatory ibfgb2wow rant response and take my leaveo7
1 i believe you mean players that just join as i said ive thought about requiring a skillset or isk price for running the second tier it would not be cheap or easy to get other than newer players matching up older players which it would not be cheap or easy for them to do i dont see any other problems mind elaborating on any that i seem to be missing2 the first tier would stay the same the second tier takes three to four times as long to train skills maybe you were confused on that point the second tier is not faster it is much much slower to use than the first maybe it should be increased to five or six times if it seems four is not slow enough3 refer to response 2 it would take a lot longer a normal one hour skill would take four hours and only leave room for one more skill remember that i propose a 6 hour limit queue for the second tier instead of a 24 hour one severely limiting how much you could put in4 this system does not share skills between alts it limits it to one character and would have the same limitation of one character learning at a time5 ibfgb2wow ibf  no idea gb2wow i would imagine means go back to world of warcraft i used to its too easy
surely having two skills training at the same time both at half speed would be much simpler to implement without the balance implications if anything along those lines is needed at all
so basically you want to increase training speed by 2533 and make the system more complicated at the same time sorry i cant support this
i like the idea its interestinghowever likable or even good ideas shouldnt always be implementedif i understand you correctly and the second tier would essentiallyin the long run be training skills at the same speed or less than you can train them in the first tier todays methodthen i would say why for example some have suggested before to be able to have two skills train at the same time both at half speed why train one and then the other with the skill q that we have today this is completely unnecessary do you have a long skill going but want to feel like youre making progress once or twice a week switch to a shorter skill if you have skills youd like to progress that take less than a day you can even add those on to the beginning of the q and your long skill will pick up afterwardsso solution in search of a problem i guess
lol i read somewhere thisccp chronotis  you might also be interested to know that slotchanging rigs are in their last stages of internal testing
the only way this would remotely work is if it follows fille balles idea that they begin to work like rigsa lot of time and discussion goes into the design of every ship to make sure that it is balanced not necessarily to prescribe a particular function for the ship but more to prevent it from serving multiple functions at the same time want a really heavy shield tank for your drake fill your low slots with shield power relays and put 2 large shield extenders and a myriad of resistance amplifiers in your mids heavy tank low dps other way around if you want high dps 3 bcs in your low slots mids have a medium shield extender or two along with an ab and target painter t2 launchers in the highs heavy dps with meager tank you cant have heavy dps and heavy tank and that is important but to implement this system without some major restrictions you are pretty much massively buffing every ship in the game and forcing everybody to start using completely different fits and those who take longer to develop their new fits will be destroyed before they can test themnot supported
ok the you can access them at poss now my proposal is to make it more obvious somehow possibly by displaying it on the right click menu on the ship maintenance array
not true no support
you already can add and remove drones using a ship maintenance arrayopen the fitting panel for your ship when youre in range of the sma and click the drones icon
you already can though ill admit its not obvious anchor a ship maintenance array at your pos fly up to it rightclick use fitting service at the fitting screen that pops up click on the little drone icon at the bottom left congrats youve accessed your drone bay
seriously ccp were you guys too lazy to give it a paragraph description in its info box or is black rise such a crappy region that you just dont care
this is an area of space that was discovered and settled the same day that the empires went to war with each other while the coincidence is remarkable experts assure us that it is all perfectly in keeping with known laws of physics and was not in any way a frantic kludge designed to make a game mechanic possibleseriously i do support this a minor issue but a really easy one to fix
why not
reasons1 low sec lacks reason a have fw that has its own issue b we have pirates running about fighting one another and trying their best to grief2 high sec has too much profit with no risk a if you are a mission runner learn to look for combat probes see them then dock or go to a safe and warp between safes until the 15 aggression counter is gone and then log off b play smart you wonUFFFDt lose your ship end of story3 will give people some kill mails because mission runners dont know the basics of living in low sec or in 004 would give pirates something to shoot5 would fix the issue of great isk phr with no risknow i dont live in low sec iUFFFDm out in npc 00i also dont see how many pirate battleships manage to get into high sec
no it would just lead to people moving to lvl3s and there are plenty lvl4ql20 agents in lowsec with higher rewards than their highsec counterparts didnt really help eitherall your suggestions wouldnt really fix lowsecgreetings from someone living in lowsec and 00
how about a lot of skillpoints oh wait
no eve doesnt need more players people need to stop suggesting things that make it super easy for newbs to get into the game you and i got into the game just fine with the way things are now and frankly i dont want to play this game with people who are babied for the first couple months because then they wont understand how the game actually works or people who only continue playing through their first couple months because theyre being given things for having a subscription because most will lose interest once the handouts cease
check this outccp chronotis  yes to a limited degree we are reintroducing nano gameplayccp chronotis  but it will be mitigated by a return to the old webifiers strength combined with a large sig radius penalty per speed mod fitted
why not just make webs script able have a script that gives your web 75 reduction in speed but it cuts the range in half simple fix no need to rebalance anything
also a good ideasupporting this topic in hopes it at least gets looked at by csmdevs

sigh can we go back to productive discussion now i might not agree with you two on everything but mazz and vuk i gotta say thank you for remaining participatory in this discussion youve both shared enough across several threads that i understand you feel frustrated and that many csms have enough to do in rl and otherwise to be willing to sacrifice more personal time on csm than they already do to sum up the situations not perfect but theres been some progress in the organization department even if its not always apparent to the player base okay thats a good start guess you gotta be on the inside looking out to really understand what the obstacles are i hope to be doing just that for csm5
it seems that ccp went back to the drawing board with this one during the last yearpersonally i feel the incarna should be more of a game in the game it should have its own goals and mechanics kinda like dust 514 though more connected to eve classic than dust 514 will be due to the fact that it uses the same client and centers around pod pilots like classic doesi would not mind that you could play incarna as your primary game experience and just use your pod pilot ability to move between stations this of course would mean that incarna would have to be able to work on its own as a game in game mechanic terms not actuallyhaving it beeing just a social tool would be a bit of a waste
considering that there are still many existing features in eve that need work i wouldnt want them to make incarna too massive in terms of how much resources it takes to make it i feel incarna is important but not all overrulingly important
thats right my friends it is now in the on position im throwing my hat in the ring as force for truth justice and small gang pvpccd from declarations of warwith over a year and a half behind the wheel of noir ive established a lasting and very public reputation for integrity and exacting standards you can call me a pvp candidate yet i have no ties to partisan 00 power blocs grief tactics or pirates what i do have is a strong desire to see small gang pvp become increasingly relevant and fun promote diversity and balance among shiptypes and make sure issues raised by the exciting new changes in the dominion patch are highlighted so this expansion can to live up to all our expectationsbut pvp isnt just about the pew pew as ceo of one of eves most in demand mercenary outfits i have proven myself to be a sound businessman additionally my clientel is a wide spread of the eve community from 00 alliances to wormholers to the industrialists which keep the ships flowing i think that competition is healthy and i would advocate the removal of barriers to competition like npc sell orders suicide gank insurance and other price ceilings as an obligatory wave to my fellow mercenary ceos as well as all those who seek our services i also support game mechanics which support the business side of the mercenary industry including protecting both merc and employer from scamsand finally i am running to hold ccp to a higher standard the gm department needs to be improved for ccp to continue to have a positive relationship with its player base ccp needs to admit the problem and work with the csm on a solution to increase familiarity with basic eve mechanics and thoughtful reading of petitions this will drastically improve the first line of customer service and promote the healthy growth and stability of the subscriber baseif you have any questions for me about me or about my position on a certain issue i can be reached via eve mail or by comments on the blog watch this space for more announcements and highlights of qas or my posts on the csm forumsalekseyev karrdeceo noiranswering voter qs 1 rr ecm cloaks morecorpalliance chat motd as part of corp management reformsupport for csm publicviews on price controls explained3rd party apps for eves web 20 portalbookmarks and probing need loveeve tribune interviewdiplomats corp management bufflowsec fac warfareplanet risk csm debates round 2
you have my 4 votes and ill prolly vote with my buddys 2 accounts as wel v0valso first
ill be voting for you with at least one of my accounts so you have at least two votes including yours phowever would like to hear your thoughts on the following1 do you think anything needs to be done to make small gangsolo pvp better is stuff fine as is or do you think they need to swing it towards larger fleets some more2 how do you feel about the ecm mechanic does it need a nerf a buff a change or to remain unchanged3 what do you think about cloaks on interceptors should these be a more viable strategy4 what areas of the game do you hope to influence
you forgot rr mechanics
oh that too i was too busy trolling about the fits that have appeared on the noir killboard over the past week p5 do you feel that rr mechanics neutral and outlaw need to be changed or are they fine as is
good question
and finally 6 how do you feel about the overview could it use an upgrade to not be ing ed or is it fine as is and im just a whiny soab7 rock pokemon are annoying cd
what specific complaintssuggestions do you have regarding the overviewalso all you need is a squirtle
mainly how difficult it is to create overview tabs how silly the states category is with the algorithm it uses to determine if a ship should appear or not appear on your overviewgrass at the start is apparently the best but i had no connection with the grass or water on offer and chose fire because to be the best pokUFFFDmon trainer in the sinnoh region you really need to have a connection with your pokUFFFDmon
yeah i guess creating tabs could be easier switching bracket profiles could probably be streamlined tooi honestly havent played since red  blue but you are of course right the first 2 badges you receive are against rock and water types so grass is the best to start with
sorry to upset the rock and mickey show but this rring a crim without a gcc should not give you a gcc sure rring them when they have a gcc is fine i mean your actually helping an active criminal then but rring a gang mate that happens to be 5 or less should not get me shot at by gate guns when he can sit there quite happily all day long
youre right outlaws need to have permagcc that would actually make sense
i was referring more to gots parking 8 npc corp guardians on a station in highsec and there isnt  you can do about it but yeah the gcc thing needs looking at too
hmm almost as good as lana running and since im fairly sure i know your stance on most things already ill say yes p
you have my nine votesdont forget to send the isk in a manilla envelope shhh
you know you have the votes of the final noiras your super duper powerbloc brothers we will be proud to support you also you have tfs in your employment history and that makes you pretty damn special 3
you are such a hater poastedrot
d
already been raised by yours truely darling you can give me a rub down later
ehalready voting for istavaan but if i had another account i mighttbh the truth and justice thing is a turnoff
i of course shall be voting for my good friend and ceoand damn i did a snappy job on lexas sig doncha think 
yeah and how well did it go every cp csm needs to raise the issue until its fixed also im still voting for you lark im just hedging my bets as alek would be the only other person i might have voted for
i am or was one of the biggest proponents of logistical ships i still like them and think they are awesome but even i will admit to it it has gotten out of hand with all the remote repping neutrals this is coming from the person who has an alt or alts created for the sole purpose of remote repping my main and other players in combat for isk pvp is fading very quickly in empire and has all but dissapeared compared to years ago players are so leery of other players using neutral remote logistics it was falcon alts coming in and jamming that was the big pain now its neutral repping not whining and frankly i dont even care if it is fixed but it is an issue that certainly deserves looking intoedit if i vote for anyone it would be aleks
i approve of this productservice
easy fix cant dock while you have a yellow timer of any sort would also create tears from mission runners ok a more reasonable one would be to limit it to player based yellow timerswould also fix the moros issue and the i have a carrier so im immune if i stay in docking range issue
i like aleks but just posting that youre running for csm and then leaving the threadim not going to vote for someone unless i know what types of changes are going to be brought to the tableknowing aleks im sure that wardec mechanics will be brought up dropping alliance to avoid pos takedowns and things like thatremote repping not causing an aggro timerall in all im disappointed in the lack of effort put forth in announcing your candidacy
perhaps this is just an attention getter thread and the meat will come later
op posted on 14th you should give people at least 24 hours to reply to something given people have real lives outside internet spaceshipsso wait
think ill stick with isstvan gl though
got my 4 votes
also my votes
i would rather vote for joe phoenix
thats why your votes are automatically rejected by the servers
i expected more from you you have let me downi need a better troll to look up to now
more than happy to give you all my votesim convinced that with the grasp you have on the game most if not all your proposals will be relevent and well thought out theres always a first time though i cannot stress the importance of pushing the neutral rr issue it has to be resolved
vote for alek
im waiting for larkonis to make some last minute entrance into running for csm again although theyll probably let him in after the cutoff date as he is that coolif that doesnt happen ill be voting for alek x 4
well if youre looking to get all the corps votes i might make a couple suggestions1 repeal that egregious 100 tax hike you hit us with to fund the aleks ship replacement program2 it would be nice if a little more of the contract payouts made it to us than was going to cover your pathetic eo poker losses
youll have my voteif the podcast comes out soon
 erm did you lose another ship or something you seem tense or something
this would go a long way in overcoming the bad overview imo allowing customizable data to appear next to the targetssame crap you can add to the overview now just listed on your current selected targetless columns needed when you can just flip through targets to get the infoplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesoh yeah and alekseyev has my votes
aleks u have three of my votes u better n win toour an awesome fc and a great leader and im sure u have great ideas for high sec war fixes that need to be addressed especially some that we have dealt with together also together i mean with ue since u probably dont know directly who i am cause im a nobodynext time u see solty tell him to get the  out of the channel btw way itll be good lols trust me
you have my vote babes
no u as this is a real life commitment i do expect that the op for candadicy be more than 2 lines long but as you can see already with him being a very popular capsuleer imo people are willing to blindly follow him no matter what issues he currently supportsplease dont get me wrong i like aleks a lot i think hes funny runs a great corp and declarations of war is the only eve podcast i listen to im looking at you jimerthis whole running for csm seems very last minute
wow you really are that full of yourself
and my axe
yeah i get thatbut i also give people the benefit of a doubt that they are capable of being a good csm member when all the evidence in game points to thisso im waiting until he puts out his spiel before i make a decisionbut it would have to be good to steal my vote from lark or istavaan
well i was going to throw my name into the csm ring but since you my boss i suppose you be more good that ill ever be perhaps next year ill throw my name down for the forum community pyour my vote 
thanks for the support everyone i suppose i should have planned ahead and had the heavens part when i announced maybe a choir of angels promise to do better next time as to the questions in this thread ill put out thoughtful answers tomorrow after im confident ive passed some pesky tests hehe
lol me and solty will be ur angelsi dunno who the heavens will be but ive heard that awesome possum likes to open up every once in awhle im sure hell oblige
you have my er axe
you are a true fanboi arnt you 
aleks can you do anything about the american education system its failing our children badly
creone there are trolls who once in a while need to be reigned in for content and then there are people like you who should never ever post on public forums everfacepalm
but you cant even keep up your podcast can you spend the time necessary to be a good csmhint 
a thread would read againpodcast
i like the idea my overview isnt big enough to have all the iinformation i need displayed on italthough to decide which ship im going to shoot sometimes ill take a look at the overview set transversal to 0 and pew pew it having to click through all the targets to see which isnt moving would not be ok with me perhaps an overhaul to the entire locking system is needed where your targets are locked go on the left hand screen verticallynaglfarly down from your neocom and then velocity range transversal would be displayed thereand maybe a organize by button on the top left so you could organize by distance speed etc hell it could even be placed just to the left of the overview since it wont have to take up the entire screen anymore
definately getting my vote having flown with you i know you have an understanding of some of the most frustrating mechanics with regards to high sec poss and pvp in general
checks
i disagree pvp is only about the honor of battle
when people sit down to play a game of chess its an understood and agreed upon competition people arent suddenly challenged to chess games while they try to go about their daily business and losing in chess more often than not doesnt cause someone to lose anything of any valueit cant be compared to causing misery to random people in a video game simply because it satisfies them on some primitive level im not making a giant moral judgement about people who engage in such behavior but lets be honest they are doing it because they enjoy making others suffer they are sadists by every definition they should at least have the balls to admit that instead of deluding themselves and others
stop this is different from undocking in eve how exactly you might tell yourself that you should be immune to unexpected aggression but that certainly doesnt mean you are and i think most people understand that at some point if they dont thats a failure on their part
back to the drawing board time for the professor
go everytime we leave our house in real life we accept the possibility that we could be shot by a mugger or killed by some psychopath for no reason at all so us having prior knowledge of the chance makes the people who do it justified somehowim not saying people should be immune or anything dont try to twist my words all im saying is the people who engage in such behavior should be honest with themselves and others about why they do what they do instead of creating delusions and justifications that allow them to see themselves as righteous while they go about cruel and sadistic behavior
note to selfnext time you get mugged press ctrlq and wake up safe in the real worldeditseriously please just reread everything you have posted in this thread and think about it for a minute you are saying that when you log on to a counterstrike server you should be left alone because you arent asking to be shot you are saying that when you log on to a combat game you havent actually agreed to engage in combat eve by every definition is a combat game why do you think practically every video of the game has ships blowing each other uphow would you like it if on your next mission the npcs turned around and said actually we dont want to be shot go away and jammed all your weapons consider that then consider whether eve is the game for you
every time you read a reply on the forums you run the risk of catching stupiddumb people on the forums are therefore automatically griefers and therefore obviously both mentally unstable and evil psychotics in real life ccp should pass on these players details to the proper authorities so they can be put in mental institutes for the criminally insane
in themepark games people roleplay being evil by getting different coloured armour and maybe some better ofensive magic you may get a different cutscene or too as wellin eve people roleplay being evil by doing evil things ingame
but you wont see good people deciding to roleplay as evil and cause others misery in a video game youll just see people who have those desires but cant act out on them in real life good people are good in every circumstance you put them inthey might want to think everyone is like them and because a monkey can be sadistic too its part of our nature and that makes it ok but i can tell you thats not the case some people are aversed to causing emotional suffering to others even through a video gamethis is the last time im going to repeat this but my only point is that the people who decide to roleplay evil shouldnt try to claim their victims chosen at random deserved it somehow if youre going to be evil dont be a  about it you like causing others misery and thats why you do it
maybe you never heard of thisman i hope you survive the rl learning experiences you have in front of you its probably good youre playing eve  this way the shock wont be so bad im guessing youre maybe 18 or 19 or perhaps in your early 20s noone with much life experience could possibly say what you just said
you can repeat things all you like but you still have a poor understanding of roleplay and what in game behaviour signifies in the attitude of the player
it goes far beyond your little link there check out the lucifer effect for added madnessmost people are weak minded they follow the herd doing whatever everyone else is doing easily influenced by someone else whether its an authority figure or not they dont know how to think for themselvesnot everyone is like that though
if 500 people are waiting to play chess and you make a point of only playing the kid with the helmet and the mittens pinned to his coat yes
and yet people who do think for themselves can still meet this criteria of goodness without an external reference are we dealing with some sort of platonic ideal of goodness or is it more of a case of deterministic moral universalism
i live a good live vicariously and release my urge to do harm by baking fluffy cupcakes transdimensional evil monitors my anguish metastasis through string cell hypertabernacles thus my dissonance is halved and my resolve pustulatedin short im a spazz irl as well as ingame
yeah i believe that subconsciously or at least on some level everyone knows right from wrong as it were they can sense it in every fiber of their being carl jung said all mental illness is due to people refusing to experience genuine suffering as soon as they start feeling guilt or remorse it bothers them and they come up with a different perspective on things that makes them feel better about themselves but its a delusion and thats the point where people start getting out of touch with reality and what theyre really doing
frigging terrible idea this is a solution in search of a problem i have a counterproposal lock thread ban op gas supporters i promise that it will make the game a better place
cookie cutter response 6473ok so from my point of view the wardec system has three fatal flaws1 its too easy to hide from wardecs players can just dock up or whatever and wait it out pvp in empire sucks and is boring it just leads to general frustration on both sides which i think is also why so little players in eve participate in pvp due to bad first expierences in empire2 the wardec system is abused there is a ton of crappy alliances in empire that runs around declaring war on various parties without fighting i think the op is partially correct in the assesment that if you dont fight often enough and you are the one who declared war in the first place concord should revoke your rights to that war with possibly banning you from declaring war for two weeks or something like that just brain storming3 if you declare war it should have weight and purpose it should be expensive to declare war and suddenly have concord turn a blind eye to you blowing someone else up in high sec the government would have been dismissed a long time ago for not cracking down on concordso what is the solution ive not thought too much about this but possibly base wardecs around lowsec not sure of the mechanics of how this would work but in addition to fixing wardecs you could give low sec a purpose too cause frankly at the minute its an empty dump with the occasional decent groups of pirates veto sniggwaffe gate campers and faction warfare fleets running through it possibly introduce a lesser version of the wardec for casual pvp in empirei dont think too many people are too happy about the state of wardecs right now other than privateers lol
do you vote on csm members based on game knowlage or based on verbal skills the csm does have to convince ccp of the players points of view after all
good idea
giving carriers a drone repair bay would be most useful for sure i agree totally that the new bay should not add more drone space i say that and believe that it may be necissary to enlarge the drone capacity with the new bay but make it so that drones can not be inside the bay when undocking the reason i say enlarging the bay might be necissary is because if you think about it as a whole it makes sense if you take space away from the drone bay you could be limitig the number of drones you can carry if you can only launch from the drone bay for instance with max skills you can have 15 fighters launched if you only have enough room for 15 fighters and nothing else in your bay it would be a setback and not a step forward personally i like to keep not only fighters in my bay but a mass of different types of drones to cover most situations i could find myself in i just do not want to see that precious space shrinked in the process of making carriers better

harmless and useful
im going to have to support some sort of increased tools to protect accounts from hacking im not so sure that wallethangar locks would be useful for normal game play however preventing certain things such as character transfers would be powerful tools in lessening damage hackers can do im sure theres a few other areas where it would be nice to have increased security available
signedemail control and secret question was an good idea
i alvin exe approve this message
yes everybody is responsible for the security of hisher pcbuthackers are pro programmers finding every days ways how to hack your securityim not an it specialist and i would be very happy to have a tool to increase the security of my accounti dont really care about my assets or isk but only the idea of knowing that at anytime my account can be stolen is very scaryyes please ccp please we are doing our best to increase our pc security but the thiefs are everyday working on new tools to steal our accountsgood idea i think to allow the lock of accounts transferti know that i will never ever want to sell my accounts i love this game and hope to play it until end of time at least mine here on eartha suggestion what about creating a secure certificate for each account without this certificate you can not unlock your accountalso when the hacker steal the account loginpass and when he want to change the email address of the account it could be possible to send a mail to the old mail address to inform about the changeor another way it is used by paypal to confirm that its really you they take a few cents of euro from your bank account thru your card in the line of the payment there is a code you log into the paypal account management and enter the code so the system is sure that the guy who pay is the real owner of the accountthere are several ways to increase the account security and i hope that ccp will allow at least an open discussion on thisand personnaly if it mean that to increase my account security i will have to pay lets say 10 as administration fee i will do itbecause my character invested money time and efforts are priceless for meedit spelling sorry for bad english

ive been asking for this for years nowben
erm whatretribution  150 dps in a 20km sphere  and 200 dps in a 7km sphere with enough tank to make it a real pain to take downvengeance  dude its a vengeance theyre awesome ive got a point and f you if you think your fleet is breaking me before my friends arrive epicmalediction  oh youre 200km from me oh look im right next to you with 3 pointscrusader  but its just an inty what can augh im meltingpurifier  300500dps from a frig with better fitting stats than the only other contender the hound add to that a usually  damn you vagabond  poorly tanked primary damage output and these hurtsentinel  mini curse totally awesome if flown wellpunisher  poor mans vengeance still goodcrucifier  poor mans sentinel anyone who doesnt like tracking disruptors in his frigate gang needs his head examinedtheres no other race that can field a viable and almost well rounded fleet simply using ships of their own race is it the best fleet you can field no absolutely not it is however a solid fleet quite capable of ruining peoples daysi love flying retributions theyre simple and fun to fly sometimes i do wish i had a second mid slot but then i wonder what it is that id be doing with it tackling people is the job of an inty or the vengeance the retribution is not a solo ship nor is it a wtfbbqpwn ship what it is is a good solid fleet ship that complements ships like the ishkur  arty wolf by supporting them in both their engagement spheres in that context it really doesnt need the second midnot supported
plz fix this redheaded stepchild
lol csmswhat a joke
a lot of the ideas are good individually omnibusing them is silly though  as a rule the csm process hates omnibus stuff split out the individual ideas and start bringing them up id support most of them
this packing multiple suggestionsideas into 1 is bad
the reason i put them into a omnibus is because 1 there are 16 ideas total at 5 min a pop that 1hour and 20 mins of posting2 if i were to to post all of them at once i would probably get flame posts about spamming the forum because it would take up the page3 by giving each one its own post that would be 16 different threads i would have to watch for responses and i dont want to spend that much time reading the forumsso instead i was hoping to get comments on which were the best one or two ideas and then post those 12 ideas as proposals in their own threads
no there is no need of so much changes just bring the weaponry in line with other races1650 arty are laughable at best
your post actually made me laugh out loud jason 5 out of 5 stars
i wonder if there is room for a mechanic where pilot sec status vrs system sec status modifies insurance payoutso a lower sec pilot in higher sec system gets less opens up loopholes surely maybe some math thatd work
so a  sec status player that loses a ship anywhere but highsec gets a reduced payout as wellcause intentionally putting your ship in risky situations surely necessitates some form of compensation to the insurer given the lack of terms on taking out the insurance rightor is this idea of your just a bitter childish knee jerk response to the idea of griefersdont answer that im teasing
i agree that new players can be totally viable in any part of eve but its easy for newbies to think that isnt the case ive been leading a corp of weekold players into wormholes for the past week  and occasionally even killing sleepershowever capitals and tech2 ships just say screw you newbie you can get along fine without them but the game holds them over your head taunting you you cant get at the coolest stuff without playing for months no matter how ingenious or profitable your character isin the same way i think all the little 5 to  that advanced players get merely for having subscribed for months or years is an unearned advantage that punishes new players just for being newi fully agree that new players need to know what they are doing and be creative to be successful but the tech 2 skill grind cannot be defeated by any amount of competence or clevernessi dont support massive sp bonuses to newbies i support fewer hard timebased limitations
i think i earned that just for subscribing in my case years in about three weeks i am going to start training some skills up to level 5 about 7 different skills its going to take me 112 days about 4 months to complete all 7 of those skills are you telling me i dont deserve the benefits those skills are going to give me
a new player can fit and fly t2 stuff in the first few daysweek but why shouldnt you have to wait for the cool stuff i had to wait 18 years before i could move out of my house 15 of those years i had to wait before i could even fly a 99 grand am another 3 years before i got my own apartment another 3 years before i got a houseeve  rl and should not be compared to it my point is that eve is modeled in some ways after that real life grind some players keep playing so they can get their characters into new ships others to be able to do more stuff etcum its an earned advantage theyve been subscribers for months or years to earn itwhat you really mean is you want to be able to grind like in wow to gain your levels quickly this is not wow as was deliberately crafted to not be similar in fact the real time skilling system is a main reason why some like to play thisbut yeah i dont see any reason why new players should have to wait for end game stuffedit i fail at quoting
what end game stuff titans expensive deadspace modules why should a noob be able to have them right away or even get them quicklyimo the skill training is just fine and when you actually achieve something you feel alot better than if you could have gotten it after a few days
wrongthe ninja salvager earn more money than mission runner without riska blockade time for an 610 months old charater is 3035 minutes with one ship earn 1820 million from bountya ninja salvager earn from salvage items if he just salvage the bs wrecks in mission 610 millions under 10 minute or shorter time and not need 2 months learning timeand the parasite ninjasalvager not waste his ammo not need 100 millions for battleship with full modules etcso ninjasalvager parasites worsen from agentrunner because they earn more money without risk from the work of other ones
well if thats the case why dont you sell that bad ass battleship and go get some scanning skills and salvage someones mission make a whole lot of isk others will see how well in the isk department you are doing which will get more people to say salvagers are ruining eve with the insane amount of isk they make on other peoples level 4 missions after about half of the high sec population starts to ninja salvage the other half ccp will step in and nerf the ninja salvagers you can then go and buy yourself another bad ass battleship and go back to running level 4 missions in high secyou have a winwin situation there whats the problem are you scared of getting shot at by the mission runner are you scared of a little risk
quoting the only sensible person in this threadonce the op and others get over the whole tired argument of percieved ownership and think for a moment about the consequences of what they are asking for then you might be worth taking seriously till then this is just the same generic whine thread that pops up once a week
i could see it being an option for either the corp name or no icon at alleither way the avatar sucks processor power and should go
agreed gettig rid of the avatar for a corp logo seems a bit silly you would still have the issue of images loading you dont really need an image next to the agents to know what they are about
ive got a better idea minimize and dont even load or search for the corp standings and the character standings just the factionthat all click on the corp or character bar and voila the info pops up make it all minimized and dont make it load or look on the server for the informationlots of times if i look at the standings page i only look to see if my corp is red or blue to him if im not too sure you know the useful stuff cause i dont really give a damn if he talked to x agentfor the op if i understand your explanation with the new system you would see the logo the name and the standings plus the i sign so in other words more data to load cause now you got the logo to get if theres an option to get that info and by default the client does not get the info like i explained above it would be a really good idea
great idea a
not sure how that is relevant to implant sets needing rebalancedyes virtues do help probingbut nothing can replace skills or experience and yes there are things you can do to avoid being probed out thats not what makes the set worthless the virtue set is worthless because of the huge cost relative to the crappy bonusesim for the rebalance im just saying that a lot of the sets suck not just the ones mentioned by the op

yes please whole petition system could use some ui designer love but this is the most glaring and obvious problem people dont bother reporting spammers because they have to jump through too many hoopsclicks to do it easier just right clickblock and it is out of your sight spammers then get to spam more per account created making their operation more profitable that other game managed to kill chatpublic channel spam almost completely with a feature like this
sure why not its got to be better than the current situation where if you report you get a nasty reply from ccp which leads you instead to just block leaving the spamming iskseller in operation
right click report spammer would be infinitely better than right click blockand there will always be false reports either intentionally or accidentally sometimes chat scrolls too fast

we are inviting everyone to join csm public chat the place where you can discus issues with your favorite csm people also we are inviting all candidates for csm 40 to join as well and promote their programs mods pls pin this threadthank you
good move thanks for opening another communication channeledit suggestion  the gms should add this to the other section of the channels list so its more accessible and easier to find for folks who may not read the forums
i opened this channel back during the csm 3 race but unfortunately uptake hasnt been incredible theres maybe a dozen people who ive ever seen in it thanks for advertising this hopefully it gets a bit less empty
thanks for sharing
i concur however with the proposed any covert operatives would blip on local when they showed up  you wouldnt instantly go from session changing in to cloaked still not idealid prefer a comprehensive solution to the localasanintelsource problem but if we cant get a commitment to do that than a halfassed bandaid like this would help
as a rule stealth aircraft turn off their transponders when they need to be yknow covert
if i want to i can build my ship from the ground up  raw materials to completion i can mine the ore refine the minerals assemble the parts and complete the build but somehow turning off or removing that damn transponder is completely beyond me
sarcasm aside maybe there should be an option to turn it off from any place you could normally do ship fittings stations butthen you wouldnt be able to see who else is in local either pit only seems to make sense to me that if youre not communicating with the network the network is not communicating with you
signed
sure you could turn off your transponder   and then the gate wont let you access it so you dont get to jump the original point makes sense local is a record everyone gets to access in return for being able to jump through the gates the real problem is not local it is logoffsky and cloaking many hunters say they want local removed however what they really want is prey not to logoff or sscloak once they show up on local if logging off left your ship scannable for a longer period of time it might even the odds for the hunter if a cloak on a nondedicated cloaking ship cov ops bombers recons had some fuel use or timer then cloaking would not be as much a problem and again the hunter could choose to wait out his ratting raven prey or look for easier less observant prey elsewhere or alternately new scanning skills could be introduced to give a small chance of scanning down cloaked ships cloaking would still be a viable option however you couldnt afk it the raven would still have to uncloak rotate safespots and recloak giving the hunter a chance to scan it down or kill if he warps back to a previous safespot that the hunter decided to camp and ships that can warp cloaked would still have to move or risk the possibility of being scanned down eventually the same mechanics would ameliorate the afk harrassment cloaking that occurs sure you could pop into your enemys system in your bomber because you can warp cloaked you have the advantage as a hunter but you sure couldnt afk for the day and go to work so you see local is not really the problem and it makes sense in the game unless we are to remove gates and make players constructed gates use of those gates requires a sacrifice on the players part if you use it you leave a kind of record of your entry for all to see and you get to see a record of who has entered your current system and not left its really pretty fair it is the other game mechanics that need tweaking
no that doesnt make sense if thats the way it worked people who enter a system via a wormhole wouldnt show up in local would they or via a cyno field
well you got me there your argument is valid as far as people entering from those means but for people entering from gates it makes sense to know they are there also there are still the problems that its too easy to logoff or cloak this is all a theoretical exercise anywayif local were to be removed there would have to be radical redesigns to how players scan and get intel why would anyone invest any serious infrastructure in 00 if you have no way to know of a threat before your expensive infrastructure is getting hammered and by the time you pull together a response destroyed removing local without replacing it with something useful would kill 00 population just as dominion is trying to increase it
so when youre at a big alliances home with 20 members in the system you want to continuously count the number of people in system to see if theres one person cloaked
simple comfort tweak just add an extra optional column that counts all objects in the overview from 1 to the sum of all objects the numbers are not attached to any object unlike for example the name of an object they are in a fix order so all the calculating can be done on the client side so it is basically like a row number in a spreadsheet but you only get a new row number if you get a new entry instead of already having them there so there is nothing automated its just an index name1 dummy12 dummy23 dummy3with a new object in the overview name1 dummy12 dummy23 dummy34 dummy4or name1 dummy42 dummy33 dummy24 dummy1advantages easier fleet surveillancereconnaissance because you dont have to count bluered dots or ship types in your constantly changing overview or your scanner fast composition check on asteroid belts no more asteroid counting to check out which belt is the juiciest  you can sort by corpalliance check the battle participants numbers and make a great post in a public forum about blobs and naps with accurate numbers before the battle without waiting for kill board data bonus easier target calling you can sync all overviews by sorting by name using the same filters and then call the number instead of the name so itll be primary 12 instead of primary zchruf30 what repeat please shoot zchruf30 in an apoc what spell it please zchruf30 helps with bad accents because almost everybody can pronounce a number in english if you sort differently or use different filters on different clients this wont work because you get different numbers as stated its just a bonus to get something extra out of this idea the target calling part is not an intended feature it is just an example i came up with on how you might profit from such a numeration you can still call by name or distance or whatever you like it is not like you have to make no effort to get standard overviews and settings for everybody in a 200 multicorporationalliance fleet to even have a basis for this to workthere might be more ways to profit from this but in the first place it is all about counting disadvantagesnon i could think of well except for the work needed to implement it  to sum it up counting stuff gets easier doesnt change any game mechanics or the gameplay because people are already counting and target calling but itd be less annoying and optionaledited for more clarityedited again for even more clarity
awesome idea
i like it
obviously a very good idea and since such a column can probably easily be made user toggleable wont bother those who dont need to count accurate numbers when scouting a 300man hostile fleet
id like to see that on the directional scanner too
very good idea

ok maybe a little cleaning up of what it is designed to dothe main purpose of the second tier is to reduce the deadlock feeling effect on a player deadlock meaning training a long skill a couple weeks or even a few months and not being able to do anything else except wait for that skill to finish and move on with their eve experience this was the same thing that made me leave eve for a while but ive continued since in my two years since starting eveyes it would increase overall training speed four times slower but in a separate queue would be a 25 increase which is probably too muchas i said still refining it and here i believed was a good place to do it maybe have it so the second tier can only hold one skill at a time like it was normally before the queue was introduced that would reduce the time a player could be training a skill effectively cutting that 25 increase in time by half or more at four times as longalso for restrictions on how soon a player could use it would 55 learning skill be required or a one month timer or maybe after their doubletime speed training of 16 mill sp is over
i get deadlock and i know why its annoying im doing a 17 day skill right now and its hardly the longest ive trained but i dont play this game to rack up new skills even if it is nice i play it because its a good game just because it takes longer to hit the next level doesnt mean im deadlocked at all im just training a long skill if i need something be it a skill i forgot or just the satisfying feeling of a new skill or two i can pause switch and resume with no loss this isnt necessary youre just juggling the same thing presenting it differently and calling the problem solved you see no deadlock i see 20 of my sp gain being spent on my secondbest skill to train not my best this wont fix anything except your own perceptions and dealing with those doesnt require a change in game mechanics sorry man but no support
theres a ton of no brainer proposals on the table but i hadnt seen this one mentionedgive us the ability to set motd for corp and alliance channelsthanks
again
been proposed dont think the csm has ever taken it up though still a good idea the second time
sounds logical to me
there are too many reasons for the corpalliance chat to have a motd in general it would be a great asset to the leaders of said corpalliance
i know we brought it up to ccp in january it should come with revamp of alliance and corp uiyou can see it here
i could rant and insult ccp about this but meh its getting tiresome
i like it
the issue was technical due to the fact that the channels are mandatory and unmoderated the security mechanics put in place to make sure noncorpies arent able to join the channel by any means then having nobody as op to kickban those people afterall it might be seen as exploit and easy ban but what are the chances the logs show something enough to ban the person and in a corp with perhaps 100 people online all the time being the most likely target chances are you would just have a bad timesupport nonetheless
did you just try to make my head explodealso motd for fleets please being able to put stuff there as in which coms to use would be handy
yes please
how this isnt in already baffles me
introducing logic into eve one proposal at a time
some modules dont have metal levels other than 1 and some dont even have tech 2 modulesas an example the tractor beams only havesmall tractor beam i meta 1capital tractor beam i meta 1it would be useful to have different meta levels dropped from rats and also t2 variants from invented blueprints at least we would have performance options also maybe different sizes for modules but that would depend on the kind of module
i cant say im against this and i really like this idea but you have to know what the consequences for having ie medium tractor beama meta level modules or different size when we currently dont at the momenti can already see the implication of having a bigger tractor beam which logically would give us more range on it faster isk cause you dont have to do 2060km to get all cans together which i do sometimes or get there in the first placebut yeah i do support this at the same time since we got the bpo for the tech 1 standard items cant ccp make the npc drop named itemsnot a ton but just a few cause t1 from npc come on is this a joke
most of the modules that dont have meta level options dont need them not supported
can i counter with all the drone enhancement modulesit is the only weapon system without t2 modules to enhance it and wit as far as i know it only 1 meta level module give as a reward for the gallente epic arc
even though this is already possible why isnt it on the infamous right click menu i mean when i first started playing eve i cant count how many times i was told when in doubt right click i know it is a bit trivial however i feel that it is important to stick to simple this game is complicated enough without having to dig to access your drone bay at a pos
because it requires the ship maintenance array and you dont want the code generating the rightclick menu to have to check nearby pos structures before it can generate the menu
why not make it a right click on the ship maintenance array then there would be no checking for pos arrays
it would still have to check range  but it does that already to see if you can access stored vessels so i really dont see a problem with doing it that way
sorry i used to fly with mh a tough bunch no doubt but only if they can stay organized i already know having a fleet align option would be a godsend for them

nice idea but not supportif its a feet and we are capsuleer everybody should be able to do and a good fleet win when pilots are good pilots not only the fc

the sin has a agility bonus and the panther a velocity bonus its impossible to speed tank battleships with such a large sig radius the bonuses are useless compared to the tracking bonus of the redeemer and the ecm bonus from the widow my proposal is to give them bonuses that are in line with the other black ops bonuses here is also an discussion going on in the ships and modules category
i get the distinct impreession that you dont fly a typhoon if you had youd think differently the typhoon has a very strong speed aspect its oneof the few things that makes it a popular ship in most circlesnow granted your talking about the pantherbut its roots are the typhoon even though its not considered a speed tank it is a rather fast battleship in comparison to othersso in conclusion id have to say not supported
better yet why not give it a historical description provide an event or some such which names a player to have found it or some such that way you get player involvement in the history of eve happening morewhy do i suggest thisthe description of a heritage asset under the australian government is a physical asset that has historical cultural environment scientific or educational importance to the community and the reason they hold heritage assets to bring the community closer together if ccp is serious about bringing the eve community into a more active participation of the game development then they should perhaps look at this option of course naming a player in the description of a region doesnt qualify as a heritage asset but it would enrich the cultural and historical value of eve
this thread now officially has enough supports to be taken to ccpmaz i found another cause for you
yet you didnt support itheres my suggestion for a descriptionthis is an area of space that was discovered long ago however due to be so terrible and full of tribbles it wasnt settled sleepers being of greater technology to new eden residents had discovered wormholes first but the first sleeper explorers had been obliterated by the tribbles sleepers left knownspace due to the hostility
i didnt need to as demonstrated in the csm term limits thread 3 supports are all that are needed adding my own would have been extraneous
when i got my first chance to vote for csm i pretty much voted for a random personwhy because i know nothing about the csm members i dons know who they are where they come from etc i think next election we should have a link next to each candidates portrait that goes to his personal page with his own speech and also possibly a discussion thread would be even better if questions could be askedwhy i was trying to find information on a number of csm members and i found it very troublesome and managed to find sort of complete information only on 2 or 3 candidates maybe i did not put enough effort maybe i wasnt doing it right or looking in the right place that is not the point you should have information easelly available users should not spend hours looking for it there are people wondering why players do not vote people do not vote because when they click on the add they see 2030 faces that they do not know and have no idea on who they are know nothing about them they feel confused somewhat lost video interviews or some sort of campaign would be awersome but if you whan to become a meber of csm you should be required to at least write a small page about yourself and what you are planning to do
afaik there was page with all candidates where you could see their campaign messages and there were links to their websites also most of the delegates had their threads in jita park speakers corner there was even a sticky with compiled links to the threads of all candidates
yes
how hard would it be to make a quick tweak to give wardecers the option to restrict perhaps things like podding or similarfor example internet tough guy wardecs these rvb guys i set it so i cant pod they also cant pod me alsosimilar options like that could be setup it can also be made visible to all those involved surely the mechanic could be pretty easy to build into the game
ticks the checkbox for cant kill ships and towers
as a standalone idea im not a fan none of the wardec mechanics are based on mutual agreement and letting one side set all the terms is too powerful as part of a bigger wardec change though id be for it if mutualconsent wars were added setting limits on them would be perfectly reasonable
is it just me or are all shield hardeners louder than 700 doomsdays combined it overpowers everything else i prepose that the volume for hardiners gets turned down at least 50 as it makes my ears bleed p

other mmos may offer added freebies like vet rewards because typically the vets there will have reached the games level cap given enough time eve has no such cap nothing realistic anyway so here they arent necessarynot supportedben

whatim currently developing a website based on the dutch stemwijzer a website that allows you to compare different political parties i plan to have this operational before the csm4 voting starts the website presents the user with a list of statements pvp should be optional trade orders should have a 1000 isk minimum increment etc and compares the answers the user gives to the answers given by csm candidates using this comparison the website then calculates a match percentage neatly identifying which candidate represents the users views the besthowthe website works in the following waycandidates receive a password that allows them to log on to the website here they can answer the statements their answers are stored in the database they can edit this information at a later time1 the answer options are strongly disagree disagree no opinion agree strongly agree while we are gathering candidate profiles user matching will be disabled as they can only get reliable results when all candidates have finished their profiles these profiles illustrate the vision of each candidateonce all within reason candidates have filled in their profile matching will be enabled users fill in the same questionaire as the candidates did and we calculate a match percentage additionally we display a table of all questions and all candidates that shows the user where his questions match and differ from the candidatesdevelopment versionthe website is
rankingscoring mechanicintroductionthe current system turns every answer into a numeric value strongly disagree being 2 to strongly agree being 2 so it gives you the range 2 1 0 1 2 additionally each candidate can mark a certain number of questions as being important to him or her important questions count doublea users answers are compared to the candidates answers matching answers increase fidelity with the candidate differing answers decrease fidelity with a candidate the candidates with the highest fidelity scores are the best matches the biggest fidelity increase is 2 and the biggest decrease is 2 4 and 4 if the question is marked importantthe questionthe question is how to compare and score candidate and user answers ill explain the current scoring mechanic and my justification and would welcome comments or constructive criticism if you feel it should be differentcase user and candidate have the exact same answerfidelity  2 the only exception is when the answer is no opinion in which case it is fidelity  1 justification absence of an opinion is not valued as highly as an opinion other than that answering exactly the same thing indicates high fidelitycase user and candidate have the similar answersfidelity  1 examples are strongly agree vs agree and strongly disagree vs disagree justification while the two answers arent identical there exist still a general concensuscase user has no opinionfidelity  0 the only exception is when the candidate also answered no opinion in which case it is fidelity  1 justification if the user has no opinion the candidates answer is immaterial unless the candidate feels exactly the same waycase user and candidate have differing viewsfidelity  1 or fidelity  2 depending on the difference in view no opinion vs stronglyagreedisagree or stronglyagree vs stronglydisagree we substract the highest number from the lowest number giving us a range of 1 to 4 a difference of 1 or 2 is fidelity  1 a difference of 3 or 4 is fidelity  2justification the 14 range is normalized to 12 to avoid counting strong differences in opinion heavier than equally strong agreementdiscussion point should this be changed to 1  1 and 24  2 one could argue a difference of 2 already indicates enough difference in opinion no opinion vs strongly disagree agree vs disagree to warrant the most severe reduction in fidelity
i would recommend not only adding questions directly about gameplay issues but also about the methods philosophies and requirements of the candidates themselves with this i mean questions like should csm prioritize issues solely based on the number of votes it received on the forum or should a proper candidate be part of a 00 alliance
your majestyplease please deign to look down from your pedestal on us mere mortals and heed our pleas for sustenance we grovel in the altar of your magnificence perchance you could listen to our beseeching requests for a mere moment of your time such that we may make suggestions regarding the sandbox that is eveyour humble obedient servantmust be hard to be as magnificent as you are 
you dare address a csm directly insolence they will acknowledge your existence and answer any feeble questions you might have when they feel like it once the sacred ritual of completing the power cycle is complete so they can have ultimate power by being csm forver then and only then will your pathetic requests for attention will be heardthe universe is theirs
game knowledge mostly
vuk lao dont you think game knowlage is relatively useless in the hands of a csm member considering that its ccps game designers thatll eventually work out what to do about the problems the csm brings to the table not the csm itselfthe csm arent game designers theyre not there to create gameplay mechanics theyre there to tell ccp what the playerbases issues are with their game or do you disagree with that premise
ofc i disagree there is much more ppl then game designers who will implement particular change so its irrelevant for this issue knowing game mechanics is essential for csm delegate cause without having extensive game knowledge you are not viable to discuss about them if there is a problemissue csm needs to identify it propose the solution aswell as all pros and cons coming with a solution even game designers propose official solution it still needs to get amen from senior producers and ofc from programmers cause if it cant be implemented due to codeswhs issues even the best proposal is useless
ive desided to apply for csm since i feel my skillset from my reallife background would provide a valuable and unique asset to it in very general terms i agree with ankhesentapemkah and take cares philosophies on the csm but i feel that 2 csm members with that mindset is better than oneany votes that dont go to me i would hope to see in their hands insteadsee you on the campaign trail

as said on the wiki that makes me think it could be nice to be able to apply the same lock to any character generally the main character i presume considering the deletion of the mentionned character  not sure if that is often the case but i would not be really happy to see a keylogger or something else trying to delete the main character if he is not able to sell it and that action only takes 1 day not a weekwell that is not like if we delete everyday our 10m sp character so i think it could be interesting to have both locks under hand  always in an optionnal way of course

research of topics already considered by csm seems to indicate that this one hasnt been considered unless i missed it although similarrelated ideas have been discussed or mentioned in the features and ideas forumi want to be able to set the dscanner range with a single click on a range value rather than having to select the slider button and move it to the desire range please replace the range slider with either a radio button for available range settings 5 15 30 60 90 180 360 or some kind of segmented labeled bar where you click on the segment desired to select a anglesliders are annoyingly time consuming to use my proposed change would allow faster selection for every angle option and instant accuracy elusive 15 degree angle this means you updated to change range to angle the paragraph above in keeping with the topicbif you post in support of this idea please dont forget to select the support check box before submitting your replyb
yes yes and thrice yes the angle slider on the dscanner is incredibly frustrating to use would be nice if there were the option to chnage the range units between aus and km as well
definitely supported need something like this for the distance as well which should of course be able to be switched to au too
isnt this the part where i should say zomg you want to make scanning people down and ganking them easieroneelevenunoactually it sounds like a good idea  that angle slider is a huge pita especially trying to hit the smallest angles

my original post is confusingly written as originally presented mixing the terms range and angle inaccurately now that it has supports it is not allowed to be edited i knew i shoulda waited for that 4th cup of coffee to kick in before posting anyway my original intent was to focus on angle selection what i meant to express was thisi want to be able to set the dscanner angle with a single click on an angle value rather than having to select the slider button and move it to the desired angle please replace the angle slider with either radio buttons for available settings 5 15 30 60 90 180 360 or some kind of segmented labeled bar where you click on a segment to select a desired anglesliders are annoyingly time consuming to use my proposed change would allow faster selection for every angle option and instant accuracy elusive 15 degree angle this means youof course easier range selection would be nice as well what comes to mind is a combo box where you can type in any value up to max range or select preset values from a dropdown menu in a perfect world those preset values could be part of the users custom configuration of their eve client via the options window

as to the underlined bold bit how bout tacklingcan you make me a list of frigates cruisers and battleships that have a single mid slot tackling isnt just the job of inties and the vengeance and when you said vengeance you should have said every other assault frigate in game its a role that can and should be able to be filled by every combat ship in the game and actually can be filled by every other combat ship in the gamewhy would a second mid make the ship a wtfbbqpwn ship your words never would they be mineit would simply allow it to fill a role besides being meat in a fleet as its currently the only ship in game restricted to one single roll in a fleetso obviously when it only has one possible use mediocre dps honestly fly an omen or a maller its cheaper and does more damage and has a hardier tank in either case so of course when placed in this less than ideal context it wouldnt need an adjustment and we could continue on our merry wayunfortunately if that were the case there would be other ships in the game that were unable to tackle or only had a single midone midif such a change was made and you still felt the need to not tackle with it thats your choice maybe you want to set it up with a tc to allow it to hit farther out god knows it s on tracking or maybe a sb to achieve inty style lock times to stop those cloakers from getting awaymaybe a target painter on those obnoxious inties circling your fleet or some form of mild ewarthe point is you would have a choice of doing something other than mediocre over priced dps
fixed
youve completely misunderstood the roles that assault frigates are meant to play there are 2 afs for each race  one for heavy tackle and one for dps with tank if youve got a wolf in fleet as a tackling ship then youve wasted a pilot in a misused role if youve not brought enough dedicated tackling ships in your fleet that you need to load up your dps ships with points then you need to seriously reconsider your fleet makeup in that context why on earth should the retribution have an extra mid tackle is taken care of ecm is taken care of the mids on damage afs are to reinforce any areas of your fleet that you want to shore up  not form the core functionif youre going to compare af dps to cruiser dps then im sorry but by that argument we should just pack up all afs right now because they will never compare favourably sure the ishkur can do 300 dps but compared to almost any gank cruiser thats really very poor to the point of pitiful given the dps you can get out of vexors for example incidentally i never said that adding a mid would make the retri a wtfbbqpwn ship i was merely pointing out that unlike the relative glass cannon which is the ishkur you cant possibly expect the same close range dps from itso then if were to compare dps then we must compare it to frigs in general and af in particular in these terms it comes out near the top second in class  the wolf just doesnt cut it and the harpy and also very much in the upper range for frigs in general the key then is the role it performs it fits in as followsishkur  wtfbbq close range gankwolf  wtf alpha long range dpsretri  wtf inty melter close range hi dps long range hi dpsharpy  wtf why are you flying thisit fills that role atm quite admirably and as i said before if youre in the position that you have to use the midslots on your dps frigates then you need to reconsider your fleet compositionthe retribution like the coercer  also 1 mid slot is explicitly a fleet ship fleet ships specialise to a role retri does works as intended its not like youd suggest a damage bonus to a kitsune so if youre ok with specialisation there why not here
not so much against a single target even up to bs but especially up to bc ehp the retribution will almost always be on the top of the killmail arty wolves have less dps and ishkurs have much less range in longer single target engagements of course the ishkur wins if anything theres an argument for dropping wolves from fleets completely  in the discussions we have in firetech over balanced fleet compositions the argument is explicitly between all ishkurs melt their faces and mostly ishkurs with some longer range face melting please it also depends on what prey youre hunting if we were all still in factional warfare then swapping some ishkurs for wolves is a nobrainer when most of your skirmish engagements are in frigate hulls the ability to make 1020 of the enemy fleet detonate on your arrival on the field was something i used many times to great effect in any case to reject retributions out of hand is to miss their power and their versatility in fleet
i understand you like the ship but look at itthe other ships you name can all now fit a scrambler and use it in conjunction with their ab bonus to hold a target down so they can apply their dpsall of them fyi the coercer kinda sucks too but thats destroyers in general and an entirely different topicevery other ship you talk about can scramble a target to disable the mwd of the target they are all also marginally faster than the retribution as well shedding even more light on the need of the ship to be able to scramble targets to keep things in its sphere of influenceyes other wingmates can have this but you cant ever unless you give up your ab which means that an default in the ships current slot layout prohibits you from taking full advantage in your ships bonus systemshow would you keep your dps on target by always depending on somebody elsewhy would you fly the ret when every other af you named can and does have the ability to pick a target and apply dps and keep that dps on target via a single 2ndary ewar modas i said the retribution was the first ship i ever purposely trained for i know exactly what its like to fly the ship and i remember the times when the fight simply progressed beyond my sphere of influence and i was helpless to effect its outcome because of the ships failings i probably flew it just about every day for 3 or 4 months prepping hacinty skillsthats a long time to get pretty intimate with a ship and i feel pretty confident that this would improve a good shipis your 5th high slot really worth that much to you when even ccp admit the ship is flawed
the ship is fine no need to change anything if you need tackle then fly another ship if you need high dps low sig radius and good warp speed fly the retri
thiseach ship is unique to itselfand as such you dont need to force them to be all alike in the most common roles you deem necessary for said shipas i said the assault shipfrigates role is dps not tacklingif you want to tackle you get an interceptor or a partneryour assumption in the basis that this ship is only able to take on smaller prey is wrongthis ship can take on anything larger its also normal for amarrian ships to have few mid slotsif ccp sees fit to change it im not gonna go emorage but i still say there is nothing wrong with this ship
heya fool wondered where you got off to the retribution is probably the only focused af of the bunch it does damage at range i might add and tanks like nothing elseit is the amarrian design philosophy condensed into a single ship providing a constant stream of 150200dps in a 20km sphere around it damage support and lots of itin a gang it is devastating and solo it will kill most softer targets before they can even make it to warp a single bump and a lse omen is in hull by the time he warps now that is powersecond mid slot has to come from somewhere remove a lowslot and the ship is gimped remove a highslot and the fitting options drop to 12 with practically no deviationsso pray tell where should this slot come from if the ship is to remain intactgive it a little extra fitting and a 5th gun mount all options remain viable and it gets to do its job with even more efficiency
one wordteamwork
yeslook i know your pain ive watched targets warp away from me because the ship i love has no point to keep them in place whilst i kill them and i raged at the time too one day though i simply accepted that i was trying to fit a square peg into a round hole there are other ships in game that you presumably accept are so specialised that you can never fly them solo kitsune for one i dont see why this isnt the case for the retribution with the exception perhaps of the ishkur i would argue that no af is a solo ship the heavy tackle boats have the dps of an asthmatic fly who has just returned home from the shops carrying a particularly heavy bag of shopping and the dps boats generally lack the tank to take down their target before they themselves die a pack of af working together in a properly balanced fleet though really is something special the fact that i still go to frigate gangs as my default roam almost every night i log on is testament to that
i would love one more mid on my retribution it would certainly be less lolwtf in gangs
i love the retribution for missioning combat sites and other carebear activity i prefer having the fifth high slot for a salvager
i almost daily fly logistic ships in low sec and something that has really started to bother me is how 1 logistic ship is just not viable for one single group of people i am here talking people with a 5 or worse sec statusbasically you get criminal flagged for repairing someone with low security status even if the guy hasnt agressed anyonei really dont see the point in this feature in high sec if a low sec status person does something illegal he gets criminal flagged anyway so changing it wouldnt make people immune to concord anywaybasically its just making a shiptype unuseable for a small group of people when fighting between each other im here talking about pirates in general when a blinky shoots a blink all is fine when one of the sides show up with a logistic ship that one gets d by sentry guns and the sudden change of primary targetdoes a fix to this even hurt anyone
im not a 10 but if this works like you suggest i support changing it
as i recall the evolution of gc for repping a criminal was because people were farming cosmos sites for invention materials right after t2 invention was introduced a farmer would sit there and rep all the rats to keep anyone else away and rep his two or more chars as well it was something along those linespersonally i have an issue with the neut remote rep as it is now as it is creating opportunities for metagaming in pvp which is bad imoif they can separate rat criminals from player criminals then i can agree with the solution to a degree if you are repping someone then someone else should be able to shoot you too but the gate guns on you does seem a bit much
i do indeed agree with you this proposal is not made for metagaming in high sec or low sec for that matter all i want is to be able to fight other pirates without getting shoot at as the only person in the fight by sentry gunsrepping rats should still give criminal flag however it cant be that hard to code a difference between repping an npc and repping a player
signed
you can also be guilty of aiding and abetting a crime if you help another person who is sought for criminal activity ie negative sec status is exactly that  i think this is working as intended and should be left alone
low sec is the domain of outlaws we should not get flagged for helping our own unless the one were helping has aggression toward a nonoutlaw then i can see the point of flagging someone for remote repping another outlaw
i already raised this in iceland brosefedit thats the one
totally agreea lot more needs to be done pirates are screwed over way too hard in this game in favour of damn carebearsbut on a serious note if the person you are trying to rep hasnt got gcc then you shouldnt recieve penalty just for helping himit even happends if you are in the same corp stupid
i dont think you heard the op its pirate vs pirate tbh i dont think the police would mind them blowing up each other in lawless spacethe whole thing was implemented because of a high sec issue as so many times before low sec was forgotten and again pirates are screwed overif the pirates agress a nonoutlaw any logistic ship on the field will get criminal flagged like anyone else still anyway
because i wonna shoot you as soon as you leave the station

isk is more important than sp give new players more isk p
its clear for me than 65k tu begin its really to low for the begining and give 5 m sp its clearly not the solutionbut why not give to the new player 400k sp give by basic profession like before and you increase the boost until 2 m spwith 400k you can play a little and you keep the booster
ya i definitely do not support this unless the new player is going to be paying a premium for it else everyone that wants to make throw away characters for griefing will be getting a big assist from ccp
well so far this thread has had complaints ofpeople saying that getting past cruisers takes 3570 days to be remotely effectivepeople saying you cant play this game without over 5m sppeople saying that learning skills are a waste of timepeople saying that new players cant do anything in the game without tremendous isk buying or another character financially supporting themwell crap i must have been doing it wrong all this time i mean im a 3 12 month old character with half of my basic learning skills at 5 and most of my advanced learning skills at 4 and very happy that i can use those skills to control the speed at which i level i started on my own havent used rl money to buy ingame money havent been funded by another character and withing 253 months i was flying battleships in level 4 missions with no problemsto all of those people who were complaining i apologize most sincerely for playing incorrectly and will proceed to think that i cant do anything cuz i dont yet have 20m sp yeti might as well sit in a station and train instead of playing the game earning loads of isk in my self funded battleship with mostly t2faction fittings
malcanis law when a change is proposed on the forums to help the new players it is always to the greater benefit of the older rich players
as has been said before any benefit for new players will benefit long time players more they will make a second accountcharacter and take advantage of it way better then a new playerin eve the fun in the game lies in the journey not what you reach in the end a hypothetical player with all skills maxed which is impossible will have nothing more to look forward to and even though that player can do anything it will likely get boring in any case you can be effective at any level of sp and there are plenty of corps willing to teach you properly helping you have fun from the getgo try referring your friends to corps like the eve university they take on any newbie and can teach you all the valuable lessons also with dominion supposedly the whole tutorial system will get yet another revamp helping new players experience the true nature of eve better and from the moment they first undocktldrno changes brought up here will have the intended effect and the entire concept is flawed not supported
i have been playing this game for a lil over 2 months i have about 33 million sp and a hulk now we all know what u can do with a hulk so saying u need 5 m sp to start out with would be unrealistic and would cause a new player to miss out on hisher development periodthe key to eve is patience if u do not have any do not play
well good for you that you are so hardcore pi for one agree that the game needs to be more accessible for new players in lots of ways one of em would be raising the double sph thing to 3mil or sth and also making sure that they know they are able to do lots of stuff before they have 15mil sp
yay another one ill try to be brief and summarize few bits i think are relevantat first wrecks dropped a can or nothing depending if there was loot later due to some underhanded griefing tactics probably the killer of an npc got ownership of the canlife was grand mission runners got bounties loot lp for their troubles salvage was introduced but probably due to performance reasons it was deemed necessary to merge the wreck and the can in a bit of a compromise wrecks would inherit the ownership of the can so that mission runners would not feel like they were robbed out of previously gained privileges but salvaging the wreck would be free for all wrecks with loot in them were changed to drop a can if salvaged before looted so that the free for all  part of the compromise would work better mission runners noticed that the newly introduced salvage could increase their income by good 30 but there was a problem if they didnt put an effort in it some scurwy dog could salvage the wrecks before they could mission runners decided to ignore the freeforall part of the compromise and instead actually tried to use the good stuff they retained in the compromise as some sort of twisted proof that freeforall actually meant freeformeunlessidontwantitso here we are the core reason for these threads cropping up is that a good part of the mission runner community cant handle contested resources probably because due to the nature of mission running they havent had to do so before the risk argument is just hypocrisy the risk is in the isk so to speak competition is the risk any salvager including mission runners has to deal with so its really not about increasing the risk for the ninjasalvager but removing the risk from the mission runner and turning salvage into a guaranteed profit the fact that a wreck only exists because you shoot it is irrelevant although it does give you a significant edge if you want to salvage yourself and gives you some additional options for dealing with the competition which a ninja salvager doesnt have the perceived problems with the ownership issue are understandable if you consider the above timeline however the one simple move that would unify the whole issue for all types of wrecks is actually by removing loot ownership from the person that killed the ship not to give wreck ownership as well but then i guess thatd feel a lot like like betraying the other end of the compromise so im sure quite a few people would object to thatmy view on changes that might be necessary empty wrecks spawn with no owner if a tractorbeam is activated on a wreck with loot in it by someone else than the owner the wreck loses ownership but drops the loot at the same spot in a can with the ownership intact probing wrecks out of a deadspace pocket should be possible out of a deadspace pocket to avoid the inevitable outcry of how probing mission runners was again made easier if zillion wrecks in a system would lag out the probing system you could instead have mission deadspace spawn a temporary until last wreck expires for example probeable warpin to a spaceship junkyard at the time of mission completionthese changes i feel would turn the system both more logically consistent and still be in spirit of the above compromise and make different breeds of salvagers slightly more equal than they are now after a while i suspect people the amount of these threads would somewhat diminish since it would be more apparent that wrecks are intended as free for allalso if there isnt one yet a tutorial bit explaining the basic ownershipaggroconcord mechanics might be in order
ccp employees have stated in several posts on these very boards that salvaging as a miniprofession is working as intended salvage materials do not exist until a wreck is successfully salvaged since it doesnt exist it doesnt belong to anybodythe moment a wreck is successfully salvaged the recovered materials become property of the salvager if you are not said salvager that salvage does not belong to youit is a very simple concept the problem isnt with salvaging with a profession its with your gimmie gimmie attitude and belief that eve is a warm and fuzzy place where carebears are safe from the cold empty black of spacegood morning sunshine its a beautiful nothingness outside today
yawnthat old straw againyoud think that there were no cans out there  oh wait there are any ninja that actually wants to trigger aggro can do so just take one measely unit of ammo out of a wreckthe option is already there  and yet it is used only seldomtherefore no real change this threat is just to scare people and it is an entirely empty one
a common misconceptionin international waters anyone can salvage anything however if you want to dock anywhere and not get sued you need to take that salvage to an admiralty court and they then divvy it between you the salvager and the original owner the only exceptions are warships and ancient shipsgo ahead and do a wiki for maritime salvage its all there
the real honest problem here is that for those who werent around for the history the current system makes precisely zero sensewhats the difference between a gun and an armor plate well none really except there is why is one yours and one not well because you need a salvager for one huhits immersion breaking which is why the first time folks run into ninjas theyre like huh thats got to be a glitch intuitively it makes no sense and its not ever going to in its current incarnationthere are lots of possible fixes one would be a claim system but that should be short another would be a system that allows the wrecks themselves to be scanned out tractors should work on everything it makes no sense that a puller beam cares about ownershipthere are lots of different things that could be done the current system is going to cause these threads as long as it stays as is because no one gets it and suddenly ninjas endlessly quoting hoary text from a couple of years ago isnt much help because the explanations in that text dont make any sense to anyone except those who1 want it to be true or2 were the ones trying to do the explainingto everyone else its bafflegab that flies about as well as a neutronium duckso thus some kind of change is needed so ill support the op although thats not the only change id do as its unbalanced  fixing tractors and allowing wreck scans seem fair compromises for balance
my first blockade took me a full six hours although that included flying into the mission space in my own salvage ship a bunch of times before the wrecks vanishedone of the reason that mission runners get bent about ninjas is that their ships are cheap their skills are low one can do very well with a 23 week old character and the pay is extremely high with very low riskif the ninja player had to put in months of grinding both isk and status in order to make the income they get id have more sympathy for them but being able to make l4 class income in a 23 week old character in a ship that doesnt even cost a million isk with close to zero chance of losing the ship is kind of broken its another reason that mission runners get kind of perturbedand yes they could join them rather than beat them and some do but a lot of them just dont enjoy griefing folks and that makes the profession kind of unpalatable for them
if they allow supercarriers to dock then im going to get one and not do anything else except play docking games with something with the ehp of a medium pos until ccp sees how dumb it is
1 to any of the ideas in here station games suck
first of all sorry for my english it has improved in the years but it is still bad so watching the fanfest in youtube i came up with some ideas you may like or may noton the previous fanfest there was talking for the missile turrets on ravens and generaly missile boats where designers didnt want them shown for various reasions so here is my tought on that small opening panels to shoot missiles out of them flares to attrackt missiles we all know the existing defender missiles are pretty uselessmay be in all ships or just the missile boats in high slot modul or separate hangar in the ship like drone ones with limited space or ammosome toughts on mwds and afterburners if you fit mwd you can get separate boosters outside the ship like the tech3 models or may be a little biger boosters on the existing ones and when you fire the mwd or afterburner you get more blinding light behind the boosters and posibly longer trails some shaking of the ship might be cool as wellsome toughts on thermodinamics overheating your capacitor incase someone is neuting your cap may be similar defence like eccm smoke fire sparks electrical spikes all over the place when overheating variuos modules that can be seen etcsome thoughts on cloaky ships scanning a lot of ppl have seen in movies some spaceship is following another spaceship via engine trails so may be we can find afk cloakers by scanning thier engine trails and the person who is scanning them can warp near the cloaker and try to decloak him or somethingwell thats on my mind for now compiled in an hour  sounded better in my head but who knows you might have similar thoghts or this have been posted already feel free to add more stuff or just modify those
 small opening panels to shoot missiles out of themmakes sense theyll probably do something like this  flares to attrackt missiles we all know the existing defender missiles are pretty uselessmay be in all ships or just the missile boats in high s
i support thisoften enough i fly a fully loaded hauler tofrom a pos either bringing fuel to the pos or taking stuff from the pos to a nice market hub and i get scanned on almost every gate in the vicinity of said market hubthere is absolutely no defence possible against suicide gankingscanning is a way to figure out if youre going to have any reward from ganking a ship why shouldnt the possible targets be able to make sure they do not get scanned
while i do not agree with the ops proposal i do agree that there should be some nonaggressive defense available against cargoship scannersthe best idea would be either a lowslot mod or a rig that cloaks the ship meaning that scanners aimed at the ship will return no results
actually if i am not mistaken there is an unpublished module or rig that does exactly that so the question is why is this unpublishedseems ccp already took a look at this problem and decided to leave it as is mm
then wouldnt the better solution be that if a pilot scans your moduleshold that it instead preempts the passive targeting system
supported
heeck even getting the option to select a group of things to make a queue of sell order dialogs would be a massive gameplay improvement for those trying to make a sizable quantity of sales
i support this guy quitting and going back to wowalso i like the standings idea kind of bites that you can permanently ruin your opportunity to mission for pirate factions when the rest of the game is so open endedi think there should be some grind or at least a time frame once per year built in shouldnt be something the rich can do at willedit to add you could also reset your sec status to 0both would have to be balanced so it wouldnt be something you could do at will
sisters of pirate evecorrupt agents with minus 40 quality or whatever would work with 5 and belowjust some special agent with no standing requirement but whose missions are likely to give heavy standing hits for empire factionsnot a big fan of the just pay isk idea but whateverif missions are going to be the way ccp wants everyone to make isk they need to throw the 00 factions a bone on this
while watching the fanfest 2009 videos a question was asked about covert op ships that are in a fleet and cloaked not being able to see each otherthe response from ccp was that the ships are removed from the universemy idea is to have a module yes it takes a slot and can only be used on covert op and related ships that can be linked to another module of the same sort in another ship the ships would need to be in a fleet and they would use a unique password to stay associated with this module covert op pilots would know where the other covert op pilots in their fleet were locatedthe technical details each client knows where the pilots ship is even if its not in the game universe otherwise collisions and the cloaked ship render couldnt happen the module would use a fleet id i assume there is one to keep track of the fleets and the password to encrypt the location being transferred between ships the location is encrypted on the client and sent to the server which forwards it to each ship in the fleet if someone doesnt know the password they cannot decrypt it and therefore cannot know where the covert op ships arein practice1 ships fleet up2 covert ops ships engage the module and are prompted for the password the module stays active until the ship is exited or docks3 the module connects to the server to register4 when there is more than one ship connected with the same password the location of the other ships using an active module is communicated and the overview shows the location possibly with the cloakbreaking distance indicateda bubble around the ship5 as the ships move the client updates the location and sends it to the server6 the server receives the locations and broadcasts it to the fleet only those with a module will be able to decode it and render the locationbonus different squads could use different passwords to only show the people in their squad fleet commanders could have a new warfare link that would allow them to store a number of passwords up to their level allowing them to track that many different sets of covert op shipsthe best part of all this is that most of the work is not done by the server i envision it as a tagged packet that doesnt need to even be processed by the server other than to send it out to the members in the fleet each client would decode it on their own a quick process and the locations added to the rendering engine
putting a cloak on your ship is already pretty powerful i doubt it needs a buff that muchit would need a downside such as making the ships probable after all to communicate with other ships in the fleet it must be sending some sort of signal which could be detected by other ships this way you get a situation where you can now organise a large gang of cloakers and allow them to see each other while also making it possible for others to come hunt you down
very good to hear ill help promote this channel in my own public channel and blog but i do hope to see some pretty steady csm presence there otherwise its kinda pointless
of the ten csms this term ive seen at least occasional attendance from six of them over the last several months its not 237 but theres a fair bit of presence there
can we get this stickiedthanx
i support this quoted idea and want too add that its maybe a good idea to remove black ops from the directional scanner
ill start with a declaration of interest and say that despite the offensive  defensive benefits of a persistent local like the op im an ardent supporter of making nullsec local behave in precisely the same way as wh local that being said i dont support this it doesnt address the concerns of the carebear ie omg you cant make us watch the scanner whilst we afk rat  mine its unreasonable and it doesnt really help the roaming gang to pick up targets it ends up as the worst of all options the point about assets being attacked without you knowing that theres a fleet present seems on the surface to be valid but is in fact not intel on fleets moving through a system comes from the people that live in those systems if theyre seeing fleets moving through alliance space and not lighting up the intel channels then ceos need to remind themselves of where the kick button is thatll stop that kind of behaviour forcing ratters to have scouts would not only protect them but itd mean that not even a cloaked fleet could get into your space without detection a conventional fleet shouldnt even need scouts where i do see an issue is with local reporting  states and suchlike are very poorly updated in the local window  usually it requires the window to be repainted by minimising or moving to a different tab  which means that local would have to poll the server at a fixed fast interval in order to allow for decloak  recloak effects to be detected im sure messaging would get around it but my concern is that it opens a door for unnecessary lagto jump on the new meme ccp need to htfu and remind all the complaining carebears that nullsec is supposed to be a dangerous and scary place where monsters could be lurking
honestly i think the easiest solution for those that dont want to be listed in local would be the introduction of a secure comms module it could be a mid slot or even a rig but there has to be a costvalue balance to itas far as the argument over no one showing in local in wspace its fairly obvious if youre familiar with the eve backstory all fluid router communication in known space is monitored and regulated by concord wormholes being outside this range of influence and not included in the concord reporting protocols
and if i am on a cov ops mission and i know the space is controlled my enemy that will blow me to shreds at the first opportunity and i am cloaked and hiding why the hell would i broadcast my it and especially my flight information to anyone
items i would like to propose1 ok do we really need to show npc corps in our employment listing i dont see the point to be honest when you have played for a while and of course moved around in corps it does make a list quite long do corps really want to know if you have been ina npc corp me personally no and also on another notr it would cut down server load if you remove bringing in all the npc corp listings too i bet considerably2 either have the ability to clear your employment after a set time or have a reduced list of say 1 year its like your real life cv people are not really intersted what you did like 3 years ago its pretty much your last few roles now obviously eve doesnt expand to the number of years your real live career does so the 1 year sort of apportions it correctly and to be honest people worrying about spies well i dont think someone who was in a rival alliancecorp 2 years ago is a real threat to be realisticagain this would help out on server load considerablyta
nopoint 1 the blanks in your employment history would be just as telling as having the npc corps listed anyway so this would be a pointless changepoint 2 if you were a spy at one point id really love to be able to see that regardless of how far back it wentit sounds to me like someone has something theyre trying to hide
hide something absolutley notjust think theres is absolutley no value showing npc corps no one when looking at history is interested in someones npc corpsok your first point you wouldnt show blanks lol how silly would it look with blanks in the listing lolall you would show are real corps  simple if then statement would suffice easy fix  and of course it would have another impact on server load quite considerably so im afraid i cant back your first argumenton your second item well if there were spies 90 of the time you wouldnt even know it unless they were dumb thats what a spie does keeps concealed loland then when enough intel is found its just like a normal personal leaving a corp without anyone knowing anythingso again understand what your saying not not really valid for a no  again showing less unnecessary history better impact on server loadi mean ok if you want to make it a something to hide issue then ccp can create a api call for you to see the full employment history out of game if you so wished tohappythat way less load on server less cluttered historyand available out of game if really neededeveryones a winner
there is no point not to show them anymore than there is no point to show the rather not waste ccp time on something that really doesnt matter
my first point probably wasnt clear  the blanks would be gaps in your employment record  for exampledec012008  dec152008 some player corp adec292008  feb32009 some player corp bthe blank i refer to is that 14 day gap between entry 1 and entry 2as far as being able to see if you were in an enemy alliance or corp  heck yes i want this even if it was five years ago because its going to drmatically effect how i handle the interview and recruitment process putting it on the api is fine but this is information i want before i even talk to you  to decide if its worth my time to even consider your applicationand you may indeed not have anything to hide but calling this a server load issue is nonsense the server load for these calls is going to be miniscule compared to say calls for loading the market window and given the optimization i would expect ccp to have put in place around their database given that games with lag are usually dead im anticipating that your suggestion would have an effect small enough you wouldnt notice itif youre worried about your history being cluttered up  quit corp hopping thats a lame reason to request a code change thats like the thread a month or so ago to be able to redistribute skill points so the skill listing would be less ugly make smarter choices
1 this is pointless and serves only to make the history harder to read id rather be able to see that someone left the game for a year and got booted to an npc corp instead of having to count the differences in dates also you make it impossible to tell when a character joined the game which is a seriously bad thing 2 again no not even so much because of spies more so because of game history as it is now i can read an omgrawr quote from 2004 and go look up the corp histories of the people involved someone can talk about where they were during some ancient war and i can go look up what alliance they were in your proposal would remove that ability
wow have you guys all just left the same anger management class judging by the time you must of just gotin from school calm down have some sugarok it isnt just about server load theres also the client side speed up and infact it dies make alot of difference and if you have come from a enterprise development background every bit of performance improvement is important did you start screaming when ccp removed corp descriptions based on the same reason no but really that was a pointless change but was still doneand can you stop obsessing about it being something to hide  its not that at all get it out of your head also if you actually read my second post i did say that if you really wanted to see the full history you could by a simple api call but inyour moment of anger you didnt see thatand wasting ccp time huh this is an absolute simple and easy fix to do and simple code changeso im not really understanding why its a problem especially when the history would be there if you wanted itok lets also make it an option to showdilute history to stop you crying like girls
wow i thought their imput was pretty sound and didnt detect any crying whining or angerim starting to think youre a troll and this thread should be ignored
what about being able to have different font colors for different corpsso going back from the current each unique instance of a corporation is given a new colorfor example corpjumper goes back and forth between thiscorp and rookiecorp regularly and has only been in three corps originalrookiecorp thiscorp and rookiecorpwhen the color toggle isnt on all names appear in the same color i think it is white but when activated the current corp lets say thiscorp and all previous instances remain white the previous corp and all previous instances may be yellowso corpjumpers employment history could look something likethiscorp whiterookiecorp yellowthiscorp whiterookiecorp yellowthiscorp whiterookiecorp yellowthiscorp whiteoriginalrookiecorp redor better yet what about being able to color code corporations in the employment history based on your or your corporations standing to them
its just about clearing up the clutter it seems that some people like the clutter i dont thats my opinion we all have different views i personally dont want to see all the clutter unless i want toso my idea to make it optional benefits everyone i think thats reasonable but doesnt seem to be much feedback on this so not much point continuingabout the colours perhaps but that might make it worse lots of info and colour might be a bit messy
i would like to propose that if you are going to lower the drone bay on carriers would you just move that space to the ship maintenance bay
theyre not lowering the space just segregating it youll get something like current bay  5000 space for fighters and 5000 m3 for subfighter drones
chances are that we wont be getting more space at that change so the change itself will be a nerf limiting the number of subfighter drones we can have again only further limiting the freedom of eve iow the sandbox is starting to appear to be more cookie cutter all the time
your kiddign mehow the hell is removing the ability to drop 1000 t1 warrior drones when you die bad what possible advantage coiuld be gleaned from it remaining
a counter suggestion stop blobbing then you wouldnt need to count fleets of 300 enemies
an excellent op i like the whine too but needs cheese
really like the idea
hear hear
very awesome pif u can toggle it of course
i cant see ever supporting this for your primary character but it just might work for alternate characters on the same account only being able to train one character at a time basically makes the other two character slots useless for any practical game play if a system such as this were implemented for the second two slots it would be a nice benefit to the players without upsetting the overall balance of the gameprimary  normal skill timesecondary  4x skill timetertiary  10x skill timejust a thought
consider this added to my platform

all this was supported before and will be again
supported perhaps alliance or corp motd could be set in a special tab in the corp window that only ceos and directors have access to to overcome security issues mentioned earlier in this thread however it might be implemented it would be a very welcome and highly useful feature much desired
totally agreeit would be great to be able to give my guys in corp a message to see when they log in supported
all you people who reject this have probley have not even trained any of the indy skillsto lvl 1 and dont know how use full this will be and it will allow noobs a easier way to tranport there ships with out having to get someone else to do it
nerf the orcas cargohold and add on to the ore hold the orca is a mining support ship not a bargethen give us a medium freighter classprobably two tiers1st tier is a standard freighter 200km3 cargo max cant load things in space etc2nd tier would be a freighter with a 600km3 ship hangar that can only unload to a station or a ship maintenance arraywould definitely make high sec a more colorful place
im neutral on this subjecton one hand i can see a need for a small freighter that has no module or rig slots and has a cargohold of exactly 120000m3 big enough for one general freight container no extra cargoholds either just a 120km3 hold however the only real argument i can give for it to be added is that it would fill in the size increment gap and be a real step between an industrialtransport ship and a freighter if people are complaining about hulls the easiest solution would be to either make this a t2 orca or a new t1 hull from interbuson the other hand we have the orca except for the very strange decision to not allow the orca to have a 100km3 cargohold or 120km3 hold to fit a gfc it does the job perfectly and then somethe only real hauling ship thats needed is a freightersized ship that can carry unpackaged ships inside of it  and nothing else
1 bring the pirate fw stuff coming in allowing expansion of the empires or pirate sov2 sleepers discover wormholes and start to come through joves open up their space and come to save us or at least try3 pirate vs antipirate system
you got it wrong jason the jove are supposed to come and kick all of our butts incursions into empire hi sec well thats how i took it
3 if somehow ccp could add that onto the bounty system it would be god tier id be hunting pirates all day

im voting for ya
this is in the assembly hall why exactly
moved from assembly hall
okay so you want to move a good chunk of level 4 agents to lowsec this would improve things how already level 5 missions are in lowsec and those are rarely run except for the few corporations who extort the agentsyou want to reduce profitability in highsec to barely at all profitable where 70 of the playerbase remain this would improve eve and the number of subscribers howyou want bubbles to be usable in lowsec i cant say how many times this has been suggested and shot down in the course of evefrom your page i see that you did some pve stuff then went to pvp and have never looked back how would you improve pve or do you even care about that aspect of the game what about highsec wardecsgiven your answers so far i really cant justify giving you my vote as some of your ideas would harm the game greatly imho
my mother always said that if you cant say anything nice dont say anything at all but then i again i think shes a cold hearted haradin here we goalready been raised and taken to ccp do some research brosefalready raised and noted ui is getting a massive overhaul soon tmso you want cruise missile kestrels back but want bombers nerfed stealth bombers were always the ginger stepchild of the frigate class and now theyre good you want them sent back to where they came from 1 to bombs in lowsec 9001 for suggesting them not being allowed to be fired near gates the exact places where you spend 90 of your time when pvping i know youve suffered greatly at the hands of these ships recently so ill let you offif you dont want to be stuck in it then dont buy one super cap proliferation is already a huge problem and one of the things limiting it is the fact that you are unable to dock themjust like level 5s oh wait if this is your idea of a way to repopulate lowsec then you need to get something done about your myopia dawg sentry guns and the drone issue have already been raised by yours truely brosefwait you want to bring more people to lowsec yet this single act will drive more people awaygood to see you think in such clean cut rigid waystldr this appears to be a manifesto to improve pvp for you and not the masses i agree with some points but many are way off the mark let alone my opinions on your real life personality issues
at least we know who the comedy vote this year is
nice sig bro who made it
so frigates capable of command ship dps is good right then wheres my bs capable of dread dps a frigate doing volleys that high is ridiculous ya theyre paper thin but when used by good pilots that have lots of damps in gang its a little overpowered
remember when the bombers got changed to how they are now you probably werent in united back then but the guys tested them and liizas conclusion was that their damage was terrible and that stealth bombers are still useless also nice to see that the experience of this pvp candidate is mining in bobs industrial corporation and after that 99 ok maybe 95 of his kills are sitting on a gate ganking people 10 vs 1

so are you getting modern warfare 2 jogvan you guys need to play something besides tf2 and l4d that way i can pwn you in other games too
ill be getting it but you never play with us on games anyway maybe your too good for us
liiza why do you want to be larkonis so much hes really not that coolbtw i loved your question 18 minutes into the csm fanfest panel you are so single minded its unreal im sure you think getting into the csm will help you win the lark vs liiza neos vs united war going on in your head you getting onto the csm will not get lark permabanned for larkonis gate it really wont
claw stfu were talkin fps games unbalance i didnt think you guys had cod4 only jogvan did its the only decent fps out there game developers suck lately but hey at least we get battlefield 3 in 2011
im in full agreement with the idea of making this a rigcentric mechanic representing a pilots ability to tinker with his ships off the rack setup i am also in agreement with the idea that it shoud be limited to a downward movement high to med or low or med to low this offers the possibility of tweaking a few other things that people are grousing about already in the assemblyswap a high spot out of your retribution and use the ab bonus and point a target drop some high slots off a destroyer to surprise someone with some ewar i bet with an extra mid slot you could get a mean shield tanked dominix and theyre not bad to begin with the point is it gives you more options and more options are betterer even if some are silly those are the ones that make for the best killmails
the easiest way to do this is to make highmidlow slot modules that give you an additional slot of the particular type you want in this way it removes the existing slot by filling it while providing the additional slot somewhere elseim not saying this is the best way just the easiestwhile i like the idea i think that the skill requirements should be very hefty and there would need to be some pretty major restrictions with fitting or some pretty hefty drawbacks for using such a modulerigexamples of how id try to useexploit the system move the megathronss 8th high to a midlow presto instant cheap vindinavy mega dominix move highs to midslows no explanation needed raven move empty highs to mids extra lows to mids scorp move extra highs to midslows for more ew and a decent armor tank i could do this all dayyou really open up a can of worms with this everything that makes a particular ship special with its slot layout gets erased with this concept would it be pretty fun maybe at first but everybody gets to do the same thing eventually so whats the fun in that geddon with its 8th high to a mid typhoon with 8 lows redeemer with five mids
ill agree that drones are undersupported and id be all for a wider selection of dronebuffing modules ive supported proposals to that effect in the past but as much as more drone modules are needed more tractor beams simply are not im not going to support a generic more stuff thread when half the stuff in question would be silly andor useless even if the other half might be good

1 i dont think you can ever stop making small gang pvp more fun fixing station docking ranges neutral rr empire especially making sure the af 4th bonus is spot on balancing ecm and sensor damps and giving small gangs a legitimate roll in attacking 00 infrastructure are what i think should be prioritized i dont think these changes will swing things away from large fleets which will still maintain their role and in fact will benifit from some changes like docking range and ecmdamp reform but rather make small gangs more fun and in 00 more significant2 id like to see adjustments to the duration depending on where ccp wants to go if they want bring all ecm into line and have the ship to ship version just break lock like the ecm drone and burst ecm then the duration should be shortened to 5 seconds with the cap use cut by 75 to match if they are wedded to the cant lock mechanic the duration cut from 20 seconds to 10 this will be very beneficial for the following reasons 1 overheating ecms will damage faster 2 the increased number of attempts will lessen the effect of non eccmd ships being completely and totally crippled doubletripple eccmd ships from being completely invulnerable 3 it will increase the role of player skill in ecm management due to more frequent opportunity and need to move jams around and 4 stealth nerf to cap ships online particularly carriers in small scale fights since the increased number of attemptssuccesses coupled with their tragic lock time will make sub cap gangs supported by ewar more competitive against them3 i think ships aside from cov ops bombers force recons blockade runners and black ops ie things that can use black ops jump bridge should have their cap regeneration suspened while cloaking and that said cloaks should have a small cap use when active 1 per second maybe total effect of this should be yeah cloaking an inty is a very viable tactic but not an indefinite one you want to lock down a system afk or be otherwise unfindable use the stealth ships that were designed for it or deal with the occasional need to decloak and recharge yes im aware such a change would bite noir in the ass im fine with that cause itd be good for the game4 empire pvp 00 pvp 00 infrastructure development removing ceilingsfloors in the market corporationalliance management and the merc market id like to say wh since im a big fan but aside from increasing the things players can build in them infrastructure opportunities but not sov i cant think of anything thats wrong with them5 remote effects need to generate an aggro timer as it applied to being able to jump dock and be probed out i read lanas point and i think its a fair change that remote repairing a 5 shouldnt give you gcc unless they have one too when you rep them6 i think the interface could be more intuitive and easy to navigate but otherwise im fine with it for some reason mine wont save distinct tabs changing one changes them all but i think thats just me7 c

yes i am an idiot no more posting when i should be sleeping
tjv is fully backing your candidacy to csm as a big supporter of small gang warfare i couldnt think any better candidate for the jobrecently i saw a good post about how killrights should be transferrable from one player to another that would allow carebears to pass suicide gankers and pirates killrights to mercenaries to take care of them against a bounty would allow lots more 1vs1 in highsec and keep gankers on their toes cant find the post now but i think the idea is great and you should think about including it into your agendaackwellcommanding officertiera javelin ltd
a aggro timers for docking into stations need to be much longer id almost want it based on ship size so then you might have a chance to kill both frigates and carriers that decide to undock and shoot youb neutral remote reppingboosting should give the same aggro timers as hostile actions c locator agents should offer some incredibly expensive option of giving you like 30 minutes of live tracking on a target one thing hindering small group pvp is your ability to even find out where your target is so with this option you pay many millions of isk for the ability to know right when your target docksundocksjumps and to where there could also be an agent you pay for a set time period of immunity to locator agents d revoke insurance payments on ships if concord is involved or reduce them to minimum paymentse a separate enemys list that notifies me about loginslogouts in a different way than the buddies list
i agree with all but c it takes practice and a bit of luck but the good merc corps make their living with the current system just fine i remember wewhen i was in noir chased a cruiser over 40 jumps in a circle not once actually seeing him and wound up catching him 1 jump out from the original location live tracking is nothing but handholding for those that are to lazy to work a little harder in my opinion even if you do not know the location of an entire corp but you get 13 active members names and run those youll end up in a hornets nest if you explore the surrounding area unless it is highsec corporation with 100members only 3 losses and0 kills in its existence that i cant find anywhere but yes to abde p or at least fix the current address book so it updates properly 
i fully support fixing the address booki am against dother than that good show
i think when you say work a little harder you mean use alt scoutsextra pilots we can bring more pilots and alt scouts to try to find someone but why not just introduce a tweak to an existing mechanic that would let one person track down and fight another person
i do not have any alt scouts and in a 2manor 3 corp and i manage just fine finding the targets generally and the ones i cant i havnt even seen online you can use that single agent every 1030minutes and there are usually multiple ones in the same area space them out by 5 minutes and you have a pretty decent idea of what the target is doing and where if you do not know the area or the likely routes then learn them the system is fine
because high sec needs to be safer amiriteedit i suck at quoting
in before this gets moved to features and idea im voting alek because of his reputation and the reputation of his corp his integrity and morals are highlighted by his corps standing on neutral rr because they believe its wrong they dont use those tactics themselves even though it places them at a disadvantage theres no reason why they cant its game mechanics atm but they keep to their values 3also as backup he has a jimer with a rant script loaded
despite having only talked to you once or twice i think that this is a vote wellspendgood luck sir
transferable kill rights might make them more interesting if you also scrapped the bounty system and merged the two ideas may give incentive for anti pirates to actually go into lowsec and give pvp besides their moralrp imperative as well as a bounty hunter mini profession honestly though i think the priority is low id like to see in game tools that support merc services generally and if they were put up i could this kill right market being a facet of that down the linein response to zhanga dont think theres anything wrong with a flat timer it just needs to be longer than it is now b exactly what i wantc locators are fine asis if someone asked me if they had to be changed what would i change about them id make them a little cheaper and id scatter a few more around the gamed reduction to minimum payout is what i have in mind e better than this just make the buddy list more folder friendly currently its a nightmare to create add to and manage folders i tried making an enemies folder once lasted about a day before i deleted it im not making this an issue though because its my understand that such things will be taken into consideration in the upcoming cosmos web 20 thingthanks for the support la vista
strongly agreei happen to like that question mister
thanks for putting this together for the good of the eve community dierdra the fact that youve already served your two terms shows how much you care for the game and not for the trip to iceland et al kudos
this sounds very interesting cant wait to see it in action here are some proposed statements obviously biased toward my play stylethe 15minute gcc for outlaw actions is too longboosts to low sec should conform to the intended personality of that space eg profit opportunities should come primarily from black market and organized crime rather than industrial activitiesnew players should be given a limited opportunity to experience pvp with each other as part of the tutorialunnecessarily cumbersome game mechanics related to contracts the market and scienceindustry should be streamlined or eliminatedpirating as a profession needs some love from ccpbounty hunting as a profession needs some love from ccp
this is a very good idea gives the csm election a chance to also be about policy not just politics or personsone question who gets to formulate the statements since you are not rerunning for the csm but has some inside experience i trust in your abilities to do this  but perhabs make a thread for others to post suggestions for statements
i dont have any statements atm but i can think of an addition to thisid like to see candidates say how much experience they have in the various things in eve pvp roleplay mining etci would not vote for a candidate who lacks experience in a field i think needs improvement
this wont happen because there is nothing we can do to prevent a candidate from marking himself as being an expert in all areas even if this is not the case to quote a certain fictional doctor everybody lies the website displays the links to the candidate webpages on step 3 and step 4 as well as the candidates description taken from the official eve online candidate page step 4 this provides extra information on each characterit is the goal of this guide to help people figure out what candidates match their own vision the best we cannot actually assess the quality of a candidate  this is still up to the individualif you read post 1 youll see if you have any suggestions for statements do not hesitate to post them in this thread any other feedback is also appreciated i will also be contacting current and former csm members and post statement seeking topics on the special interest forums mining crime and punishment etc this will be done once i move the website to the new host
based on feedback ive made the following changes candidate maintenance page now remembers a candidates previous choices display candidate avatar on step 3 and step 4 display candidate real name corp and alliance on step 4also the website should receive a visual overhaul soontm
well done i was just considering doing something along these lines i have a few suggestions about the site itselfhave candidate profile pages which show their answers without requiring the user to answer the questions themselves the links on steps three and four are 404ing right now and theyre buried behind a form which i dont think google will fill outask for a link to a public skillsheet site like chribbas eveboardask for the date of birth of the candidates character to see how long they have been playingsome of the questions i came up with dont fit well with the agreedisagree pattern but they could perhaps be adaptedin what space do you spend most of your timehighseclowsec00wspacehow do you make most of your moneytradingbuildingminingmissioningpiratingexplorationrattingotherim having trouble coming up with specific statements to suggest but something along the lines of what areas of the game need love including perhaps some of the above but also the api and poss

im voting for ya
this is in the assembly hall why exactly
moved from assembly hall
okay so you want to move a good chunk of level 4 agents to lowsec this would improve things how already level 5 missions are in lowsec and those are rarely run except for the few corporations who extort the agentsyou want to reduce profitability in highsec to barely at all profitable where 70 of the playerbase remain this would improve eve and the number of subscribers howyou want bubbles to be usable in lowsec i cant say how many times this has been suggested and shot down in the course of evefrom your page i see that you did some pve stuff then went to pvp and have never looked back how would you improve pve or do you even care about that aspect of the game what about highsec wardecsgiven your answers so far i really cant justify giving you my vote as some of your ideas would harm the game greatly imho
my mother always said that if you cant say anything nice dont say anything at all but then i again i think shes a cold hearted haradin here we goalready been raised and taken to ccp do some research brosefalready raised and noted ui is getting a massive overhaul soon tmso you want cruise missile kestrels back but want bombers nerfed stealth bombers were always the ginger stepchild of the frigate class and now theyre good you want them sent back to where they came from 1 to bombs in lowsec 9001 for suggesting them not being allowed to be fired near gates the exact places where you spend 90 of your time when pvping i know youve suffered greatly at the hands of these ships recently so ill let you offif you dont want to be stuck in it then dont buy one super cap proliferation is already a huge problem and one of the things limiting it is the fact that you are unable to dock themjust like level 5s oh wait if this is your idea of a way to repopulate lowsec then you need to get something done about your myopia dawg sentry guns and the drone issue have already been raised by yours truely brosefwait you want to bring more people to lowsec yet this single act will drive more people awaygood to see you think in such clean cut rigid waystldr this appears to be a manifesto to improve pvp for you and not the masses i agree with some points but many are way off the mark let alone my opinions on your real life personality issues
at least we know who the comedy vote this year is
nice sig bro who made it
so frigates capable of command ship dps is good right then wheres my bs capable of dread dps a frigate doing volleys that high is ridiculous ya theyre paper thin but when used by good pilots that have lots of damps in gang its a little overpowered
remember when the bombers got changed to how they are now you probably werent in united back then but the guys tested them and liizas conclusion was that their damage was terrible and that stealth bombers are still useless also nice to see that the experience of this pvp candidate is mining in bobs industrial corporation and after that 99 ok maybe 95 of his kills are sitting on a gate ganking people 10 vs 1

liiza why do you want to be larkonis so much hes really not that coolbtw i loved your question 18 minutes into the csm fanfest panel you are so single minded its unreal im sure you think getting into the csm will help you win the lark vs liiza neos vs united war going on in your head you getting onto the csm will not get lark permabanned for larkonis gate it really wont

greetings renegades rogues pirates scammers trolls and dullards i am larkonis trassler and i want to run for csm 4 i am a pirate by trade but in my time in eve i have mined missioned fought in hisec wars killed pirates died horribly in bubble camps flown capitals lost capitals and fought and fced numerous goodfightswait arent you that  who resigned from the last csm due to less than honourable actionsyes yes i am i made a tremendous error of judgement which was a result of a slightly hilarious chain of events i let down those of you who voted for me and ccp regardless its water under the bridge which is where all you trolls should stay toohave you no shamenot really im hoping to be re elected to the csm in a peter mandelsonesque return to glory albeit without a portuguese manboy at my side and the penchant for buggeryso what did you get done last time aroundi championed many issues and brought forward a few of my own among themboosting web strength on minmatar recons and easfixing logoffskia few tweaks to gcc mechanics and sentriespirate faction ship improvementsto name but a fewhowever as a csm virgin one felt slightly overwhelmed by it all and not really sure of our role yes there is plenty of documentation out there but just like the art of love my first time round was akin to a few hesitant gropes followed by a few half hearted thrusts and a trail of bodily fluids stretching from a hip to an inner thigh there is much more to do and so much more to achievethe csm is in its infancy people are expecting the world from this body of internet spaceships politicians thats simply not going to happen for the moment delegates are not devs theyre players pure and simple there in some part to bridge the gap between ccp and the playerbaseso what are you standing for this time arounda greater passage of information between ccp and the csm and the csm and the playerbase its been pretty woeful this term with the monthly qas becoming more like annual qas i took some time out from trolling the forums and put in some time reading them and contributing to assorted discussions however i often didnt take the time to respond to evemails and convos this time around ill make more time to do soas far as game changes goewar ecm is still overpowered more in terms of the mechanic not the strength or range of the modules and other ewar needs shaking up badly damps were overnerfed and target painters are underused and undervaluedlowsec despite discussions conducted by csm 3 lowsec is and will continue to be the ginger stepchild of the universe for some time i want to further push for changes to lowsec and how it operatesfaction warfare fw needs a distinct shake up increased lp rewards are great but theres so much room for improvement occupancy still means nothing and there is no benefit to being victorious beyond personal gain im all for introducing economic knock on effects for empires who perform well and those that perform badly small gang pvp at the moment there is nothing to incentivise this at all with the majority of isk on a vessel being tied up in the hull and rigs even maintaining say a 101 kd ratio the average pvper is going to struggle to make a profit a rebalance to the system so that more isk is tied up in the mods and less in the hull would benefit everyone id also like to see revisions to loot drops whereby mods have a higher  chance to drop if there are less opponents on the kmhisec wardecs are easily avoided and under certain mechanics alliances are able to become all but immune to the effects of them while wardecs should not become a griefing tool i would like to see changes to the system to make it harder to avoid a fight if someone comes and picks one with you id also like to see a reversal of the alliance p nerf
ill reiterate that the csm are not devs they can merely suggest changes if they have popular backing ill also say that im willing to support anyones issue if they approach me directly and i agree with it even if its not part of my platformhold on you can suggest all this stuff on the assembly hall what can you offer the csmcontinuity with i believe only two other previous members running again this term i believe i can share my knowledge of the system and how it works with the csm newbies much like an experienced older partnersolid no nonsense approaches i dont mince my words if i dont like you ill say so if i think youre talking out of your backside then ill bung a cork in iton a personal side id perhaps like the chance to redeem myself a littlei hope to further develop what has already been a cracking and productive 18 months and be part of the process which helps evolve the csm concept
youve got my vote all 3 of them i for one think you were framed by vicious carebears
oh well if johnny is in im in
will vote again
apart from the faction ships did anything else change
confirming that youll get at least 1 vote from me
you have my votes good luck to your campaign
the iceland summit was only six weeks ago broski just because you are not getting instant gratification doesnt mean you wont get it at some point think of the csm as more of a tantric experience do not judge it by your western standardsill reiterate for those of you that are unaware of how this worksissue raised in assembly hallissue championed by a csm delegateissue debated in a csm only online meating and voted on if voted no then qqif yesissue goes to iceland summit or a csmccp online meetingccp say either 1 thats cool we were working on it lets see if we can prioritise it a bit more see it in 312 months2 thats cool we never thought of that well add it to the backlog see it in 618 months3 thats not really what we have in mind for the game4 not technically possible right now but we like the idea and maybe look into it a little5 not technically possible at all6 grand slam your idea isnt at all technically feasable and its completely awful who elected you and what are you doing here go and mix up a cocktail of whiskey and sleeping pills for yourselfobviously theres room for a little debate with reference to points 3 and 4 and we were able to sway them on more than one or two issues in iceland
ill be voting for you again
people who make such a mistake knowing theyre putting their candidacy on the line for something silly are not worth to be voted for all the but its the piraty thing to do bullcrap is just that bullcrapthe csm is already a joke but if at all possible id to have some people there who think about what theyre doing
i endorse this product andor service
1 post with your main2 anybody who votes for you is an idiotyou took advantage of multiple systems during your csm i dont think you can be trusted to do anything honorable even though i generally agree with some of your viewpoints i dont think you can deliver anything else except total fail i wouldnt be surprised if ccp actually denied you to even be a part of the csm
and my axe
took advantage of multiple systems unless you call the young boys in his corp systems then im not sure what youre talking aboutwill be getting my votes again official lark csm4 sig add it to your sigs for monster support
i voted for you last time and you embarrassed yourself and the pirate community so no
plan on breaking more ndas made my ccp which i might add is real life contracts sheesh you lost my respect for your actions trust ingame is one thing but you broke ccps trust on you outofgame which is a far worse offense than any piracy or scam youve ever done those who vote for youwellwow just wow people tbh hope they reject you out of hand when your application gets put up isaac
you have my sword and my vote toodont balls it up again like last time btw are you running on trassler or trassiermoderatedapplebabe
im sorry but are you accusing lark of behaving like a politician
confirming 50 under and i are systems he will be getting my votes
you know who my main isi would like to know the multiple systems i took advantage of i seem to recall only acting on one piece of information and being caught soon after if anything you could say especially in these days of politicians and expense scandals i was the most cost effective member of csm 3 as i got all my main issues discussed in person at the iceland summit but ccp didnt have to spend money on a flight to fanfest or accomodation for me savings that they can pass on to you the playerdiscussion of moderation removed zymurgist
and what thats ok for ppl to behave like that isaac
well it is how we run the entire western world and if you dont like it young man i suggest you move to communist north korea
ah i see so you are evading a forum ban by posting with an altalternate account wow thats honor right there the second system im referring to is where you entered into the tournament solely to resell the slot and not fight in it yourself it was a cheesy thing to do and isnt the kind of behavior id want in a csm candidate and i dont see how they are passing savings on to me because last i checked my monthly subscription fee was the same amount of money its always been
you made broad generalizations on the 3 biggest issues in lowsec how about you provide details on fixes instead of stating the obvious
i see you got a new campaign sig banner
wow your one sad person
you got my votes gief moar isk value on modules and more drops from small gang encounters
sir i am a patriot and if you love jesus youll vote for larkonis trassler
lulz
but that 1500 gets spent on something other than a plane ticket and hotel roomwhat i dont understand is why people get chastised for playing the game in a way it was meant to be played do you see ccp complaining about him scamming his tourny slot if the devs accept it as fair play who are you to say its foulunderhandedimmoralwrong if its a part of the gameedit wtf i seriously missed the snype for this guess i fail worse than voogru
unlike a certain other cpcentric candidate who shall remain nameless youre actually amusing and likable and clearly you have given some thought to improving the game in beneficial wayshowever not even waiting for a decent period of time after you were kicked sends the wrong message and is too blatant a power grab if the csm is to evolve into something valid and useful your behavior cannot be rewarded i assume the only reason ccp didnt give you a life ban from the csm is because it didnt occur to them for this term ccp would be completely correct to block your candidacyyou will not be getting my vote hold off running again for a year or so and next time display at least the pretense of contrition
you have my votes primarily cause i think ccp needs a kick in the balls regarding lowsecas for the other stuff meh just try not to get caught next time ya noob
you sir might know something about eve judging from the quoted statement eve is exactly where your horizon endslarkonis itll be interesting to see what kind of scam you plan to pull off this time well by now you might even think to know how to bypass ccps security mechanisms maybe you should get my vote again just to see you fail again
op is tldrbut you have my vote ofc in fact i think you might have all of them you were far more entertaining than some of the boring holes that got my votes last time tbh
oh boy you do realise that the sale of my tournament slot was not only allowed by ccp but thouroughly endorsed you also realise that i robbed blind the person who purchased it the pilots flying under my alliance flag in the tournament were my corpmates through and through if you think that slots hadnt been sold in the past then youd be wrong just because i operated in the open instead of in a clandestine manner doesnt make it any betterworse as for alt posting well if im paying for two accounts i should have the priviledge of being able to post from two accounts amirite hardly evasion broski
this is a srs topic so i will make a srs postyou say you want to improve ccpcsmplayerbase communication  can you expand on how you think this can be done
ill venture a guess that ccp isnt that dimwitted and that there might be more to the story than weve been told i dont care and im satisfied with the way it was handled water over the bridge moving onlark i like you and believe your game experience play style and viewpoint are worth having on csm two things you mentioncsm continuity and improved communications with playersare important to me plus you have experience where it counts too bad ive promised my votes to that other pirate buddy of mine is it too much to dream of having two savvy low sec pirates on csm at the same time imagine the synergies to be had in championing low sec changes that make sense i guess the universe is telling me i need more accounts
a lot of people say theyre on our side in the csmbut only larkonis has acted accordingly he ran on the platform that cp stands forand apart from the getting caught part n00b i dare say he proved hes the genuine article
now a srs post from meill be voting for lark for several reasons1 i seriously doubt hed pull that stunt again2 at least i know where he stands how do i know the next guy wont do the same thing3 this is game i mean really hell be representin my internet spaceship id prefer somebody who can laugh about themso will the campaign colors be rainbow if so i think we should hold some parades
whati sorry but no gentelship no truth no brosef  and most important no hounourourourouryou have my 2 votes and whoever else i can persuade to vote for you
you have my vote larkwell my 3 votes
got my votes just dont get caught next time 
youre getting my votes again however i only give second chances dont mess up again

dust 514 will never come to pc get that thru your stupid thick skulls people pc fps and console fps are two different crowds and ccp said one million ing times that they wanted to make a console fpsso stop the tears and accept it either buy a console or stfu alreadythis thread is really starting to get pretty patheticlet it go people let it go
first page again voice your support people 
would be a nice change i agree 1 for mynxee
hell yes
that slider es me off

sounds like prom night at your house mynx what with all the yeses flying around s u p p o r t e d
when logging in i dont feel like im about to play a gameim entering the cold realm of space the harsh environment that is new edentherefor i like to see the entry message changed intoentering new eden asentering space asentering  aspost your choices here and lets hope it will be noticed by the csm and ccp
im not sure if all the proposed changes values are perfect but its the best ive seen here supported balancing and some tweaking needed ofc but its the concept that matters have nos properly replace augment cap boosters 3 the burst tank concept
youd think so maybe requires two conditions be evaluated rather than one no idea what the code is evaluating though the whole sec status thing is messed up anyways

camo looks cool on some ships on many gallente ship it just looks somewhat wired maybe making it more contrast or adjusting it a bit would help black does look cool i am not going to ultimately state that black is the only colous that fits but camo need a little adjustment
giving my support to this thread because camo in space  black black and silver or any other cool paintjob will dogallente are supposed to be stylish camo on spaceships is not stylish its foolish
yesssss yes yes yes yes yes yes yescan we get the deimos in on this as well that poor ship doesnt look much better
yes revert to a color scheme either blackwhitebluelit or roden shipyards blackredorangelit
yes
get a diferent colour black is khanid
1 against salad issue mega
supported it looks horrific
agree forest camuflage in space is just wrong
i firmly support a gaaa llente navy colour overhaul of pink flesh tone with light bluepurple candy cane racing stripes
the camo has to go
let this thread die already3m sp until the bonus wears off is far overpowered imo it should still be like in empyrean age since this is when i joined im going to assume this is when it first happened where you choose a career and specialization and get roughly 900k from the beginning
dont sit in station for 6 months quit for a year or so ccp is slowly moving towards what youre hoping for if you come back in a year youll be able to join up on what is becoming the fps version of what this game used to be ccp cant just jump to the level you want as theyll lose a large number of vets they have to gradually phase in the changes that are homogenizing and dumbing down this game in order to keep those of us who have been playing for a few years they do want people like you because youre where the money is but at the same time they want to keep us around long enough to make leaving too painful for us its the natural way all the good games eventually go dont worry despite all the negative feedback your post is exactly what ccp wants to see the more people like you suggesting the ridiculous the easier it is for them to pass their more gradual changes toward blandness the longer they suck the cash out of us vets
they need to go back to how it was before apocrypha and have players choose professions and be given skills in that area but at the same time they need to be told they are not locked into a certain path i also would like to see the return of spending attribute points on player creation so you can make your char unique i think everyone starts with the same basic setup now regardless of bloodline or raceinstead of making it easier they need to give the new player more information so they can make informed decisions on what to train on the point of it taking too long to get started part of that is the absurd cost of some of the skillbooks like all the advanced learning books which are 45 mill apiece what new player will have that starting out unless they are given it however i do not support the changes in dominion on making the exploration related skills easier to get training skills should always really mean something
sounds like a good suggestion
this
im saju somtaaw and i approve this message
great idea
a system that makes it appear like something is there that isnt essentially a system that gets your ship suicided however at the expense of the suiceder
you mean like a ship bpc 3
no im also against a system that allows people to change the items they have to something other unless concord gets nerfed from its current state concord is only the way it is to balance suicide ganks so a system that unbalances things again should be countered with a concord nerf didnt think about that they always cause a lot of exitement before the inevitable disappointment
not supported dont fly on ap if your cargo is of any value
i dont like the show something that isnt there idea but a kind of module that scrambles attempts to scan cargo makes sense the scanner would know you were jamming them and theyd have to decide if it was worth the risk to attack without knowing for sure what is being hauled
balancing suicide ganking shouldnt even be part of an issue suicide ganking is grief tactics plain and simple while also very enjoyable the heart break a suicide ganker feels when they loot the freighter wreck only to discover out of the 20 billion isk value only 100 million dropped is palpable and harsh concidering he spent 4 damn hours sitting in a system bsing on vent getting bored as hell godfuuuuuuuuuuudfsjlahlkdshfsj ahem pardon me but yeah i agree a modual that lies about what is in the cargo hold isnt all that great but maybe a counter measure that gives back either a partial return or no return this would make haulers have to decide between buffer or ewar assuming midslot but it would have to be an activatable module so afk haulers maintain their spot on the bottom of the food chaini think i am rambling
1st they should create 4 new types of isotopes these only exist in 00 in their respective pirate race so like serps for gallentethey then come out with pirate capships who use these isotopes to go aroundthese capships will be designed around the racial ewarrecon system so the bloodsansha carrier would have capital sized neutsnos guristaecmremoteecm serpsdampsextremerangepoint angelswebsnano
angel nanocarrier is easily the best suggestion i have ever seenthis concludes my participation in opposite day
i have visions of a carrier speed tanking a battleship fleet going 15000 ms this is something i want to see if only so i can call it the g4yest thing i have ever witnessed
this is a good idea  everything in this game has a counter except ship scanners  it seems imbalanced to me to have a module that has no counter  i also find it quite ridiculous that people say that if someone autopilots that they deserve to get blown up  yes autopiloting may not be wise and if you want to keep your stuff it would be a good idea to not do that  but people need to take responsibility for their actions  just because someone does something stupid or unwise does not give you a right to victimize them  that is like saying that a woman who walks down the street in tight clothes deserves to be d  if you want to spend you game time being a vicitimizer than do that just dont try to paint the victim as the bad guy when it is clear you who are choosing to act poorly 
in hisec it should be considered agressiononly police and customs should be able to perfom these acts in empire hisec anyone else is doing it for nefarious purposes at best excluding war targets or course
pretty much this
looking at someone is not an aggressive act there are numerous ways to prevent suicide ganking like carrying fuel in portions 2 jumps away from the market hub fitting tank on your ship fitting warp core stabs helps just do not carry more then 100 mills worth of isk in a hauler near a market hub
thats not a very strong argument i have my cargo scanned regularly during alignment cargofit orcas and freighters with no option to be nanod offer ample opportunity to be scanned im not using autopilothowever aggroing the scanner to the scanee wouldnt be a terribly useful change freighters cannot under any circumstance respond to being scanned they have no slots engaging somebody scanning you in an industrialtransportblockade runnerorca  well im sure there are people who would do it but thats just stupid nobody in their right mind would do it while hauling stuff cargo scanning doesnt exactly have a huge skill requirement i get scanned by npc corp alts regularly i assume there are mains waiting at the next gate to do the actual ganking being flagged to the guy with the cargo scanner in your freighter will not allow you to even destroy the guy scanning you nevermind the people who are about to gank you when you drop out of warp at the next gate by the time you can react youve probably been scanned anywayto discourage it in any meaningful way you would probably need a sec status hit to be associated with scanning but that is a disproportionate responsei think everything is fine as it stands today if youre worried about getting ganked at the next gate dock up and wait a whilelolspelling edit
why not have one just for them the same way we have a rookie help channel
how do you propose we find answers to their problems  or make experienced players answer their questions  ect

according to the fanfest presentations this is already going to happen
the one billion isk for a complete reset of standings would work well i could see that as paying one of the pirate agents to hack the concord database and reset the standings of the person obviously the agent would not want to do it that often for fear of being caught in the hack so the once per sixmonth period would make sensei also like the idea of smuggling items to reset faction standings it would give people a reason to buy stuff from the faction stores or market then remove them from play to increase standings obviously the standings boost would have to make it worth the cost of the lp but not insanely higheither way something does need to be done i support this thread
no i kind of like the way that we cant see each other but even apart from that there are some points to considerthe first is that although the ship model is removed from the universe the player is not he still has a position on whichever grid hes on for the purposes of aoe damage and decloak calculations the question then becomes what you mean by seeing surely a better compromise would be to see the brackets on your overview  in space but keep the models removed from the universe less overhead and more in keeping with being cloakedthe problem i have with this being a module is the principle of active module activation across a jump all modules deactivate on jumping and i dont know how easy it would be for ccp to code a whole new behaviourultimately though this is not the issue they need to fix as i said i like not being able to see the rest of the fleet  it adds to the immersion we all know however that the underlying issue is decloaks as things stand atm its clearly broken its a potentially harder problem to fix but im certainly of the opinion that they need to exclude cloaked ships and only cloaked ships  regardless of fleet membership  so the neutral hound i accidentally decloaked yesterday in my cloaked falcon wouldnt have been decloaked from decloaking other cloaked ships this would allow fleets to warp together whilst cloaked and give good power to spies too  one person uncloaking whilst in warp would cascade uncloak the entire fleet pushing for halfway solutions i dont think helps gets us to the behaviour wed like to see
cool idea ill hang out
not supported because i like to troll
its good to be able to chat with the ones that are representing player bases opinion to ccp
just put local into delayed mode problem solved
weve all experienced desyncs before they are nothing unheard of especially if you have wireless you might see desyncs such as shooting at something that isnt there or losing a ship because of incorrect capacitor or shield readouts things of that natureas of now the only time the client gets a full refresh is during a session change because of unstable network conditions differently configured machines or simple protocol errors i dont believe this to be adequate id like to propose the client be refreshed every 30 seconds to improve client  server synchronization it would certainly reduce the reimbursement petitions which is always a good thingi really dont see why this shouldnt be donefake edit dammit are the forums being a  again i shouldnt have to login 3 times to make a post
and it would certainly increase latency and resource usage on both the server and the client which is obviously a very very bad thing there are better ways to resolve desyncing than forcing a full resync on a predetermined intervaluntil they find said better ways how about you stop playing the game on a crappy connection that causes desyncs thats not ccps fault
yeah my dedicated nonwireless 8mbs connection has been giving me hell lately like not being able to have insanely low response times to a server located halfway across the globe its also causing my cpu to run at a different clock frequency than the server blades yes ill change my crappy connection to direct ethernet to tq right away
noemployment history is just thatnpc just indicates gaps of non player corpsremoving them would make it harder to discernnonissue
if you dont like clutter youre playing the wrong game my friend
i would like to propose an idea to make mining a little safer for the actual miners mined materiali just witnessed my first can tip as players call it and find it very frustrating cause you dont get kill rights against someone who steals from you i understand its legal to steal cargo i understand concord cant do nothing about it even though i wish they could but i find it unfair for a more experienced player can steal my mined cargo and what ever defence i can put up and retaliate against and i cant do anything about it cause that player is better cause after the player stole from me i went to get a ship to extract my mined goods upon leaving station the same player the stole from me was now in a well put together amarr assault ship he blew my cargo ship up right outside station then i got my drake to retaliate same player blew my drake up as well and nothing could be done my corp mate couldnt really help i had no kill rights and no concord to help so i really think something should be considered or done about this
my eyes
i remember two years ago miners were asking for a means to fight back against the can flippers you got it live with it
i dont have the slightest clue as to what you said but i think the solution to this is to make it so that an industrial sized vessel could not be filled up by only 3 minutes of mining if this were so giant secure containers would be good for more than just storing ammo at a posbut since your proposal is really illegible i cant support it because i dont know what it is
oonot supporting noob whinepostillegible
i almost dont want to take the time to dignify such an idiotic post with a reply but others have already done so so not much more harm can be done herea god damn i thought people had figured out by now that just because youre on the internet doesnt mean you dont have to use periodsb you are obviously new to the game so i will say this as lightly as possible learn a few things about the game before complaining in the csm forum about how your ship got blown up you can kill people that steal from you they put your minerals in a can of their own so when you took them back you stole from them they could then kill you they did thats how the game works and i dont know why you dont know that there was even a popup when you took ore from them telling you that you can be shot when you take it how less subtle can it beits people like you that make can tipping fun for people like me so i hope i wont regret explaining how can tipping worksanyway people to sum it up celticwolf is asking that there be some way that you are allowed to defend yourself such as kill rights or something when somebody steals ore out of your jet can and then wondered why he got blown up when he was just taking his ore out of their containers so hes basically asking the csm to add things that are already very firmly in place and have been so since the beginning of the game sounds like this guy needs a mentor 1 2 3 not it
there are solutions to this can tipping problem even one that you can do solo obviously you should avoid having ore in a jetcan but here are some other things you can do1 solofriendly  mine in a hulk outfitted for expanded cargo my hulk has 13k cargo space and thats a fair bit to mine before returning2 timeconsuming  mine until your hold is full then return and repeat3 dual accounts low sp  mine with a friend in an industrial as soon as you put the items into the can have him take them4 dual accounts high sp  mine with a friend who has an orca your mining yield will be higher and you can deposit the ore directly into his cargoholdthese are your options neglect them at your will

so im leveling up my jugglypuff right now because i want to catch and abra but abras are really hard to catch because of teleport so i need my jigglypuff to be at a higher level so i can put it to sleep before it teleports and my charmeleon died of poison so i need to go to the pokemon centre but i want to catch a abra first because its a long ways to the pokemon centre and i dont want to have to make two trips and i would like my geodude to evolve its at level seventeen
hells yeah i caught my abra

im interested in your thoughts about the market ceilings and floorsthanks in advance

if i remember right route 5
they suck manass i mainly refer to npc goods which can easily be purchased off the market in nigh unlimited quantities and then used to destabilize markets shared by player activity shuttles were such an item back in the day because they could be refined for a large amount of trit this trit which could then be dumped onto the market driving prices down artificially i also think insurance qualifies which is why i want to reduce its ability to affect the market by reducing it to the default payout in cases of concord and self destructs while not a mineral source you do have the situation where a price can become so low on the market that people just buy the ship platinum insure it suicide gank or self destruct it and walk away with a profit in this case its helping to keep prices artificially high insurance should be thinkingaheadway to reduce the pain on the wallet if you lose your ship not a price floor this will also have the desired side effect of making suicide ganking more selective which is a balance i think needs to happen now that npc corps are getting taxed im referring to a rather nice thread about a corp that nearrandomly suicide ganked people on a pipe over a period of time and wound up making double digit billions having trouble finding it though if someone has a link handy please post to thread

helloi am helen highwater and i will be running for csm 4you can read my campaign platform herei look forward to answering any questions you have and discussing your issues here i have more than ten years of professional experience in online communities and in games design and i think my credentials would be valuable to the eve community as a wholeive pasted in the important parts of my platform below to save you a click if you dont feel like wading through the biographical stuff on my site
here are some questions i could think ofnow that sovereignty is being overhauled what area of the game desperately needs attention next markettrade mining wardecs lowsec pvp othermany complain that level 4 missions are too profitable what should be done to balance this move level 4 missions to lowsecurity space remove t1 meta 0 loot from missions reduce payout of npcs increase mission difficulty other nothingill update this list as i think of new questions
please keep in mind that the only answers should be ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree were not looking at various options just statements that people agree or disagree with
great idea will try to toss a few statements your way selection is biased to my platform but i tried to keep the wording neutralimproving the processesoutcomes of and customer relationship with the gm department is important for ccps long term successstation docking areas should be made to more closely match their modelsactivating a positive remote effect someone remote repair should cause a one minute delay on dockingjumping and keep your ship in space for up to fifteen minutes after a disconnect just like aggressionthe strength of sensor dampeners on t2 gallente ewar ships is inadequate information warfare links should be rebalanced or redesignedtarget painters are not frequently used because they are not frequently usefultargeted ecm mechanics make them overpowered compared to other forms of electronic warfare00 infrastructure should only be vulnerable to large fleets of organized players supported by capital shipsthe most enjoyable pvp consists of less than 30 players a sidemarket competition is a form of pvpindefinite cloaking is an issue that should be addressedthe interface for customizing your overview tabs is easy to understand and usesuicide ganking should be a viable tacticsuicide gankers should not receive a full insurance payoutcorporation and alliance chats should have messages of the day similar to other chat channelsprice ceilings and floors undermine eves free marketmercenaries are an important part of the game and the hiring process should be supported by ingame mechanics or toolscsm representatives should be held to a higher standard of conduct than ordinary players
i was going to do another voter information service like i did in the last election but this is way better than that so ill just give you some possible questions  amarr are currently overpowered  caldari are currently overpowered  gallente are currently overpowered  minmatar are currently overpowered  ccp should make the user interface openly moddable by players  scamming should be prohibited  epic arcs do not currently live up to their promise and need more work  action needs to be taken to remove 001 isk order bumping from the game  there should be explicit ingame support for coalitions of alliances beyond setting standings  tech 1 meta 0 loot should not be dropped by npcs  players should be able to set their own skill levels on the test server  the csm does not communicate with players enough at present  local chat should be changed to delayed mode immediately  pos mechanics are fundamentally broken and need a complete overhaul  all level 4 missions should be moved to lowsecurity space  jammers are too powerful compared to painters dampeners and tracking disruptors will add more if i think of them
can we please have an official update on these minutessurly given the fact the the csms existence is based on representing the player base to ccp and reporting back the actual communication to the aforementioned player base should be paramounti undertand that ccp need to vet the minutes and that we just had fan fest but come on guysplease try and avoid the trap real life councils seem to walk into with astonishing ease and remember you were elected to serve not for the love of that officecj

this idea just makes senseslow repair facilityhowever i would suggest just rendering the drones unusable while repairs are being madeexample your drone bay is currently locked while repairs are underwayrepairs should be completed in 4 minutes and 37 secondssupported
yes good idea but not instant repair say 20 hps for carrier 50hps for mother ship just think of some better numbers tho
supported as long as doing so consumes nanite repair paste or some other similar resource so its not free and you cant do it forever without a minimal amount of logisticsalso for sake of ease of implementation it should probably be something that just starts repairing everything in your fighterbay when you start it by rightclicking your carrier at the same time everything else is probably going to be a ton tougher to implementi like the thought of it locking your fighter bay while repairs are in progress thoughin addition given that fighter and dronebays will be seperated soon maybe only let the repair thing apply to fighters or something
i support this however there should be some consequence for example the repairs require you to have maintenance personel in your cargohangers the more personel you have the quicker the repairs can be done but at a cost of sacrificing space in your bays also repairs should take capacitor as the maintenance personel would need to use the ships energy to make the repairs

concerning pos fueling requirementswith the advent of dominion and sovereignty changes i would like to suggest a change to the way pos are fueledrather than having to gather all the required resources id like to see the creation of a new pos battery to replace all of the components required allow the pos battery to be manufactured create a bpo and put it on a timer such as 30 60 90 days this should significantly reduce the number of calculations performed on every pos on every moon in eve and allow for better logistical support of an alliance corporation or individual towera secondary battery called a reinforcement battery could replace stront and stront timers in 6 12 18 24 hour increments allowing multiple reinforcement batteries to be installed on a towerfor tower mods and armament either leave the hvy waterliquid ozone required or change these mods to use cpu and power as part of the pos batterycheers

should be a 5 minute change and would make our in game lives better gets my support
the slider does leave something to be desired like buttons p
supporting the idea as well
signedper the reasons stated above mainly that this is the faction cap booster equivalent of the agesold faction ammo and that these will become necessary for any pvper to compete just as faction or t2 ammo and rigs have in recent history faction cap charges should be easy to buy on the open market

supported any pilot that brings one of these to a fleet deserve to be shot by his own team mates and podded give it 2 mids already
i hate to rain on your parade grath but ccp have at least temporarly aborted plans to introduce the 15 ab boost per level any time soon apparentely some bright chap fit a 10mn afterburner to an af and ccp are looking into ways to make the bonus only apply to 1mn absanyway to quote chronotis from the respective thread over in the test server feedbackthe thread has been unstickied as well
i think retribution is the only af for a defensive proupose i like it i suggest another way to make that ship better 4 hi slots1 med slot6 low slotsthis way my favorite ship will have a sense in the game and i dont want to change it to have a mid slot more ccp will take it from the lower making the retribution a suicide assault ship
supported because yeah obviouslytake away the utility high add a med duh
or maybe we could have disruptor that fits to high slot would fix all the ships with too few med slots
this this ship is worthless as it is and it will stay worthless until it gets another mid slot
the fact that some players call this their favorite ship in the game makes me seriously doubt the intelligence of certain amarrian pilots give this ship another mid slot or just delete it from the game all together probably just as well
got my vote i always belived that frigs should beable to tackle and run an af or mwd
hi therethis might already have been discussed if so then ignore this threadthe gap from industrials to freighters is just huge  not just in cargohold but also in skill requirements and specifically ship cost what is missing in my opinion is a ship type to cover that gap industrials cover the highsec hauling of smaller amounts transport ships cover the lowsec part and freighters cover the hauling of very large amounts of goods a ship covering the area around 120000m3 to 150000m3 would be very welcome imo whats floating around my mind looks like this 120000m3 to 150000m3 cargohold fully fitted  rigged 3 rig slots 56 low slots 24 mid slots no high slot medium cost around 60m slightly more survivability than an industrial 25 more shield  armor but at the same time slower and bulkier takes more time to align possibly the requirement of having advanced spaceship command in addition to industrials of any faction at lvl 5 manufactured by ore as to only have to create one type of ship instead of one for each faction
call them medium freighters give each race two variants1st tier would be the kind of hauler youre describing2nd tier would be a freighter with a ship hangar that has lets say 600km3 space enough to fit a battleship insidegive them some fluff say the first tier caldari medium freighters were made by kaalakiota to ship war supplies into the border lands 2nd tier gallente m freighters would be made by roden shipyards to transport warships to this and that place etc itll give me something to rp aboutim tired so yeah sorry if my ideas seem lacking in description fill in the blanks for me still think its a great idea thumbs up
this was already discussed two years ago which is why we now have orcas in the game which fit your specs almost exactly
not really the orca is a support ship for mining operationswhat id like to have is a hauler that requires hauling skills and not mining leadership skills see it as a large industrial or a small freighter whatever you prefer it can move around things but it wont boost other peoples output in any way  and therefore it wouldnt require one to train skills totally useless for hauling thats also why it wouldnt cost you some 250m isk it would be more in line with transport ships or slightly below in terms of cost
it seems to be popping up over and over again the orca is the ship your are looking for that it gives nice mining bonuses is nice on top
its a dualrole ship one of the roles is the small freighter almost exactly as you outlined the other role is mining support it does both well throwing another ship into the same niche would be silly  the orca was designed to fill it and they did a good job with it just because it takes funny skills doesnt mean its not the ship youre asking for
i think itd be great if there was a 120km3 hauling ship in addition to the orca it wouldnt hurt the game and theres the orca already isnt that great of an argument unless youre arguing from the standpoint that you hate having diversity in the game
good morning pilot how do you feeland an aura voice saying that please
something like that why not
i think it sounds a bit too warm and fuzzy for a cold universeand i think you should stay where you were the last time you were logged in i feel it would make life too easy

overal its ok
latest revision looks goodpattern is right that changing the weapons alone would risk making acs on nonbonused especially active tanking ships too goodand with the new arties minmatar ships would be something more than useless in sniper fleets

hi not sure if this has been brought up but here goeswar decing and empire wars have been way over looked by ccp for instance when a corpalliance war decs an apposing corpalliance there is a fee thats all good but if a person or corp leaves a war deced corpalliance there is no penalty to either the individual or corp as a whole other then a nice eve mail saying x corp has surrendered big whoopteedoo how about spoils of war now i dont know what the penalty should be but if they have surrendered then there should be a fee associated with said surrendercome on ccp and council lets address this matter i for one want to see something introduced in the next patch that use empire care bears can get some benefit from not just new paint and pretty planetswell thats about it let the carebears start whining about this thread lol
pretty much everyone and their dog is aware the empire wars are broken beyond all understanding your proposal while interesting isnt all that uniquefrankly whats needed is a complete overhaul of the mechanic not just an additional step in the process
i dont see it as a step but as a fix right now every man wimp and his pet turtle can leave a corpalliance when someone declares war on them penalize them it cost isk to dec there wimpy asss so it should cost them to chicken out too so i would call this a step in the right direction while we sit and age for the war decing rebuild that will never come 
when you can find a way to keep this from being used strictly to grief smaller corporations into oblivion ill consider supporting itmaybeuntil then no
1 your topic is misleading you should change it to war abandonmentpeople are going to assume your complaining about those who grief in wardecs2 you have a valid point but like de i wont support this without a great deal of thought and balance being added to the equation
no you all fail to see the point its not about griefing a corp into inhalation or anything like that its about the use of surrendering with no penalty everything in this game well almost has a consequence but with wars too many can leave a war without a consiquense what im saying is fine if you wish to leave a war then there should be a fee paid thats all as it stands there is nothing for the victor you fight in 00 for a reason you kill for a km well with war there should be a price at the end its not just about griefing its about balance right now there is no balance for the war mongers in eve
you also fail to see that if you declare war and stay docked for the whole duration there is no consequence to you you also fail to see that 2mil is pittance for a license to pop stuff in highsec you also fail to see that there is no point in wardecs apart from freeing up a highsec moon or griefing clueless noobs the first one is valid but as for the second one if youre having a hard time griefing noobs then you should just quit now because its not gonna get any easierwardecs where supposed to be a way for people to disrupt the supply lines of 00 alliances but with neutral hauler alts and all the metagaming this is no longer the casei agree wardecs need an overhaul as theyre pretty much a wasted mechanic atm but you fail to adress the other issues if you look at the big picture youll understand that wardecs arent in favour of neither attacker nor defender as it stands if you want to change the mechanic you need to make sure it stays that waythank youps not supporting this as there isnt even a suggested fix and only one side is represented
i guess youve had your fair share of war decs lol you sit there and spout crap about sitting in dock all i was getting at if you bothered to read is there needs to be a penalty for people who quit a war and want to sit in a npc corp fine if you do want out of a war but there needs to be a penalty to do it thats all i fail to see why your getting your pretty panties tide all in a knot and yes the whole war decing needs a rebuilt and as i said great if it ever gets done but in the mean time lets get a couple of things fixedchanged dang man who cares if you support butt sniffers anonymous but at least read what im getting at properly oh and the 2mil is for a corp decing a corp its 50mil for alliances
quit while your ahead nooblet you dont know who your dealing with here thumbs fille balle
it costs 1bil to found an alliance if you can afford that 50mil is pittance and you failed to read what i wrote i agree there should be a penalty but there also need to be a penalty for the attacker if they dont engage yes ive had my share of wardecs and every time it was declared by a bunch of loosers looking to grief some noobs then they learned that they where picking on the worng guys then they docked up and waited it out no consequencethats the bit that you fail to understand there needs to be balance if theres a penalty for the defender then you also need to implement a penalty for the attacker for balance get itand lern to use periods ffs punctuation is not a city in afganistan
per 
fascinating idea and i like it in principle but im not sure its workable problem is determining ownership of the ore jetcans are corp assets not personal and multiple people can fill one not to mention that when you stack items together the game forgets their history  theres no way to tell whether half the stack came from you and half from me the only way i can even think of to do this would be to have a specialized jetcan that is individual not corporate and that gives the person taking from it the option to pay their going rate for itthey wouldnt be forced of course since we want to still allow can stealing thats a complex and ugly solution but it might do what you want still it sounds like something better done by players than by game mechanics id love it if it worked but im not sure that it really could
in the code youd just have to keep the history of ownership of the ore around as long as the container is owned by someone in the corp or fleeti think keeping the ownership history around as long as the container is owned by the corpfleet then it shouldnt be a problem the mining director would be able to set the going rate for each ore based on a contract of course he could set up veld for 4 isk and then when the mining op starts lower it to 00  that would still allow cheating btw  i love how we try to design the possibility for cheating into this  i love eve
youre saying put it into the code like its easy inventory code is complex welloptimized and not something you want to mess with unnecessarily stacked items dont have histories they have typeids and quantities to the best of my knowledge thats it you want to store more even in that one narrow case they have to completely redo how they do all inventory everywhere any time youd open a container hangar cargo bay whatever itd have to get the ownership history on every single stack of everything the hamsters would be screaming its the same reason that they cant colour bpcs differently than bpos its not that they dont want it to be easy to work with its that the server architecture doesnt work well with the proposal and the proposal isnt important enough to justify rewriting everything with all the attendant bugs and diversion of dev manhours
when i had been training for arround a week i was waiting at a gate with my fleet and i got my first abaddon kill as a team even a new player can be usefull in a fleet now 6 months on i still like the role i played that night tackler now a tackler needs arround 3 hours of training from the start and ur there and in my opinion its the most fun role to play in the fleetof course if u playing eve by ur self and trying to teach ur self how to play u got no chance so find ur self a corp and not a cearbear mining one if u havent got the balls for pvp and wardecks then get a pve corp but u have no idea what ur missing
one last bump but looks like its not a big deal to most people and most likely wont see time of day with the csm let alone on ccps plateoh wellside note ccp where are my hull rep drones the csm brought up to you
dont know why this has so little support it seems like a good idea to me id prefer the 1 rig improves heat resistance of all mods option but the 1 rig per rack option is probably better balanced
my frustration is simple the way that actual graphics of the shield effect on the ship looks my proposal is to make shield graphic effect looks again round or oval shape like it used to bethe reason for this is1 ending some graphic bugs on some ships like joints or spaces between areas of the ship and so on2 having a oval or round shield is more rationale for the majority of players when generating a shield or an electromagnetic shield usually it have a round or oval shape like the electromagnetic shield of the planet the shape of such of these in general are round or oval3 and shield beeing oval around the ship can show animated effects of interaction with it when happens like beeing hit bye a missile it wouble or waveing wen hit by a laser or iradiating by overcrossing with others ships shields and so on these things making the overall gameplay way better because when you play eve the most of the time is spent with ship in space and shilds online thanks
because we all know what a real shield looks likei think that because its wasnt possiblefeasible for ccp to move hits to shields away from the center point then moved shields closer to the center point it looks like missiles actually hit the shields or pretty close instead of going through the oval shields
actualy i spend most of my time with shields and armour both offline although it would look nice for the few seconds when they are there
real men hull tank
not supported i prefer the ship hugging shieldshowever it would be nice if ccp would do something about the damn sounds when you have hardeners activated
i am referring only on shields of course it will be nice to have sounds asociated with some specific shields or armour and hull interactors or activators but again i thinking only on shields because shields seams to have a graphic problem or inconvenience as far i can see hardeners and other repairs and stuff effects looks ok there are room for more anyway but that shields are really on edgethe poit is ccp could bring back old shields at least the old ones were much much much
oh jeese i dont even have the stones to troll like this dayum
this idea is so good that i feel i need to present you with an award of some kind so without further delays i hereby present you with a check for eleven internets
supported or at least give us the ability to toggle it
i agree it doesnt fix everything but its most of the way
excellent idea scrappy ship should be fast frail and make things go boom in spectacular ways
yes this needs to be fixed i spent a few months ratting on a slow and unstable internet connection and getting discod would result in 5 minutes logging in and a 20 jump trip to a station that i could dock in to buy new drones this is not fisable on a daily basis nor should it have to be
signed
docking timers are fine what i think you dont realize is that a huge sideaffect of this change would be people would be even more cautious to engage leading to even fewer fights and fewer kills id support a scale up for docking timers of different classes of ships but i dont think any subcap should have to wait more than a minute to dock its plenty of time to give it a go and if you dont kill them in that frame so be it this from someone who has missed a drake raven and cnr kill due to docking in just the past 5 hours if you really wanted to get rid of the problem youd take your fight off station no support here
after the fiasco of the sisi event last weekend id say noit was full of muppets shooting anything with titanspersonally i used it to test stuff i could realistically use on tq such as different turrets etc to see if i thought it was worth training them on tq sure i undocked in a dread to shoot a titan that was abandoned outside the station in highsec and got instapopped by concord man i want one of those battleshipshaving armageddon days on tq is a bad idea let alone armageddon weeks they serve no real purpose apart from having a laugh and flying stuff you cant normally fly
i think an armageddon day would be awesome i bolded what i consider to be the whole point armageddon day might be hard to setup but i thik the lolz from the event are well worth the time ccp could spend on such a wild event again
armaghedon day cammed a week ago you probably missed it
except that was intended to be an actual test for dominion capital changes then again i guess it was going to happen regardless
thumbstheres no point in having armageddon day on sisi the performanceloginqueuemess that was last weekend attests to thateither needs to be a big cluster or dont d
irl cargo transfers happen among naval vessels it would make sense for the same thing to happen with freighters in evethe orcas could be mining directorsforeman and the freighters could haul for them im seeing some mechanisms where by orcas dock with the freighter and the cargo is transferred like in the instation trade mechanism
why just orcas and freightersbut i see a major problem hold spacei think the main reason ccp requires trades to happen in stations is because there is a lot less requirements in station trades just require you to have a few of your 1000 or 999 i forget which is the limit slots open
im willing to bet money that ccp does not want freighters to be able to be directly involved in a mining op at best they should pick up the ore from a station andor pos and haul it elsewhereyou want a humongous cargo capacity while mining fly a rorqualnot supported
freighters are specifically prohibited from transferring cargo in space for exactly this reason nobody wants to see hulks jetcanning into a freighter not even if theres an orca in the middle
and if 5000 people falsely report you dont get me wrong im all for this but the logs should be checked before taking any action i can totally see someone not mentioning any names here abusing this i think some sort of punishment for abuse should be implemented like a 3 day ban you know just to put people again not mentioning any names here off abusing it for lulz

ok so now if youre in a gang you can just drag your mission from journal to chat however only gang people can see it nobody else can click on iti propose making this work for everyone regardless of gangnewbs and pros then can drag and show the mission to everyonenow pirate roleplayer losers dont go bah no supporting missionrunners if you as a pirate find ur way accidentally into a mission channel and a newb links a lowsec mission you know exactly where to go to find a mission runner in lowsec
makes perfect sense to me would help a lot in the assorted help channels
some of these i like the missile port are a good idea the overheated cap not so much while were on the topic of graphics id like to bring up the graphics for the beam and pulse lasers beam lasers are a steady beam id like to see just that  a single solid steady beam lasting the entire cycle time perhaps with a bit of drift off of the target and extending past it for a period of the shot i know this part would be difficult to implement as hit anims are fairly static and not dependant on the targets sillouette from the attackers persspective thats bunches more processing to determine that alonepulses as they are now ar so similar to beams its laughable id make them more like the projectile or hybrid graphics im that it would be a projected energy blast  think fast moving missile and youre on the right track in either case and with all the other weapons too id like to see a graphical representation of the shields perhaps not visible at all times only when hit and not necessarily representitive of the shields strength but it would be nice to visually see when youve gotten through the shielding and are hitting the armorthe same goes for the division between armor and hull but thats harder to see usually is over really fast and hull damage already has a graphic on pc ships id like to see it on rats thoughjust my 002 isk 
no support for op but i like this idea
i raised it as an issue for a csm meeting but isd renamed my issue due to excess profanityheres the current name for it
i do support the idea of faction capitals however you might wanna look into those bonuses nano carrier is prob what makes this suggestion go into the dust and be forgotten anyway make it webdamage or webextreme tank or something like that or for lolz target painterweb for a very expensive rapier
capital tps and webs ftw with 100km range wouldnt be that bad imo but the real question remains would you need say cladariamarr carrier trained to lvl3 in order to use the sansha one because im ok with crosstraining subcaps but capships i cant even fly any capships yet
flagging a scanning alt isnt going to help much if anything should be done and i doubt suicide ganks need yet another nerf then a mod which hides some of your cargo would be better
not supported
before or after 8 and 9
actually thats not a half bad idea cast 8 is in production recording 9 this evening well kick the idea around after were done recording 9 and see if its feasibleim definitely going to be making an appearance on planet risk to talk w other csm candidates but some kind of super qa would be something im up for if we can make it work
alek why do you hate arazus
ive read your page and i must say that you seem like a very valid candidate however i do have a few questions regarding your position1 why did you choose to be a member of goonswarm over the other alliances aside for personal reasons do you see a benefit to join an alliance with such often questionable tactics2 i noticed you didnt mention mission running or factional warfare in your history how much experience do you have with those3 what area of the game needs the most attention in your eyes and what would you do to improve iti look forward to hearing your answers
hey thanks for your questionsfirstly lets get the goon question out of the way i joined a corp within goonswarm back in may or so this year as the big invasion of delve was in full swing the corp i joined had a lot of friends id known for a long time outside of eve and so it seemed natural to hook up with them after my last corp disintegrated i was also looking for experience in large fleet fights so the prospect of joining in with the largest conflict was particularly attractive the benefits that i joined goonswarm for were the opportunities to fly with friends and to take part in the kind of epic scale fleet engagements that had attracted me to eve in the first place if you check out my killboard stats then youll notice that almost all of my kills and losses are in fleet fights of varying sizes youll also notice that i am a terrible pvper but lets not dwell on thati know that goons have a reputation however the game is just as important to us as to anyone else many of the current and upcoming improvements to the game have been brought to the table by goon csms a lot of testing and numbercrunching is done as well as a lot of development work on thirdparty tools that have benefited almost everyone who plays the game evemon being the most obvious examplemissions and factional warfareif you look up my employment history in game youll see long periods in the scope youll also see i have some very high standings with npc corps like federation intelligence federation navy creodron and spacelane patrol that should answer your question about my experience with mission running i spent most of my time between player corps running missions in empire to build up my wallet and buy some shiny toys i also took the time to shepherd my industrial alt through enough missions to get his standings up for l4 rd agents i havent tried factional warfare myself i was in an alliance when it launched and we were too busy fighting for our space up in vale of the silent at the time i keep thinking of starting an alt just for fw but ive been too busy with my main to get distracted with a time intensive altwhat area of the game needs the most attentionthere are a lot of different areas that i think need some urgent attention and im hesitant to pick just one as the most important obviously the upcoming dominion changes will shake up the game in a big way and i think its critical that ccp gets that right if there are major issues with the way that the new sov system and 00 rebalancing works then i would say that this will be the most important area in the short term assuming that ccp mostly gets dominion right then the next thing in my sights would be the new user experience new players are essential for eves long term survival and at present i dont think the game does a good job of drawing them in a whole raft of things contribute to this some of which are also problems for more experienced players such as the ui the various management interfaces and the difficulty of getting accurate information about game mechanics or systems id like to sit down with ccp and work through all of this to untangle all of these knots to make the experience more streamlined more transparent and far more user friendlyof course as well as these existing issues there are also other points on the horizon  dust 514 is coming and eve players have a lot of questions and concerns about that  especially with the planetary management stuff ambulation looks to be on the way at last and were long overdue for a lowsec overhaul id hope to bring these questions to the devs along with the current or imminent issues faced by all of us
i can vouch for goons during my term on the csm darius was the spearhead that put the 00 revamp into full gear and ive noticed that avalloc has also championed a lot of interesting topics i dont mind goons personally i just despise their tactics dj was all about pvp and turned down a lot of reasonable pve topics for instancethat said thank you for answering my questions assuming no other candidate comes to the forefront you have my vote
hiya hope you dont mind me asking but are you the same ian c who ran the european closed war beta and of previous daoc fame
please list all upcoming changes to the game that the goon csms are responsible for
yesmarlona most of that info is in the meeting minutes
oh coolwell you got one of my votes  i got in the beta on one of the first waves and i thought you did splendidly there have no doubt youll take a csm post seriously and have a positive impact we could use an all roundrepresentative on the csm imo eve needs to be better for everyone the whole nerf pirates boost carebears boost lowsec nerf highsec rhetoric gets me down good luck with the campaign
i must have been very tired since i managed to miss the obvious  anyways a few suggestions kill rights should be tradeable player piracy in low sec currently isnt worthwhile
does this mean youve found a way to prevent a candidate from being dishonest about his views on the statements
there is no significant difference between a player choosing to cross the boundary into lowsec or 00 and a player choosing to open fire on a ninjalooter in highseceither way the player is making a conscious decision to assume riskninjas are totally in touch with reality and what theyre really doing they are offering mission runners a chance to engage in pvp on extremely unfavorable termsall this talk about good evil and mental illness is totally ridiculous
simply saying something is so does not in fact make it so
there go with 4 votesgood luck in the csm

the csm is nothing more than a convenient platform in which ccp generates some good press and makes you feel they listenalthough they have implemented a number of small fixes based on the csm these would probably have seen the light of day without the csm after all the devs do read the ideas and some of the ones in dominion etc are on the boards in one form or another and not part of the csm

none of the players i talked to prefers the new jump effect over the old one it is time to get the bang back and make it bling while all other effects are great well i kinda liked the matrix pos shields better than the current one capital jumps are a major disappointment as they are no different than jumping a gate this really needs to be improved

yep i was so looking forward to this until i saw the console only thing
pc please
the more i read about it the more i am realizing that this is a business decisionccp already has a game that is doing pretty well on pc  evenow they want a game that will do well on console and thus double or triple their revenue  dustthey wont make dust pc because everyone knows that a pc gamer would a r any console gamer because a mousekeyboard allows much better control they also insist on dust being a linked universeso dust will be console only i f hate consoles but i might get a ps3 so i can watch bluray and play dust after all its one of the best bluray players out theretldr  f you ccp you greedy bastards i will still buy your products lead me
being locked out of what could very well be an extremely great game on pc sucks weve seen the success of bf1942 bf2 and its numerous clones so the demand for action oriented games with a good rts part mixed with cooperative first person shootthemintheface is thereso yeahid like to play a game like that again
seconded
excellent idea well thought out concept for it too
interesting idea but riddled with flawsjust like having rigs is not mandatory but if you want to compete youll want the best to compete with if the other guy has crews youll want them tooneeding a rig in order to fit crews makes no sense from an rp standpoint which seems to be most of your justification for this idea the crews already work inside the ship rigs are cool things you can do to mess with the ship for better results just like instead of buying brakes from the manufacturer i could rig something up with some cork and sheet metal lying around not recommended and in case you missed it from my post above the crews already work inside the ship when you fire missiles the crews are in the bowels of your ship to reload itand what about that oh crap i left my crew in station rp you can now not turn around to redock you have no crew to operate under your commands
this was brought to the csm and ccp and shot down here are the reasonings1 there are already a lot of things which can modify ship stats2 adding more things that modify ship stats just mean there is a lot of rebalancing work that needs to be done to prevent the inevitable overpowered ship3 when a new stat modifier is released and rebalanced with respect to everything else that means people who dont get this new thing for their ships will be at a disadvantage to everyone else4 with mods rigs skills implants gang bonuses etc etc players already have enough  to worry about and they have a long enough list of things they must have to be competitive
one of the big problems i have with the assembly hall system is that there is a support button but not an unsupported buttonwhy is this a problemit means you cannot be neutral in order to gauge how well an idea is liked you have to compare the number of supports to the total number of posts this creates an atmosphere of if you arnt with us you are against us because it means if you dont post with an explicit support you are reducing the apparent support leveli propose a not supported tick box if you tick not supported it deducts a point from the supported tallythis means an item can have negative or positive support but more importantly allows people to post constructive but not explicitly supportive posts without seeming to cast a not supported vote
obviously supported
supported
id almost prefer that the thread summary have explicit thumbsupthumbsdown counts not a total but thats really secondary yes this has been asked for since day one and with good reason itd sort out the mess immensely supporting it again
not supported
but how can we tell
me strikes one up for neutral
i think ccp is worried with justification about attracting trolls griefers and troublemakers to this forum since you cant just give thumbs down people are more likely to actually bother typing reasons why the idea is bad certainly this is not always going to happen especially on the 101st thread about salvage thieves but i doubt devs bother with those threads either im guessing that from the perspective of developers the current system is much more fruitfuli do agree that there is no way of immediately show you are neutral but i doubt this is an actual issue it will make some ideas look to have less support than they actually have since the op had a lacking solution or understanding but i think it is pretty foolish to think that any changes are made on the basis of the number of thumbs up compared to the total number of posts it only shows there is interest on the matter and how the playerbase is feeling about the issuesolution proposed but the actual arguments in the posts are propably much more influentialim not sure why there is any real need to fix problems of appearances since popularity isnt going to get your idea passed anyway it is the good reasons and ideas you have to provide and usually can provide on popular matters that will decide the issue
supportednot because i think it is good to thus open the door to vote no because i dont like yousupporting because it allows you to show i have seen it and want to vote against it as opposed to now where a lack of support vote may mean anything from you have not even seen the thread over you have seen it but have not decided yet to you are adamantly against the ideamotive
yes please
thumbs up to thumbs down
sounds like a reasonable idea
not supported as this is based off the flawed idea that the number of thumbs up posts as compared to the total number of posts is what indicates whether the idea will be brought to ccp by the csms this is incorrectthe thumbs up feature on the assembly hall posts can allow the csms to easily eyeball the threads they can see by the number which topics have caught the eye of many people and then go into the threads themselves to see what kind of support or lack thereof there actually is for the ideatldr  there is no  of thumbs up per  of unique posters formula that makes the idea presented to ccp it just allows csm to notice threads to look at
not having it makes you sound like youre against the topic unless you click the support ive sometimes not involved myself in discussions where i couldnt quite decide and ive supported topics without being sure what the suggested topic actually meansthis button would be helpful
supported not just because it makes sense but because the ability for users to vote for and against proposals anonymously was promised in the original draft for how this forum was supposed to workthere was never meant to be a requirement to post to support an idea actually coding in the originally promised functionality for this forum would get rid of a large amount of spam from the topics in the form of posts simply put in to bump up the support count without adding to any discussion to the idea being put forwarditd also get rid of alt supports by tying the ability to vote in each topic to the account rather than the posting characterhaving said that i seem to remember supporting this very issue a couple of other times in the past
and this is wasting the csms timelet me show you whyhypothetical thread2000 posts on thread 500 supportslooks pretty promising ehexcept that in that thread 500 posts are supportive 500 are neutral and 1000 are negativeif there were a not supported box that tally would have shown 500 instead of 500 and the csm would have known that it was an unpopular ideainstead they have to tunnel though the entire thread to get an overview o just how unpopular the idea isif you have a way to show your liking for an idea but no way to show your disliking it cannot help but create misrepresentation
totally and utterly unsure of support or not maybe
supporting in spite of the idiot trolls
so this thread is intended to go straight to ccp and completely bypass the csms the reason the csms are the problem and i highly doubt theyll bring up the issue of their own failingsafter observing the last three csm elections and reviewing their performances its crystal clear things need to change for the better the entire csm process needs to dissolve and be rebuilt in order to function as intended currently its brokenthough larkonis indiscretions are awful to say the least the damage to the csm credibility was imo much worsehe may be called an isolated incident and that would be fine if true sadly it isnt when csms like mazzilliu bring up blatant self serving issues like this it further hurts the csm credibility especially when the player support vote is 3 for  133 against3 for is herself an alt and some other guysomehow this issue despite receiving less than 1 thread support made it onto the table with ccp isnt the whole purpose of the csm process to represent player interests and bringing them to ccp in an intelligent and structured presentation can anyone honestly say this csm is speaking on the players behalfunfortunately it gets worse with the recent ccp fanfest a csm panel was hosted to a near empty room the video posted on youtube look who strolls in late and with poorly chosen words 1415really is this really why she ran for csm a free trip to iceland all expense paid a simple phrase thats disturbingly insightful into her intentionsand yes it does get worse there are alliances ingame who have guaranteed spots on the csm panel due to their sheer size and voting muscle nothing personal goons but having multiple guaranteed seats just isnt right i could point out further failures of the csm process but the point has been madeladies and gentlemen we can do better than thiswe as a playerbase are not being represented by those whose sole purpose is to represent usccp i implore you disband the csm and restructure so these failings never happen again reform the csm with clear and public guidelines and structure define what is expected of them and what their purpose is give us the tools to determine which issues the csms bring up and which ones they dont form an inside panel to review csm performance so we can finally be rid of their sleazy politics become more transparent and public with the ongoings of csms were sick of this shadowy process were sick of being left out in the coldthere may yet still be hope for salvaging this broken csm process but we cant do it without your help ccpoh and i like pie
yes some candidates get elected that imho do not deserve to be elected some of them consider the csm a joke and the players are the targets of that joke however they do get elected by the playersreformatting the csm wont do anything to help this facet the fact that mazz raised the issue in a csm meeting isnt at all surprising what is surprising is that the measure passedwhen i was in office you can see by my history that i raised some issues that didnt get good support and therefore didnt even bring them up to the csm some of the issues that got a lot of support got shut down by my other delegates however this is a democraticallyelected council and this is part and parcel of the taleif you think this is wrong use the power youve been granted by ccp to change it by doing research and voting in people who are responsible dont whine about a system that does somewhat work even if it isnt perfectless than 10 of the playerbase voted last time we can do better but that might actually require some eek effort from the players go to the polls and vote and encourage friends and corporate members to do the same
first of all supporting my own thread and just for the record i have voted for candidates whom have shown a lot of initiative towards cleaning up this mess however theyve always been a letdown afterwards even in the last election for csm3 i voted for someone who later turned out to be a complete asshat im sure someone out there will liken this onto sleazy rl politics but it doesnt have to be and thats the entire point of the thread we can do better than this
jealous muchi doubt you want their jobs lets be fairfanfest was awesome thank you
agreed but the problem remains nonethelesseven if i was to run and possibly could pull it off as i have a bit of an ace up my sleeve support wisedont look so shocked just because you hate my guts doesnt mean theres isnt a large contingent of people who do like me  o p i dont think its worth the effort or trouble in all honestythat should say something to you people think about that for a bitfor starters the csm has no checksum in place for crap that mazz pullsone voice against a pile of csms who abuse that power is not going to help me whether im in it or notsecondly the obvious brick wall of communication is likely ndas and thats not good for someone such as myself who scream in the face of stupiditythirdly im a rather contrary person people dont like me because i dont hesitate to shine a 100 million candle spotlight in your face if your a moronnot likely to win points there even for the fact that i would never pull the crap mazz did or lark which was minor in comparison imho which should have cost lark more than he had to pay but mazz did far worseccp should enforce a strict set of rules concerning the submission of ideas and the process of which they are benchedand i refuse to accept mazzs pathetic excuse for why she pushed it forward without proof from ccp itself none of that nda bulli would support this proposal under normal circumstances but bunyip has a valid pointso im torn at the moment but i agree there is a serious problem and it needs to be resolved prontoif they can bring any idea to the front of the list with minimal to zero public support the csm should likely be shut down and scrapped to be replaced by something with a little more accountability than it has todaynot an easy thing to fix to be surethis is supposed to be i really hate using this word democratic process in which people bring forth ideas they are critiqued tested and then the csm votes those things that are popularbut this is nothing the csm are praticually dictators who agree to cooperate and vote on things we are just the peanut gallery who have no sway or control over the situationthey choose to listen or to ignore or laugh at usthats not how this is supposed to workif ccp intended to push this forward they would have never have bothered with the csm in the first place they would bypass them entirely after all they are in charge and at largeso all it comes down to is this if the csm is really who they are then who do they answer tosure as hell aint us
according to a gm who likes to sleep in odd placesthere is no fixed number of votes required the csm decides which issues is being given priorityso they could just ignore this forum and bring issues to ccp that they dream up the day beforewhich makes voting a waste of time for players if the csm members want to ignore it as some dosupported but good luck getting the csm to raise this one
all i hear is bawwwwww
i get that youre ed for that matter i agree with some of the reasons mazzs issue was largely idiotic as i said in my reply to it and the fact that the csm passed it flabbergasts methough to be fair 3136 is 2 not 1 i would never have voted for it myself i like a lot of what mazz has to say and i think she gets a bad rap sometimes for being too sarcastic like in that quote but shes far from an ideal csm that said this is how democracy works you elect fools you elect slackers you elect people most interested in lining their pockets and you elect people who have grand visions and never deliver on themand no i am not referring to anyone in particular with any of those democracy is not perfect and it wont be perfect until every candidates innermost thoughts are known to the voters and every voter is an expert on every issue needless to say im not holding my breath on either of those the problem here isnt the democracy though  its that youre expecting too much of it youre making the perfect the enemy of the good and yes the csm we have is a good thing warts and all yeah you elect lark and watch him selfdestruct or you electwell most of them have proposed a silly issue or two so i wont even single out mazz you also elect the body that finally managed to kick ccps ass hard enough to make them realize the skill queue wed been screaming for six years was something that we really did want the csm provides a good crosssection of the players and they have enough weight behind themselves to make ccp listen to the will of the players as best our representatives can advance it im not going to mess around with that system just because you think you can do better with the next set of rules you cant  this is what democracy always looks like theres a reason churchill called it the worst system except for all the others it is but i wouldnt give it up for the world
realy  but they wrote the truthcsm a joke most of csm members elected from alliance mail from 00 corps binding vote its not so fair against other candidatesneed an other solution for vote maybe a popup window in eve when starting the client before the next election will be started and maybe ccp will be get better result as 10 of eve players i could show you in the hungarian or other forums how working thisvote for this guy he is blue for us and we can talk with him for our own interest blablaand other things because the whole csm is 00 players most of problems focused just to 00cry for cloakcry for cloak mwd etclogoffsky and about them does not change nothing they just like it the dirty and tricky things which dodge from the normal gamethats fine when a freighter logged off at gate when the warp phase just started and you cant kill him because you cant target the ship even then if you scanned in space after then the pilot have 15 minute aggression timebut csm didnt vote the changes
personally the csm has been utter failure since it started imo its all about who gets most votes and egos well if your in a large alliance then of course your going to winits about personal preferences for those alliances not for the good of the whole of eve and thats was what it was supposed to be maybe thats what ccp intended it to be as the majority of players going to use the full depth of the game are the large alliances mayberemember your supposed to be the voice of all players of eve i saw one thread that because ccp decided not to answer or give suggestions to a problem they closed it keh your supposed to push ccp on matters and get an answer again that was the point of csm otherwise whats the pointhowever csm was supposed to be that conduit between player and ccp really i hear nothing and you only see stuff if you go look for itsomething needs to change big time so supportedi think at least change it so that you must of played eve for at least 3 years to apply and the people voted just dont know how to work as real stakeholders and drive issues throughmaybe ccp need to hire a set of independants but there again if they not going to listen to csm then they aint going to listen to anyoneany perhaps thats the real problem ccp not coming to their side of the bargain
youre absolutely right everyone on the csm represents 00 interests especially the euni dude and that erik dude who is a carebear andowaitedit as for the figure saying that 133 people disagreed with mazzs issue thats disingenuous at best and completely dishonest at worst theres a group of about six or seven posters who represent the vast majority of posts in that thread they dont get multiple votes go count the number of people who posted in the thread rather than the posts before trying to analyze the support it got
posting to vote supporti think those who have been following these things have an idea of my views on the mattersapart from that i do object to one point raised by the opthread support it should not really be a criteria or requirement in deciding whether something gets raised or notdoes anyone even read the first post of every thread in assembly hall its like being forced to read the features and ideas sectionso lack of threadsupport is no acceptable reason to drop somethingotoh a lot of support can be mustered simply by certain people telling their pleebs to go vote it not it those exact words but it does not take all that much due to the lack of attention these things generally get to make it look like a lot of support compared to the majority of thingstherefore drop the notion that thread support thumbcount should matter it is not realistic with the current level of participation by the general populationbtw i would like to point out that the csm minutes from the last meeting with ccp is still missing from the official page
forgot the thumb

ahahahahahau mad
you werent the only one that cringed at that commentthere was no further input from that end of the table after that
to add to your nerd rage and list of my indiscretions i raised this issue with zero supports and even zero posts thats like even less support then my term limits issue i didnt even post to support it myself you should probably make a youtube video or something about itif you want to audit the performance of the csm you can do it right here from the comfort of your own computer chair plenty of the issues on that list were raised by me some of which were extremely popular issues youll probably ignore the full list of what weve actually done and keep complaining about how we dont represent da people or something like that though and i can totally understand that everyone has a right to cry on eveo for very little good reason re the csm panel well im glad i accomplished at least one thing there by trolling you people irl the entire csm panel was us answering a small handful of questions for an hour almost all of it was stuff you can look up fanfest is for parties our actual work as the csm was in private and all held early on the first day i attended all of thatalso ccp dont read the assembly hall forums but ill save this thread so i can show it to my voting base next reelection for some reason they like it when eveo posters get trolled and cry on the forums about it especially when its for pretty much no good reason this will get me more votes next time aroundsupported for trolling a half dozen ofthe assembly hall posterssignedkisses and hugs the most diplomatic diplomat in pl and a real girl in real lifemazzilliuthis post is disappointing it doesnt even contain scandal involving the people you listed larkonis has no big alliance backing him
actually yes quite a few of us are indeed angry about the situation although to be honest im more irritated about mazzs flagrant abuse of her power than i am about larkonisgatethe csm is a lot like a communist state  it looks great on paper once you get real people involved however it rapidly goes to  because most people are inherently selfish and out to line their own pockets its just how were built  evolution ftwwhats really needed are two things1 increase the vote count the reason these lare alliances keep getting their members on the council is because they poke and prod their members to vote we need to get a similar movement out among the nonalliance players  push the idea that they need to get out and vote at least then if they win theyll have earned it instead of walking into the spot2 increase oversitgh of the council from the player side part of the issue is that once elected a csm member has no incentive to do anything they promised to do except actually show up to meetings as my dad would say they have no skin in the game and thus can pretty much do what they want as long as they dont incur the wrath of ccp if anything they are beholden to their alliancescorps pretty much because theyre the people that will make their lives the most miserable if they dont push their agendathe op if youd posted this a month ago id have back it with every thumb i could muster ive come to the realization since then that the csm can probably be saved but only if we get more players involvededitmazz snuck in a post on me while i was writing thisscrew it disband them no more free trips to anywhere for anyoneif the members of the csm themselves are going to treat the position like a joke dump it id rather ccp spent my subscription money on new hardware than sending asshats like mazz to iceland so she can be an attention  in rl as well as pixel land
haha a dozen of you are mad more like the function of the csm has always been for people to raise issues to ccp to improve the game we still do that just fine and ccp seem pretty happy with the count and quality of issues raised so far you dozenguys act like we are stealing money from da people or some terrible crime its pretty funny
btwneed clear and clean rulesfirst supported and not supported button for this forumsecond when an idea reach a minimum supporter count and reached over 501vote must be move to csm vote 1100200300 or other numbers find out1 vote from 1 account binding alliance votes cause banas in pandemic legion dplayers controlled csm  csm controlled ccp
agreed csm process needs to change theres not enough awesome people like mazzilliu on itfake edit first page in this epic threadnought
and then we move to communism real edit it wont be a threadnought it will be a failure
i wish to make my campaign promise for when i run for csm right now i will not rest until the true dream of mazzilliu being the only person on the csm is achieved today the csm tomorrow ccp
supporting my own thread these highsec carebear tears are pretty sweet run for csm yourself and stop crying like a little girl nothing stop you from launching a campaign travel around in eve and copy and paste your campaign website etc but i guess its less effort posting whine posts on a forum
failpost this named to democracyeverybody depends on each other and supervises each other
hey its good enough for chinafake fake edit this is truely going to be an epic threadnaught
cry more 3
so pathetic you need more ally member from ventrilo or from corp channel just yell there my csm lover cries and need help in evecom alts and members go to defend d
i too think this csm is nothing but a sham and a fraudit goes against every principle of democracy that goons of all people should be allowed to be voted in and the fact theres even representatives from pl just goes to show how broken the system is ccp should ban them allmuch like the op dirty wizard i too believe that the csm would be much better if it were comprised solely from members of the other side of eve 00 politicsi also support where dirty wizard is going with his idea representatives should be that solely representatives during their term in the csm all members should have their ingame accounts frozen to prevent distraction from their duties they should also be taken to iceland and kept in solitary confinement to prevent being conataminated with bias from human interraction on the matters that they are currently considering the facility should be known as the box once accepted onto the csm they should be immediately flown out to iceland and placed in the box relevent reading material can be passed via a dumb waiter as well as the necessary foods and liquids this allows the representative to work for the people without interference or distraction until their term comes to an end and they are released from the box early release from the box should not be an option except in obvious cases of medical emergency or deathi believe the box will allow the csm to act more fluidly in considering matters of extreme importance in the eveuniverse and put to bed claims of bias
this thread is shaping up to be pretty good i dont even know where to startfor those who havent realised it yet youve all been trolled massively by a dainty little azn girl grats through your ignorance and short sightedness youve pretty much allowed it to happenwhiteknightas for the other issues here 49 current csm members are from big 00 entities hardly dominating it and its only right in some ways as 00 is the supposed endgame of course these people are going to be able to generate lots of support and lots of political capital quickly if youre unhappy about it then make more contacts in game or qq more and get back in your hugboxif you have a problem with the way things are being done then either run yourself try and make some constructive posts or cancel your sub making inflamatory and ill informed posts just makes yall look like mongs and if this forum is filled with flamebait then noone will see any of the constructive postswith reference to the thumbs up and mazs post the 3 supports are all from individuals most of the 100 or so posts on that thread were made by a dozen or so people the system in its current form is a bit broken i forwarded issues which didnt have majority support or even much support at all the forum interface especially with regards to the csm stuff is pretty woeful and should hopefully get a revamp with spacebookcosmos blame ccp for that not usas for the old what has the csm done for us crowd its barely been active for 18 months were only just starting to see the labours of csm 1 come to light its not a case of raising an issue ccp rubber stamping it and then getting it in the next hotfixregardless you should all grow up a bit the amount of nerdrage your are generating over a quasi political advisory group in an internet spaceships game is staggering its like the phantom menace all over againnext thing you know well be having rl assassinations with delegates keeling over left right and centre the victims of snipers poinsoners and bomb makers
woah now i wouldnt go that far imo the goons have just as much right to be in eve as anyone else the fact that they have multiple guaranteed seats on the csm is what troubles me anyways what i would like to see happen is a change in the way csms bring up issues to ccp instead of bringing whatever they feel likei would like to see them given forum tools to set up polls a csm would review all the threads regarding an issue condense and rewrite it into an intelligent and unbiased format and set oneclick voting optionsthose with high vote counts would be allowed to be brought up while blatant self serving issues with nearly zero public support will not be allowed for discussion coughmazzilliucoughthe fact that this thread is actually getting supports should be evident enough hey im just as surprised as you are btw csms should be held accountable for their words and behavior on the forums i cringe when i see an elected csm trolling and behaving badly its shameful it tarnishes the csm credibility and brings upset and negative attitudes towards the whole processtrolling and general asshatery behavior from a csm should warrant closer ccp observation and possible review to dismiss you want to be an official representative of the playerbase start behaving as such
honoure i like the way mazz represents me btw
right here what develdrin wrote is how i feel if the position is going to be treated has a joke then put em all in clown suits so we can at least get a laugh at em when they do the csm panel at the fan fest drive a little car on stage and have the csm reps all bail out of it beeping each others noses and throwing pies at each other
okay now this i can totally support
yes the csm has totally become a laughing stock of eve onlinesupportedlooks like pl has become the new goonswarm heh
i completely agree the csm should be representative of the needs and views of the voters as a avid troll and dedicated voter the fact that some of the csm members dont troll is offensive to my sensibilities politicalmoral beliefs religion and sexuality
oh oh oh please thiswtb picturevideo of vuk lau in a clown suit
id vote for youto op sorry but thats all i have to say on this matter thank you
hey guys ive had the best idea everpay me and ill raise whatever pet issue you want it can even be a really stupid issue or even this oneto make this scam proof i am going to ask to get paid at the rate of one 30 day plex license per assembly hall thread so if i end up going back on my word youall can ban meim going to set the deadline at the 23rd of october for thisbuy a piece of history todayedit i agree with this idea with the amendment that the csm get bathroom breaks and free icecream and brandy is provided on request also ccp need to take the csm out on runs periodically so we dont all get too fat
awesome idea i got this thing i want you to take up with ccp how about having some filter function on the forum so that players that are easily trolled cant respond to a post for say 30 minutes or so giving them enough time to think about the post they read meh who am i fooling some people are too dumb to know they are being trolled and would probably never catch it
you serious id figure youve grown tired of me 
i am so outraged by this csm and its level of corruption because of mazzilliu i put all the data into this graph and as you can see the level of corruption is growing and spiraling out of control in direct relation to how many posts mazzilliu makes in this forum please visit your user settings to reenable imagesit will be so out of control that ccp will no longer be able to control the csm reps they will build mazzilliu a throne room with a niffty gold chair that has massage built in even ccp employees will be forced to bring mazzilliu offerings of pineapples brandy and icecream or face mazzillius wrath i may have to create a totally new thread so we can really get to the bottom of this and get rid of mazzilliu forever or the spiral may continue and engulf all of eve the repercussions of this could cause tens of thousands of people in real life to only give up and down thumbs as answers then because some gangs may think they are throwing gang signs the gangs will cap them in their nerdy asses i for one do not want to get a capped in my nerdy ass so support this now
welcome to a year and a half ago i dont want to upset you but nanos are going to get nerfed 
popularity has absolutely nothing to do with whether an idea is good or good for eve bear in mind it was the playerbase that absolutely insisted to ccp by overwhelming popular support to have can flagging introduced to the game they were warned what would happen but they demanded it so it was introduced and the people that demanded it got blown up in hillariously comic fashion as a direct resultalso if you had the courage of your convictions you wouldnt be posting on a 2 month old alt
if you first realize the purpose of the csm the point becomes fairly mootcsm exists because of pr before the csm any issue unfixed for 35 years is bad ccp now why isnt the csm doing something about this problem bad csmno point doing anything tbh just dont vote for mazz csm voting should be soon
a dude called corstaad ganked me two years ago when i first started playing eve i remember this and if he ever arrived in the same system as me i would dock upyou propose to give him the option to change his name so i dont know when he arrives in system im hardly going to go though the id page of all 100 names in a caldari system before i start mining therename changes are ed not supported
this would be a great addition to poss may i suggest you start a thread about this so it gets the support it deserves

what diversity an orca fits between 77500 m3 and 140951 m3 depending on fit plus 50000 m3 of ore sounds quite a lot like 120km3 to me in order for it to be diverse it has to actually be different
the difference you are harping on about is to be able to haul one general freight container whose volume is 120km3 the orca cannot carry a gfc because its carrying capacity is divided between two cargo holdsim pretty certain that the requests made two years ago specifically requested that the minifreighter was to be able to haul one such container the orca cant therefore the demand for a genuine minifreighter still stands the orca almost does the job but since it doesnt do the job fully the proposal lives on
i agree chrar thats a great idea besides the orca has 80k of basic cargo space with 400k specificly for ships and 50k specificly for ore my suggestion for the skills needed arespaceship command level 5racial industrial level 5also for the cargo 140k  160k of cargo space would be nice finally the cost should be about 60 mil  90 mil so its not too cheap and about a sixth of an orcas cost377000000 isk in amarr
let me ask you somethingwhats the point of carrying 1 freight containerunlike other containers it isnt larger on the insideproofand even if it was the orca is larger then 120000m3 anywaythe only point of gfcs in a freighter is to organize stuff otherwise most freighter holds end up a messif your hold can only take 1 gfc you might as well not use it
who cares i fly a real freighter and i dont touch gfcs theyre worthless for anyone who isnt trying to organize corporate hauling and even then couriers work better carry one gfc is a measure of size and the orca meets that measure if your goal is to haul physical gfcs from one place to anotherwell i suppose i could tell you to fly a real freighter but really id just tell you to find something worthwhile to do with your time nobody hauls gfcs from point a to point b intentionally so the fact that the orca cant is utterly irrelevant it hauls as much stuff as a gfc fits which is the whole point just because people phrased their desires around the assumption of it only having one cargo bay instead of three does not mean that the orca fails at its role of being a small freighter quite the contrary really  it carries significantly more than its proponents asked for
the orca has with lvl440k mUFFFD corp hangar seems you missed that79k mUFFFD cargo bay50k mUFFFD ore hangar400k mUFFFD ships
1 with those skill requirements youve already trained for a freighter pretty much just need advanced spaceship command lvl 1 youve very nearly trained for a transport ship just a couple more days for industry vso for skill requirements youre not getting anything in between a freighter and industrialtransport ship2 you dont set the price ccp doesnt set the price they can set the mineral requirements but the economy sets the price2a your 60  90 mil price tag is what transport ships cost it is not in between freighters and transport ships2b an orcas cost is already about 12  23 the cost of a freighter it is the in between ship you are looking for3 an orca fully fitted has 128km3 of cargo space thats going off the old data on the item database here on the site of basic 30k if the basic cargo space in the game is actually at 80k now that is much moreso even not looking at the corporate hanger and the ore bay youve already hit your target mark for the amount of cargo the orca can carry the orca can also carry a bs or two while were at it so yes the orca is the ship you are looking forand yes theres already the orca is a good argument just like when people try to ask for t2 shuttles and we point out that we have frigates and interceptors when you are asking for a new ship class it needs to fit some sort of nitch or need that we dont already have otherwise you arent asking for diversity but you are asking for murkinesswhat you really are asking for is to reduce the cost and skill training of the orca and maybe give it a bit more cargo space you wont get far just begging to reduce your cost
its called the orca yes the orca is a mining support ship but it also costs half the cost of a freighter so fills the cost gap and hauls the amount of cargo youre talking about its also very good in that role so we dont need another onealso the skill reqs of a freighter over a transport are negligable your suggested cost of 60m is laughable have you looked at the price of transports and freighters
the only real advantage the orca has over a freighter is a the higher warp speedehp is lower as is cargo  understandably however even the align time with expander in low is almost as slow as a freighterwith my skills its a mere 2sec according to eftso if i need to carry 120k what advantage does the orca really have
actually from the stats im reading the orca doesnt have a higher warp speedhowever the orca aligns 23 as slowly as a frieghter so not twice as fast but almost the orca also has a lot less mass the freighter has a lower intertia modifier which helps the align time in comparison to the orca but the lower mass of the orca means it can get up to speed faster the freighters give a bonus to velocity for each level which means it actually takes more time to get up to 75 to warp than at a lower level the orca doesnt have that problemfinally you can fit and rig an orca you cant fit anything to a freighter so you have some more freedom there to fit for faster delivery vs cargo hold size
dretzle please get the facts rightfreighter warp speed 075ausorca warp speed 27aus195aus is a huge difference if you ask meabout the align timemy alt has 385s time to warp with a cargo rigged t1 and cargo expanded t2 orcathe same alt in the freighter has 452s452s385s67s faster alignment dohoh and if you web both of them they are into warp in less than 25s dohteam work rocks btw
please forgive me i dont have the eve client on my current machine so im working off of data only available from the database dump as utilized on eveiversecom which is apparently out of date it showed them both as 1 aus edit i also didnt see the warp speed multiplier stat but even with that i think my orca warp speed is still offthe item database on this site doesnt even have the warp speed listed that i could see but you further helped show the advantages of the orca as a hauleralso i did forget to mention that advanced spaceship command skill gives a bit of an increase to freighter align time that the orca doesnt have which allows the freighter to come more in line with the orca for alignment
still want if the orca is such a great mini freighter then maybe we can make a compromize how about we remove all the mining prereqs i we can do that then we have a solution and everybodys happy actually no i want somehting a bit faster and more agile but im willing to compromize if you are
you arent really crying about less than 30days training time are youbesides it wouldnt make sense the orca is a 2 roles ship and the 2nd role requires the mining part
surewhy stop there i would like to train it when i start the game and for it to be the most agile ship in the gameoh wait those are called frigatesin other words weve already made a compromise its called the orca the compromise is you get what you want with a little wonky skill requirements for your purposes theres a drawback for everything i could go for the largest freighter in the game the charon in one shot by training caldari industrial 5 or i could go for the largest industrial in the game mammoth and itty v but have to cross train to caldari if i wanted the largest freighter i could go straight for a freighter or have to train a bit differently if i really want an medium freighterorcaget a freighter or transport ship otherwise the training difference between an industrial and a freighter isnt huge and between a transport ship and a freighter is teeny
use an orcanow as per the freighter vs orca align time argument an orca aligns faster with base stats but add in advanced spaceship command v and racial freighter 4 and your freighter align nearly as fast as an orca of course when you add in cargo expanders or istabs for align the gap closes very quickly

wootz only one problem some ships only differ because of their unique color as in the domi and sin why did they not add like a few globs of mass around the edges to make it at least seem like they tired ah well sweet idea though
i dont see the problem here as the info is still on your overview and scanner besides whatever engine you got in your car it still looks the same as that one with a weakerstronger enginefor the coloring imagine 33 standard white trucks next to each other can you tell which one is from hauler transports co if they all have an own color scheme like in rl then you could tell which one belongs to which company without even looking at the corp infocoloring would also give ship manufacturers the option to watermark their label on the ships like big fluffy ship productions makes pink thoraxes bzzzzzzzzzz you can repaint them after assembling for an x amount of isk when you let your corp do the paining into the corps default color it would be cheaperas stated before this can be done with just 1 byte network traffic thats only transmitted once for each ship lag what lagimo this would add a system to eve where people can distinct themselves from others which is quite needed if you ask me i support this just like all the other 255 times before this one
i actually came up with a good solution that got a lot of support from the forums but failed to pass the csm council by adding a mere 3 bytes per ship you could have two separate areas with a wide range of colors the texture map would only need to have the color areas separated and could have an unchangeable color as well to prevent the pink or black ships that would result for many playersthe resulting color spectrum is visible via the link below this easy map could be disabled in the escape screen to allow for faster graphic processing for fleet battles and would add very little to lag perhaps the current csm could bring this idea up since theres a different crew this time nudgenudgecolor spectrum
customization could be client side with regular downloads from a seperate server for people with this option turned on which would reduce lag and stress from the main server which would also cause any lag to be client side only obviously having a colour slider would be easy but then you couldnt have thisplease visit your user settings to reenable imagestamber

the biggest problem with war decs completely arbitrary objectivesseriously theres nothing hardwired into the system as a definitvie goal what is the objective of the war what will your corpalliance accept as terms of surrender these concepts are completely void in the current mechanic subject to the whim of hcceodirectors not a good basis for a solid strategy in my experience
this wouldnt be very workable because there is no way to ensure that anything purchased from the orca would actually pass to the seller market transactions delete items from the hangar of the seller and recreate them into the hangar of the buyers in stations to use current code the orca would have to have proprietary hangars for people to access this suggestion opens itself up to large numbers of market exploits the market window would need to indicate that the sellers item is floating in an undetermined point in space on player xs ship the sort of transaction you want is probably something that could be handled on a case by case basis between two players that have a modest level of trust between themi think the direction that is most likely to get a bazaar ship would be some sort of large ship with dock functionality like a station that can never itself dock and somehow possesses proprietary hangar space for other players
oh from your explanation it sounds like their doing a deep copy and then deleting the original  i can see how that would make this difficultjust to be clear the idea here is that ore is purchased by the orcait appears that containers have the concept of owners really a corp i was just thinking about how to extend this to the individual items in the container that would help make this all possiblethe portions of code that defines a target from where a market transaction could occur would have to be modified to include jetcans and the orcas hull i assume it would have to be generalized into an interface imarkettransactionsource imarkettransactiondest or something similiar that would certainly be some significant changessure would make for some interesting capabilities for mining directors though
afaik ownership of specific items is currently handled via what location they are in a location being a hangar assembled container assembled ship whatever only locations have owners individual items do not especially not item stacks which have an id a typeid a stacksize signed 32bit int for whatever reason and a locationid and nothing else afaik this is all the rows that the generic inventory table contains everything else is fetched via typeid as soon as you eg do a showinfoattaching owner info to item stacks would probably either require a seperate ownership table referencing item ids sounds like a hackjob or messing with the heavily normalized and optimized inventory table itself especially the latter sounds like a major cluster and is probably not going to happen for the same reason bpcbpo seperation is currently not happening as mentioned above well one of the reasons anywaythe idea is interesting but i doubt its even remotely feasibleedit for a singleton notpackaged item i assume the item being moved is simply a change of its associated locationid how movement of stacks is done i do not know it should be possible to check wether moving a stack from one place to another changes its itemid if it does its a copy if its not it just had its location changed im not sure how id go about doing this though
you good sir are exactly the sort of person that eve is aimed towards despite all the added mechanical help newbies have been getting more recently the op however is not eve is admittedly a game that kinda requires an older player to take a newbie by the hand and walk him through the early bits for most newbies that is there are exceptions coughinnominatenightmarecough but theyve been trying to work on the new player experience with every expansion i figure you gotta give ccp points for at least trying dominion will add another two tutorial lines lets hope eris does good work on those dalso in case this isnt obvious op not supported
errr nosorry but alot of us had to start from scratch too if they did that then they would have to give everyone those extra skill points toohowever i do agree ccp need to do something for new players active people hasnt gone up for a long time even with the massive advertising but really that would mean changing the whole mechanics of the gamepersonally they need to reward more instead of this feeble bounties etc they want people to play for longer but not much good if they cant even get them to stay in the first placewith all the advertising i dont think ccp want this to be just a niche for the few game anymore so you have change ccpadapt or just stay where you are
the new ones are seriously much much better lookingthe old invuln effect was for instance horrible now it looks very nice
you are right about that but we still mising oval shields ups sorry for reporting by mistake
i posted something like this a couple of years ago on one of the forums and it seemed to get a general nod so i have decided to step up and submit something to the council for their opinion on thisbackgroundi run a multi national multi timezone multi language and multidexterityie some diasabled corp now some of us are very good at typing in english but for the most part there are varying degress of this alot of my members also dont have the benefit of using teamspeak or eve voice et al due to a numebr of factors and reasons we also work in nullsec and lowsec systems this puts a number of my members at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to being attacked as they sometimes find it difficult to communicate quickly what it happenning and where they areso one thing that might be able to work to give an edge is the ability to trigger a distress call to alert corpmatesalliance members or others in the system that you are under attack andor need assistancethe concept  setupa player can customise how their distress call works this can be done at a ship level or a player level still undecided essentially there are three options i have thought of1corp alert2system alert3alliance alertyou also have the option to receive or ignore distress calls based on the three opions above  mechanicsyou are under attack and you want to trigger the distress signal this can take the form of right clicking on your ship and selecting send distress call or a hotkey depending on your preferences and the preferences of others the distress call will be then sent outother players who have opted to receive the signal will get a dialog box on their screen similar to the downtime countdown box informing them of the person who triggered the alert and the system where the alert was triggered the location of where the distress was triggered will be warpable and will display on the pilots overviewbut only for those who have opted to receive the signal in the first place this will allow pilots to move as quickly as possible to their comrades to provide assistanceobviously there are a number of things that need to be reviewed such as whether to expand this feature to include blues on your likes list whether agressors will have this feature as well how to avoid people crying wolf preventing abuse network and bandwidth overheads etc however considering the wide diversity of players that play eve i believe this will be a welcome feature for all players as long as the paramaters and rules of its use are balancedthoughts anyonemj
actually i like this idea most of my corporation also doesnt use ventts  largely due to language barriers my germandanish being terrible  of course sos my english and while we have an advantage of being fairly small and quick to respond to one another in corp chat a popup alert might be a nice addon feature especially when were in a whlowsec running an operationthe details may need to be worked out but i like the ideasupported
i see no harm from this feature
certainly worth thinking about
this would make carebears feel safer in low sec so i want it its a desert out thereits a dangerous option tho as i will cerntainly enable my system to receive distress calls and no i wont be there to help
thats not unlike a modern distress call youve no way of knowing if the person who intercepts it will be coming to help or hurry your destruction alongi can also see if being used by pirate hunters to lay traps so 
indeed however the mechanics could allow you to ignore certain types of distress calls especially if they are not from your own corpalliance but otherwise you could very well be the hero and go and resuce people or get yourself blown up in a trapmj
i agree make the distress call available to everyone someone in an opposing corp or alliance should be able to receive the distress beacon too so you could be painting a target on yourself or you could be calling for helpand the possibility of using it to lay bait and traps would be amazing too especially if people do it right and have two ships pretending to duke it out when others arrive to join in the killing then spring the trap
make sure its off by default we dont need people spamming public ones in jita
this is just my opinion but i think it should broadcast to the entire system rather than a select few its like lighting a flare anyone whos looking can see it and respond
awesome idea  i totally support this  no docking after aggression at least 10min  maybe more  and at least we wont spent ammo on station hugging players 
i support this not so much because of docking games but in light of dominion sov changes where most fleet fights will take place on gatesbut id say doubling the timer is enough
15 minute would be better than dand other thing if someone docked up with global aggression flag would be pay minimum 10 million isk penalty payment to station office except low sec
supported but make it on tranquility this time not sisi
no never again because of what happened during the super cap event and having it on tq is definately not the answer
dear ccp gentle readersone thing that is puzzling me and others whos discussed this in my hearing is why the ship maintenance array sma does not have tabbed storage for ships unlike corp hangers and pos storage bayswhenever you open a heavily loaded corp or allianceused sma eve lags for many seconds up to a minute if your connection is questionable as it loads the ships and their icons if the sma were divided into configurable tabs defaulting to such as general restricted and even corpspecific and limited tabs that would significantly reduce the server access load increase corpalliance security and organization ideally implementing an auditlog of smas would help as well its amazing that containers have such logs but not smasso while doing dominion sov changes why not make smas a configurable category for corporations like other storagediscusskrum
yeah this makes no sense to me maybe ccp is intentionally creating security holes to keep stuff interesting if so this goes into the same bin as anybody with corp research access can cancel any corp industry job  too clever by half supporting this
and while they are changing the sma anyway it could at least be a bit bigger its just to small in size
why is that
i would like to announce my candidacy for csmmy main platform is about looking for the interests of faction war players no matter which side they are on so far csm in regards to faction war has been dominated by people motivated more by their personal agendas than game play interestsi dont promise to pull down the dyspro moon from the heaven and hand it to you symbolically speaking because i dont believe that is even possible as member of csm i also dont claim to have knowledge of 00 pos warfare or sov however what i do know is the faction warfare mechanisms inside out both highsec and lowsec and all the issues which lower fw enjoyment i feel that if ccp is to make corrections to many of the currently flawed mechanisms i am qualified enough to consult on it i am also longterm resident of lowsec space and feel that i can also speak on their behalf whether they are 100 or 50this is what i offer it may not sound much but its something i believe i can deliver instead of making unrealistic promises such as i will remove concord15000 fw players deserve a voice to csm and here is what i would like to fix if i get into csmbugs faction war complexes are riddled with bugs some which lead to game crashing while others deal with timers and npcs inside the faction war complexes these must be fixed so people have more enjoyable experiencenpc disparity npcs defending the plexes need to be adjusted somewhat right now amarr and gallente plexes can easily be speedtanked by a t1 frigate while caldari and matar can rely on missile spawn to discourage anyone staying too close to timer solution here could be some missile armed ship for every faction which makes speed tanking harder but not entirely impossiblemissions people are returning from 00 to farm isk in faction war missions while lowsec is definetely more populated now i dont think ccp had this in mind initially missions need to be scaled back somewhat by removing the option of continuously declining the missionsoccupancy right now occupancy only matters in regards to npc ships inside the complexes i would like to give small benefits to side which holds occupancy some solutions here would be reduced repair costs on stations reduced pos fuel needs and so onplexing reward there still is little reason to actually plex if more lucrative opportunities exist  missions unless you are a diehard plexer provided that bugs regarding plexes can be fixed ccp could try to introduce some nominal rewards such as loyalty points for taking to encourage more small gang fighting over themdamar rocarionbrigadier general
pervs approves this candidate
i have no doubt that behind the smack in local you are a good guy damar who doesnt enjoy a bit of good smack talk however i find it hard to believe that you could be the voice of all four militiasthat said perhaps you could outline your views on the current imbalance between the minmatarcaldari vs galenteamarr plex npcs
why do you think maybe ankh was does one have to go through at least three different militias to qualify like ankh did backstab your former fleeetmates to demonstrate knowledge and experience in all fronts do you honestly think that damar wants to get elected to persue some kind of personal or pro caldari agendaor do you just question his capability and knowledge and not his motives because i am getting a bit of both from your post
first i didnt bring up ankh and i dont really understand why you did unless you think that damar should stand on a im not ankh platform i dont think thats what hes doing but perhaps thats why you will vote for himsecond and to the point all i know about damar comes from the persona he projects in local and his posting on these forums neither of these things lead me to believe that he is able or perhaps willing to act in the best interests of militias other then his owni do however look forward to hearing more from him but it will take more then what hes written in the op to persuade me
as far as i understand current issue with many people is that offensive gallenteamarr plexes can be speedtanked this applies to medium and major plexes if someone has to speed tank a minor plex he is doing something badly wrong it is indeed possible to take a major amarrgallante plex with properly fitted t1 frigate while matarcaldari requires specially fitted tank such as enyoishkur or multiple warp outs which ive seen amarrian inties donow the best solution in my opinion for a fix would be to simply give missiles to all plexes either to npcs many gallente npc ships already shoot defender rockets so why not missiles or having the initial spawn in plexes to be mixture of missile and gun batteries perhaps even a webifier this would also eliminate initial ewar from plexes if ships carrying it would only spawn after timer is started and perhaps urge more people to attack them defender would still receive dps bonus from them of courseand yes killing npcs should be required in all cases for plex to capture which would immediately help in regards to selfrunning timersdamar rocarionbrigadier general ab punisher worked for me in gallente majors while i hear vigil works well enough for amarr but i lack personal experience in conquering amarr plexes so this is hearsay
damar has had the ear of the amarr militia for some time just as we have had his he has proven to have a thorough understanding of what is wrong with the current fw system on all sides of the war as he shares the burning passion that i myself have for this corner of the universe and since i am certain that he can be unbiased when called for he has my vote
sorry having had much interaction with damar through his main and the many alts and his best friends the pervs  this statement is quite frankly not credible his repeated emotional outbursts in local his vociferous real life hatred of his opponents in faction war is out in the open and is quite well known by even causal observersi do not believe he could put his emotions aside to deal with faction warfare as a whole without making sure the interests of his self identified faction was paramount as far as he understands it he does understand and doesnt want to give up faction advantage the problems people have clearly and repeatly expressed which he has dismised are that caldari npcs are overpowered with ecmmissile spam and that this leads to less pvp as people dont want to be perma jammed while fighting that he has any proposal for npc changes is surprising in that a recent thread he started in warfare and tactics he expressed no such need for any npc changes at all it was just so much whining by the gallente faction players  in that thread were many suggestions by numrous people much better than this thrown together idea to to appear that he now supports npc changes that he has never in the pasti strongly suggest that this canidate is not in the best interests of faction warfare as a whole and should not be supported as the fw canidate

all these people supposedly running for lowsec theyre just going to end up splitting the vote which benefits no one really need a primary or tworound voting for this maybe a stv
the only legitimate lowsec candidates are lark and that python guymost people who live in lowsec have more than one account or are members of tight knit groups that will all vote togetherthe lowsec vote isnt that badly splitthe fact so few player give a  about lowsec compared to the innumerable hordes of generic highsec bear candidates is the real issue
that python guy is mejust saying
no you arent
tbh everyone should just vote for alek problem solved
this my platform benefits lots of folks 
added some improvements to bookmark management and probing to my wishlist
im not sure if i can vote for a canadian in good conscience they do odd things to bacon
it is a pain to try and sift thru that mess they call the minutes be so kind as to link the ones where ccp says which upcoming changes are because of the goonie csm members
so much goon hateyoud be surprised to know that certainly this term the goon delegates were actually pretty decent people and a pleasure to work with the goons run internal primaries so they usually put forward good candidates as for who raised what you can always dig through the minutes why should someone else do it for you if youre obviously that concerned or ask the people involved on previous terms
oh mah gawd i just want to know these changes the goon csms are responsible for you want to paint it like the only reason i am asking is because they are goons that is not the case at all if the op wants to wear that statement like a badge then link where ccp says these said changes are because of the goon csmsas they say proof or stfuyou will also be happy to know i would gladly vote for a goon before i voted for you
the op how did you do in the goons internal primary elections
they havent happened yet im running on the assumption that i wont be an official goon candidate as one of our incumbents is running again and so is the guy who narrowly lost last time around thats why im campaigning outside the alliance as well
okay  so begs the question that if you dont think you are going to be a good enough candidate enough inside your own alliance to get officially supported  why should the rest of eve outside of goonswarm think you are good enough for ussorry to sound a bit cynical but thats the downside of being in a big alliance with a readymade voting block to get their candidates in since the goons have 12 walkin candidates anyway why should we give them a 3rd
i do think im a good enough candidate however the reality is that im unlikely to get official goon support that has nothing to do with my platform and everything to do with the fact that my alliance recognises that our incumbents have done a good jobyou arent voting in a 3rd goon candidate youre voting for an independent candidate who happens to be a goon as i said ill represent any playstyle and take forwards any valid issues regardless of my alliance affiliation
a goonhow about no
with respect its easy to say that but the reality is you have chosen to run with a character with a good ticker and youve personally chosen an eve affilitation that is tied directly to the goons you obviously like that culture and enjoy the way the goons do things  can you really break free of all that to be a true independent maybe you can but i hope youll appreciate it takes a massive leap of faith for an actual nongoon to trust you not just to vote the goon party line on any issue that comes upjust as it takes another leap of faith to see nonofficial goon candidates as anything else beyond simple electorial tactics attempting to split and dilute the nongoon voteim personally of the opinion that even 2 goon candidates on the council is too many given the relative size of that alliance and overall number of players in eve  so helping to get a 3rd in is quite a poor decision
there isnt a goon party line if there was then the goon delegates in the previous three csms would have shot down changes to the doomsday and the sov shakeup as two examples off the top of my head because the current mechanics benefit us pretty well the fact remains that they pushed those changes forwards because the csm as a body wants to see the game made better overall and so do ito be honest im not seeing what your issue is here anything that benefits the goon party line by definition would also benefit other entities in the game that are like the goons ie that own 00 space or have large capital fleets or have supercapital construction facilities etc and many of those entities are hostile to us off the top of my head i cant think of any changes that could be made to the game as a whole that would solely benefit goons and not also help out people like atlas tri sysk etcheres the thing in my professional life i often had to push issues that were opposite to my own interests as a player in war and daoc i played the game and fought on a particular side and yet i was able to see the validity of issues that the other sides in those games had i pushed them all forwards regardless of my personal affiliation because the end result was a better game thats exactly what will happen here
you cant be serious rightfirst of all your a goonie so naturally by default everyone is cautious to vote for you because of your ties and dont give me that what do you mean crap because in all games that goonies play the idea is to ruin everyones funsecond of all you are running around saying that the goonie csms are the ones responsible for many of the upcoming changes that is coming out in the next expansion really where does it say that i have asked repeatedly for you to link where these information is but you still wont do it no one will i have looked myself and there is no evidence at all from ccp that says anything like thisthirdly you are also saying that darious told the csms to tell ccp to fix 00 and titans tell captain obvious darious that these things have been told to ccp for a long time nowso please link me where ccp says here is the changes that the goonie csms had us do
i lolled hard over your totally unbiased post
right because ccp will obviously tolerate the csm being used as a griefing tool also generalisations are fun and always correct all of the timeyoure looking for the wrong thing ccp wont say goons pushed for this omber zombie made us do that etc the information youll find is in the meeting minutes a couple of minutes with the ctrlf shortcut will show you what the goon members or any member you happen to be interested in pushed for and discussed this is all public information alternatively you can ask other csm delegates what their experiences of the goon candidates were bunyip and larkonis have already stated their views in this thread as an example
its fair to factor in his alliance to your decision making  after all it is a decision he has made as to who he is going to associate with in gameon the other hand though having known him for quite a while and recently interviewed him for eve tribune im confident he will present a fair view and work for the benefit of eve as a whole
indeed thanks to zarch for the interview which you can read here
no but being dishonest about his statements just means people who feel the same way as he does will not match him while people who feel differently will so while he will gain matches with differentthinking players he will lose a supposedly equal amount of matches with like minded players a drawthis system isnt about testing someones competency in ingame related matters its just a way to chart their position on the evepolitical spectrum and match them with people who feel the same way
great work this is really useful and if used by all candidates this would greatly help me make a choice if some candidates are not bothered to use tools like this or at least post a good resume on the forum i am probably not going to end up voting for them please note that initiative such as this is noted as well and i am more likely to vote for an active csm candidate that puts effort into his campaign into clearly stating his views rather then for someone who does not take this proses seriously
updatewebsite moved to the correct host new address is now
its always surprised me that ccp themselves did not come up with a similar system great work this you need a few exposure mechanisms though since the big bulk of voters rarely pokes their heads outside their internal forums and the eve forum carries limited exposure options in threads outside of the csm and cp sections really if all candidates stick their heads in this webapp and the exposure is slapped in the face so to speak regular isd articles  in game advert on login  magic sigs for people to use to show their preference  stuf like that then perhaps it is possible to make the voting patterns a little bit less like this is our guy yall vote for him he tells us what to plan for screw nda
moved to  jita park speakers corner 
this guy isnt that bad this sorta people make eve what it is its about balance between this and order half of the attacks on the op are not reasonablenot voting for you because i have another candidate in mindand btw all the talk about good an evil is kinda lame
maybe because they brought up some issues and ccp laughed at them and they dont want that to be made public
youve been asked several times to mail them to me since im now part of the csm when is that going to happenissler
i am confused if your post is suppose to be ironic and its a joke ro you are actually serious i used to run missions alot that never happened to meanyway you do not get my vote
csm is not perfect but it does work now if more people would be bothered to vote for the correct candidates that would greatly improve the situation why do i think it works because the issue i proposed for underpowered destroyers made it through csm does not have to reply to the post they might well just have a look at it discuss it then discuss it with ccp and see what ccp thinks now if csm would make us aware of such doings that would greatly improve players opinion of it and there reputation but thats a different ussue if you look at the wiki there is a list of all issues votes denied proposals so on
you have all my votesyou won me through your fountain of charisma
not that i dont appreciate your situation but i wont be voting for you because you got caught
unfortunately gents i wont be allowed to run this term as ccp have deemed it too soon much like making jokes about a recently deceased irish pop staron that note ill share this little gem i recieved todaywhats pink and goes round in circlesstephen gatelys suitcaseill get my coat
really too soonmore like pwnedyou cheated you got caught you got pwned
please change your name to terrible troll
you never mentioned this whole scandal to me larkonisplease change your name to liaronis trassler
you got a couple good points even despite your bad reputation i will take you into consideration and compare to other candidates
what did you think was going to happenyou broke the nda and now run around talking about it like its a badge of honor i mean look at your sig you cheatedlet me say it again to emphasizeyou c h e a t e dseriously lol at you trying to run for csm again
they better let istvaan in this time or i wont have anyone to vote for
funny thing is i was told i wasnt b4lyfe its quite understandable though not being allowed to run this time around the outrage from people such as yourself when elected again would probably have made the forums explode costing ccp millions in new servers and bandwidth charges ive been told to wait a while until the heat dies downas for the sig well youre the only person whos complained so far i think its quite clever and considering shigsy had to carve it onto a potato before scanning it too they dont have paper in irelandat least i can have a laugh about my shortcomings and failures i fouled up i apologised i moved on water under the bridge broski i did actually have some great plans for improving how the csm operates and giving more power to the people but then again nothing will ever please pretentious dullards such as yourself in other threads you seem to have tarred all goons with the same brush despite everyone providing evidence to the contrary you strike me as a very bitter person or a very good troll perhaps a lady friend would ease your troubles theres more to life than nerdraging on eveo because tri didnt get a representative in last term your alt maybe and cavorting with madam palm and her five lovely daughters while watching some japanimation or whatever the hell they call it these days
excellent judgement call by ccp to be perfectly honest you should be banned from ever running again nda
yes you can find the minutes from every meeting into related thread
im keeping this list here i will make wikis later
soo when are you crackers gonna ask ccp to fix rockets
we did this like 2 months agoand ccp agreed theyd look at rockets again 
it occurs to me that csm is like a student unioni dont know if it is does already but perhaps if it conducted itself in more a union like manner it might be able to affect changedo csm members have roles or postings to act as channels for different issuesa carebear officer 00 fw industrial etcbut how is it organised already
dont think of it as a congress or council it is an elected focus groupwhy should you care about how it gets organizedbecause this focus group is going to be the go to focus group outside of ccps devs and testersif you want a carebear officer vote for a person that sounds like they will push that point of viewcsm should be less about agendas and more about background and even then it requires a delicate balance between diversity and proportional representationfor example lets say that eve had exactly 5 different types of players types a through e as make up 50 of the population bs 20 cs 15 ds 15 and es 10 do as deserve 50 of the csm seats what if there are only 5 csm seats i know there are more should 25 of them be filled by a type playersthis would probably lead to a panel of a a b c d leaving e players entirely unrepresented in this focus groupunfortunately we each just get one vote instead of being able to say i think x y z and w would make for a diverse set of delegates we can only say i want t to be in csm
an elected focus group well that doesnt sound very interestingi was spitballing those role ideas but the idea behind the roles would be to provide channels between players and ccp
i would like to nominate king leopold ii of belgium seems like the kinda leadership eve needs
i updated the op and second post with some links to updated wiki pages about the csm read it or die
keeping this near the top given ccp have been put off the ab bonus thing by all the whiners

signedwant dust to pc now
pc wtf
i agree not because im particularly looking forward to dust but because i think it will fail as a console exclusive and because of how it will tie in on eve its failure will have a negative impact on all of uslets face it the console market is saturated with fps titles and dust wont offer anything different from more established titles to anyone other than eve gamers console games are expensive usually almost twice the price you can get the same title on pc for that means console gamers are not going to buy 2 fps games when they both seemingly offer the same thing is dust really going to overhaul halo for the mainstream xbox market because if its not better than halo no one will play itsince it will tie in closely with eve a lack of players for dust will mean one of two things either the entire mechanic will fail which would be disatrous for eve or more likely some large alliance we all know the most likely candidate will realise there is a small player base and order all their members to play dust and theyll exploit the low player base in dust to gain a huge advantage in eve you could argue that thats the way its intended to be but it seems a little unfair that somethign that is not available to all players can have such an impactif dust was on pc and ran on an engine that was useable by the majority of eve players the source engine still looks good and is very scaleable and was available at a reasonable price point i reckon most eve players would buy it it still needs to be a good game in order to get people playing which as i said is vital to the games success and also to the success of the new mechanics in eve perhaps ccp are just planning to release it as a console exclusive initially then a few months down the line if player numbers arent what they need to be they can port it to pc and release it free to all eve subscribers a man can dream cant he
i came up with this concept although a bit different a long time ago imho we should be able to train the livestock human trade goods in an academy to work in our ships it might require a pos module to do or it could be available at most academy stations or suchthe basic idea is that the crew goes through a series of steps and some of these steps can add to the rp value for instance slavers can be taken off of vitoc or others can be given vitoc depending on which side of the amarrminmatar war youre ononce the recruits graduate which you would have to pay for their education and wait for their education to be completed you can equip them in new crew slots frigates wouldnt have any crew slots destroyers 1 cruisers 2 bcs 4 bs 6 capital 10 for example once put into place they add a 1 bonus to that specific area theyre trained in guns shields speed etcover time these crews gain education in their field allowing their bonus to increase up to 3 the crews can be unequipped and sold giving a new market area for trained crew obviously youd have to be doing what the crew specializes in activating a module of the type that corresponds to the crew  gunnersguns scientistsscanning engineersshields amount repaired etcsince frigates dont have crew slots the new players can ease themselves into the idea a tutorial might open up as soon as you switch ships into your first crewready ship to walk you through how it worksthis method accomplishes many goals without many hinderances outside of the coding requirements makes livestock trade goods valuable and you might have to feed the crew as well with other trade goods brings a new development to ship customization eases new players into the game without overwhelming them introduces a timebased element and isk sink opens up a new market segment for players to specialize in
i have something similar on a website for our corp over a year old myself i agree with many of the points raised in this crews would be a great way to do a lot with leadershipsocialcorporate management skills and make charisma a slightly more relevant skill it lets the livestock section of trade goods suddenly become importanti believe that new slots other than rigs should be available and that the maintenance of crews be implemented into already existing aspects of eve as much as possible a simple pantry bay to put foodstuffs spirits and antibiotics among others would suffice with the amount of material being used out of it dependent on the number of crew slots filled by the playeri think that the observation that this helps missioners more than pvp is relevant but you have to pay these crews something so how about this rather than a drawback like rigs give crews take a percentage of bounties and mission rewards equal to the percentage bonus that they give its not crippling and in the event that many different bonuses are given by different crew components an average is used this means particularly evil micromanagers will keep the crack squads for their weapons rooms or whatever and rotate greenhorns out as soon as theyre trained in order to keep the bonuses low theres a potential for pilots swapping to uncrewed ships for mission completions but the bounties themselves would be skimmed for crew performancei like this for a lot of reasons and i think that eventually it will happen whether ccp is interested in it or not right now
i dont care who said it that theres funny right there

ill support this surebut i am concerned that some players may spam the thumbs updown option to artificially impact the threads relevanceit would be nice if each account was only allowed one supportunsupport per thread
shameless bump
i agree with the sentiment but its not the system at fault its the players who arent using it to begin with that arewith only 10 voter turnout to date theres plenty of scope for you to make some friends of your own and vote for somebody else you like insteadben
the only motivation behind calling out an alt is to tailor personal attacks against them i deprive you of this ammunitionand i find it a little humorous that most of the attacks in this thread stem from sniggerdly and pl you guys mad
we are v mad because our grand plan to sieze control of the csm has been foiled by this very thread
posting legion the posts made by pl are probably as genuine as those made by the opridiculously genuine also hubriss graph is the best the mazzilliu throne room will be my next csm proposal
mazzilliu you do understand your incessant trolling makes the csms as a whole look bad right in all seriousness are you deliberately trying to tarnish the csms already battered public reputation if so it just further reinforces the need for reform
its ok i have hired an entire legion of poasting mercenaries to whitewash my legacy so history will remember me as the best csm to ever walk this space video gameand also a girl in real lifethe best girlas for you you should probably rum for csm and then raise this issue and disband it from the inside a self destructing csm would be pretty funny
thing is shes doing it on the assembly hall we already know the dirty truth can the opinion people here have of the csm really get any worse
first i can never run for csm as i am on active dutysecond the purpose of this thread is not to destroy the csm to the contrary the intended purpose of this thread is to bring reform with checks and balances so black sheep incidents like you and larkonis never happen againdoubtful imo i can only wonder whats going through the heads of the other csms one thing is for sure if she really intends to run again for csm 4 shes got a whole lot of explaining to do this thread isnt going away anytime soon
i dont think the opinion of the csm in the assembly hall was ever positive everywhere elseingame within corps average eve players like joe the pirate members of real evemarica people seem a bit more chill about it but on eveo even innocuous posts about the csm itself attract whining about the csm like flies to poop as such i am trying to decide whether my fall campaign should be sarah palin themed or obama themed again and which will generate more whiningin before it was all fine before mazz ruined everything posts
i can see where it would be easy particularly after some of the csm 3 actions to become cynical about the csm process that said i think the solution lies in greater player participationmore and better candidatesholding ccp and the csm accountable for their actions or inactiongetting the word out in game to all the players that arent in big alliances or associated with the 00 end game that they need to find a candidate to supporti dont have any connections to big alliances or 00 politics and represented just those players i just suggested should rally to become involved i was elected to csm 2 and got nearly 1000 votes in the last election despite rl time conflicts that prevented any real effort for election to csm 3 and thanks to lark got to be in the csm 3 anyways so one thing i posted repeatedly last election was to really look at who you were voting for i hope that the importance of that suggestions is now particularly clear in at least two cases folks were elected that made it pretty clear that taking the job seriously wasnt really their focus and you know what they acted pretty much like they promisedso please consider being part of the solution to fix the problems you see in the csm participate run or challenge candidates that have shown a lack of character or that have made the primary focus of their campaign the ownership of mammary glandsand get other people to do the samethe csm is only as good as you choose to make it im going to give this a thumb not so much to throw out the current process but as a call to action for all the pilots of eve to join in making the csm betterissler
you did ruin everything eve is a much worse place to live after the short reign of mazzulliu just yesterday i heard a little caldari boy quote mazzilliu killed my mumma puppa brudahs and those other things she stolez my c4ndi too so i asked the little boy why she did those things mazzilliu is da debbil the pur3 eveel that be sh3 makes justece dead coldthere we have it people the devil the tyrant the witch  mazzilliu on other news mazzillius reign of terror and suppression is over crowd roarsanyway im for disbanding csm i would like to disband csm because ccp is not correct 100 of the time and this is one of those times just look at certificates lmfao i would also like to see csm disbanded because its a clear separation of the classes and we cant have that it would lead to possible discrimination for example  mazz is one of those council of sin management delegates or was i will never associate with that csmeryeah i believe im drunk but hey you have to put up with it yarr
what he said
your character dirty wizard has a long posting history in assembly hall are you seriously saying you made a specific alt to post here while protecting your mains identity afraid of political assassinationsthe problem isnt with the csm its with you taking ingame internet spaceship politics way too seriously whether you like it or not being flown out to iceland every now and then is a perk of being elected to what is a time consuming and volountary position theres no actual need for ccp to do this its offered as an incentive to standpersonally i suspect your motives and your behaviour it seems too much of a coincidence youve singled out goons and pl for reform while trying to hide who you actually are behind an alt created specifically for this very purpose the only motivation behind using an alt is to mask your own alliance based political affiliations
waaaaaaaa why is the csm not giving me the respect i deserve waaaaaaathis thread owns
bring more man just cry on ventrillo dpl turning on so ridiculous
im all for this but i see some problems right off the bat the first is the method of accountability or rather the lack thereof once a csm gets their foot in the door thats that there is no mechanic for dealing with unruly and misbehaving csms other than breaking hard and fast nda rules there is no trigger that throws out these bad apples no vote to dismiss no impeach process no behavioral review panel nothingif anything this thread is the closest thing weve got to such a mechanism kinda sad if one really takes it all in but it illustrates the point we need such a tool so these incidents are prevented or dealt with in the futurethe second problem is that the csm is mostly a forum thing issues are here discussion is here voting is here however we dont see any of this ingame were almost talking about two separate universes plural universi the eve forums and the eve gamemost players ingame are only vaguely aware of the forums existence let alone what a csm is the forums seem to be looked upon as an outlet for trolls and hatemongers to spew their vitriol its hard to dispute that sometimes in full honesty i do not want to draw the attention of the ingame playerbase to the csm not in its current state just look at what theyll see here in assembly hallif the csm is to garner any sort of greater player awareness tools and mechanisms will have to be introduced into the game spreading the csms existence by word of mouth simply isnt enough
top that off with the fact that there pathetic excuse of well run for csm then if you dont like it is no longer validbased on the fact that only there stupid excuse of a posse would practicually garuentee the said idiot getting reelectedas ive said i might be able to make it past the front door but then id be rendered useless every time i shot down an idiot csm because id be out gunned and out numberedi get that we dont know everything thats going oni get that there is more to the csm than we knowbut that will not excuse the fact that the flagrant behavior on these forums in total lack of respect and trolling by csm itself with there posse gangs making these boards turn into the coad or worse yet the cp would effectively make it a total waste of time to bother running for csmas i would only be a drop in the perverse pond of foolishness even with ripples wouldnt do much to change the situationonly ccp would be able to slap them aroundeven with people who don entirely like me have already indicated to me they would vote for me i havent figure out whether they are joking or if there seriousand as ive indicated before im not convinced it would amount to a hill of beans when you got that  points at mazz going on and embarrassing the entire goal and image of csm itselfthe whole purpose of the csm is no longer valid all i see the csm doing is ignoring the bulk of us sitting there twiddling there thumbs and keeping quite ex members reputable or not are doing more work than the current term and even they are apparently embarrassedmaybe i should start dragging people in here but then they would have no bloody idea what was going on because only less than 10 even give a damnand in the end they would conclude that participating is nothing short a waste of time short of discussing ideasmaybe its time i move to features and ideas because im growing tired of the foul stench that floods these boards and i can assure you its not coming from dare i say my party of participationthere is literally no more point to assembly hall itself or jita park if the csm is in its current form is free to do as they pleasewhy bother discussing and pushing issues if they are likely to ignore you and do there own thingthat alone should make everyone with half a brain rather mad
far from it i think im getting used to you thus i now understand better how you think youve grown on meanyho due to recent events im considering wether this might not be such a bad idea after all
o7 well need to chat in game some time
i cant support this thread because you are growing on me too drake i may not agree with some of the specifics you lay down in terms of fixes and tweaks and at times i feel like you shoot down ideas that you feel frivolous but might be fun but i know that you love this game i have a feeling that you would do everything in your power to improve the game to the best of your abilitythat being said you dont choose the fights you can win you fight the fights that need fighting
it is one thing to disagree with someone with a valid reasonits an another to do so like a child and trollinsultmockignorestupidly go forth like a moronyes im agressive that way but i tend to respect peoples positionfor example i have nothing personal agianst mazz or lark i do take insult however with the spitting they have done on the very idea of what csm is and when they come walking in here with the holier than thou atitude with a track record that shows nothing but trash for what they have to prove for it thats an entirely different issuelark violated a real life contractual agreement called a nondisclosure agreement usually at least in my knowledge that results in getting suedfinedcharged criminally for causing damage to a working business hes damn lucky what ccp did was all they did they where well within there right to let him have it with everything they gottake the time to read the legalese and youd be surprised ndas are no laughing matter and he took it lightly obviouslymazz miss i gots boobs and tons of alts with the entirety of the pandemic legion whom i referr to as the neogoonswarm now goes forth in the guise of working for the better of eve and then pushes a very suspicous we need longer terms proposal and at 3 to 133200 obviously a hell of a lot more than 3 it gets passed by csm without hesitation or consideration of public opinion and then pushed on to ccp whom i hope will likely shoot it down for the obvious lack of common sense but even then we dont know as ccp tends to keep to itselfthe point is not a matter of what the csm does or how its who they representthey excuse there actions for then run for office when in fact they know that very little to no participation in the game population will result in changing the status quoso whose the fool now that would be us the overall public at the mercy of a bunch of egotistical asshatsthat i wager is far worse than what ever i could come up witham i mad yes i voted i payed for this game i plan to use what was given to me to my fullest extent including my expressing an opinionthe csm has great potential but there must be some changes to how they do business or it should be terminated immediately
im curious to see which csms have the moral fiber to bring this issue to the next upcoming meetingcsm 3 meeting 10  sunday october 25th 1600granted its not a week old but the very nature of this thread and the recent misbehavior of a csm member warrants an exception to ignore or delay this issue will only cause greater resentment towards the csm process
i agree their operational processes and practices need revamped that wont stop idiots from acting like idiots though true colors always shine through whatever their root cause lack of maturity inexperience or just not giving a  before you throw the baby out with the bathwater keep in mind that the worst behavior weve seen from csm delegates has come from a tiny minority of their members the vast majority have conducted themselves admirablyat least as far as we can tell from their behavior on the forums here and in meeting chat logs got to give credit where its duedisagree with you on that one hence no thumbs up from me for your idea as a whole one thing that would mitigate asshattery would be for ccp to give players the ability to impeach a csm candidate who acted like a total  related to that the whole csm process needs more participation ie voting competing for seats and participating in the csm forums from the playerbaseideas for which ive been internally brainstorming about quite a bit recently
in response to the termination statement yes that was a bit extreme but you got one major question here what is the point if there is no check sum system why bother at all if this is all we are going to getto implement a checksum requires an unbiased if you wana call it that party unfortunately that means ccp whom moderates anyway im not so sure if they would even go that farat that rate ccp is better off having a dedicated team to sit here on the forums and just chat things up not likely to happen hell the csm will never go away at this ratedont mean we all cant make a ruckus about it but you do have valid points nonetheless
i petitioned this and asked all the relevant people and it wont get me banned or anything i am certified legitfor the cost of one 30 day plex i will raise any issue in the assembly hall for you it can even be a really stupid issue ill write up a wiki about it bring it to a meeting and everythingim charging plex since you cant scam with gametime and it seems like a pretty fair price for anyone to be able to make their mark on eve foreverso hurry up and get it the threads have to already exist since the next meeting is so soon the deadline for purchasing your influence is october 24thedit you can also have me leave your name in the csm issuethis issue was brought to you by xxxx or remain annonymous your choice
except that you can with plex as its an in game item and the devs have already said that scams involving plex are within the rules its only gtcs youre not allowed to scam withnice try though
clearly this is what we want from our representatives its nice to see that the csm can act like real politicians from time to timeedit some csm members i should say there are and have been a few that arent on personal powertrips again strangely like real life politicians
i just might end up charging an entire gtc then depending on whatever petition answer comes back as to whether i can do this or notdont be silly im nothing like those dishonest rl scumbags im an honest hardwokring american a politician you would want to have a beer with a politician you would trust your family withanyways real life politicians dont put their prices upfront im more honest like thatsupporting myself in this threadlike any honest hardworking real american would
and yet another cpsponsored csm living up to his full potentialand you expect ccp and the rest of the community to take you seriouslyraising issues for which your real concern is whether or not the price for the gtc was worth itin a way im glad cp keeps electing these frivolous csms because it just means they have no real representation in the csm
her actually didnt you know that mazz is a really hot girl
ah so the true utter depravity comes out of the csmhow nice to see them lowering themselves to an all new lowhow pathetic can you get
just one more reason why csm term limits are an excellent idea so scumbags like mazzilliu dont return just because you are a girl playing an internet spaceships game doesnt mean you deserve any kind of special treatment
supporting this
brilliant if only because of the amount of hate it will garner from othersi think i need to send you a plex very soon
and the lord said let there be tears and then there was tears
lets all send gtcs to have this guy support the dead horse pos and make him list this petition brought to you by name name name        maybe then ccp will listen to us ps will send tonight
funny thing im pretty sure you can scam with gtcs too unless you trade via the secure mechanism which only allows cash for time transactions gtc scamming is legit too the only actual unscammable transaction is character trades and even then that only applies to characterforisk trades saying you wont scam is fine  i might even be crazy enough to believe it as the old saying goes an honest politician is one that stays bought but saying you cant scam is just wrong and for what its worth i think that this is stupid as well csms scamming unrelated thingssay tourney slots im cool with unlike a lot of people but id think that youd try to hold yourself to a bit higher a standard on actual csm business
finally a politician willing to be totally transparent about true politics and to bring it into the public domainwe should all celebrate mazzilliu for finally bringing this forward1 support
damn youre dumb mazz is the plsotpets candidate i hope now you can see why you should biomass yourself
oh damn i forgot to support
and with this ccp and other csms should immediately realize that any issue brought up by mazzilliu as a csm is highly suspect and not a true representation of the eve community as a wholemazzilliu its nice to see that as a csm you are genuinely interested and concerned in improving eve by bringing up issues that matter this isnt a waste of time at all good job keep it up
how about you actually do your job properly in the csm and make positive changes and youre not hot dont believe these nerds that jerk off to victoria secret magazines
i find mazz incredibly erotic fyiin fact i even laminated her picture 33 baby
oh i think we have a new winner
just so i know for your next termhow much isk would your seat at the csmccp meeting cost me flighthotelmealswhatever else they provide you included in that
dont be knocking shigsys campaign sig he made for meground floor in a mazz troll thread i cant believe people are still biting its pretty outrageous how stupid and easily trolled you all are in some ways i am glad im not allowed to run and hence get elected this term you people are the biggest bunch of pretentious dullards ive ever seen i think its time to apply larks law to the eveo community now it goes something like thisim larkonis trassler signing off good night
larkonce again your missing the point much like you breaking an ndaits not about the fact everyone in your opinion is falling for a trollits the fact mazz is trollingposting  in the first place is the problemyoud think the csm would care about how or who they represent as opposed to inflating ones epeen
its not like a csm would actually attempt to do something as stupid as the op oh wai
i personally think that the people who mazz represents are having a good laugh right now if you dont like it then run this term or rally more support to make sure horrible people like myself and mazz are never elected to the csm again if you and your peers werent such a bunch of pretentious reactionist and easily trolled dullards youd probably see that the whole process is otherwise going along quite smoothly
im wondering two thingsa if this thread is such an obvious troll why hasnt it been locked yetb if mazz is such an obvious troll why hasnt she been banned for itselfedit i have a theory but i like my posting rights enough that ill refrain from sharing it
this thread is boring lark deepthroats mazzs anal beads
so what your saying that its perfectly acceptable to make the csm as a csm look like a bunch of idiots waving epeens around at the expense of othersthank you for that revealing bit of insight
oh let it rip deif mazz can get away with that kind of  you got perfect grounds for contradicting moderation
id rather be deepthroating yours maddog but you never post anymore so the actions of one member reflect upon the whole council do they i would have thought everyone playing this game was compos mentis enough to realise that everyone on the csm is an individual and not part of a mive hind i suppose then because i engaged in some insider trading it means all the members of the council are actually lets not go therethanks for that revealing bit of insight into your mind drakeedit snipe i know youre not supposed to edit them in but i forgot to first time around so its ok
again you missed the pointthe csm is a council a member of the council represents the csm as a whole to the body of playersif you cant handle that you have no business being there in the first placeif one breaks an nda or one starts making a mockery it starts to give the impression to everyone else that your a bunch of asshatsand until such time you start to reflect otherwise its going to stickpolitics 101  guilty by associationshrug it off all you want this is what started the anticsm mob back in the days and now its stronger than everfurthermore the csms inaction in light of this either confirms or denies said issue
what makes it worse is that none of the supposed decent members bother to distance themselves from that sort of behavior which to me indicates that they either dont care in which case why should i be convinced they care about anything else or that they condone it which makes them no better than the public asshats  just better at hiding it either way their silence on the subject only serves to exacerbate the perception that the entire csm is a joke and should be deleted at the earliest oppourtunity id rather have no player input than ty player input filtered through a bunch of witsedit i can spell  no really i are edumacated
exactly eve online may be a game but when your tasked with the job of molding that game its not supposed to be treated like a game or a jokethe trouble with politicians is they end up being in it for themselves and dont give a  about anyone elsewhich is why ive started asking the question what the heck is the point of assembly hall and jita park if all we are going to do is see csm ignore us entirely and do as they pleaseif thats the case shut the damn thing down and we can get on with our lives
and your vocalness on the subject only serves to exacerbate the perception that the eve community or at least in this forum are a bunch of mouth breathing reactionist cretins with a flare for the dramatic
in full honesty if i were in the shoes of the other csms i would remain publicly silent about this as well the last thing we need is for the csm body to engage in a civil war on the forumstake note this is no longer a minor incident or simple harmless trolling this has become a real and genuine fracture of the csm process i doubt well see any public action from the other csms or ccp anytime soon but i bet theyre discussing it right now behind closed doorsand i have no doubt that once this issue is dealt with by ccp mazz will reemerge and claim the whole thing was all just an act and on purpose to help promote the need for csm reform
as if you couldnt lower the standard any furtherso is there a clause for bringing the csm into disrepute
so it is just like real politics thanks for the confirmation
wrong respectfully mind youthe csm being silent is the worst thing they can doall they need to do is step up and clearly and simply say they do not agree nor condone mazz or lark or anyone elses actions for that matter and apologize or at least attempt to come to some sort of level playing field for the community at bestfor them to be silent is to keep people guessing and we all know where that goesi always tell me members if you make me guess i always choose the worst possible guessso dont make me guess because thats the wrong conclusionthe silence or further encouraging of these stupid little games only makes them look even more guilty than before
i think the op pretty much confirms that the csm is a complete joke managed by clowns
anyone that is willing to spend the money for a plex or a gtc to have a subject brought to light by a csm will probably make sure that the topic is worth the money well at least i would hope so as for it being a scam it very well may be but as with all of eve that is the chance the customer takesi sense a fairly dramtic post here myself slade
i hate to break it to you but lark isnt a csm delegateall they need to do is apologize every time a random eve player does something that somebody else doesnt like are you even thinking before you click the poast buttan
he was csm and resigned it was the resignation and circumstances surrounding it to which drake was referring try and keep up with the scandals
what mazz is doing here is offer a service or something like that for eve players anyone can post a thread on assembly hall you dont get the attention you wanted well build your efame like mazz did and you will get the attention you want
what do you call a female who sells themselves to perform a service
prostitute and whre are not gender specific terms
politician
hate to break it to you but you should learn to read before you click that poast button as you call itlark was csm and certainly shows an air of currently on csm even if not officially and anyone with the sense to read would know thatas for the statement about the csm thats just a suggestion at bestthe point is silence is the worst possible move they could make now even if they where putting on a show of support it would at least be something positive or negativeeven i know no matter of words would make up for it as its way to late but sitting there on there hands and not doing anything is still a very bad move
first to lark if you can call any member of the csm a politician then who exactly do you think they represent even a president who gets elected by a margin of 1 still represents the other 49 who voted against him this holds true to any politicianmazz is not only representing those that voted for him but the scores of others who didnt i have to agree with drake on this in that when you are helping to mold a game that we all pay for mind you it affects other people playing that game and thus a certain amount of decorum must be maintainedthis action is reprehensible because he should be bringing up concerns of the playerbase anyway what the hell else is his job other than to bring up ways to improve the game from the playerbasei fail to see this as anything but a slap in the face from a person who is supposed to be helping make our game world a more fun place to beone man acting alone is one thing and can possibly be shrugged off as a stunt or a joke or god forbid an actuality but what if a time comes where the only way to get input to the csm is to pay one of them off with a plex why should we trust them based upon that why should ccp listen to them and why should ccp listen to mazz right now if he is willing to do this
dear all the angry posters in this threadyou complete me3
in before welcome to eve
welcome to eve
confirming that anybody who posts like a longwinded psuedointelligent douchebag on the assembly hall is being mindcontrolled by the council to promote their secret agenda to destroy drake
shows some character legal or not joke or not the suggestion is appalling
well she has no obligation to raise an issue that someone tells her to so this makes sense
supported
i assume people are doing this behind closed doors anyways so why not make it public
this thread belongs in the sell orders or jita park speakers forum respectfully request that a moderator move it
qualitywise you could also move it to caod 
every morning is a kawaii morning with mazillooh in the csm supporting this for future mornings
god i love this game sometimes
supporting this coz im down with the clown
funny part is that rl politics work exactly the same although the public doesnt realize thisthen again ccp will filter out the really stupid issues anyway iirc they will filter out 90 of the issues anyway
one individuals purchased issue on the table means one less relevant issue supported by the playerbasedemocracy at its finest oh wait
as some might know ccp is lowering the skill requirements for exploration by large margin pretty much making anyone able to quickly skill up
not sure about the civilian modules but its no longer a profession if everyone can do ita real kick in the nuts ccp
your solution doesnt allow ccp to do their intended thing the tutorials arent a reason to do the change and tutorial modules have been in the game for a long time already so suggesting tutorial modules is obsolete and doesnt address the issuetheir intention is to make them actual professions you know just like mining missioning and manufacturing that means new players must be able to start doing it very quickly and progress with it as their skills grow they shouldnt be able to do everything but low entry barriers havent hurt any of the other professionsas you can see it isnt like being able to get into a hulk it is like being able to fit miners on your frigate and start scraping an income out of it or flying with your corp on level 4 missions and helping to kill the frigates target paint the primary salvage and do some looting these things are already in the game and are encouraged so why is this such a problem with your chosen profession
you train lvl 1 arcaheologyhacking and you have access to most of the content and level 2 takes what an hour 3 less than a day how long for a hulk again you cant apply the same methodology because it doesnt have the same scalability
nope i support ccp in attacking the exploration community it seems a logical step in creating chaos and therefore i must not support this thread
i guess it seems like neccessary to dumb eve enough so it reach levels more accessible to poor development performance but i cant support this approach
dude they can start exploration witn noobship and on board scanner and can go from there
the part about civilian modules was aimed as a wider solution to the coming skill req nerf of hackingarcheology and such however ive changed the proposal to better reflect what im really seeking with the proposal
just because its easier to get too doesnt mean the current mechanics would end up being the best zone to be in for those exploration skillsi dont think its an issue veteran players such as our selves would have an edge on them anyway
i do not think that making the basic requirements for scanning is a bad thing however i would very much like to see more depth in the scanning profession
so the proposal is to make exploration a longer skill tree with lower entry requirements i like this not sure if itll work out to be a reasonable balance when you create the actual skills but its the right approach
i am all for a richer astrometrics skill tree
ccp is using the exploration profession as a way of dynamically adding content to eve and will probably be the most important tool used in the upgrading of 00 solar systems in dominion it must be more accessible as more people will be using it you cant increase the difficulty in finding sites or lower bonuses that is the opposite of accessiblefor more depth how about adding a skill that allows you to identify a site at weaker signal strengths each site type gravimetric unknown etc would have its own skill professional probers would find the sites they are interested in more quickly and waste less time on other sites
explain its very easy to add things that dont need to be probed down
god yes please fcs cannot pronounce gpfwestie try it its nonsense not even a wordi had no idea what i was doing when i signed up no idea you couldnt change the name later and by the time i realised the mistake i had too many sp to start againi keep petitioning to get it changed but the answer is always the same
nowhen you buy a character you also buy the reputationits part of the cost of taking a shortcutat least you wont be primaried

how are we going to bring this feedback to ccp i dont think we have yetunless i missed something is this going to be in a csm issue or direct mail to ccp or what
this at least all sounds relating to your ship what would be the point of some of these sounds otherwisealso the ability to customize sounds to a high degree without this feature the soundscape will turn into cacophony with all these different sounds and the whole point of implementing the system is lostso 1 for sound profilesfor functional soundability to listen when you are being shot at and differentiate sounds between hitting shields hitting armor and hitting hull so if your attention is focused on something else you can still effortlessly monitor your ships condition could also use a user determined warning point that basicly tells you when your tank is about to fail or at breaking pointcapacitor low warning preferably at a user determined pointdrones taking damage i have only two eyes and i cant look everywhere at once id like to focus more on flying and less on glancing at tiny little bars for any change
sounds good to me as long as ccp sort things out quicklyid also either add webber batteries to the complexes or disable mwds within them the same as with proper deadspace
the filthy doucebags that abused the timer exploit should be banned to hell and back ccp is aware of this happening and will hopefully bbq some people soon i just sent another email to ccp to hopefully speed things up and sent this thread to erik so he can at least schedule it to go through the csm if you got names and screenshots and the gms do nothing email them to me in my profile in case you dont have my email yet ill make some work of iti made a reproducable defect for ccp when i was in iceland so qa is aware of it and theyll fix it now they need to ban the people that exploited this ever wondered how certain people could decontest everything while you were sleeping for an hour now you knowi agree with all other points too

eve tv 20i had posted this in general a while back but feel this is a more appropriate venue for this proposalthe ability to view the alliance tournaments live has been perhaps something that we have taken for granted i personally remember the first time i watched one of the tournaments live  it was very exciting it has become apparent however that this medium of expression is too cost prohibitive for ccp to produce with any sort of frequency when you think about the amount of bandwidth and server power needed to stream video to thousands of users simultaneously this is not a huge surprise what i will propose here is a solution to this problem that will not only be more cost effective but will also produce a much higher quality result i will begin with an overview from the users perspective followed by a more technical analysisoverviewmany of us have played rts games that have a replay feature after a match is completed the camera can be moved by the user to any part of the map allowing the user to analyze the match second by second eve tv 20 would essentially be an ingame player that would allow you to do the same thing with eve recordings as well as accepting live feed from eve events it is important to note that this would be entirely different from a video stream or stored video file this player would not play video footage but would render the events to be viewed using the same graphics quality and freedom seen when playing the game many of the same options available to a pilot in eve space would be available in this player look at camera rotation zoom inout etc while also adding the features of a standard media player play pause rewind the feed for this player could come in the form of stored files or a live feed the graphical quality of the display would be exactly the same as that seen when you play the game other information could also be provided ie showing when fleet members activate which modules etca pilot could record a battle they participate in then go back later and closely analyze the fight from any of its participants view to gain a greater tactical understanding of what the hell actually happened a fc could use this replay to viciously chastise the noobery that he might otherwise not notice
technical analysisthe product i described previously is without doubt ambitious the part that may surprise you however is that once implemented this application would probably take less resources to run than its current counterpartsthe first and most basic function of this application is the ability to take data representing a sequence of events in eve and play it back luckily eve already does this a video stream the method used to display the tournaments thus far actually sends your computer data representing every pixel on your screen  essentially sending every video frame to your computer when you actually play eve this is not the case the information on how to graphically render every object in eve is already stored on your computer locally all the eve server actually sends you is information about the entities in your area for example the server might send you data indicating that there is a megathron at coordinate xyz the entitys name that it has an armor repairer active its velocityacceleration vectors etc the rendering of this information to the pretty pixels on your monitor is then handled by your computer locally as it takes all the given information and produces the image on your screen appropriately an eve tv 20 player would use this same graphics engine that is already in place to produce its image the only real difference would be the source of the data that is fed to the player this feed of data could be produced from a stored file or from a live feed from the eve servers the amount of data needed to represent a sequence of events visually through this method should be far less than that needed to send every pixel through a video stream this is why the game itself is generated in this way further the server power is already in place to send this data for live events it could even be implemented in a form that prevents extra burden on the servers for live events ie cannot be logged in and have player open or must be docked to open player an implementation of this sort would guarantee that a player watching a live event puts no higher a burden on the eve servers than one playing the game less since it is just a sequence of data sent that doesnt allow interaction from the player you cant control the ships in the video player and the server power is always in place for this type of broadcast so long as eve is online it does not require temporary allocation of server resources to do a live broadcastthe second function of this player would allow eve players to produce their own files to be played at this time any eve video you see on youtube etc is produced with a thirdparty video capture program these programs basically take the display on your monitor and copy it to your hard drive in the form of a video file to be played later again this means that every pixel on the screen will need to be stored on the hard drive the method used to create files to be played in the eve tv 20 browser would be much more efficient these files would store the entity information rather than the visual representation again in most cases this would run with better performance than its current counterparts this would allow it to use less resources when recording than a program like fraps while also producing a much higher quality result to be played back obviously the record option would have some sort of onoff switch so it would not impact game performance at all while off
disclaimeri have certainly made some assumptions about the underlying workings of eve in this post most notably there is a point where this form of video reproduction will begin to cost more resources than a standard video capture i cannot say what this point is from my limited perspective but basically at some point the amount of data needed to represent everything around you will exceed a simple low quality video feed or file only those familiar with the underlying data structures of eve will be able to make an accurate prediction of the resource cost of such a player compared to a standard media player that said even in the cases where the resource cost for eve tv 20 would be higher huge fleet battles maybe it would still produce a final product of much higher quality and functionality
im all for more eye candy but i run eve on a fairly old machine and already im pushing its limits im unwilling to sacrifice significant performance to get more sweets
omg what are they thinking jungle green camo in space it looks bad on the navy vexor worse on the domi and omg tear my eyes out on the mega switches training queue to amarr
no salad paint
yep terrible idea black looks so much better give me black eagles
i dont think that it has to be black but that camo paint is totally stupid there is already enough smack going on because of the stupid french origin which has now been somewhat retconned i dont really want to subject myself to slurs about being so stupid as to use camoflage in space
please dont apply green camo skin to gallente navy ships space is black so the only camouflage color for a spaceship is black

signed im sure they had a good reason for it i wonder how they are using negative valueswell the simple answer would be to allow individuals to own a jetcan etc and then tell people not to jetcan into someones can  but that would probably break something else some people i work with would consider that elegant  sigh its amazing how much of crafting code is an art some people just dont have an eye for it
um you know that it was coded by ccp right
i didnt mean it as a hackjob database architecture wise thats the best way i could think of you could probably implement a system like that without messing with the core inventory table but its still problematicif you have ownership for every item itll create a huge table one entry for every item in eve if you dont and in most cases still use the location system youll have reduncancy which strikes me as unaesthetic in a massively normalized and highperformance database either way each showinfo lookup or any call requiring ownership info will have to involve a join or something of the like of the ownership table given the item entry and singleton info no longer are enough to tell you everythingi obviously do not have statistics on how many ownerlookups the current eve code generates and how heavy the db load is in general but this might potentially create performance issueswho knows
id suggest increasing the accelerated learning cap by about 200k sp every monththis isnt enough to make new characters overpowered and you wont be able to keep three characters on an account in permanently accelerated learning
id keep it as simple as possible just a distress button that selectively flashes the corp or alliance chat tab a different color and displays a canned message with your location
keep it simple system only completely public and up on the overview like a cyno field
i support this but we also need a way to broadcast quickly to corp or alliance chat or both a request for help with a link to the system we are in the link should work like an escalation where if youre not in system you can use it to set destination via rightclick and if you are already in system you can warp to it
the only issue i can see with this is people spamming your overview with distress signalsimo the way it should work is that it would be a deployable item with a few minutes of lifespan when you activate it you will be required to enter a short text to describe the situation ie help or hotspot thereby securing the name for the beacon in this system this would be in place so that when someone deploys a beacon the hostiles couldnt spam the system with beacons of the same name to confuse the enemythese deployable beacons should cost a fair bit to produce and take a hefty amount of cargo space ideally theyd sell for about a mil on the market and take 50100 m3u in cargo
agreed
id apply this idea to all thumbnail avatars but with some modification i enjoy seeing some avatars i think they could also be used to carry more information i suggest some sort of timer that will indicate ive seen or shown interest in this person recently

yay motion was championed by dierdra vaal and passed carriage unanimous hopefully well see this in the game soon thanks for the support all
i like it
yes please
edit oops too late awesomeness anyway
web speeds were decreased due to the nano nerf to level things offif you are that hellbent on webbing speed get a serpentis ship after dominion comes out and max out your racial skills
supporting this thread
youd do better to put at least the bulk of the linked idea into your op here instead of making us go and read it at least put an actual hyperlink in but yes the idea itself is quite sound would love to see it implemented
oops sorry didnt realise links didnt autoparse fixed now and quoted the original thread
the analize and return active probes buttons are to close to each otherplease move one of them
im all for itand im sure soon there will be replies telling you to look next time because its your own fault etcanyway supported bad ui

oh i can taste the carebear tears already a 15 minute docking timer would make baiting minersmissionrunners even more entertainingsomething like this i would support
itt carebears who cant figure out how bumping works want more cheapfree kills
hey noob you knew it the ccp changed the bump mechanic long time ago and you cant bump the ships just much slower than before  try to bump a capital at dockrangebefore changes you could hit the capital with a bc10mn mwd over 200msafter changes you can hit them with a bc10mn mwd 3040msnoob
you do realize that there are some stations with extremely large 30km docking rangesrightsupported docking games are ed while youre at it fix the neutral rr issue as well
signed not supported for the very same reason there will be hundreds of people online just to screw up others fun instapopping when undocking etc etc itd be like the supercap event only 100x larger
i have witnessed players using docking mechanics to harass rival players in highsec also known as the docking game this is unfair because a small force that could not win in a standup fight can disrupt and hassle an entire corporation in a system for an extended time i propose that there be the introduction of a docking jammer that would not permit docking at a highsec station while in use it would aggro concord just like a warp scrambler or a webifier so it could only be used on someone who is a wartarget or has stolen from you canflipping
nofixing that problem you seem to have is called bumping and it can be done in any number of ways with any number of ships
not on all stations certain stations have hilariously large docking range
bump them out of station dock range and have fun use alts neutrals whatever its possible and fun
i dont think the aggro timer needs to changedock ranges on the other hand need to be looked at and in some cases reduced considerablythose of you who say just bump it have you ever been to a station with a 35km dock range try bumping something off that then come back
nowhen ccp adds windows to stations then they can look into modifying docking games
supporting my own topicthe core idea here is just an improvement in organization and security for alliancesi dont know about increasing sma space you get that by anchoring more than one if you really need it krum
hey youre right he comes across like a carebear with nerdrage
also improving a strong foundationas the only other lowsecpiracy focused candidate has been myself so i must assume that the foundation you are building on is me im flattered and i didnt know that you cared so much sammich 3
actually i am a lowsecpiracy focused candidate i am also a big advocate of cheese especially the soft varieties
because she was the closest thing fw ever had for a representative in the csm and i brought her up because you seem to think damar can be possibly worseval do you also think that damar is doing this for himself do you think that whatever proposals for fw changes go to ccp will be his own are you so set in your mind that you would prefer no fw participant in csm instead you have exchanged noumerous blows and words with damar rocarion  brigadier general in game maybe you should try shaking hands with the man behind the general because he is the one to represent us not his ingame persona i have flown with damar on many occasions and although i can not claim to know him very well i can attest to one thing he is an honourable person and you just can not put a price to that especially in politics which is what this is all about i would vote someone just for thatdamn alt posting  wallinstar
i cant seem to find the thread in cp people are talking about where he kills mission runners would someone be so kind to link it
but this does applies to both caldari and gallente plexes whoever has the aggro will be either ecmed randomly or damped always works and indeed be somewhat unable to do anything both of these can be bypassed in a way with fof missiles or drones or the plex can be captured anyway with specially fitted shipif you do solo plexing of course the ewar in either races plex will gimp your perfomance and if you have npc aggro solo i doubt anyone would start 1 vs 1 fight in such situation lets not forget that caldari did conquer all systems and had to deal with npcs and someone always had to be the fall guy for npc aggro and damps but of course we killed the rats so eventually everyone was free of ewarabove of course speaks about caldarigallente plexes i cannot comment on amarr offensive plexes as ive not captured any it is perhaps true that caldari npcs are better than some but npcs are nonetheless important factor of faction war so removing all of them would probably be disservice as it helps new people in pvp and gives outgunned defender some help i do agree that some tweaks are likely in order for amarr and gallente npcs to put them more on par with matar and caldari damar rocarionbrigadier general
i doubt youd want to try this on the live server but i do have a suggestion for you if you have access to sisiget an alt into the gallente militia on sisi and try running plexes for the gallente militia on there where it wont affect whats happening on tranquility youve got a lot of experience with how the plexes work from the caldari point of view see whether the same tactics and fittings tailored for caldari rats allow you to run those plexes with the same degree of dificultyfor example was it possible to run gallente medium plexes and higher solo by speed tanking in a rat specific hardened t1 frigate if so would the same frigate be able to do the same in a caldari plex when the hardeners are switched out to focus on caldari rats instead or would you need a much more specialised ship to do the same task to what degree does the npc ewar hamper your ability to operate within those plexes when you have to deal with enemy plexers for this i speak of your experience in coming into plexes both offensive and defensive when gallente are running the plex and often taking several of them down before escaping or driving them out of the plex could you do the same if the situation was reversed flying into a caldari plex where the rats will be hostile against the same group of player ships flown with the same level of skillthe problem is until you do this from an unbiased perspective and publish your findings people are going to believe that your candidacy will be biased towards making fw better for the caldari alone even if that isnt your intentionfor myself im keeping an open mind on this and have not decided whether or not to support you in the election yet
yes he is personaly invested in his faction winning his other motivation stated by his most ardent friends  the space pervs who say in public its  to get revenge for people who voted for ankhhis only goal appears to be to keep the current fw plexing system as it currently is because his faction currently dominates that systemhe doesnt want to change anything except make other npc rats gallenteamarr more difficult what about changes in the whole plexing system the only thing i can see from other forums is a notion that increasing the amount of time on plexs and decreasing the amount of plexs will somehow lead to more pvp does damar endorse this idea still i personaly couldnt think of a worse one if i tried i have seen proposals that offensive must kill the spawns to cap plexsbut nothing about a t1 frig defending a major plex that cant be changed becasue then how would a certain faction defend with their alts etc etcso bottom line i dont agree with the only proposals he has put forward they seem self serving to his own interests it would take a lot for me to be convinced that his in game personae isnt his real face so i stand by my earlier call that damar is not the person best suited to represent fw to ccp while he does understan dcurrent mechanics he just wants them fixed not overhauledhis ideas are out of synch with the majority of fw players who dont care for the current plexsystem occupancy system and he has not demonstrated any impartiality in game or on these forumsedit bugs in plexs should of course be fixed but proposing that offensive ships must kill spawn for that bug only raises the question about defensive plexers causing this any ideas on that the whole sentence just demonstrates lack of impartiality
eve is quite complex game and you are talking about details when you should look at big picturenpc is not a problem it really does not matter what it does if you have reason to kill those and capture that plex you will do itwe all want more pvp in plexes but it seems that those who whine about npc does not want to capture those plexes they just want easy kills fw should be capturing systems not just easy kills it has to have bigger goals toocaldari npc may need some balancing but not much val itself has shown that those can be captured by solo he can kill enymy in those too sometimes it goes well somethimes not
i have actually tried tanking caldari plexes with an alt of mine in tq and usually end result has not been very succesful interceptor certainly could not speed tank close enough without having to warp out repeatedly neither could vigil ive not tried tanking one in t1 punisher perhaps only t1 frigate which might be able to pull it off my alt did kill one to medium plex which tanked it quite well but i reckon it wont do it forever unless your fit is completely aimed at tanking the said npcs in which case its quite useless in pvphowever what bm says and what battlestar crusader says in other thread raise a good point people would need more incentive to go to plexes and then discussion about solo capture would probably no longer be necessary the question is of course how it can be donedamar rocarionbrigadier general
lets focus on what take care has been doing for factional warfare the past yearfw focus and goalsalliances in fwcomplex spawning issuesfix fw lagaward medals to the correct caldari playersrequest for update on fw bugsexploitsreviewing the fw npcsthat plus several full documents sent to ccp on personal title and personally reproducing bugs in front of the qa team to get them fixed sooner contrary to the slander here you can see clearly that my view is entirely neutral and unbiased if you are looking for a fw candidate then look for the next take care candidate at least take care has a proven track record of productive and unbiassed issues raised on behalf of all factions of the fw community
anything ive seen damar doing he puts whole heart on it and he has my vote oh yes he have bad days being angry and stuff but isnt he just a human too you should just cut the bull and shut up
so lets see what damar really thinks when it comes to fw1 ankh said x whine whine whine2 fw npcs are perfectly fine3 plexes are the best thing in fw4 plex timers should take even longer5 gallente are evil blobbers i have to fly around with 9 alts for my casual pvpsummary everything is fine dont fix fwfw people should vote for someone that is actually aware of the problems with fw instead of someone that just tries to keep his own faction dominant
thanks for linking something that narrowed things a bit most of what i read was a lot ofcsm  you need to fix thisccp  we are already working on thatcsm  ohit is the equivalent of seeing thisowner of a car tells csm that their car is not working rightoh really says csm ill talk to the mechanic that is under the hoodcsm walks over to the car and says to the mechanic hey you need to fix this carthe mechanic looks up at csm and says i know that is why im working on itcsm in frustration says yeah well i was just letting you knowi did read every word of the minutes you linked by the wayseriously though so far i think you would be a good csm to be honest currently the only two things that are keeping me from voting for you is your false statement about the goon csms and you acting all surprised when people tell you they have a problem with you being a goonyou say early on that people should ignore the fact you are a goon and vote for you but then later say vote for me because i am a goon and look what these other goon csms didi read the interview and it seems you have a very nice background that would be very beneficial to the csm as far as balance to the game goes just fix those two things and you get my votes unless someone better announces they are running for csm which it doesnt look like it
thats not what i said though there was a lolgoons post to which i pointed out that goon csms have contributed positively to the game  as borne out by the testimony of the two actual csm delegates who have posted in this thread so its not a false statement at all that isnt the same thing as saying vote for me because other people in my alliance have done a good job its simply to set the record straightim not at all surprised that people have a problem with a goon which is why most of my posts in this thread have been to try and put those fears to restanyway thanks for your comments
some great questions there however it will be difficult giving them all a rating to distinguish between different gameplay styles and interests im afraid
as i get it those questions currently listed on the site are there for the test only but some of them are perfect examples of how questions shouldnt be formulated because they can yield completely opposite answers depending on how person will interpret them tech 1 meta 0 loot should not be dropped by npcsill say strongly agree if this is supposed to remove mineral income from loot reprocessing to leave it to the miners but ill answer strongly disagree if all meta 0 drops are supposed to be replaced with higher meta drops as we dont need to increase mission profitability even higher action needs to be taken to remove 001 isk order bumping from the gameill answer strongly agree because 001 isk order bumping looks stupid and if there will be a replacment mechanics to allow buyers to make their choices based on something other than the price but ill answer strongly disagree if this is only aimed against people who are able to babysit their orders and supposed to nerf their advantage in front of those who logs in and check their orders once a day suicide gankers should not receive a full insurance payoutill answer strongly agree as its unbelievable what suicide gankers get insurance but only if condord responce time will get nerfed in same proportion but ill answer strongly disagree if this is a plain nerf to suicide ganking as i believe what suicide ganking was never as overpowered as some people claimso final questions should be checked and formulated in the way to disallow different interpretationsand some question ideas1 point income sources like r64 moons and static complexes were main conflict drivers and their nerfs were wrong2 core combat model of eve lacks complexity and too simple3 development of eve should focus on the expanding of existant activities and not on bringing new ones like plantary interaction incarna or dusti know this is dictated by strategic marketing and quite an utopian dream as this isnt something what can be influenced by csm or even probably out of control of most devs but i think it will be useful to know if there are candidates who share similar thoughts
gripen i get your complaints but no simple system deals with them effectively were asking simple questions on complex issues and that will always have flaws but everyone knows what is meant by these questions and so the answers are still relevant if dv wants to give candidates the option of adding a link at the bottom to explain their answers that might help id prefer it that way really but even if thats not how it works i think itll be fine
maybe herschel but gripens item 1 is a very far reaching impact factor in terms of 00 affinity and perspective if properly diversified to put for lacking of a better description something that makes you want to scream epic next to different levels of 00 play this is probably the most important question for a 00 pvp viewpoint imaginable
gripen some good points and some over thinking in my opinioni rephrased the 001 isk issue to the minimum trade order increasedecrease should be 2 of the item value however i think you are overthinking the meta 0 question all it states is to remove the loot it does not mention replacing it with higher value items or more isk bounties judge it purely on what it statesbasically if you can only agree to a question if you have to say agree but only if then you do not agree with the statement as is and should select disagree we will need to evaluate the questions we add carefully your 001 isk explanation was a good one but ultimately you have to take them at face valueaddedherschel i will not add a specific explanation link to the candidate data  but i do include the candidate website as entered on the official eve online candidacy list candidates can post their explanation on their own website
dierdra how are candidates supposed to get passwords i was going to evemail you but your bio said to not bother since it would get lost in the volumeis the best way to just address book you and then wait until we are both on at the same timealso i would appreciate it if questions werent too broad some may want bombs to work in high sec but not the disruption spheres or vice versa with concord reacting appropriately if used on a bystander but when grouped a person can only say yes to both or no to both
more questions level 4 missions are not challenging enough level 5 missions should be available in highsec csm candidates should be able to get reelected indefinately instead of being bound by a twoterm restriction poses in wormhole space should be exposed to more danger there should be more varied dynamic pve content instead of just the static missions and exploration sites we have now ccp is not doing enough to punish macroers players banned from the forums should not be able to run for csm and get booted if this happens during their term
interview with hallan turrekinterview with zarch aldain of evetribunecsm is a focus group it is important for it to be as diverse and representative of all types of eve players as possible so that as many unique points of view can be conveyed to ccpi am a proud member of the school of applied knowledge a caldari rookie corporation i spend lots of time and attention educating the freshmen of sakin that vein it would be a privilege to represent rookie corpers pveers and anyone that takes on the responsibility of teaching new players the gamethings i want to see improved in this game include but are not limited tonew player experience primertutorials are fine and all but it has been my experience that the key tips players need are not communicated those being 1 right click 2 left bar of buttons and 3 the overview this is far from complete but i think it would be a startplayer vs environment miningreading through past csm minutes i keep seeing the topic of mining come up again and again i think we all agree that if mining could be made more interactive that would be better i have a hulk i know who doesnt and i often feel like i would rather punch myself in the face rather than undock and go get another hold full of orei dont have a perfect solution but i have a few ideasreduce the population of asteroids in beacon marked beltscreate new higher yielding ores in probe sites trade mining time with finding time this would probably combat macro minerslock bigger ships out of tutorial systemsrookie corporations extension programspart of what keeps me in sak is the social atmosphere and being able to help new players to learn the game instead of rage quitting or joining some player corp just to be scammed into a worse situation than they started at and then being dumped into one of the 2nd generation corporations what i would like to see is a way to still participate in the corp chat of a characters first rookie corporation i am not ignoring the obvious potential abuse people spamming their original rookie corp for new recruits i just dont have a good solution to thataggro sharing across fleetsi understand why aggression timers arent shared among rookie corporations they are simply too big and why should a complete stranger in black rise care about what is happening to someone in the citadel but i think that the aggression timer should be shared at a bare bones minimum across a fleet fleeting is the best ways to recruit new people that are going to remain with youwho i am in real lifeoutside of new eden i am a 24 year old california resident i am a graduate student working towards a masters in computer science emphasizing securitythank you for reading thisjonathan dawnchaser fearn
hello jonathanas a csm representative during term 2 i am eager to see another npc corp member in the csm especially with the upcoming taxes to be levied against the npc corps that being said you should make a strong platform with specific objectives to achieve and get the support of the npc corps you should also let us know who you are as part of the reason i believe that helped me get elected was my biothe npe does need work but the objectives towards mining i believe will not benefit the actual activity part of the main problem is not minings profitability but rather its boredom ever since project unholy rage it seems as if macro groups have abandoned or mostly neglected macro mining for other activities such as hacking accounts to steal isk and items in this vein having belts diminished and moved to exploration sites will only raise the bar on the mining activity making even less people want to do iti do agree with the aggro sharing across fleets but only due to the fact that the tax will soon remove one of our few benefits to remaining in npc corp npc corps will still have their main advantage and disadvantage in place  no wardecs and no poses respectivelythe rookie extension program i disagree with somewhat i do think players who leave npc corp might have second thoughts and regrets due to the livelyhood of the conversation there this is a sticky issue though and im not sure how to solve it maybe by eliminating the 2nd generation npc corporations and having them return to their original npc corporation since the effects are essentially the samebest of luck to you but you need to give us a reason to vote for you before this thread i never even knew you existed
i know my direction is to increase interactivity for example i am mining right now while writing this post to make it less boringregardless if i am elected or not i hope my campaign raises issues for the elected delegates to further pursue i am glad to hear that others appreciate some of themi would argue that not being able to war dec could be a drawback too i look at the population of sak and i sometimes imagine what would happen if the school corporations could alliance up and declare probably something like a million babies taking on bruce lee but it is still an interesting thought this is sort of an extension of the new tax thing ccp wants us to go to player corporations that is great but some of us in sak anyway i cant peek into other corp chats do remain in sak to teach and others that stay to learn the game and meet people before they start to build the wall of employment historythank you unfortunately i only started posting on the forum recently i plan to run as much of my campaign actually in new eden to that effect i have created a public channel called soapbox chaser for people to ask me questions and otherwise grill me on my opinions and personality as i said csm is an elected focus group and as you said if i expect people to vote for me i need to convince them that i can represent their opinion and point of view to ccp
as you deliberately used the term rookie corp its only fair to pick up on this and ask what do you think of npc corps being currently used as a taxfree safe haven by players who ceased to be rookies long ago what is your opinion on the 11 tax proposal
i am glad you ask also i dont want anyone to feel like they need a reason to ask me any sort of questionfirst i will address the forthcoming tax i think an 11 tax is acceptable but it is the wrong solution for encouraging people to go to player corporations to me i have to choose between 11 of a portion of my income vs the value of the social commentary that occurs in sak chat not to mention an uncertainty of how i will i feel about my new corporation did i just give up the diversity of sak for a corp made of 2 friends and 30 strangersbut taxing new players is harmful to retaining new users yeah the tax only applies to missionbounty entries over 100k but bounties are summed if they occur in a near enough time span for example 10 12k bounties is 120k therefore eligible for taxation i think this 11 tax maybe should apply to characters until some point is reached such as reaching 60 days of age or leaving their school corp which ever comes firstdont forget that the 11 tax doesnt apply to sales and many argue that a lot of the profit from mission running comes from the resulting salvage and loothaving players move from a player corp to a rookie corp when they leave only makes sense otherwise they might be dumped into a player corp of 1 which just screams grief me but that isnt what you are talking about this is the case of a player in transitionthe big problem is that you are talking about an abuse maybe a high sec pirate that is in a rookie corp and spends the days trying to bait other players specifically other rookie corp players into shooting him so he can go get a bigger ship and ruin someone all the while knowing that after 15 minutes he will be safe from retaliation if you are asking me how i would address that perhaps increasing the aggression timer and allowing fleets to share aggro could help would a rookie corp pirate be as bold if he cant control the number of targets that can shoot back this can also reduce the profitability of suicide ganking when the alt tries to loot he gives aggro to the reinforcementsas to players hiding in the 2nd generation corporations it is important to recognize that not all situations are the same perhaps the person that leaves for the rookie corp was part of the aggressor corporation and just doesnt feel the war declaration was justified and wants no part in it is it wrong to dissociate yourself from a group with an agenda you dont agree withor perhaps a minority of a targeted corporation provoked the wrath and the resulting war declaration even after those members are removed or quit the war dec may remain for a periodwhatever the reason at some level pvp combat is opt in and it does need to stay that way some people just dont want to spend hours waiting to undock until someone leaves and no amount of baiting can force one player to take advantage of an aggression window although some may say the act of baiting is a form of pvphowever i would still argue that being in a rookie corp doesnt make a player safe suicide ganks still occur and people do salvage other peoples missions including stealing loot from wrecks just because a person cant just war dec and shoot me doesnt mean they cant engage in pvp against me they just have to be more inventivepassive pvp may also include competing for sciindy lines especially for manufacturing at mission hubs the market aka eve price is right 17000 ill post at 1699999those that use rookie corporations as war dec shields are going to continue to do that 11 or none it would take game changes toe end that

i think the sig is funny too you want people to forgive and forget which is fine but then why have a sig reminding everyone of what you did and wonder why people keep bringing it upjust because you cant run for csm doesnt mean you still cant help if you have some good ideas or suggestions then let the csms know and hopefully they take it and run with it also the assembly hall is just as easy to post in so the community can hear it i said before i like some of your ideasi am neither
including the op it would seem
well its a nondisclosure agreement although he acted on sensitive information himself larkonis didnt tell anyone else so i guess he didnt actually disclose any private informationso is he in breach of a nda
with serenitys help i know have a way of creating an automated survey which will make it much easier for yall to fill it in and create some good ol fashioned raw data to work with its currently in the works expect it to be done soon tm
here is a link to the automated survey edit link in next posti hope many of you will take the time to fill this out regardless of who you will vote for in the upcoming election any candidate can make use of the data which i will post herethank youaynen
i updated one of the questions slightly to specify which side is high priority and which is low as some users where getting confused this makes the old link absolete
any way you could have it that on each of the topics you could rate it on a scale being very imporant important meh unimportant and very unimportantthis business of rating them and not being able to rate 2 items at the same level means i end up rating thing i dislike at meh level and items i like i end up rating at mehsimply because there are no more slotsya its boguslike the initiative but the survey needs fixing
there are a lot of things like this that im learning from doing this survey i plan to do many more based on various aspects of how this survey is turning out and a lot of issues like the one youre bringing to the table will be worked on the problem with changing the current survey is that it can taint the results of the people who allready took it so because of that ill wait with major improvements untill the next survey
here are some innitial results as an appetiser as more people do the survey the chances of anomalies decrease as the majority vote evens them out so judge these first impression results carefullyi asked what activities players find the most important noting that i am not referring to what they spend the most time doing just what they feel is most important people have voted as follows starting at 1 being the most important and 16 being the least1 missioning2 ingame socializing3 wormhole exploration4 exploration outside of wormholes5 00 sovereignty wars6 mining7 00 wars that are not about sovereignty8 market trading9 low sec piracy10 null sec piracy11 factional warfare pvp12 factional warfare plexinga tie at places 1314 with bounty hunting and factional warfare missions15 suicide ganking in high sec16 scamming other playerswith the first type of pvp gameplay coming in at number 5 with 00 sovereignty wars and players electing missioning and exploration aswell as ingame socializing highest on the list one could argue that players do seek to interact with other players but prefer to do so with words not guns this seems rather unexpected from a game like eveit may well be that as more people take the survey it changes so i dont want to set anything in stone quite yetanother part of the survey shows that an overwelming 80 prefers to do their missioning in high security space thus also avoiding unwanted player interactionmining also shows this result albeit in a less drastic measure we see 40 saying they do occationally mine in 00 most miners avoid low security spaceon the topic of blobs there appears to be another strange result 40 of people hate blobs but 28 says to fly in them and just as 4 wants to keep them arround another 4 wants to get rid of them while 44 says to have no opinion of them people who love blobs make up 8 of those surveyedon what people feel ccp needs to focus on next the list goes as follows1st new shiptypes2nd missioning3rd exploration4th ship ballancing5th wormholes6th mining7th factional warfare mechanics8th ingame socializing9th 00 sovereignty system as it is in dominion10th bounty hunting11th piracy12th suicide ganking13th tradingin this list we see also that players seem to prioritise forms of pve over forms of pvp with missioning exploration wormholes and mining all listing high but new shiptypes is the most demanded of the lot in future surveys ill be sure to try and find out what types of ships it is that players seem to be demandinglet me state one more time though that these are not final results more people are coming in and taking the survey as should you especially if you disagree with the outcome your entry will affect the final outcomewhen i am confident that enough people have taken the survey to be relatively sure that the result isnt scewed which i can currently not be sure of as the testgroup is yet too small to rule this out i will then post a copy of the results here on the forum so you can all see the whole thing and make sure that i havent changed anythingfor now keep surveying 
my highest priority isnt listed on this survey at all and that would be better pos corporation and alliance management tools i really feel they should offer more pos services alliance wide
perhaps i should do a survey about the user interface to cover for the lack of mentioning it in the current priority list the problem with adding it now is that it will give a distorted outcome to the final survey result as some players will have taken the survey without it and some with ityoure the first to mention this lacking to me so far but there may be many others who havent said anything about itedit speaking of user interfaces i hate how the forum automatically selects one of my alts to post with which i sometimes forget to rectify such as now so for the record im aynen too
what a stupid suggestion no of course not im going to counter your wardec by docking up for 3 days sweet seriously wondering what the op was thinking
yaykazzzi hugs dierdra
thanks for championing my issue dierdra glad to see it passed the lag was horrendous
did ccp deem him able to run or not
which is why they call it council of stellar management instead of elected focus groupthat isnt to say that those channels couldnt be formedafter the delegates are selected for csm4 i urge everyone to figure out who is for what types of game play and discuss with those players on those topics add them to your address book heck talk to them before the election is held see who responds and who ignores you
here is how the csm is organizedperson with most votes total is the chairman he is the one who organizes the csm and gives direction our chairmandiedra vallsp was excallent he was the one who did the issue submission tofrom ccp and kicked our asses to make sure we got our crap in on time and made sure there was something to show for even ifwhen we didnt the chairman can resign if they dont want this extra work and who wins this position is voted upon by the rest of the csmhe sets deadlines for meetings and makes organizational decisions he also acts as moderator so to speak during csm meetingsvice chairman acts as chair if chair is absent during meetings which hasnt happened yet iirc thats omber i thinksecretary takes notes and produces meeting minutes and releases the raw logs sans nda stuff thats meissavice secretary acts as sec if the sec is absent thats eriki thinkall positions aside from chairman are voted on by the csm members volunteer for the positions then we vote for who does itaside from that all csm members have equal ability to raise issues and vote yes or no not even the chairman can flat out decide not to include an issue on the agenda if it follows the rules otherwisefor example you need to follow a template and the assembly hall thread needs to be at least a week old stuff like that

character security against hackskeyloggersetc like this would be a good idea imho
signed
disregarding the story and the fact this probably happens rarely having character transfers disabled by default and a timer is a great idea regardless the time delay would be an issue if you wanted to sell a character asap but it would stop the haxor from logging in a disabling this function straight away and like stated earlier sometimes the devs cannot answer too quickly so 10days  would be a good idea as i have traded characters quite a few times i can say this wouldnt cause too many problems also the mention a couple of posts up about sending a confirmation email to the original owner of character using the email adress supplied on this account 28 days before the transfer was sanctioned to catch any email changed with a link from ccp to confirm the sale this is also a good idea the time spent making this function would pay off in dev time and player grief later tenfoldtamber
i like the idea and would even say that characters should be locked by default so if you want to sell em you have to enable it i would even say that you receive an email once this option is enabled and the email has to be confirmed before the unlocking takes place after it has been confirmed a one week period will commencethere should also be an email adress field that you can specify that cant be immediately changed it would take 23 days to change this would give the victim some time to notify ccp and would also provide ccp with the necessary info to determine if the account was really stolen account security is everyones responsibility but you can only do so much to prevent  from happening

i have friends who like fpss who have played eve but didnt care for it these people are hard core pc gamers who have no interest in consoles id sure like to play eve and support their dust activitiesgive the consolers wiimine and give dust to the computer peoplei wonder how much ccp is at the mercy of the shareholders in making such decisions perhaps shareholders are destroying eve dust and ccp perhaps helmar has lost control of ccp to them he did seem choked up about something at fanfest 09

because i believe that the type of csm delegate who gets electedand the efficacy of the csm itselfwill evolve toward a more ideal form over time no guarantee there wont be an occasional mutant though assuming those of us with sufficient interest in how that could happen keep talking do our part to encourage more players to participate and step up ourselves when we canyou ought to run for csm5 if we both got elected it could be fun to see what youre like in rl given your energetic opinions here
from herego sick
heh you might be disappointed as i tend to be more mentally active than i am vocally unless theres a good discussionif anything csm may very well result in me calming down a bit for fear of getting my ass handed to me by my peers x
the system is less than 18 months old if you expect it to be perfect right off the bat then youre deluded as awareness grows and more people become aware of the process and get involved hopefully then you will have your check sum
you will actually find according to the data ccp recorded from csm voting that the voting awareness and committment of the player base is dropping rather than increasing or perhaps is simply stagnant csm 1  10 2  8 3  9
how bout that sounds like csm is driving away the interestgo figure
hey man 2008 called hes says hes been there and done that
id say the csm has done pretty well despite being saddled with people like jade and womenthat was redundant i guess
bump for that totally sensible feature requestwtf five minutes
if this is true then csm has the consistency of water
its still an issue raised by the players you could probably even say its more worthy of being raised since the author paid to get it raised while other people wouldnt do the same for their issues
in the real world we call this bribery and people go to prison for itill settle for concord podding mazz onceor twicean hourfor the next six monthsin station or not
oops
good thing there is no limit to the number of issues that can be raised
of course there is a limit and its called time

hey i post like a longwinded psuedointelligent douchebag on the assembly hall does this mean im being mind controlled truly your faith in humanity is inspiring more seriously look at whos on the csm how many of them are really desperate for cash i mean im sure you could bribe vuk with another rattlesnake to add to the dozens he owns but i doubt anyone is willing to pay quite that much mazz doesnt need the cash shes just doing it because its funny its not funny if it happens behind closed doorsyes but in the real world the population isnt a bunch of genocidal demigods who engage in mass murder because stripmining asteroid belts is too boring
wow good point expect that mazz isnt the president of the csm so i guess its not a good point its quite clear that csm delegates are supposed to represent the interests of the player blocks that vote them in just like a senator for california represents the interests of californians given that mazz represents pl id say that by trolling this forum she probably satisfying her constituency
thisgoing out with a troll like this and ruining the party for the next deligates is pretty damn poor
hersch your a riotbut you gotta appreciate des little statement on concord x
actually lark and mazz doing things like this makes sense they represent exactly what this spirit of cp is
anyone want to go 5050 on raising change nebulae backgrounds to pink and green rainbowseditoh and itt people suddenly realizing what has gone on for centuries in real life
ill go splitsies if we put in elves magic and dragons too
confirming mazz is a real american hero and a girl
writing what i would like to write here would prob give me a ban so ill just stay happy with the knowledge that your period as csm is soon over
just you could probably do something like this anyway and it is not really bad or anything actually i want to see how this goes jst for the fun of it
truly in the land of the blind the one eyed  is queen or was it stoned to death only time will tell 
i am interested in purchasing topics from you mazzilliuhere are my topics i would like brought upissue 1 all csm delegates must partake in csm meetings with ccp nakedreasoning clothed csm delegates are dangerous they could be hiding brain influencing devices are other nasty stuff if they were clothed the only solution is manditory nakedness for csm delegatesissue 2 all csm meetings must be viewable on evetv lifereasoning this is to make sure all csm delegates are in fact naked later claims that they were naked at the meeting could be pure propaganda and untrue we all know trust is foolish and life coverage of the meetings will make sure everything goes as intendedissue 3 csm delegates selling topics to players must swim to iceland and back naked to prove their worthyness of csm membershipreasoning eve players need proof that these csm delegates truly are willing to sacrifice to be in the csm without this test csm delegates may seem unworthy this test obviously needs to be done naked otherwise the delegates could wear protective suits or hide secret life support systems underneath their clothsi have some more topics that need to be adressedmazzilliu you can contact me by performing the secret ancient ritualsif you are worthy you will know whichjust a hint all rituals need to be performed nakedonce the rituals are completed mazzilliu you need to go to a large citysit on a public plaza naked of course rock back and forth and scream my name22 times then i will appear and give you plexthank you
ok like this totally invalidates all my worries about the csm irony how many plex to have you go back to wowscnr
supporting this csms a dumb idea anyway its a job ccp should do themselves so why shouldnt people get paid
i know its a girl but did you see the meeting from the fanfest not the kind of girl you want to see naked
but being drunk makes everything beautiful its the next morning where you wonder what you were thinking after waking up next to something that looks like it got hit in the face by a 18wheeler
you guys should convo mazz ingame if you are serious about purchasing an issue from her
from this thread from the term limits thread new suggested campaign slogan massilliu for csmconsultant when that description is more convenient politician when that description is more convenient  hypocrite full time
remember to clearly state the objective of your petition when you send you plex nobody benefits from miscommunication
so according to this thread i can get mazzilliu to raise even the worst threads which might even have a negative influence on herself for 350 milnow that is a bargainbanningsuspending mazzilliu from the csmforums for only a pricetag of 350 mil is really a bargain as you state yourself in your terms that you wont hesitate to support any topic as long as i give you a 30 day gtc i doubt with your state of service as soon as you get this in the meeting that there wont be a lot of resistanceanyway seemingly you still have a lot of fun in making these obvious troll threads since some people tend to take csm a little bit too serious
accessible does not imply youre able to find every or even half the sites out there
i agree if this goes through eve will lose some of its uniqueness again
only if its a once per account thing for pay and your prior name remains a matter of public record tied to the new name searches for the old name would bring up the current name even if it has no bearing on the current name
totally support the functionalityi write enterprisescale business software character records should be referenced by a unique id and name should not be that id even though they probably made that decision in 2003 and thats why we cant do it easily then this change would have been 3 seconds buddy lists would automatically work and so would anything that that character ownedi actually wanted to change a character name just last night as i wasnt happy with my original choice nothing more nothing lesswould have paid 10 to do it
this shouldnt be a problem from a technical standpoint you could even have the old name appear in the ingame information on the character like melor rend also know as blabla should not be a problem to change ones callsign from an rp standpoint either would be great if ccp would give us this option i would be willing to pay anything up to 200 us dollars for a name change on one of my characters no seriously id pay that tomorrow morning without thinking twice about it if i could pls give us this option dearest devs
supporting a one time only name change for each character but old name is easily viewable in corp history or something similar
this is a voting issue for meagree to bring this to ccp you get my vote

definitely against there is already a mechanism in place to remove towers shoot them after reading through all of these posts mostly i see people wanting an easy way to make a lot of isk for doing little the only thing i would support would be the ability to blow up via charges abandoned towers provided they put in a mechanism to determine a tower is actually been abandoned ie off line anchored in space for 3 months or morepersonally i think there are bigger issues ccp has to deal with then messing with something that already is functioning
as ankhe said we showed to ccp the most prominent exploit during fanfest being a defect and in qa adding to this the fw balancing issue i am not sure if we need another fw motion in the csm pipeline  i can already reraise the issue and request for feedback and i will do so during the next and for this term concluding csmccp meeting midnovemberuntil then i will use the csm contacts at ccp to inquire about the progress
if theyre going to be completely useless and corrupt we should at least admit it so i propose changing the job description to something along the lines of gets free vacation and given information early to be used for personal gainthats a bit long for a title maybe we should just rename them useless has even one thing come out of that committee thats useful to anyone but them
the csm is a glorified free trip to iceland club whos only purpose is to spend beer tokens at fanfest ccp probably still pays for the csm just to troll people in the assembly hall with
and to clarify im not saying that nothing comes out of the csm i am saying that what comes out can or prolly would come out from ccp anyway they have a ton of suggestions made in other areas of the forum wouldnt take long to figure out what is wantedneeded in the way of changesbut i support my own idea cause csm is essentially useless and can and should be replaced by a ccp staff committee of their own

too many changes in one post some i like some are interesting and some i dont like ship balancing as proposed i dont agree with but on the other hand your projectile changes are interesting increasing the optimal on projectiles would be nice but a falloff bonus andor reevaluating how falloff works for minmatar across all the weapons would be better imot2 ammo needs to be reevaluated probably a flat damage increase and a reduction in tracking would be better on the other hand short range weapons long range ammo should have the tracking reduction removed

cant the recons cyno around already
nope only blackops but those are very expensive as much as a carrier and several times less useful have a very very short jump range useless bonuses etc
eve is already small enough stop being lazyif i can travel 40 jumps in a day going hub to hub without ing about you can too
i fail to see the point with such a ship its practically useless cant even fight nor mine for that sake
thusly the shuttles the industrials the freighters and the rorqualorca are also practically useless as they are incapable of mining or fighting its not there to mine or fight its a shuttle with a jump drive thats it that is its purpose  get from one end of the universe to anotherobviously someone has never lived in 00 in the ass end of the universe where it is 45 carrier jumps 2 in dread rorq jf to empire about 20m each way or its 30 jumps through various usually contested regions of 00 into a camped entry point occasionally one lucks out and finds a wh to empire not a common occurrencenever mind you must scout each system if you dont want to be the next pinata km and then wait a minute at least non combat fit or 5 minutes if combat fit to jump again this is fine and all but it takes timehopefully you have a cyno gen or perhaps you pay 20month or however much isk for a cyno alt yes jump clones alleviate this if you need skillbooks and can use them in the here and now but what if you cant afford the 24 hour jump delay sure you can train something else but you still need to do itwhat if you need to move small cargos a carrier trip is hardly economicalbtw  you cant use cynos in highsec so yes in the context of highseclowsec such a ship is indeed uselessits a jump shuttle for those poor fools who trained jump drive operation 5 and so on of which i am one its a pita but it was worth it otoh i just think it would be nice to have a smaller craft which makes use of these skills  is useful for transit
so what your saying is anyone who trains jump drive operations v is a poor foolthats messed upnot supporting noob proposal
logistics are already easy mode with titans portalling jump bridges jumping cyno generators generating and regional gates doing the whole i cannot be bubbled thing jump freighters rorquals carriers haulers that can use cov cynos good lord you have so many tools to make it easy to get ships and modules into 00 ridiculously easythats the problem really you are too used to easy mode logistics in 00 you believe you are entitled to one button click instant 30 jumps through 5 regions of 00 in a second no a thousand times no
no i dont regret training for carrier or jump fritter it was a cast iron pain in the ass but ultimately it was worth it the point i was trying to express is it is annoying to train jump skills  being forced to get atleast one to lvl5 and two others to 4 for baseline skills you may want to check jump ranges before you make silly statements like that you could span about 3 regions with that sort of range tops it has nearly enough fuel with standard skills to make it from empire to omist this is jumping over 2 regions 3 jumpsfor a jump bridge route to be viable ignoring fuel use which is an insane pain you need to own every 38 systems on the route to empire which still terminates in an entry point system which is fine and all but its hardly the epic logistics tool you make it out to be titans jump portalling surely you jest for an alliance freighter op okay sure it may happen not that i have seen it anything outside of a combat situation no cyno gens are indeed a revolution and are very very handy for moving capsall of what you have listed are mass transports slow but if something big needs to be moved well you have the tools btw those haulers that can use cov cynos need a black ops pilot who actually owns a pinata and moreover has no qualms about using it plus its going to take a long time to get those small haulers to wherever with a 4 ly jump range and you need cynos for each step of the way because blackops cant bridge to cyno gens stupid assuming someone was crazy read stupid enough to put cyno gens at 4 ly intervals its a lot of work for a single item that you want btw 200m3 is enough to carry about 5k rounds of med ammo or 6 cap booster 800s or around 6 hours 12 if you use some of the fuel bay of pos fuel small pos or 4 large mods good for personal logistics aka a quick hop to empire grab a book or a mod which is not available in 00 but not corp or alliance logistics okay you can get to 295 with a spander and two small cans not game breakingid say it would be a perfect use for the opux luxury yacht but that wouldnt really be fair to voogrui dont really see what there is to hate about it its another tool for people who have jump skills its another fragile ship to blow up and those who live in empire arent affected whats your problem not like big bad shuttle is going to kill you and your way of life its like im asking for a vaga that has fighters a dd the tank of a mothership the cargo of a freighter enough range to go from stain to omist in a single jump using 66 topes without a cyno and dread guns while generating isk it does not make any ship obsolete nor is there any other ship that is remotely similar outside of having a jump drive
so youre basically describing a ship thats supposed to be like a jump clone that can haul officer gear and blueprints im not liking it
did it occur to you that the fact you need a minimum of level iv jump drive op to fly most jump drive capable ships is to prevent mass pandemic jump drive pilotsyour little idea makes it much worselike it or not it really is easy to get around not supporting
jump freighters are 5lycarriers 65lyyou want longer range then that110 troll for beating me to it
it is generally considered that you are extremely dumb or extremely unlucky to lose a jump capable ship when used correctly cynoing to stationsdeathstar poss the thing to hate is that you bypass 00 pipes entrance points and get nearly risk free logistics into 00 which is supposed to be contested and an area for lots of pvp by adding in jump generators and jump bridges ccp nerfed pipes to make them completely useless it used to be that people could harass an empire by attacking their logistic pipes but now they can jump everything they need without a sweatattacking an alliances logistics is a different interesting way to fight big alliances and you do not require huge blob to do it easy mode logistics nerfs an entire style of play and what is worse it is one of the few that is great for small fleets and doesnt require blobbingyou are in atlas you live in detoridinsmotherwicked creek area you are one jump from an npc region that is easy to jump from a lowhigh sec area you already have easy mode logistics claimable 00 is for alliances that work together not so you can solo jump in modulesammo whenever you feel like it for very little effortrisk and bypass having to secure logistic pipes or actually going out and doing work and securing spacei dont understand why you cannot use your corporationalliance resources to move up 200300m3 to your alliances space corps with far less do much more thats how it should be having to rely on friends and cooperation to get into 00
what are you on about it needs jump prereqs to fly as noted in first postseems to me that you have more problems with 00 logistics in general than this jump ships already do all of what you are unhappy with being easy to get into 00 ranting here wont fix any of that implying that it needs to be fixed which it doesntbtw  we also have and use omist though not for much longer probably some deathstar pos cloaked hic w cyno  jf jumps in  bubble  cyno  insured dread jumps in  jf dies hic dies wreck popped dread self destructs  nynced station cyno goes up  recon pops another cyno  you jump in to the company of 15 dreads you diewhich is what you get for not scouting as proposed this is even more vulnerable to this trap because the recon in question is free to tackle you and something comes to blast you jump bridges are easily campable with stealth bombers small guns have 250mm scan res and scramble batteries absurdly low scan res so you have a good 10 or so seconds before you start getting shot at theres no time to assess the situation beforehand you just die and frankly im not too bothered by thisnot to say that this would be any different but moving about 00 isnt nearly as safe as you make it seem if this could go from jita to 00 in a single bound it cant then i might be inclined to agree but you still have to get through however much highsec before you can get to a point where you can jump to 00 meanwhile youre just as vulnerable more vulnerable really to wardecsthe problem is getting said 200m3 from wherever assuming you already own it to a point where an atlas pilot will pick it up alts okay but courier contracts are very unreliable empire runs are few and far between during wardecs i could just as easily hop down my own carrier but then im wasting 2040m of fuel counting round trip nevermind some cyno alts timeits a cruiser with a jump drive it jumps small amounts of cargo it has a longer jump range than a carrier 3 ly at jdc 4 but in all other aspects it is inferior its several times more vulnerable than a carrier as it has about 5k ehp and thus if it gets caught it will die no logoffski here a carrier can jump faster carry much more ly worth of fuel nevermind cargo and ships i dont see how this makes anything easy mode if anything its more dangerous to use than my carrier for jumping stuff its more economical on fuel use but that is it the greater jump range is frankly useless as cyno beacons will continue to be placed at ranges that make sense for dreads and carriers so again whats your problem its not obsoleting a playstyle by any means nor does it make logistics easier or safer its about 9 times as expensive as a carrier jump is per m3 assuming both are fully loaded at 200m3 the carrier costs 19500 per m3 and the shuttles 3600 per m3 it becomes cheaper to use the carrier at 400m3 because the shuttle must make 3 jumps as opposed to the carrier still only needing one at 5 m3 the carrier is 780000 iskm3 while the shuttle is at 144000 this is assuming jdc 4 and the max jump range for each shipedit quote fail
ok this is a bit different i know but what about a jump shuttle with no cargo just a fuel bay and can only be used if your corpalliance has sov in the area you heading to why would you use this to get around your space fast if you need to probably stupid but just a thought

honestly youre right tradeoffs really arent that cut and dryexactly however the easy copout is that i really dont care im a paying customer so i can just come up with the insert appropriate adjective ideas ifhow to implement it is someone elses problem
although an interesting idea on most mining ops that ive ever seen or organized its always more advantageous to be paying the miners based on participation not which roids are close to thema good mining outfit would be striping everything in sight otherwise everyone will be grinding on the same high value rocks thus wasting cycles every cycle should be on adding to the aggregate haul for the organization
a mobile store ship would be interesting but also hard to implement perhaps make a pos mod which can have stuff put into it which can be then put on market problem then is delivery delivery probes lolotoh poses would need to be completely renovated before id want the devs to even consider putting time on this sort of thing there was a good thread in featuresideas discussion about this
the hardener effects didnt look so hotfading in and out but i liked the previous shields on the whole better more like one would think a shield would be ditto for shield booster fx it also opens the door effects like shield impacts etc
greetingsi have been playing this game since 2003 i recall fondly the perception of 00 space when it appeared largely empty and void of life today 00 space is controlled by conglomerates and afk entities dominion promises to break up these monopolies and once again restore 00 to a chaotic and unfettered state i propose we take this one step furtherwith the addition of wormholes to the game a unique game mechanic has been introduced where local chat does not show other pilots in system i propose ccp add this same mechanic to all of 00 space make no mistake this would dramatically change the dynamics of every day life in 00 however since dominion is going to allow for system upgrades i would imagine an upgrade could be made available that would restore the intel provided in local to its current state showing the size of fleets and pilots in system for all parties this intel upgrade would only effect systems where sov markers were in place and the upgrade was added in addition to greater intel within home systems the result would create pockets of uncontested 00 space where no info could be gleaned from local similar to how wormholes currently workthis would have several effectsfirst it may provide the needed security blanket for industrial players to leave empire space and begin making their way into deep 00 space i believe this is one of the major motivations behind dominion to begin withsecond it would also place greater emphasis on probing abilities attacking fleets would need skill in locating targets otherwise hidden because local would not indicate their presence third combat encounters would actually increase as ambush parties could lie in wait without fear that local would give their presence awayfourth holding sov using jump bridges and cap ships would be even more valuable as pilots could no longer rely on a scout or two to avoid confrontationfifth this change would further immerse players into the wild that is 00 space unlike empire where communication devices and transmitters would theoretically be used by npc factions to show players in local 00 is supposed to be void of their influence instead this encourages players to assume the mantle of protectorate and sovereign overload in conclusion this proposal is designed to accomplish the combined goals of greater security for the sovereign empire by showing pilots in local while increasing the likelihood of 00 encounters throughout unclaimed space not showing pilots in local please join me in supporting this initiative and make 00 wild once againthank youjanos vaasdirector arkons of myth
this is a new and promising concept that nobody has ever thought of beforeedit its a tough life having four heads
one more post on a good idea
its a lovely idea what a shame it will be shouted down by those whos alliances rely on macrosweatshop isk farmer alliances paying rent
so let it be written so let it be done this is a good idea and i support it
whoathats a really good idea i like it
no local in 00 without another intel tool has been discussed anddenied
good thing another intel tool was proposed then
i must have missed the part thats going to make 00 ratting or mining 4x as profitable as now to even warrant coming out of the highsec mission cribs
or maybe i didnt and this is just another thinly veiled i want to gank ratters and have people laud my pvp prowess post i just dont know
if not doing missions in high sec isnt enough motivation already nothing ever will be i wouldnt go back into empire and run missions for a living if it was 50x as much isk if iskhr is really your primary motivation maybe empire is best for you
not a bad idea
i agree that there is a problem with the current system reguarding salvagingim very new to eve and have worked my way upto level 4 missions and do still find missions time consuming and difficult i do not earn the 20 mills an hour mentionedi stopped doing them and logging into eve due to the frustration cause by ninja salvagingi understand salvaging is a new feature but with it came ninjas these ninjas tend to enter missions well before i can clear the npcs 910 they follow the npc im currently trying to kill and salvage it as soon the npc goes popi did try to run missions with a friend who had fitted a t2 salvage harbinger but even thats not quick enoughi dont have a problem with salvaging just the ease and speed that the salvagers are free to work atif i can be bothered to log in and do a mission i tend to blow the wrecks up straight away but this hurts me more that the ninjasim not ready for lownull sec getting a ship popped is expensive and mining id rather not log in at all1 runner less for the ninjas i guess
all those mission rat frigates cruisers and battleships arent warships
these are the best ones to getif you have backup you always know they wont have anyone else coming to help them
a lot of them nofor salvage purposes warship is a flagged naval vessel of a sovreign powerangels guristas etc etc etc are not warships theyre just criminals with guns flying spaceshipswere we to use true salvage rules than only naval ships amarr navy etc would be warships and even they can be salvaged under certain circumstances usually by contract with the owning government
i see it this way wrecks belong to the person who got killed in the case of missioning they belong to the npc and since they are already flashy red to them its fair game the loot from these wrecks imo belong to the npc aswell but to balance it out and prevent your tears form sustaining those noble ninja salvagers you are rewarded with the loot that is inside of the shipor you can employ a salvager to clean up for you best defense against a ninja salvager is someone setup to do the same thing and doesnt have to probe just let there reward be the bounty on missions and when there is no bounty you pay them for there time
mission in a less crowded system
tryed that 3 times either lose quality or go into null sec it doesnt matter where you mission nor how meny people are in local ninjas are everywhereempire miners have a harder time than the ninjas at least the npcs cause agro when they try to strip there belts
fair points which is why there should be an option to ignore distress signals for systemspersonally imvho i am in two minds about a system wide distress call for exactly that reason could you imagine the scene in jita not to mention the extra bandwidth and system load that could ensue the way to eliminate that is to have it set simply for someones corp or alliance but that still leaves the npc corps obviously still some things to sort outat first i didnt like your idea about charging for the beacons but now that i have had thought more about it i can see your point and it makes sense a deterrant to keep down spam is to charge for the priviledge so about a mil to buy install a distress beacon sounds like a good approach although i dont think it should take up cargo hold space it should simply be installed when one is used up and furthermore i dont believe it should take a slot it should be a standard item in every shipmj
simple really give us the ability to right click a blinked icon on the neocom to clear the blink i am sure you all know just how tiresome clicking the wallet or journal button only to then have to close the resulting window time after time after time after time getsso please almighty csm tell the ui guys to actually do some work for once
yes plz
yes please  
makes sense would be useful agreed
you know theres actually an option to turn the blinking offuse it
why not just move all of the lvl 4 agents to low sec so carebears could defend their salvage if they wanted to and ninjas could keep going with their business p another idea is to put limits on how many missions the lazy comfortloving high sec agents would give each day that might make some of the players go to low sec as wellone more apporach would be to introduce some specific to mission running profesion leadership skills and modules which would make a carebear gang less vulnerable to pirate attack assuming missions take place in low sec and mission runners are inside a deadspace in a similar way as microwarpdrive doesnt work in such a location
because they would go to level 3s insteadand limiting them would be no different then doubling the security penalty for killing players in lowsecstop thinking lopsided and start thinking balancedneither can live without the other alienating the other is going to kill the gamethis isnt hello kitty online nor is it pvp online its eve onlineunique and requires all types to keep it going
ill preface this by saying ccp would have to offer a 1 time opportunity to change racesnow that ccp has removed any need to choose a race to delegate attribute points there really is little reason to dedicate to one race short of specing everything to level 5race has seldom ment anything in this game and removing attribute characteristics has pushed us further from that roadso what im thinking is a specific line of either skills or bonuses related to race these skills would encourage you to stay within your own race rather than branch off so easily it would add another element of tradeoff choosing to stay within race or using skills outside obviously these bonuses cant be severe or else everyone would be up in arms about one race getting the biggest benefit so what could potentially workmaybe its a skill that gives 2 boost to racial ship effectivenessmaybe is a bonus to racial warfare styles such as ecm target painting webs drones etcmaybe its a racial agility boost speed boost range boost etci think the options are limitless and with such a small boost it shouldnt skew the balance of poweroriginally i was considering making this a line of skills for each ship class but it doesnt seem practical so i think it would better be handled with drugs or implants or just racial awarenessit just seems unusual for so many caldari pilots to fly gallente ships and surely we cannot continue these atrocities
something like a 1 bonus to all racial ship bonuses for your racenote role specific bonuses should not be affected nor should the t2 skill bonusestake for example the rifter with minmatar frigate vnon minmatar  25 bonus to small projectile turret damage and 375 bonus to tracking per levelminmatar  2525 bonus to small projectile turret damage and 37875 bonus to tracking per levelor the golem with caldari battleship vnon caldari  caldari battleship skill bonus 50 bonus to cruise missile and torpedo velocity and 25 bonus to cruise missile and torpedo explosion velocity per levelcaldari  caldari battleship skill bonus 505 bonus to cruise missile and torpedo velocity and 2525 bonus to cruise missile and torpedo explosion velocity per levelthis would also make pirate ships more interestingfor example the bhaalgorn with both amarr and minmatar battleship skills at vcaldari and gallenteamarr battleship 75 to large neutnos amount per level minmatar battleship 100 to range of stasis webifiers per levelminmatar  amarr battleship 75 to large neutnos amount per level minmatar battleship 101 to range of stasis webifiers per levelamarr  amarr battleship 7575 to large neutnos amount per level minmatar battleship 100 to range of stasis webifiers per level
uhhh no with that amount no one would be using his racial ship for sure but if you take it to 10 or maybe even 20 or 25 then yeahmaybe
then noone will use nonracial shipsno however neat this idea may seem to be i like the way eve is unrestricted race is determined by your birth so you cannot possibly change race if you where born lets say british you may speak a different language you may live in a different country but that noes not change your race
no
noas much as i would have liked them to keep differences in stats i can see why they removed them as long as one of them was even one point or percent more efficient than the others others it was adviced in every guide new players were offered it was causing severe population imbalance between races and the obvious solution to balance things was to make race a meaningless choiceyour solution would discourage crosstraining but it isnt a bad thing and such bonuses would just be silly there really isnt any need to create such differences between races roleplayers create their own persons and the ability to chooce stats should suffice for them most players seem to be happy with the current situation there is no reason to implement this and it could create new unforseen problems so why would ccp even consider this
atm t1 mining ship bpos are extreme expencive roughly between 1  25 bil   npc marketretriever  1 bilcovetor 25 bilthere commen used entery level ships cruiser  battlecruiserclass in size  skill levelalign the price to there level
haha youre lcky to even find a covetor bpo on the market i agree but it seems ccps policy to keep lining the pockets of the older alliances and players to the detriment of everyone else
lucky to find them on market head to outer ring  plenty for sale and i really fail to see how a bpo that has always been expensive remaining expensive counts as lining anyones pockets no to the op as well the ships are cheap and abundant industrialists who dont have the cash for that can build cruisers and battlecruisers instead
this
ok hersel ill play your game as its 24 jumps there and back through null sec to get to 4cb7x how much cheaper than 25 billion is a covetor bpo in the real world as ccp likes to equate eve to a covetor bpo would have to be around 600 million to be worth the risk considering gates can be bubbled please let me know cause if you dont know then your full of it mate
i think its npc price is 2bil your options are pretty much these 1 get it yourself in a covop and try to sneak it out 2 pay a someone to sneak it out or to jump it out 3 pay the market premium for delivery to highsec
 this the npc price is 2 bilconsidering the user level of this ship it is absurd highi dont mind getting it out of 00 you can get a orca bpo  capital  for lessits a part of the game if you want to do something likebuilding a ship you need to do some efford or spend iskto get to itthe problem is that it has a odd pricei dont give a rats ass about politics to be fair thinkits overrated when i first noticed it i actually thought it was a bug still think it is
yes lets make sure all the people who actually went there and bought the bpos at the original price wasted craptons of moneythe problem with this is that you cant go changing such an expensive product without currently afflicting a huge number of peopleif you really want to get your hands on a bpo in a market which is mostly dominated anyway is either take the chance and fly there in a cov ops or join a corp who claims the ore stations

it came in on test server and it was horrible still too slow to tackle well and also useless because they still couldnt tackle worth beansif it was a role bonus id not mind so much but as a 4th bonus its completely useless and ignores the fact that the ships themselves need renovation due to having poor fitting and too few slots also hacs and field cs dont have role bonuses and perform their job just fine
my first thought is gtfo with a shield boost bonus on the jag but the rest of the post makes sensewhile you hit on a lot of the points in which specific afs suffer that is an insane boost you are giving them more slots for more tankingewartackling as well as a 50 dps increase in a lot of these ships i can imagine that ishkur with 5x medium drones killing any t1 cruiser in the game i dont think with these changes afs will crush and obsolete t1 cruisers but it is something to look at in testingmainly i dont agree with your original statements into why afs are broken t2 ships are generally poor value for the money sure some t2 ships can do unique things but are still very expensive as a heavy tackler they are certainly not outdone by t1 frigs or ab ceptors with a plate an ab ceptor with a plate wtf who flies that i guarantee you that the ishkur is many times better than a plated ab taranis or god even a t1 frigate have you flown t1 frigates lately in the heavy tackle role and by heavy tackle i mean you dont need fast lock speed just lots of ehptank and tackle and in that role the ishkur soundly squashes the ab plated taranis which anyone caught dead flying would probably be laughed at on the killboards and insanely squashes a t1 frigatebut ive read the this thread a few times and comparing it to other ships ingame and like the idea of a minideimos in the enyo 400 dps on light guns omfg and the other changes seem okay like the hawk sounds cool and 4 rockets on the vengeance is definitely needed im supporting this thread and unlike herschel yamamoto i have actually been keeping up on afs and know that ccp has scrapped the af ab speed role bonus and is back at the drawing board minihacs for the win doctor evil cackle also giving you bonus points for effort
learn to fly the taranis tbh theres a good video from a ranis pilot on youtube that proves you completely wrong and eats ishtars for lunchotnot supported tho the af should not take over the role of the ceptorthe sisi changes allready make them a lot better even though a few could use some love like the hawk but lots of them are fine as they are on sisi
congratulations youve managed to make my ishkur invincible and leave my hawk still in a very very sad stateishkur does quite well now and does not really need a buff  especially on the level youve proposed all the damage im dishing out now with blasters plus i dont have to be within 1km to make it work greatthe hawk on the other hand needs to be able to do more damage also why not a bonus to missile explosion velocity which will actually help it do the job you claim your revised version can
a while back ccp came up with a new way for alliances to submit custom alliance logos however the new system for submitting the logos to ccp is not working correctly and for some time now it has been impossible for alliances to have their logos put into the game tears is a year old now and we are still waiting for our ingame logo basically if you didnt have one before the change theres no way to get one currently and ccp seems to be ignoring our pleas for an explanation see here id like ccp to address this problem or at the very least fill the rest of us in on its statusthank you
no give minmatar webbing ships web strength role bonuses and have done
i posted this in another thread and ill add it here too instead of a mod or rig or changing ship bonus all that is needed to fix webs is a script when equipped the script gives the web 75 speed reduction but reduces its range by 50 there problem solved and it helps minnie recons because then they will have a more powerful shorter range web or a weaker longer range one

blah 5 minute rulethis
this is good thread
is it possible to bring up the issue of pos mods onliningdont get me wrong i know they are a timesink and they should be but the degree they are is a little too much how about a way to online multiple items at once but for every module added it slows the onlining timer by 13 or something ie online a 10 min mod will take 10 mins online 2 10 min mods at once takes 23 mins but they both online at once onlining 3 10 min mods takes 36 mins etc so you have a option of setting it all to online at once but taking more time or doing it the old fashioned way
give players the ability to create plastic wraps the things used in courier contracts thats it so you can select say 10 mods and ammo select wrap from a menu and for a nominal cost payable to station owner you get a plastic wrap which you name good for organizingetc especially fritter pilots moving other peoples stuff or alternate ship fits fuel packages etc
check this out and support instead of this thread
noterm limits are removed by dictators and others that think too highly of themselves if only a few people in entire playerbase can represent that playerbase then the game is screwed anywaythere should be a 1 term limit maxmazzilliu you have to realize eve is not rl maybe get a rl and do something productive like run for public office in real elections instead of the fake elections for csm

i dont see myself squirming more like laughing a talentless hack like liiza would quickly fold under pressure in the csm without someone more experienced to leech ideas off or threaten the other delegates with acts of violence if they didnt conform to his way of thinking i was merely pointing out some issues with his platform issues which he has failed to respond to which shows how seriously he takes his bid looking aside from the fact that this man is a delusional sociopath his manifesto comes across as being written by a borderline illiterate not that ive ever claimed to be tolstoy but he could have put a bit of effort into ittldr i think you should probably complain of meta gaming and being packet bombed some more undead
you have been on the csm before i must have missed that

tbh having you support your friend damar should be good enough for most people to not support him  so keep on whining about other people whiningbut you say it should be about capturing systems and bigger goals to at the same time you say current plex system is fine npcs are fine  everything is fine with fw so what are you thinking that damar will do stop changes to npcs halt any changes to plex systems and system capture so many people dont share your view of fw and they should just change their minds and finaly a question for the canidate himselfwhat is your vision for fw what changes would you like to see for th e future that you will push for do you share your great friend bad messengers views that all is fine if people would just change their attitude it would be greathow about fw missions what are your thoughts on those success after all you say you made billions farming them should they be changed nowwholesale overhaul of plex system  or a few tweaks here and there how about a real platform instead of i know current fw mechanics the best of all  and for those turned off by ankhs tone and attitude the link s provided show that csm did more to bring attention to fw issues than i had thought they didfor tosi you seem upset that damars public personae in local is quiteover the top and out of line many people have experienced it defend it all you want its an issue that wont go away with a gee whiz damar is having a bad day today
while you cleary stated that your csm will make sure pervs and damar rocario does not get any kind of reward stated many many times in your public channel stated many times to us constant calling of us as exploiters with out proof while you plex with high caldari standings so npc agro wont work on youlets see what we got while you were on csm1 even bugged plexes nothing done here only worse2 fw lp rewards  increased mission income3 incoming nerf to obviously easy lpisk farming machine that should not have been there in the first placepsso uh nice ideas too bad ccp seems to thin other way around and not many your ideas has been noted
the current mechanism is flawed i believe ankh was talking about need for fw rewards and this is what we got pervs and some others said that system was broken the moment it was annnounced yet it came along anyway i really wonder how come people required weeks to understand how to farm themwe did the missions before the changes anyway mostly to have an objective for roaming gang now there really is no need we were given the key to bank vault so should we not use itthe mechanism should not allow continuous declining of missions this makes it possible to essentially have an assembly line for lp like caldari have and i reckon gallente have as well in nennamaila areaas said in other thread make declining not possible except the one in 4h but if mission fails dont give standing hit this would reduce the functionality of assembly line it might also bring more roaming fw missioner gangs like we had to lowsec instead of current soloingalt tanker setups which rarely pvpdamar rocarionbrigadier general
i smell bull as we dont even have a public channel communication with the majority players goes through evemail or private convosand we dont discuss individual corps internally erik didnt even know pervs by name until the week before fanfest when we discovered the complex timer exploit and the people involvedtake care is there to make eve better for all players no matter what side they are on not to pursue a petty vengeance agenda damars sole purpose on the csm is because he has beef with me and thats exactly why i dont believe he will be a good csm that represents all factions not to mention all playstyles in evedamar just wants to keep everything in fw as it is as evidenced by the earlier thread in warfare and tactics which is exactly why he has beef with me and take care because we raised issues such as rebalancing the fw npcs and fixing broken plex mechanics which he doesnt want to happen
it has been bugreported like qazillion times for around a year by now
could you perhaps create a seperate thread for all the issues you have with me and pervs along with all the proof you have about said exploits it would be nice to keep this thread somewhat on topic and relevant without getting all personaldamar rocarionbrigadier general
yes that must be why the qa department and game design didnt know about it until i reproduced it in their test environment in front of their eyes it may have been reported as a glitch yes we did that many times too but not with any reproduction stepsitd be nice for the people that consider voting for you to actually know your personality i have always been open about who i am and what my goals are on the csm so you should be doing the samefirst dont turn it the other way around i never had any issues with you or pervs it was you that harrassed slandered and stalked me personally and with your alts whenever i was logged in it was you that applied for this csm just to annoy me further and to secure your own interests your entire business here is a personal vendetta because you are totally obsessed with griefing me so dont play innocent here and ask me to please bugger off when your entire purpose here is to provoke me starting with that slander that alt made at the top of this threada lot of the time when you speak in militia channel its ankh did this whaah a lot of the time when you post on the forum its ankh said this whaah youre even using some alts in gallente militia to spam ankh should shut up whaah every time i say something every time im flying around with a few people and you show up in local you cant help yourself ranting at them how ankh is evil whaah sometimes these tantrum sessions last for over half an hourall of this is just because i was succesful and happened to be on the opposing faction and because i wanted to make some hardneeded improvements to fw while on the csm which you considered a threat to your personal playstyle remember when i was in the caldari militia then you suddenly turned around like a leaf being nice and helpful just because i had another faction icon next to my character all of this is why i dont believe you will represent all fw players if you get on the csm just the ones that are on your personal bandwagonyou shouldnt be pretending to run on a fw platform you should run on a i hate ankh and will secure my fw interests platform
this is a platform i can believe in3 votes
pile in guys best platform 5
yes you two are very much alike treat the csm as a joke and backstab your voters to further your own selfish agendas luckily your support like bad messengers will only show the rest of the players exactly what type of person theyre dealing with
ack ack that is the sound of me laughing like the penguin from batman returns fyithis is as opposed to you treating the csm like an extended job interview and forcing your personal ideals and beliefs on the community and devs while trying to promote irrelevant and dangerous issuesps i was trolling i would no sooner vote for this imbecile than i would allow an american rendition technician to remove my toenails
you replied to one questiondo you have any details to your platform please let us knowbtw any thoughts on high sec pos mechanics as they relate to fw any changes needed there you think
for the full list of these irrelevant and dangerous issues please consult my wiki entry youll find subversive things like the skill queue scary live events unnecessary drone improvements irrelevant 00 reviews and a whole range of fw issues which noone gives a  about not to mention a whole lot of community feedback issues which of course was my secrit plan to brainwash them with my personal idealsyeah right
you must have shown them the bug before early july where i reported it with 5 easy reproduction steps  bug update even states that it was fixed internallybut some gms dont even know what i am talking about when i report abusers so dont see why qa should be any different to be honestand after that lobying you did last year to get medals and rewards for plexingvp you really shouldnt play the personal interest cardmy dealings with damar have always been fair and reasonable perhaps he behaves differently in his natural habitat i can only judge by what i know first hand far too much slander and bad blood to do otherwiseshameless plug i would like to take this opportunity to encourage everyone to support my proposed vp freeze perhaps ccp will listen if we show that we would rather have fw dead than broken
which i didnt do as csm which i explicitly said so and didnt use csm channels for i just responded to the eve mails that ccp sent to all the top fw players any player could have done that i even informed ccps csm team and the rest of the csm of what i was doing exactly to avoid such conflicts of interest and to maintain transparencymy csm work has been entirely honorable and only on behalf of the eve community personal interest never came into it and i dont like these accusations you are making after everything i have done for youerik is already at it i heard
you are not even aware of your own narcissism and whiney attitudes are you this is a computer game ffs
according to hilmar eve is not a game but an emergent nationand its not narcissism its mainly debunking all kinds of false accusations and slandersome people here claim that i was driven by selfinterest and only proposed things that were on my hidden agenda this is simply false as proven by my issue list which proves i did serve the interests of the eve community as a wholethen there are those that say i did it for the trip to iceland yes that must be why i flew back a day early so i wouldnt come into conflict with my study and didnt participate in the recreation during the evenings so i could be on time and sober during the meetings the next daynext comes that accusation that i only favor the gallente side of fw right that must be why i started playing for the amarr faction my first real player corp was the ammatar free corps and i often hang out in providence when im not in fw i actively participated in all four militias either with my main or my pvp char gasp ankh has a pvp char to evaluate the situation on each side in fact the only time take care did something exclusively for one faction was when erik asked ccp for a medal for caldari veterans which include corps like the 22ndlast there is this claim that i used csm powers to get myself fw medals not true i just rallied some other disgruntled plexers after this stupid plexing contest ccp held which turned out to have no meaningful reward and used the normal ingame communication channels you can see my issue csm list above here there is no give ankh a medal issue in there right
yeah its a computer game i hear nothing but whining from you on most of your fw posts before you got elected to your benevolent position we will just have to disagree that your a spammy twit or someone who actually cares about the balancing of mechanics of fw mob consensus points to the first
how is this all related on damars csm application
if the goons dont vote for him thats one reason for the rest of us to consider it unless its all just one big happy troll in order to secure 3 members instead of the guaranteed 2 you never can tell with that alliance tickerben
the funniest thing about the reputation we have with some eve players is watching them tie themselves in paranoid knots looking for goonswarm conspiracies where none existedit i probably shouldnt point this out but if we were looking to infiltrate a third goon onto the csm which seems like an unnecessary effort looking at the success weve had with just one or two we would probably have someone run on one of their empire alts with no ties whatsoever to our alliance ticker but of course were not doing that eitheror are we
elementary question needs to be added to surveydo you think eve is dyingediti run the survey and it seems i cant get the list of other candidates score offered at step 4 are you the only csm candidate in database so far
we will initially evemail the password to all candidatesi was i added 2 more dummy candidates however the website is still just in testing so right now everything you see is purely for demonstration only
that site is just what we need its too boring to read all the lenghty introductions of all canditates also that site is easy to use and seems to look nice and well designedi should vote the op just because of that site
moon mining should be permitted in 04 security status systemsplayer activity should affect system securitymarket trades should work as a marketplace and not a brokerage ie players buy from chosen sellers not from the lowest priced item in the marketall items should have market buysell slots exceptions assembled ships used bpos and all bpcs
many thanks dierdra and a good jobif it would be possible to have the candidates list issues in order of preference it would tell us far more about them egbounty hunting as a profession needs some love from ccpgame mechanics should be developed to support a banking system in evemining in its current form is not profitable enoughit is easy for 3 candidates all choose strongly agree because they want the pvp vote trader vote and mining vote however if they were asked to rank these issues in order of importance we could see which issues the candidate cares about most and would therefore be likely to bring up with ccp
candidates can mark a specific number of questions as important this is weighed when calculating a users fidelity with that candidate it is also displayed in the resultsletting people sort 30 questions from most important to least important is not going to happen though
looking forward to my mail

got my voteits funny seeing lark squirm in this thread would open again
i dont see myself squirming more like laughing a talentless hack like liiza would quickly fold under pressure in the csm without someone more experienced to leech ideas off or threaten the other delegates with acts of violence if they didnt conform to his way of thinking i was merely pointing out some issues with his platform issues which he has failed to respond to which shows how seriously he takes his bid looking aside from the fact that this man is a delusional sociopath his manifesto comes across as being written by a borderline illiterate not that ive ever claimed to be tolstoy but he could have put a bit of effort into ittldr i think you should probably complain of meta gaming and being packet bombed some more undead
you have been on the csm before i must have missed that
see the bolded text above
lark youre starting to sound like you know who you should probably stop now you forum stalker
if youre interested say so here ill find you if our times sync up i prefer out of character since those that run for the csm are running primarily as people not charactersedit and before i interview someone ill need your website or forum post so i can familiarize myself with your platform if you have no platform i probably wont spend any time on you
i have and it really doesnt make a difference
lark youve let all this get to your head stop saying dullard stop posting stop reminding me of that monkey obama with all your lies no one cares its only amusement now just like the csm as a whole
im sorry i cant hear you over the sound of how awesome i amalso i would like to see exactly where i have lied
i see what you mean here but i do not see the point of limiting the way people can fight there wars some tactics might not be fair but hey hire a merc corp to teach them a lesson if they annoy you and you do not posess the guns nessesary to teach them a lesson yourself

it was never this threads intention to insult take shots sling mud or imply negative connotations about pl and the goons were talking about one csm who was thrown out and another who is misbehaving badly who just happens to be a member of plthe only reason the goons were mentioned is because of their guaranteed multiple seats on the csm due to their voting muscle lets keep things in perspectiveits an issue about lack of csm oversight by ccpits an issue when a csm members can continue to misbehave so badly yet the playerbase has no mechanic or recourse to throw them outits an issue when a csm forcefully pushes ahead issues so unpopular that the playerbase reacts with such anger issues which common sense dictates should have never been given a second glanceits an issue about entire alliances flexing their voting muscle to keep clowns like these in office who clearly have no business being therethis thread isnt going away anytime soon sure it may fill to thread capacity but other threads similar to this one are already starting this cannot go unaddressed for much longer
i beg to differccp have a super power up their sleeve that super power isdrum rollthe power to ignore you indefinitelythis issue has been addressed time and time againthe petitioning process requires persistent spamming whining crying ing more whining and more crying before you finally get a proper responsei have said time and time again if ccp felt that it had to do something or that it wanted to do something it could and with great effect and to great lengths very few topics are monitored by the gms and i think that you may very well need to hit report a few thousand times before it happensfyi try hitting report on this message and see if something happens to this thread for once xd

you should convo her ingame if you really want to do that ive spoken to her and she would actually be willing to stop posting in exchange for gtc i just didnt have the money on handedit i guess she could accomplish that by posting goatse in exchange for plex or something
concur  while making exploration more accessible is definitly the way to go it should not be impossible to specialize in it that is getting into exploration should be easy but mastering it should be hard if you just bring the skilltraining down across the board you end up with everyone capable of finding all sites since the skill training required is so low
agreed
not signed but i think that ccp should implement a relatively simple change to the naming of eves characters1 you get a true name which is the name you currently assign to a character when you create it that is fixed and cannot be changed however it is not visible on the overview any more2 you get aliases or nick names this is what is visible on the overview and you can change it any time you like
yes back to the top btw
sigdthis would be sweet
for better than five years players screamed incessantly for a skill queue and ccp said we werent going to get one because swapping skills makes us play more often csm gets elected makes an issue out of it we get a queue in the next expansion even if they never did anything else ever again they earned themselves a hundred free trips to iceland with that one
the real question is did the skill queue come about because the csms pushed it or was it already on its way and the csms simply took credit for itsort of a chicken and the egg questionsupported
leave it to somebody who doesnt know about the csm to trash the csm i went through a term and it wasnt a picnic i spent between 8 and 15 hours a week just on csm stuff not including playing the game itself in exchange for six months of this i did get flown to ccp hq and fanfest but it was for meetings and representation of the devsplayersill admit that some members even in my own term acted in ways that i find repulsive and warranting a ban however the csm as a whole is a devoted group of players who earnestly want to make the game better arguing without knowledge is the height of arrogancyif you cant take off your black glasses theres nothing more that can be said about this thread other than troll
for better than five years ccp was a broken record with the same stupid explanation and they certainly sounded like they believed it the csm as an actual elected body with several thousand votes behind them got listened to in a way that a string of random forum whiners simply never would be you can ignore eve general or fi threads far more easily than you can ignore an issue where the carebears alliance leaders pirates industrialists and general crazy folk all agree unanimously the latter seems to have been enough to make ccp realize that we meant it and it wasnt just a few disaffected folks of course this thread is at least 80 trolling anyways so i dont expect ill convince you but hopefully someone else reading this thread will take note
the problem is that the csm isnt an entity itself as always its the people who actually take action not the group designationtheres no use in worshipping a group for what it did when the original members who took action arent even in it anymore
one flaw in your argumentset up a forum provide a support this topic button provide protocol to recognise items with 1000 or more support ccp has a viable solution cost free and argument freeyou can worship csm all you want but at the end of each day it is but a face its ccps idea of how to get the players involved to make a fantasy landscape where they can say the players are in control but truthfully arentwhy do thisit looks good it brings in new players despite that they dont know about it it strengthens the community take your pick there are probably a few hundred theories supporting community based voting systems strengthening the community thats all it isat the end of each day each subscription period do you think to yourself omg this game blows if it had a skill queue id keep playing ill answer for you no the games development has continued with remarkable progress and not through players ideas the game keeps expanding and attracting further players
op is a crying little babby
this is correct though you only took the logic halfway by the same reasoning that its inapropriate to worship a group for what it did because the members change its also inapropriate to condem the group for the same reason the logic cant work only one way you are correct that its the individual csms that make a difference each will leave their own mark on the group and the process some leave their mark as actual civil servants  doing thier best to help the game and the players some are more like pop stars or teenagers with spraypaint cans  the only mark they care about is their name in lights or putting thier gangsign on the wall some leave a mark like a stray dog on a random fence post as long as they stink up the place on the way out they are happy if we the public want percieved problems with the csm solved we need to vote in candidates that think the same
thats what you got from my post learn to read you ignorant fool also learn to spelllearn to spellcheckagain my point was csm does so little and is so corruptible that ccp can do the job betterplease visit your user settings to reenable images
no no they did noti vote for the clown commission for a name change

i know this is something that concerns a limitednumber of people but i think its reasonable for br and serpentis to get some buff it will at least get some people out of highsec running missions there is more profitable than the blood raiders or serpentis inquest

very reasonable
someone should look into this its about time

i support ya ziggyinteresting idea i wouldnt mind having it 
i first tried eve two or three years ago back when you started with the 800k sps through a career path no neural remaps yet at the time but it was after ccp introduced bloodlines so you had a bunch of achura monk characters who minmaxed into the 5charisma builds i tried it with a friend of mine who was into mining so i did have a fellow player to keep me interested in the game we both ended up quitting thoughi fired eve up over the past summer again with the same friend from twothree years ago the first thing i made sure i would do this time around was to join a player corporation asap my friend joined the same corporation but the corporation i joined was primarily a small gang and pirate corp with industrialmining as an afterthought my friend has sort of quit right now while im still going strong in the gamewhat is the lesson here get into a player corporation as soon as possible and participate with the corp its not enough just to be in a player corp see my friend who has gotten bored of the game once again if anything instead of giving new players free sps ccp should change the starter tutorials so that they are more clear and concise regarding the importance of player corporationsin fact perhaps the first tutorial pages should point players to player corporationspeople have raised the issue of corps requiring sp requirements that take months to fulfill first of all the majority of the corps i have found doing this are null sec corps which makes sense because you need to be somewhat selfsufficient by the time you get to null because not all the amenities are available out there for example basic skillbooksmost corps do not require an explicit number of sps ive found though at most they just require a basic skillset that can be trained within hours for example pirate corps usually require at most that you have the skills to use a frigate with point for tackling mission corps sometimes require that you can salvage so you can tag along as a salvager on l4s instead of running a bunch of l1s solo etc
we only really have to problems1 other players telling new players they are worthless until they have 20m sp2 other players telling new players to do nothing but train learning skills when they start outthis  the only anoying thing about low sp is when havingto solo pvp against a high sp t2 pimp my ship  then you get dplaying this game now for 3 months or so low sp on 3 accountshaving a blast with it learning new stuff every daynothing like having every so odd days a new shiny toy to play with
dont let the door hit you on the way out
this is the first remove local thread ive seen in at least a year that has an actual serious proposal for how to replace the intelgathering function local provides after removing local whether it is workable or not will depend greatly on how the upgrade system works which i dont know enough about to comment on that said it seems like a better approach than 99 of the others and i almost have to support it for novelty value alone so yeah youve got my thumb
cheers to this idea well presented as well as very useful it will truly make 00 a blast hom3
sounds like it could make things very interesting
this could work in theorywho would have access to ftl communications technologywhy would the 4 empires have ftl communications in deep 00 in the first placethe pirate factions could steal the tech and use them for their respective regions sisters of eve and ore would undoubtedly have a system set up for their regions see the news from april concerning the release of apocrypha the drone might have a system though only to talk to each other in 1s and 0s i would assume drones wont have much to say in the words of man but delve period basis providence who would fund such endeavors and why for the benefit of everyone would they really care about thathow did such a system get put in place in the first place the joviansmy idea would be this affect only sov altering systems reason being that would be the highest concentrations of main sequence anomolies as depicted in seylin and 3hqc6 ore system in apocrypha trailer and news archives empires and factions can and do have the resources to upgrade and replace ftl comm arrays due to the msas recurring and in some cases multiples at the same time appearing over an extended amount of time the electromagnetic fields have damaged such equipment much like how they dont work in the first place in wh space at least until someone talks but you still have frequencies that each ship sends out and you can be on those channels ie cb radios for all us old fogies out therealternatively who actually uses constellationregion chat anyways 
yes thats a very good ideawould allow for much better opportunity of tactical movement in a single system as well as in constellation  regionalso would increase the tactical value of small systems that are easy to cover with the onboard scanner as a checkpoint sort of thing to restrict hostile movement into your space
and my axe
removing local but making it a system upgrade has long been a proposed idea
10
sovereigntybased intelligence tools which allow people players to be better informed about hostile movements through their space is something that ccp are actively looking at  it was mentioned at fanfest as something that could be tied to the new dominion infrastructure once such a system is in place ccp have said that they may look at the local channelso yes a system resembling what you suggest is already on ccps possibility list
this is a neat ideaprops for bringing it upthe other side of this would be making sure an alliance has motivation to install these rather than say delegate a system probe or gate watch character
i think its a great idea you have my suport
because of the above portion of your quote i could support a local nerf
this  finally a remove local idea that made sense
as the two posts i quoted said  this is the first thread ive yet seen in the assembly hall that offered a reasonable replacement for localthis ia at least worth investigating
like it 
although many details are still in development one of the things i really wanted to point out is thisdominion  super caps being more of toe to toe ships of the linedominion  no significantly defendable way to manufacture supercapsas both a former super cap pilotsuper cap producer i think we need something to allow manufacturers a little peace of mind with dropping 2080 billion in components into a relatively weak structure supercaps are going to be exploding soon after the dominion release there needs to be some way to replace these losses in a better way than relying on the defense of a posi know i dont have the solution so im not offering one but im asking other forum posters for their ideas ive had a few but found many holes in them here were my ideas as starting points for discussion outpost upgrade for 1 supercap assembly line i think this is too safe but also this does not include docking which is whole other issue i would propose the super cap can be launched from the outpost to put it into space possibly without fittings system upgrade creating an ability to assign invulnerability to a csaa pos with some heavy restrictions and a high cost for the upgradeanyway your turn discus
so supercaps came into the game there was no sov 4 it was basically a galactic shell game no supercaps survived supercaps  massive waste of isk then sov 4 came along to ensure u built your supercaps now you get to the point everyone has supercaps which in my opinion is fine ccp disagreesnow we are going back to the shell game which means building supercaps will be very very difficult anyone who isnt the sole powerhouse alliances will be unable to build them giving major advantage to the powerful over the new guysanyone who is anywhere near empire wont be able to build supercapsthats pretty much ccps goal i thinkkind of stupid only inevitable that they need to revert that and give us invuln pos again
i have run hundreds  maybe thousands  of hisec level 4s most of them in isinokka which is not the smallest mission hub there is how come i never get salvage ninjas theyre scared of my awesome dangerous notorious combat powah cdto date 1 dude turned up in some super ab frigate and swiped the quafe from cargo delivery never even bothered trying to ransom it back to me i figured that if the guy was that thirsty then who was i to deny him a cool refreshing quafe that was i dunno early 2008then a few months later in 2008 a tri suicide gank squad bump tackled me at an acceleration gate scanned me and advised me to learn to fit your cnr properly before going on their way my feelings somewhat hurt but my shields intact i docked up for 20 mins just in case of some freaky h4xploit aggro shennanigansin fact so far from being plagued with salvage ninjas i find that i literally cannot give the salvage away im frequently too lazy to loot and salvage since i usually mission when im either too unwell or hungover to play real eve and my offers in local of salvage ae4 anyone who wants it x up in local go unheeded
sigd everything else aside at the base level  this still comes down to someone profiting off someone elses work without there permission and that is by definition stealing why would loot be considered property but not salvage both where created because of a direct action by a individual and without that direct action would cease to have been created they at least should have the same policy on loot and salvage rather than 2 different policies considering that they are both created the same way come on guys its simple logic you work for it  you get it the asteroid analogy is null bc asteroids are already there and dont require someone triggering them
i see that in some systems i mission in some guy offers up the salvage and he gets no response i think it has to do with the type of game eve is its a trust no one for they are out to kill you type game
i am a mission runner and uber salvager i make as much money from the rigs i produce from the salvage than the missions themselves i dont even run missions for the isk just the standings loyalty points mods and salvage i love ninja salvagers they provide an excellent service they cut down on the items in space making the system run smoother and during high body count missions they can make the salvaging fun as you race for the same wreckage to be honest the loot in that gallente bs will often sell for a higher price than the 10 armour plates that could be salvagedso im afraid i am with ccp salvage is for everyone lifes like that
i love the idea of being able to set up traps with distress beacons would be pretty awesome could have something flying a damaged hauler with no cargo but in low structure so its got fires and whatever just when the hero gets closer cloakers decloak and start shooting this guy to bits
distress signals perhaps a temporary beacon on the overview would be greatmake it something you have to carry in your cargo hold and deploy and that industrialists can build
the proposal is for a distress signal not a comegetme signal
there is but you want to see it flash on certain occasions but be able to turn the flash off without having to open it first
which are
for examplewhen someone buys something from you or sells something theres also people who want it to flash for all events just to know their wallet changed but be able to turn off the flashing without opening the window its a simple fix really
supported
should have made it that way to start withsigd
yup logistics suck in this game anything that makes it less painful might actually encourage me to haul my own 
its quite populated already sure some stretches of it are fairly empty but a lot of it is populated enoughsure more things available to make isk in lowsec would be nice but taking l4s from highsec and putting them there isnt really a very appealing idea to methe only reason why l4s in highsec bother me is that they really make the whole riskrewardetc story pretty pointless but thats another story and highsec is too good a cash cow
it is the highsec l4 carebears who buy lots of the faction goodies people get in lowsec00 you really think they would bring them into lowsec
ok so im doing this 1010 plex down in 0mist lets say it drops me this nice gist xtype xl shield booster it took 5 of us to run this plex so we are hoping to sell that booster for at least 12bil who buys this is there even a darknesss who does shields i doubt that so pretty much its the lvl 4 mission runners who buy it hmmmnow lets move lvl 4 missions to lowsec if they goto lowsec for missions they sure as hell arent bringing gist mods so they arent going to be using those anymore if they stay in highsec and run lvl 3s they sure as hell wont be flying a ship which needs an xlbooster so they dont need to buy it once againso suddenly this module that currently can sell for a load of isk suddenly has absolutely no buyersnow factor in sov is being fixed and people are going to populate 00 more iow more of these modules are going to find their way to jita to be solddo you really want to nerf missions when nerfing missions leads to 00 being extremely worthless
dont worry guys i just talked to jason edwards in a private chat and he admitted that this idea was ok
please turn on brain before engaging mouthfirst of all  even if a bunch of missioners were to go to low sec it wouldnt mean a free for all against salvagers because that would mean shooting someone who hadnt drawn what concord considers legal aggro which means that if you shot a fair number of salvagers your sec status would tank and youd not be able to get back into high secsecond  mission runners use pve ships and many fly solo pirates the largest low sec population use pvp fits and fly in groups whats more they are pirates  killing other players for cash loot and fun is what they do so mission runners die like flies and get disgusted after about five minutes of this and go back to high sec space and run whats therethird  ever hear of these things called l5 missions they only exist in low sec guess what no one does them except for bored pirates who are there anyway and even those only rarely as it leaves them open to getting ganked by other pirates if l5s the best paying of all missions arent being taken advantage of what makes you think l4s would bethis is either the least well thought out comment ever or a very sad attempt at trolling ive no idea which and dont much care
i didnt write that they were going to defend their salvage without legal aggro they just wont get concorded in low sec while doing so which gives them a chance to claim their salvage if they need it so badlywell mission runners may as well team up and fight backif you put less npc ships in missions reduced server load but give them more tank make them smarter and increase itemsalvage drop rate then mission runners might team up and get pvp fitted ships as they wont need a huge amount of tank to survive a mission anymore that would give them the ability to defend themselves when they get attacked by a pirate gangreducing number of npc ships on a mission and increasing possibility of losing ships because of other players actions might result in missions that are less of a grind with more thrill and thus they will be completed faster and more fun accomplishing such a mission would be more meaningful too however if it decreases chances of a pirate attack and imbalances the game a signal strength of a ship in a deadspace would have to be increasedwhats more why not introduce a new faction warfarelike thing something of a playercontrolled lowsecconcord whose pilots would be the only group authorized to get bounties from kills assuming a pilot who has a bounty on their head had indeed committed an action punishable by the concord players would put rewards on heads of those who give them troubles in lowsec and antipirate oriented pvpers would get the opportunity to kill pirates for a profit without risk of getting killed by other antipirates that might even make rewards oriented pirates become antipirate adding balance to this new systemadditionally players would still be able to help each other by attacking a pirate flagged with aggro in a similar way it happens in cvas nrds providence although they dont get literally flagged as its 00 im more interested in a way players backup themselves that would eventually mean that mission runners would be getting some feeling of being collectively bonded to other mission runners and it might increase social interaction between themand about lvl 5 missions why not make them a feature of 00 security space one of solar systems improvments would be a possibilty to include inviting lvl 5 agents to holders space players inhabiting 00 usually have means to run them effectivelythat would possibly mean making 00 the most profitable space in game thus encouraging their holders to fit their ships as well as possible to get an edge during defense or attack in case of conquering a well developped solar system and becoming new customers of providers of high meta lootto sum up maybe a perspective of less time consuming and more enjoyable missions would convince many highsec mission runners to go to low sec especially if they could call and much more likely recive a back up and maybe it would make them consider exploring even deeper more hostile parts of new eden where the fortune and epic battles have their place
well mission runners may as well team up and fight backif you put less npc ships in missions reduced server load but give them more tank make them smarter and increase itemsalvage drop rate then mission runners might team up and get pvp fitted ships as they wont need a huge amount of tank to survive a mission anymore that would give them the ability to defend themselves when they get attacked by a pirate gangyou still dont seem to get it missioning is not for the sake of finish a mission it is for the sake of earning isk ever tried to finish a lvl 4 mission in a pvp ship lets begin1 how do you aggromanage with shortrange guns 2 how do you slowboat your way from one group of enemy to another group that is actually 100km away in a 100ms battleship microwarpdrives well those dont work in most missions im afraid no macrowarpdrives then how the hell do you pvp3 without aggro management how do you tank 1000dps with a buffer tank and without missionspecific hardners4 if you plan on use an active tank how many cargo space are you prepared to sacrifice for cap boosters even if you do fill your cargohold with cap boosters are they gonna last 30 minutes 5 where do you get ammo not a lot of traders go to lowsec right5 how do you plan on getting your salvage ship to do the salvaging provided that the station is going to be camped 99 of the timeand about lvl 5 missions why not make them a feature of 00 security space one of solar systems improvments would be a possibilty to include inviting lvl 5 agents to holders space players inhabiting 00 usually have means to run them effectivelythat would possibly mean making 00 the most profitable space in game thus encouraging their holders to fit their ships as well as possible to get an edge during defense or attack in case of conquering a well developped solar system and becoming new customers of providers of high meta lootwhy would 00 space holders who can get billions and billions of isks from moon mining where they dont need to move a finger would actually start grinding missions what makes you assume a particular 00 space that is claimed by a particular corpalliance is actually safe for that alliance to missionrun with pve ships
tldr version  pve fit ships are not pvp fit ships and vice versaa missioning gang will likely end up bringing a pvper with them for defense purposes but at that rate they are likely to not come at allthis isnt as cut and dry as you think it is
if you decrease number of npc ships and accordingly increase their tank and chance of loot the end isk reward should remain unchanged in fact the point is to decrease dps received from npc rats and increase the threat from other players so those boosters you have mentioned are most likely to be used only in case of pvpwhether people decide to go for range or power in the mission it will be entirely up to them the point of flying in low sec though is to have at least a wingman that way players would get some feel of tactics in pvp so for example one player is focused on a mission while other makes for an escortdont forget about the idea of player controlled concord in low security systems antipirate warfareas to station camping if the pirate vs antipirate warfare is introduced it wont be so easy to camp a station anymore as players will feel much more confident to fight pirates assuming the presence of well trained antipirate pvpers in the system and response of other mission runnersbut you have to assume that as easily as pirates will be able to find you ninjas will be able to do the same so going to get a salvager ship might be a bit pointless but having a wingman lets say in an ecm ship who could do salvaging for you and buy you more time to defend yourselves from pirates before the player based concord arrives to help you might be a much better ideaof course it will be very important to balance the mission reward time and threatwise as you might get ganked by another player at any time im not saying that losing a ship shouldnt hurt its eve and it should but the new system should as well be encouraging players to fly in low sec as imho it seems as a next logical step to make more money and do new more interesting thingswhats more i cant agree with you that the only purpose of missions is to make isk they should give fun as well because thats what computer or any other games are for and the fact is that right now missions are extremely dulleconomy i doubt that moving lvl 4 missions to low sec would limit the availability of items and ammo because if there is a place where money can be made people who want to make it will very likely find a way to do soand the last thing in my opinion its not the point to make space for running level 5 missions a safe place 00 isnt a safe place and definitely shouldnt be such its a place where you go to hit the limits of wealth and power you can get in eve but i dont think it should be an easy task and not for every player it is an easy task despite the bilions youre thinking of ccp for one is reinventing the 00 and many players even of well established and well managed alliances have to get funding for their warfare by ratting or doing plexes why dont give them a chance to do lvl 5 missions too
if you decrease number of npc ships and accordingly increase their tank and chance of loot the end isk reward should remain unchanged in fact the point is to decrease dps received from npc rats and increase the threat from other players so those boosters you have mentioned are most likely to be used only in case of pvpive already said you have no clue what you are talking about a buffertanked battleship cannot tank anything other than current lvl 2 and maybe some easiest lvl 3 missions without aggro management thats not even 150th of what a lvl4 mission may pump out so you are going to reduce lvl4 dps by 150 and buff bountiesdropsloops by 50 how realistic is that and thats just the issue with tanking you have not addressed a whole bunch of other issues there if you want to balance the lowsec mission rewardrisk then it perhaps needs to be at least 30 times as lucrative as highsec missioning or even more lvl5 missions are already 10 times as lucrative as highsec level 4s and do you see anyone bothered doing themah running missions is for making isk this is a basic fact of eve and it does not really depend on whether you agree with it or not if you dont agree that 11 2 dosent mean it isnt being ganked in a pve ship while missioning doesnt make the mission any more fun either maybe for the griefer but not for the mission runneredit something i do agree with you is that lowsec and 00 needs buffing it needs more reasons for people to go there other than to feel good about themselves that they are a pvper for instance better rats more interesting warfares generally things that can improve for players flying pvp fitted shipsbut lowsec missioning was never a good idea in the first place that ccp might just as well remove the lowsec agents alltogether the main reasons ive already stated missioning with pvp fitted ship is totally unfeasible
this is actually not true there are some ships that work very well for pve with pvp fit long range hacs for example also many battleship pvp fits work okayish for missions with proper aggro management but it still doesnt help you when you get attacked that you got this extra dps from the rats against you
um dude the best level 4 agents in the game available from all faction are drumroll you guessed it in lowsecnobody uses them currently why do you think that isdepends on which rats youre fighting and which mission if it one of those deadspace gates that drop you in the middle of 6 close range battleships then a range tank isnt going to help if its a guristas mission they can actually hit you up 150km so no help here either so unless youve got some magical tanking ability that works for both pvp and pve then it doesnt workbesides the dps on a hac vs marauder is pretty thin missioning in a marauder in highsec nets you more iskh simply because you are able to finish the misisons faster and you never have to docksafe the interruptions from seriously bored people camping you in station for hours on end puts a massive dent in your iskhnot that i really care about the iskh i care more about the fact that i can actually play the game when i log in and not sit a smack a bunch of people that are too boredlazy to actually go hunt something that might yield some action you can have my isk but my time is precious
i didnt say hacs are exactly fast in doing that job and range tank works even with those missions where you get dropped right into the middle of them wc 4 angelsansha eg i tanked in a cerberus was just orbiting long range and even when guristas hit you up to 150km they dont hit hard if you keep movingcerb can even do c1c2 wh stuff soloand i often pick the cerb over my golem just to have to actually fly in my ship and not just sitting at the warp in point killing things
ok some of you read my original idea of a tier training systemproposal tier training system and it was shot down hard which is okay it happens but rotten fruit can become great fertilizeri very much like arens adaptation instead of a main character having two skills going at once the second going much slower as i had it have it so your alts can be learning skills but at a slower pace than your primary maybe decided on which skill queue you set up first or assign it to your characters which is primary secondary and tertiarywell this any better and good thinking aren
iwas actualy was about to make a topic of this i made an alt after a month of playing and then it said i couldnt train skills i just wanted to make a gallente and try a different line of skills and see how i liked that and maybe make it my primary instead and maybe become a pirate on my alt but there is no way im delaying any training on my primary just to indulge my need for piracy should totaly enact this and make the alt 4x train time that way its slightly harder to abuse it
again not supported if you want another toon training at the same time get a 2nd account multiple toons training on the same account will just lead to people training toons to sell them
i have to disagree strongly with the idea of training multiple characters at the same time my reasons are simple characters develop their skills dictate who and what they are which takes time playing time i understand the desire to try different races and skill trees but without putting in the required effort these skills are meaningless worse they belittle the effort put in by players who have dedicated their time and resources into developing these skill trees finally the last thing needs is old experienced players like me who know how to create powerful characters quickly running around with pirategriefer minertrader alts game balance would be blown out the window to the detriment of newer less experienced players
make outpost build cost 10x more outpost spam is horrible 00 is not supposed to be empire
i would say number of outposts right now is fine however i do expect number of outposts to increase vastly with dominion as little alliances taking a few systems build an outpost for quick response to attacks on sov
is there a limit on the number of outposts if not maybe a limit of 1 per constelation hmm i dont really know if tehre are already any set rules but i agree 00 shouldnt be full of outposts
on the other hand with sov4 invulnerability going away a lot of the incentive for the recent outpost explosion will go with it  most outposts dropped in the last year or so were built in order to sov4 a constellation with an existing outpost plus the r64 rebalance may deny alliances the easy passive income that the outposts were funded withthe only current limit is 1 per system  our w4 constellation in delve has 6 playerbuilt outposts it would be pointless to impose a restriction on other alliances following suit if they wished to do so but as above postdominion there may not be either a good reason for them to bother or the income to afford it
what is the point of limiting amount of outpost that one can buildif i want to invest billions into making my alience empire and improving logistics why shouldnt i be able to
oh boy your in for a surprise ccp wants more people in zero so in a matter of speaking it could become empireprobably will be and no more outpost in zero means more market and more competionim like that
not supporting for 2 reasons1 its called economic growth2 dominion will change the entire landscape with the new sov system id rather wait before calling it quits on the system first as far as outposts go
id like to see the 1 per system limit raised but player outposts should ultimately be destructible in some way
because eventually every single 00 system will have an outpost allowing players to build them and not tear them down can only ever lead to an increase in outposts
because eventually every single 00 system will have an outpost allowing players to build them and not tear them down can only ever lead to an increase in outpostswhy are these bad things
currently the default setting is to lock every item that is put into a secured container not just station ones i propose to make the default setting unlocked instead of locked because its annoying having to set up the cans to not lock items in your personal hanger and it also takes ages to unlock 200 items ive also had these settings reset on me a couple timesplease ccp
this
not sure maybe some kind of addition to gang boosters restricted by race would be an idea ie say minmatar characters in minmatar ships get an additional 2 from the gang boost a pilot with skirmish links  mindlink providesshouldnt be too much either way as that would just lead to countless whinefests on how overpowered the amarr  caldari bonuses are while the gallente  minnie ones suck still not supporting id rather see some thought put into something like that first
i would rather see the bonuses work the other way for example for every lvl of mimitar crusier you have that grants 1 bonus to all speeds on a crusier level this means that if you can fly all 4 races ships you would have additional knowledge and experience that would augment your combat ability
many a times i had to click the blinking wallet and journal icons and thus opening them in order to get rid of their shiny status id like it if there was an option to get rid of having to open the menu and simply right clicking them sounds just rightsituations where this could come handy are limited only to missions im afraid when you want to know when an objective is completed so you could warp out however its still a nice feature for us people with minor cases of ocd who prefer having all their buttons having the same background without cluttering their interface with stuff you need to close
it was suggested i create a thread about a post i made to the other pos topicwith the advent of dominion and the change in sovereignty mechanics in game id like to suggest a change to the logistics required to fuel possid like to suggest the creation of a new component called a pos battery which could be manufactured from the current components required to fuel them bpos could be created in order to facilitate the manufacture of the new pos batteries the pos battery would benefit both the players and ccp by eliminating extra calculations required when determining remaining fuel for a pos for the player if a pos battery was 9000m3 and had a 7 day lifecycle the player would only have to be able to count to 3 to fuel a pos rather than open the calculator and multiply the fuel requirements for each component subtract the remaining components already in the tower and load the difference in our refueling ship the isk sink that is pos fuel components would not be lost if a blueprint requiring those same components existedfor ccp rather than the 7 or 8 if in empire calculations per pos per hour the new pos battery would be 1 calculation per pos and could be made per hour or once per day lets say there are 10000 pos in the eve universe that would reduce calculations by between 144 and 158 million per dayfinally a secondary battery for reinforcement of towers or the current stront timers could still be usedpos batteries could be designed so they exist for the same duration as the current pos fuels and could be stacked in a tower or theyre lifespan could be expanded to 10 20 or 30 daysplease feel free to expand on or criticize this proposal as you see fitcheers
not signedi recall reading something like this in the past i think they called them fuel rods or similar which imo is a better name than pos battery and many of us shot it down for the following reasons1 every manufacturing slot in empire would be jammed full of these things assuming these completely replaced fuel ie you could no longer use regular fuel to fuel a pos2 you would need different racial ones for each race if you switch tower types or have the wrong ones you have to waste more money getting the right ones vs just replacing the racial ice fuel3 liquid ozone and heavy water are used in variable amounts it depends how much pgcpu is used in your tower unless these were separate to the fuel rods you would not save anything by offlining unused modules like you currently do4 more of a waste of time for people like me who routinely fuel pos come on the math is not hard at all and there are tools such as my pos that you can put your tower fit into and then just copy and paste the amounts in the tower to figure out what you need if you dont want to do math under this system i would have to buy bpos of the fuel rods research them unless they start with a 0 wastage factor like ore compression bpos waste more time building them haul etc
i sort of like the fuel rod idea but the problems with it are real youd do better to just delete the current npc good requirements and replace them with one npc starbase fuel cell item with the same cost per hour less flavour but also less hairpulling
im with hersch on this one too many pitfalls here
the other posts above mine have pretty much covered the reasons so ill just add my own no to the list
while doing a wormhole with a group of corp mates today a bunch of us were rudely cutoff eve regularly unfortunately it happened so much so that one of our members didnt come back perhaps he also had net problems after the disconnection anyway my proposal is a sitter functionwhat is a sitter functiona sitter is a player you elect that can log on to your account using their password it contains severely restricted roles much like a corporation designing its titles etc and allows a player to give access to other players without providing their login passwordswhat i would like to seewhile the sitter function is a fantastic idea it cant simply be thrown as is into eve online it wasnt designed for the game however limiting its duties can provide a viable function with minimum consequences for ccp the sitter function should prevent players from undocking from stations contracting selling buying or transfering isk from wallets the sitter can however use the ships if the character is already undocked and to its maximum potential pvp pve etc the sitter can also add skills to the queue however cant remove skills from the queueusing this approach should prevent any abuse of the system furthermore should the original owner log on priority access should be given to them preventing other players from bumping them off
you can jumpdrive to 4cb7x from loads of lowsec systems that border highsec pretty much safely cyno ship is likely to die sure but big deal a couple mil vs 25bil bpo similarly u can jump right back to that same lowsec systemgetting the bpos is easy the price is high sure but its mining barges its like the main horse of the game mega important due to this theres much competition in the barge markets
verys shall i list the changes ccp have made over the last 20 months that have affected the majority of eve players your point is mute
the existence of a spell checker is moot if you dont know the word you want to type in the first placebut uh no sure if this stupid stupid stupid suggestion was ever implemented it would be a lot easier to get a mining barge bpo that means everyone would have one that means you wouldnt make money building them or copying them so we must ask to what end whats the fricken point once you make barge bpos dirt cheap they become worthless so why screw up the game for a bunch of players for a change that will net you or anyone else no benefit
damar you had to see this coming youve made your self known to have a very touchy temper that is remarkably similar to my 1yr old niece when she isnt getting held if you dont get your way you rage if someone kicks you out of a defensive plex you rage we are talking about the csm here people do we really want a self driven tempered person to be on the csm yes i am gallente im sure ive said enough to you in local for you to know i dont like you and your whininganybody in the world from any side will argue biased this whole thread screams it but the fact remains is you can argue as much as you want about plexing mechanics you want but until you direct your attention to the pvp aspect of faction warfare the rewards of pvp and the plexingpvp interaction you will do nothing for faction warfare you could go on about how what rats do what and how they are unbalanced and how ships can tank or not tank plexes but tbh a lot of people ive spoken to yes mainly gallente dont give a rats  no pun intendedtbh i think from a pvp standpoint that if the whole plex system was redone not system control because the caldari earned their captures fair and squareor so i think to fit for better pvp interaction make control more easily loseable dont flame me im not done yetmaking plexes more dire more rewarding to the player as far as experience you will see a lot more people from both sides all sides get more involved see the map become more dynamic like alliancescuz ive been therealliance space changes a lot making it more dire and rewardingim no expert about plexes and i dont claim to be but the general consensus is that plexes can get boring to the average player and they lose their zing after awhilethis should be about making faction warfare more attractive and dynamicrewarding experience wiseonce you do that the experiences are that much better even if all i do is defensive plex at least make it more dynamic and critical to the point people want to do them more often lastlyi have even thought about running for csm myself actually but the truth isim too biased i talk to much in local and im a die hard pvpr who cares very little about plexing but only when the occasion risesim sorry damar but i will not be supporting you keep on plexing tho 0pvp ftw
yes and yes
because he posted this falsehood in his application which ironically describes his own character very well
one of the many reasons im not canadianalek panders like no other
happy bday alek
if there is no other pirate candidate ill gladly vote for you with all of my accounts  including the ones in very hostile corps to us
ya i heard alek moved in with nidia in the basement of canadian mothers everywhere
you got my vote alek
good initiative dierdrawhile many of the issues discussed at the time are no longer relevant you might get a few more statement ideas from this thread dating back to csm1ben
so when will this go livemike
nice and very handy tool one thing though if i answer  to an item and a delegate has the  opinion aswell it registers as blue  good match while it should be a perfect match  green methinks
this is definately an interesting issue  one i thought about a lot while yes you have exactly the same choice as the candidate on the other hand it is not really a choice but more the absence of a choice you both have no opinion or dont know i have chosen not to award the full fidelity bonus because this issue apparently doesnt matter to the user you match with the candidate but because it is on an issue that neither of you care about it is only a weak matchi would be open to discussion about this however that is what this topic is for
i see your point but i still think no opinion really is an opinionwhen a delegate thinks a topic is not interesting and i think its not interesting aswell id say its a good canditate to vote for  a candidate that shares my interests and noninterests
born freeeeeeas freee as the wind blowwwwsssla la la la la traaaa traaaado do dodoo dooo dooooany chance of someone please getting round to typing up the meeting minutes so we can have a look at the responses its kind of part of your job in fact its arguably 100 of your job so just do it do itindeed writing up a couple of pages of a4 is payment for that squiffy free jaunt to danmarkesland where you did all those jolly things remember that where you had those lovely gourmet rolls and were made to feel really important by the devs then you had some beers and two of you got tipsy and it was hilarious when bozzer fell out of his seat and the penuts went everywhereskunk
disappointing performance on both sides 
i am interestedi am runningmy platform is only a few planks wide however i personally would like to see minor shifts in some basic mechanics but i do believe a lot most of this csms mandate will be reactionary to the dominion expansion it is hard to build a platform when we do not see the land we will be building uponthat being said
i will vote yes when a baboon is voted in to protect a banana warehouse
nice troll lark i applaud thee sir
reporting this thread as nothing but trolling and spam now i mean after all larkonis is not allowed to run because of breaking the nda so this thread is now pointlessdont worry lark maybe in future terms when if ccp allows you to run i am sure no one will bring up what you did and dash your hopes for another chance at a spot in csm right
im now at half the amount of surveyed people im aiming for its going pretty fasta new tally of what people are interested in1 ingame socializing2 missioning3 wormhole exploration4 exploration outside of wormholes5 sovereignty wars6 00 wars that arent about sovereignty7 market trading8 mining9 low sec piracy10 factional warfare pvp11 null sec piracy12 bounty hunting13 factional warfare plexing14 factional warfare missions15 suicide ganking in high sec16 scamming other playersso far not much has changed and it seems that what some people are saying is in fact true the carebears have taken over eveonto the list of what people want to see ccp work on next1 new shiptypes with a convincing lead btw2 exploration3 and 4 a tie for missioning and the sovereignty system is it will be in dominion5 mining6 ship ballancing7 factional warfare mechanics8 ingame socializing9 wormholes10 piracy11 bounty hunting12 trading13 suicide gankingthe new shiptypes could apply to all gamestyles potentially but here we see a similar trend of pve things getting priority over pvp thingsby now i have discovered how misleading forum data can be ive taken the survey ingame looking for people there who will take the test so it doesnt just represent the people that go to the forum and i think thats where this result starts being different from the trend of many pvprelated topics on the forum as a csm member i would therefor be promoting better ingame tools for the csm to reach the ingame population with to make sure that no type of player is overlookedthere are many more things that i am learning as this survey plays out and ill keep you posted once ive reached the target number of participants im aiming for ill post the whole thing in full here
edit better formatting for readabilityone of the problem of the current survey is that people rating something as high priority can mean it in 2 different waysfor example industrialisttrader and there is nothing about industry in the survey btw ccp work on mission  high priority  what he want remove meta 0 loot from missions malcanis ccp work on mission  high priority  remove them rpg interested mission runner ccp work on mission  high priority  make them more interesting variend and let them affect eve in some way 00 player alt ccp work on mission  high priority  make them faster and more profitable i need the isk for my 00 character pvpand so on
you are correct there is a plethora of reasons why people vote the way they do and this survey by itself cannot clarify those reasons but it gives me a good indication of what to enquire about next in surveys to come which will be more and more specificalso its not entirely true that i have no indication of what people vote high priority for for instancelooking at the first list i asked what players find most important in the game missinging comes in second this means that missions in some way shape or form are indeed coveted by players then looking at a part of the survey where i ask where it is that people do their missionsthe overwhelming majority do them in high security space this is what they appear to want otherwise they would choose to do them in low security space so looking at the last list of what ccp needs to change missions scoring as they do i just checked missioning to be on 6th place now you could argue that even though a still considerable amount people want them to change it doesnt weigh up to the overwhelming amount that plays them in high security space so if you where to asume that all players who voted for missioning to be looked at next mean to say that they should be moved to low sec they would still be overruling an even larger group that wants to play them in high sec
i am not going to mess about with numbers in this thread though but i would personally like to see about 5 minutes per fighters when carrier is not in triage 25 minutes for fighters in a mothership and about 1 minute for fighters when a standard carrier goes into triage and starts consuming nanite pastesince not all fighters have the same hp i think time should be the factor of the repairlocking the bay would complement the idea of having repairs time based which i support myselfseeing as the carrier would be equipped with a maintenance bay i would also like to see it possible to repair standard drones however these should take up slots so that you will have to choose what to repairsince this mechanic would largely be when the carrier is in a safe position unless you are in triage i believe the repairs should only be limited to the amount of time the player has and for what amount the carrier can stay in this positionspeeding up repairs in a carrier by personnel would lead to situations where people only put the repair personnel in the cargobay unless they have a hefty cost
sounds like a intresting idear
i like this you have my support
let me make somethings clear i support this idea however from a game design standpoint i doubt a repair bay will be allowed theres too much room in there to allow someone to pack a whole new flight of fighters in there i think a carrier or mothership should have the ability to designate repair this drone at which point an eta to repair time pops up after the name of the drone drone repairs cannot be aborted and drones under repair cannot be launchedin general this idea is quite good though signed
of course its not perfect after all weve seen so far as of late its nowhere near perfect improvements are still badly needed and they wont happen unless ccp steps in and intervenes the csms have already demonstrated they cannot conduct themselves accordingly they cannot be expected to police themselves
wow i thought this and threads like it are all about how easy it is to troll people in this forum section thank you for clarifying thisits serious business lol
the csm is a joke needs more clown its not worth the toilet paper it was created on
bonsoir
any news on thisuncripple the scanner give us our lag back
i hope these wallets come with their own personal corp bins feature just like corps have
not sure about the approach but the idea of continually making everything quickly accessible to everyone seems to lead to a generic experience for all personally i think eve could use an added element of specialization within all of the careersmaking exploration more accessible and also adding depth to it seems to be the best of both worlds
i support a deeper probing tree id also like to see more distinction between combat probing bonii for detecting ships maybe and exploration scanning
requesting a devblog on the layout of the servers for dust514as an australian fps player i know that only local servers are playablethere is no possible way to play an fps game on a foreign server from australia as you end up half a second behind the other playersas such im very dubious of what the final result of dust514 will be when it comes to nonus marketswill it be setup to have geolocated servers which then feed data back to the ccp server farmwill dedicated servers be able to be run and authorised by 3rd partiesif no dedicated servers are planned how does ccp plan to mitigate latency
something ive been wondering about too not because i own a console but just because im curious
ccp is always on the bleeding edge of technology so to make sure aussies can connect to the servers in london they will be getting a dedidcated t256 line to kangarooland this tacheyon256 line will wirelessly broadcast tacheyons through the earth to ensure a quality connection that bypasses the great aussie firewall
sorry aussies bad news is no amount of softwareserver work is going to alleviate the fact that australia has been in dire need of additional long haul fiber for years if i didnt get laid off a year ago id be building the conversion station here in san diego but the company went under and lost the contract who knows where the project is now but hopefully you gamers down under will be getting some telco love soon but again id like to point out that there really isnt very much ccp can do in terms of the latency you guys are plagued by its a telco problem
another now concerned aussie battler wondering what the future holds
this might help with our horrible speedsbut as for multiple servers all over the place  i guess well be waiting for the next media release from ccp before we find out asking for a devblog about another game isnt likely to yield much of a result

isnt this thread in the wrong forumif we are going to have functional sounds they need to be pleasing to the ear randomize the sounds a bit no looping plz if you do something that gives same warning 3 times in a row in 20 seconds that warning sound should be disabled for 2 minutes allow players to disable allmost any sound they dont like and yea i have quite little trust on how ccp is going to make the voices workcountdown to session change 1 minute aggression cooldown 30sec 10sec and 2sec aggression cd warnings also smaller 5sec warning to docking countdown when gate cloak is ending and maybe session change in station when changing ship orand maybe perhaps visible timer somewhere on the ui you know all those annoying arbitrary cooldowns fleet session change alsoeve female voice announcement when global criminal cooldown endssound when fitting a ship and youre out of cpu or pgannouncement when concord incomingwhen pushing the warp button eve female voice could announce warping in 6seconds estimationannouncements when science and industry jobs are finished same kind of like when skill training finishessound when bumping someone getting bumped or crashing into anything that slows you down sound when youre bugged and stuck into an asteroid that is actually 20km away from you when you try to dock and youre too far away game should tell you how close you need to be to be able to dockwhen cap booster runs out of chargeswarning when module is about to be busted of overheating but id rather see an improvement on the graphics on the uimessage or sound when first neutral or hostile pilot is added to your overview sound when you are targeted first timeno sound if you are allready being targeted sound when you are being aggressed first time possibly if you can code it have eve female voice say the name of the aggressor would be neatvarious messages from the eve voice female when you lose a ship or a pod it was great when i lost my first shipor was it a pod and she ridiculed me i was like hit with a bat and like wtf half a joke here
as much as i would love to think that poking ccp repeatedly gets the job done they dont exactly have a pristine track record in regards to fw the bug that they marvelled at in iceland was reported and presumably reproducedfixed internally back in july which is obviously not the case they have stated that they have no idea what causes timers to behave as they do which gave rise to the defunct cloaking exploit and the timers refusing capture they removed mwd from vanilla missions back in the day specifically to prevent people from speedtankingkiting npcs due to limited ai yet they turn a blind eye to the exact same thing in fw to top it off they have not had a single employee utter the words factional warfare if you disregard the round table on it that isby instantly freezing vpstandings gain from plexes but leaving them for pvp purposes ccp can have the time they need to make it fair to all parties and squash the bugs either by changing the mechanics or finding the offending codei just do not have a lot of faith left in ccps ability to fix the mishmash of code that fw mechanics is comprised of
hey way to line up like sheep but shouldnt you be off somewhere servicing your masters
why would we when were getting serviced right herei mean this is grade a whine without purpose hereyour argument is flawed on so many levels i have to wonder what the few thumbs up you got smoked this morning and where i can lay my hands on someflaw 1fanfest had some video footage of the things that the csm has brought before them and in said graph were marked out the things that were implemented denied and the things in development to say they do nothing is a bit of a stretch to say they do much is also laughable they are attempting to strike a balance a give players a voice the things they raise come from usflaw 2if you find it utterly corrupt feel free to toss your name in the voting booth and create change from the insidei know baffling concept that you should actually do something yourself to change something you dont like but the shock will pass and your life will continuein the end one guy cheated and one girl is adopting a real life politics by attempting to form a lobbying group something i find both fascinating and a bit funny the first got impeached so to speak the second is well within the rights of just about every elected official in the history of elected officialsif you dont like it its on your shoulders to do something about it not  and moan in some barely passable thread where you insultpick apart the spelling  of those who dont share your viewsperhaps you dont hail from a country with a democratically elected government so your not used to seeing the system at work a flaw that i can understand but without even trying to do something yourself your efforts are laughable at besttldr you can change the system if you get off your whiney lazy ass and do something for once in your lifeedit upon reflection your sig on this very forum makes the hypocritical nature of your post so much more evident

i just gimped this pic to show why ship painting is a bad idealikely offensive photo that shows exactly why we cant have a ship painterconsidering ill probably get in trouble for this post only goes to prove why we cant have it ingame
i like the idea
i dont really see why we need jump shuttle and what will be purpose of that ship but idea seem to be interesting so you will get my support for this
jump shuttle with carrier jump range that requires 110th fuel of black ops requires only racial cruiser 4  that  also it would actually require about 4 capital jump drives for an average price of only 35m but seriously get a ing life and train for  buy a bobs andor carrier like the rest of us did
the op failed to outline the main thing needed in assembly hall threads the whyas in why in the world do we need a jump shuttlecruiser the only answer i saw in the op was because he wanted to travel easier more importantly he wants to trade bpsexpensive but small gear easierthe i want things easier is not a reason that will gain much support
im against that idea use a capital ship if you want to jump i dont see the use of that ship
this is not true a blackops can jump you to a covert cyno in a recon same with stealth bombers
jumping cargo and player isnt inbalanced but jumping player only is
yeah they can do that but if you look at the questionanswer again im pretty sure hes asking if recons can cyno around they cannot bo cyno them around they cannot cyno themselves around
i own a carrier a jf and a black ops also it requires exactly the same fuel as a blackops feel free to check mins whatever i dont do indy i dont trade fail the purpose is to get from a to b preferably intact with a tiny little bit of cargo its more economical but incredibly fragile less ehp than a cruiser never mind this would be candy to any sort of blackops squad one volley from a redeemeretc  dead before you even load system or lowsec gatestation campers or highsec gankers if anything its more dangerous to trade in its a shuttle use it like a shuttle pick stuff up go places die etc its not a complicated concept lol an easier way for cap pilots to get around it requires 23 of the skill training of a cap to usethis requires 2 more people more fuel and you have a range of 4 ly they cant jump around by themselves
for people who use jump bridges on a regular basis you will understand that everytime you switch system you need to reenter 99 of the time the same password on your ship in order to use the next bridge this can grate after multiple bridges need to be used and seems a bit uneccessary i propose that the password be saved on your ship until you change it or logout people who dont have access should support this on the grounds of making 00 more accessible to the general player in the future its akin to being asked to enter a password everytime you want to dock in a hisec station
it is saved per session just that every jump dockundock bridging is a session change in ccps terms 
notice i removed the term session from my post before this response knowing that some pedant would make this response
no people who mess up the password then discover themselves outside the bubble and dying dying is a good thing
well due to those stpd 5minute timers for postings my answer was typed like 30minutes ago it just took ages until i could actually submit it p
dont worry about it man but to be honest i would think my idea of a ccp session is a lot different to yours im thinking more along the lines of viking suits and kegs of beer vovanyway im attempting to improve the usability accessibity of the game whats not to support
you know you almost had me with the usability thingie  but then he said something about killing now i am undecided again
internet tough guy has a somewhat valid point but hes not looking at the big picture if you make 00 more user friendly you basically get more people into 00 which means a lot more targetsalso jump bridge netowrks and poses nearly always have different passwords so you will still have people bouncing off pos shields so its not really a very strong counterpoint
i had originally posted this in the ideas forum i dont know why theres an ideas forum and this one seems redundant butanyhow heres that post
yeah might need a few tweaks and a nit of ironing but all in all i can see this becoming advantageous
shame the new players are not going to enjoy waking up at night to switch a skillit was the best part
no they dont need 510mil sp d you got to be kiddinghowever learning curve is pretty horrible in eve you fly kestrel for like what a week or maybe few days then you got a cruiser then battleship in a month then uhm yeah you dont really need anything else what i mean is that t1 frigs are pretty useless very fast its not about giving more sp at start its kinda relative nuclear physics or something
and for those of you who think this will make moving through 00 more difficult consider thisif you look at the star map as it stands now there are very few systems without sov this proposal would really only impact those few systems where no one claims control the rest of 00 would function much like it does now this proposal just creates pockets of black space where no intel can be gathered on fleet sizes just by simply looking in local
aha so you are proposing to use the sov markers as a kinds of frequency tower activate the tower activate localwouldnt that counter why ccp has stated the sov changes in the first place
woo page 2 of support
would be perhaps the best change ever all of us old guys know it
supported
why does everyone only want local removed in 00 if you gonna do it do it good and remove it from lowsec and empire as well that will make empire wars a heck of a lot more fun as well
takes with one hand gives with the other1
i fully support this idea
think of it this wayyour alliance controls 4 systems in a 6 system constellation by placing the sov markers in those four systems you gain all the benefits intended with the release of dominion in my proposal those four systems would be dark until the marker was dropped and the upgrade acquired for local intel then it would function just like it does now it alerts anyone in system that a hostile is in local and from what corpalliance they belong to nothing more so the two systems that are dark would be potential sources of invasion or where a hostile fleet could operate unnoticed think about the ramifications for a momentcloaked ships would essentially disappear from existence this would also make a black ops fleet more relevant without having to buff the ships directly they could hide in a dark system and wait for a covert cyno to be dropped who knows the possibilities are dynamic and much more intriguingbut remember this would also benefit those who wish to operate in 00 without being noticed just as much covert mining ops with cloaked rorqs transport ships and a super cap loitering at the only gate could make for a very interesting encounterand if everyone started fitting cloaks then all the penalties associated with cloaks come into play there would be a targeting delay for most ships that would usually make a cloak prohibitive for a roaming gang so pilots with probing skills would be invaluable as they scanned down such fleets i would also say that while this idea would technically apply to all of known space in reality the empire factions and npc 00 factions would have fully functional local channels all the time so empire space wouldnt change at all unless you wanted to say certain constellations could go down for a short period of time turning empire local into 00 local for sporadic time intervals who knows thats not the purpose of this proposalvery few systems would be without local intel this proposal only creates opportunities for engagements in systems without sov where both fleets may be unaware of the other until the carnage ensues i think that would be fun
i dont think weve heard enough information yet about exactly what ccps plans are i would agree that there ought to be some degree of compromise  there are so many supercaps already out there that their current owners are set to have a distinct advantage for a very long time after a transition of this kindwell be seeing quite a lot of abortions if theres no mechanism to protect any of the outstanding jobs what i suspect is going to happen is that supercap production is going to be linked to the new infrastructure hubs which are going to be a lot harder to take down than your average pos rather than outposts
imo there are at least an order of magnitude too many supercapitals active at the moment
supercapital abortions wont be as near as common as you think if alliance finances take a major hit postdominion
my opinion  htfu my advice as a pro ninja be tidy you wont have any problems if you dont leave a trail of wrecks for everyone to salvage i dont care how you do it but if by the time you finish the mission you also finished salvaging ninja salvagers wont stay around you for very long
consider the law of the sea regarding salvage the owner of the property must negotiate with the salvor who retrieved the salvage when you are running missions you are not the owners of those wrecks that would be guristas or sanchas nation or whoevers ships you blew up legally you would have no rights to the salvage any more than anyone else salvage is a free for all tbfh you should be glad that looting wrecks is counted as thiefnot supported
i dont ask for much in this game i dont ask for boosts or nerfs all i ask is that ccp give meus what they said they were going to give us years ago an interbus lp storeso come on lets get this into dominion it cant be hard to implement surely even if it means just having one system in the whole of eve where we can trade in our lpthumbs up for this please 
i cant see what interbus would offerfactional cargo expanders oo
ccp said this was coming out soonfrom here specifically interbus we are aware of the missing interbus station it should be ingame q1q2 next yearthis obviously hasnt happened
tldr srylike the idea perhaps link it to the fleet broadcasts window evemailthe cyno mechanics or even have an autoconvo window open to bootohhhhhh the possibilitiesi have to go lie down now
on the weekend of september 4  our illustrious csm were flown to ccp hq to represent the player base on numerous issues for a face to face meeting with ccp7 weeks later  were still awaiting the results of that meeting sanitizing the minutes for public view should not take 7 weeks 49 days or 1176 hours or 70560 minutes or 4233660 secondsfyi  everyday ccp makes us wait is taking away from the credibility of the whole csm program

does it really matter tbh csm  useless to the players the minutes mean nothing
sure we would finally hear how many free beer they got and what mushrooms mazzilliu tried
case example of player sentiment you think ccp would try to avoid  no follow up doesnt help 
gotta say i didnt even know the meeting had happened yet i dont pay the most attention to ccpcsm but i troll the forums enough that i would have noticed if minutes had been posted id like to see those even if past csms have proven themselves next to useless guess well have to wait and see if these did anything goodof course to see that minutes will have to be provided
after fanfest someone posted saying that the minutes had to wait for information from ccp that couldnt be given until after fanfest i read this and thought it made sense however a lot of drama could have been avoided if they had clearly stated weeks before that it wouldnt be until after fanfestits been 2 weeks since that post and the minutes still arent available now its gone from mismanaging information into negligence if someone doesnt want to do the work dont run for csm and especially dont accept the secretary job
yup current csm sucks need to set some standards imoedit and if its so bloody secret  then at least tell us that your are busy plotting how to best take advantage of teh situation up ahead i it took you this long so youre probably way past the the point of saying nothing and remain inconspious while hiding behind the banner of stupidity
look no one important cares you cant have your minutesnow quiet down and go look at our pretty dev blogslook youtubewe are a 21st century company allright what you still arent happy stop telling everyone or marketing is going to yell at us againno we really mean it
your primary assumption that the csm still has any credibility left after mazz got done with it is flawed and thus your argument doesnt matteri am now adopting an attitude of until its in the patch notes its not happening
oops  my bad
i think several members of the csm do still have some credibility and are working hard its just a minority of members actually not doing their job not acting ethically or just who like trolling people a bit too muchthe euni guy seems to be doing well with a lot of issues brought to the table erik and avalloc brought a few themselves some of the others might not have raised as many issues but theyve contributed in meeting minutes
yes please
no reason i can see not to incorporate thisgood idea op
for the wallet only i dont believe theres similar options for the journal or eve mail or at least i havent found themand the journal i want to see blink when ive completed a mission but why should i have to open it up to stop the blink i know ive completed the mission now and there is nothing in the journal i need to look atso still doesnt solve the problem of you want it to blink but dont need to open when it does
supported please make sure it is possible remotely as well as in station
yes please good idea can we have virtual bubble wrap too
keep the negative quality lvl4s in highsec move postive quality lvl4s to lowsec if they want reward they need risk
this is just not a good idea nobody goes to lowsec mission not because they are not lucrative since there are bunch of q20 l4 and highqual lvl5 agents there alreadybut because anyone with a sane mind will not drive a pve fitted ship into a pvp area neither will someone use a pvp ship to do missions want to buff lowsec at least do it not at the highsecs expense
beside the small advantage that missiles dont care about tracking and so can work at short and long range without problems while guns cant what pvp capabilities has your cerberus seriously a cerberus tanked to do a level 4 mission as you claim to do has no tackling gear and probably an active tank or your completion time for missions is so low that you get maybe 10 millionshour if the wrecks dont despawn before the end of the mission so it is a awful ship for solo or small gang pvp the only pvp option i see for the ship to claim to use  if fitted to do a mission is to be to stay away from the mission entry point and warp out in a hurry if someone warp in
you know how they put the tech level on the corner of the item in thumbnail i was wondering if there was someway for them to label mods with thier meta level instead of memorizing or looking in the show info tech information is just as important as meta level this would also make sorting through loot found a lot eaiser when you got a massive haul from corpmate rat kill or pvp killi could get up off my lazy butt and memorize everything but i only bother with the stuff i use and given how many items are actually in eve i wonder if this wouldnt be too much of a hassle or if anyone else has any reasons why this hasnt been implemented
we need diplomats
you sold me on small gang warefare consider yourself 2 votes
we control your game etc
id argue that not knowing how to deal with an issue doesnt mean you dont care about it far from it as a candidate i strive to be a democrat acting whatever way my surveys tell me to so i cant know in advance what issues ill be championing or how i would vote on things how does such an approach factor into your program as it is nowedit sorry about the character mixup im aynen i just sometimes forget to switch to that character as it has this one automatically selected
it is less about the candidate voting no opinion and more about the user voting no opiniondont care if an issue doesnt matter to the user one could argue that the answer of a candidate has no effect on the fidelity score one way or anotherif i dont care about bombs in low sec it doesnt matter if a candidate supports the idea doesnt support it or also doesnt care because well whatever it turns out to be  i dont care however i choose to award a lower but positive fidelity score if both you and the candidate dont carei admit that i do feel a candidate should be knowledgable in all parts of the game even if it is only the basics if an issue comes up that you dont know about you should research it to form a proper opinion the csm process needs people who can make informed descisions to support or not support an issue not people who dont care or dont know and just roll the dice remember as a councillor you can only agree or disagree with an issue there is no dont care option in our meetings as such i want to encourage candidates to take an actual position on issues afterall the only thing you show as a candidate who votes a lot of dont knowdont care is that you know or care very little about the game
stop beeing lazy its been 2 monthsrelease the minutes
from this post  it appears that this individual is responsible for the results being published and indeed this was the last post the individual has made on the forums 10th octoberif this person is indeed responsible we can gather that some event has overtaken hisher eve life and we can only hope it is not a serious onenever the less would some other member of the csm care to put him or herself forward to take the publication process forward in melissas absence and point us towards the results of the meeting literally a yesno answer to each of the points would suffice and would take you what 20 minsor perhaps as is often the case once the freebie holiday is out of the way all enthusiasm for the csm goes out of the window skunk
i am interested also you can read my platform here theres also a discussion thread here
any csm candidates wanting an interview published in our weekly newspaper can get in touch with me or any of our other staffers or join the channel evetribune to request an interview

x i support this msg
trying to create more dept to the current system seems much more reasonable without such progression it is more of an miniprofession than a career you can dedicate yourself to my support is for that basic concept not for this specific proposalone basic way to do this would be to add new sites or phenomena that require their own skill or skill set to make available these sites should provide their own set of rewards on top of the normal ones so they would retain their value for explorers regardless of what happens with other professions in eve
its reasonable for ccp to lower the threshold for getting into the exploration profession new players should feel like they can do that without waiting weeks but the op has a solid gold proposal in simultaneously expanding the skill set at the top that way everyone who long ago invested the time in electronic upgrades v and survey v and poured their hardwaitingon sp into astrometrics hacking and archeology will still be validated for having done so id also recommend making the good sites harder to pin down and wormholes even more so and boosting the strength of npcs found in them that way the brand new player who can scan things down and exploit what heshe finds still needs some help from a corpmate or more time spent on combat skills in order to get at the bounty

most of your post reads like this blah blah blah talk about wo purpose if you disagree with me state your reasons flaw 1once again i will state my meaning in full csm does nothing that ccp could do themselves wo the massive ammounts of corruptionseriously you think one person in csm could change the system what brand of stupid are you there are now some very respectable hardworking members of csm their work will always be overshadowed by the scammers and thieves in csm one bad apple spoils the bunchone guy cheated no one guy got caught theres a difference a few mins of thought would lead one to wonder how anyone even could be caught it would be so easy to avoid the fact that this person didnt take the minimal effort required suggests to me the depths that the abuse goes towelcome to the internets if you dont like it the doors double as exitsthis is democracy lol if you say so fine if this is democracy i want a way to recall csm members the people demand itchange wouldnt be enough for the csm though the recall suggestion does interest mei dont have a sig attached to this particular player perhaps your referring to my corp attachment could this be another dig along the lines of players in npc corps arent playing eve rightno that cant be it because its supposed to be a democracy and players should have a choiceblah blah blah sandbox and all thattldr at least this guy attempted to explain his reasoning to me in his i was hit with a baseball when i was 5yrs old way
everything you said would make sense if it werent for that fact that you and everyone else in pl are trolling and spamming up the placetalk about contradictions and a half
funny this is at the bottom of all your posts looks like a sig to mei find it ironic simply because instead of actually doing something your just ingalso thanks for proving my point about insulting people who disagree with you im sure it would go a long way in helping get a solid support base should you choose to run for office and do something to create changeand yes when you hold an election like we do cast ballads and tally votes to see who wins its a democratic election pretty bad that a guy who was hit with a baseball when i was 5yrs old can grasp that and you cantyou want changes get elected and get things brought before ccp to help change what you think is a problem but please for the love of god include as many of your conspiracy theories as humanly possible especially about the greedy underhanded cheating that obviously must be common place in the csm god knows that catching a guy within days of his transgression hasnt swayed me either brother down with the manbasically the long and short of it is you complaining that ccp has included the players when they should just be doing this themselves then complaining about basic human nature if you expect some pious self righteous person to be your csm rep then you either work hard at getting him elected or you run yourself but telling other people how they should act just makes you look miserably sad
so my alliance automatically makes my posts garbageso since ive never heard of your alliance can i just automatically assume that your posts are as irrelevant as your alliance i mean thats only fair right judging the things someone says by the company they keep is as tired and old as most things you read on these forums so suprised im notalso last check trolling by anyone anywhere is not against any form of law so im not sure what your issue with what my alliance affiliates post on the forums i mean its a simple sollutiondont bite the hook so damn hard

i think this would be difficult to do for huge battles however battlefield2 already includes a feature where you can get at this exact type of recording within 48 hours of it happening other precedents are fighter pilot training this would be an excellent addition with regards to all eve movies being able to essentially edit the battles together from multiple angles for another independent developer that already has this implemented aces high 2 wwii mmo flight sim allows recording of this data for later editing in dev provided client to play back such files i really think the awesome videos that will end up on utube from this feature would seriously benefit ccp and all the rest of us by virtue of awesome pr depiction of the eve combat space note i also think this kind of data service should be included in incarna to allow for advanced machinima and lols im going to go out there for a second and say that if ccp could deliver a browser plugin or make the transfer an open format so one could be written wouldnt it be epic to be able to watch any kill on a killboard from any pilots perspectivetotally a good idea and supported
great conceptual idea i hope its possible to implement
its definitely worth letting corps and alliances put customized livery on their ships if not allowing every pilot to customize his or her own frankly this sort of thing would have fit very well with the theme of the dominion expansion
active shield tankers can only use cdos very meh because of cap or resist rigs meh because they simply dont provide a big enough tank bostwhere are the shield equivalent of aux nano pumpsim well aware that shield tankers benefit from crystals but buffer armor tankers benefit from slaves and trimarks are just as useful as cdfe whereas the active shield rigs are sub par compared to the active armor rigs
while i think the idea may have merit dont forget that armour tankers dont have an equivalent to the shield boost amplifierstill if a way can be found to implement this without it being overpowered when combined with sbas i think its a reasonable proposaltentativedue to balance concerns thumbs up
as much as i want a sba for my armour tank i enjoy having the two tanks different

i own 2 chims a nomad 2 redeemers and a widow well did have them all at once sold one chim the redeemers mass affects the jumping fuel aswell jump fuel use is a balancing coeffecient of it if you want it to take the same fuel as it it would have to take 3000 or 2500 not 300
and yet you dont know that fuel use is a hard rate thats disappointing
this would rock for offensive fleet deploymentssneak in a cyno recon assemble the fleet in caps and jump shuttles light cynos everyone jumps in shuttles swap to combat ships carried by carriers profitbye bye gate campsso long heading of attacking fleetshave a nice trip jump in lag

honestly i dont think this will help we all know how fast these spammers create new characters  think of how fast they can create a free website just as a link redirect to their isk selling site and it would take longer to add the url to the block listi agree that spammers are a plague on this game and im thankful for operation unholy rage i just dont think this will work the only thing i could recommend is adding a motd message saying dont buy from isk spammers information to the new players is the best way to combat this menace as theyre the ones that probably buy from these idiots since they dont know about the etc tradesorry but i cant support this measure
no not really not at all min maxing will just get you killed
yes shield boosters those must be oval at least

oh i like the idea of a solopwnmobile having to be actually defended the titan in its current sisi design is much too strong keep in mind no one is gonna fly only 1 or 2 titans in a battle and im not talking about the doomsday deviceif i were to propose anything id just nerf supercaps to a certain degree required and make them lots cheaper ccp tries to justify 15b and 50b supercaps by concentrating on their attributes rather than just making them cheaper and crappier but thats something that doesnt really belong here
there should be a way to switch onoff unwanted characters from chat lists for example you wanna see only hostiles in local and turn off your mates now its impossible you must scroll down entire list to see how many of reds are in system after change by pressing single button you will see only reds with exact count of thempic
im supporting this
make the drawings better and you got a sale 8
why
this kind of information management is what eve needs more
would be helpful to allow a change in order other than alphabeticly reorder by standing or war status to lump those groups together for ease of quick referance
honestly meh although might be interesting to get aggro just from salvaging
if you could tie a distress call only to corpmilitia channels or to custom channels of your choice i think this could be very useful it could also be misused and abused easily tough to balance but worthwhile
i thought about something like this once
i do think this is a pretty cool idea and perhaps useful in many cases i would add that if one is not already operating in a fleet or on audio with friendlies nearby by the time a distress call is issued and responded to the carebear is dead and his wreck looted things happen very quickly in low and null sec systems and a good pirate wont stick around long unless he knows he has the backup support to take on would be rescuersalso a distress call may not be noticed unless an alert noise was associated with it as many people minimize the many hordes of windows on their screen during gameplayi typically monitor local and our special private channel or fleet and minimize everything else
while a nice idea i think that all the pirate who may abuse the distress call system going to people in distress or posing as one will cause the regular players not to use it
i absolutely support this proposal the lag induced by the info screen when looking at a players or player corps standings is terrible after all who cares about any agents random staringstraightforward mug a plain list of agents with their npc corp logos would be a 100 improvement
in a attempt to fix the broken bounty system it seem that everadio has taken on themselves to code their own bounty system in to a web site the problem is that they need to be able to confirm that the bounty hunter has in fact killed the mark to do this they require the full api key of the bounty hunter so that they can pull the killmail directly from the server that way they dont have to rely on potentially faked kill mailsno one in their right mind or at least very few will give them their full api key as it allows access to to all the information of that persons account everything it seem that when ccp codes mechanics and systems that deal with trusting others and access to information ccp tend to make that accesscapability monolithic meaning all or nothing see corp roles and access to poshangers the solution to this problem is once again granularity and user definability in addition to the default api access templates full  limited allow a third type of template customwith this custom template the user can specify what sections of the profile about them stored on the database they want the access template to expose a key is then generated and associated with this template that way if a bounty hunter wants to use this service he can make a custom template that only allows the killmail information to be accessed and not any thing else about them or say someone wants to join a corp they can make a custom template of only the information required by the corp that they are comfortable giving access to
this could be a good thing or a really bad thing depending on whats involved in the codingbut i think its a good ideasupported
why arte you blaming the csm for this delay its only their fault half the time have you asked meissa where the holdup is is it a problem with the secretary not getting the stuff to ccp for approval is it a problem with ccp not giving approval or is it trapped in limbo somewhere im not going to blindly condemn the csm for something that quite possibly isnt their fault
the delay isnt really the problem  its the total lack of communication if one of the csms were to post saying yeah the minutes are written up were just waiting for ccp to ok their release that would be fine
received this from our secretary  thought i had sent the csmccp iceland minutes i havent theyre on the way out the other minutes will go out today as wellso an unfortunate mistake but just a mistake were only human
thank you for looking into this for us im glad to see some communication about it

as a merc and not seeing a ton of threads out in this forum i had originally posted my candidacy thread in crime and punishment it seems the speakers corner is becoming the more prevalent collection of candidate threads so id like to put mine with the others for ease of access by anyone seeking information on whos runningcan i copy the thread post a link to it or get it mod moved not sure which of those is the most appropriate way to go about it
crossposting will likely get your ass kicked by the evil modsid report the thread in cp and asked for it to be moved here
from the survey i am running im allready seeing some things i feel id need to adress as a csm member if i am to be voted in first and foremost a bit of solid foundation needs to be layed currently the csm can champion suggestions made in the assembly hall but if you compare the suggestions made there with the survey results youll notice that the many amounts of suggestions and comments on things like missioning and exploration which do well in the survey arent that common in the assembly hall and the new shiptypes that are the most popular demand of what ccp should work on next in the survey arent even mentioned as suggestions in the assembly hall important to note here is that i didnt just advertise my survey on the forums i also did ingame this i believe is how the difference emerged i feel that the forum or atleast the assembly hall attracts a certain type of eve player moreso than others so people who stay ingame and dont bother with the forum wont see their issues be worked at by the csm the logical conclusion isnt to convince 300000 players to change their behaviour its to get the csm to come to them id strive for better ingame tools for the csm to use and also for the players to use to get to the csm ingame survey tools ingame sheets that show what the csm is upto ingame logs of their meetings ingame is where most players are and appearantly where they want to stay but this also means that the assembly hall is not a good basis for the csm to work with as a source for their suggestions to ccp as it shows a distorted picture of what the playerbase as a whole wants so the whole assembly hall needs to be transfered to in the game aswellofcourse these steps arent actual gameplay changes or additions but they are the groundwork that needs to be layed so future csms will suggest gameplay changes and additions to ccp that are really representative of the whole playerbase and not of a small segment thereofedit the survey is still ongoing if you havent had your say yet you have your chance here

so for the over 9000th time im going to complain about how blasters need to be boostedfor their current damage output they do not have enough range to be effective theyre supposed to be a cross between pulse lasers and autocannons therefore their optimal and falloff should be a bit higher than 0kms ok im exagerating but you get my pointthis makes blaster boats highly inneffective in combat such as the deimos for example ive stopped flying them for pvp completely because they just get slaughtered mainly because of the fact that it is indeed a crappy ship overall and on that note id choose a vagabond over a deimos anyday to pvp in or even a zealotbut anyways the deimos isnt the subject of this post the fact that you can hit up to 45km with pulse lasers and scorch ammo and still do a lot of damage is pretty overpowered compared to the notsopowerfulanymore rangedefficient blasterscurrently gallente ships are a very hard choice for large fleet engagements since blasters dont hit far enough thus forcing us to use failguns instead see what i did there let me put some ratio numbers in heregun type  dps dmg mod x hi dmg ammo  rof  optimal  falloff  ratio dps x optimal  falloffneutron blaster cannon ii  42 x 48  788  3600  10000  347939800mm repeating artillery  3234 x 48  788  2400  19000  421569mega pulse laser ii  36 x 48  788  12000  8000  003375  438578425mm railgun ii  33 x 48  956  28500  24000  8698741400mm howitzer artillery ii  12807 x 48  4016  24000  35000  903123tachyon beam laser ii  54 x 48  1250  26000  20000  953856solution either increase blasters damage to match their ridiculous range or increase their ridiculous range to match their damagei feel like ive covered most of the aspects in this post so support or flame awayedit moar numberz
if you increase range you crowd out autocannons completely in bs level this is actually already true damage increase at point blank maybe but itUFFFDs more like lasers doing too much real dps you could increase speed but not agility of blaster boats allowing them to close on targets bit faster maybe
i agree with your post but autocannons are getting boosted in dominion  now i dont know how thats gonna turn out but yes i think that to lasers and even acs regarding the falloff they are underpowered and yes increasing speed would be an awesome solution to this problem thank you for your feedback
but what about caldari ships i know their intended for use with railguns but their bonuses also apply to blasters i think a boost to optimal is the easiest solution allthough that would be against the filosophy of blasters increased tracking and damage would be more in line with the intended function of blasters
absolutly truethe recent changes to the vigilant 60 hybrid damage and how great it works shows us what the blasters should really be they need to do more damage 2025 more keep the current rangeabout the deimos it needs to have a definite purpose right now it is absolutly worthless with blasters a brutix is a dozen times cheaper to lose and does exactly the same thing i suggest giving the deimos even more damage or more speed or more range but something to make it worth flying over a brutix
medium blasters have embarrassing range large blasters arent as bad ps i dont like when i sit at point blank range next to a webbed amarr ship and it does nearly as much damage with lasers an armageddon with 7 mega pulse laser 2s 5 t2 ogres and 3 damage mods deals 1150 dps with all skills at lvl 5 and higher damage ammo type megathron with 7 neutron blaster cannons 2 and 5 t2 ogres deals 1200 damage with 3 damge mods and void ammo range of mega optimalfalloff is 27km range of geddon is 55 km that is with longrange ammunitionwith armogeddon having 2 times grater range this is not right

draw me a triceratops with laser beam eyes and all is forgiven mazzincidentally you serious business types do realize that if you whine enough ccp wont just disband a csm and have another voted in rightthey will can the entire experimentps go outside get some fresh air and meet some new people face to face

i am with u all the way 
im gona take issue with this bit firstyou keep bringing up the one mid slot coercer stop it destroyers in general suck ccp knows it players know it if you dont know it your literally the only one theres exactly one good destroyer the thrasher the rest are in dire need of revamping and its been a complaint of players for quite some timeyour almost purposely misconstruing what im asking for on the ship by comparing moving an non weapon fitting high slot to a mid slot to allow it to a mod that helps it keep dps on almost every other ship in game to giving a damage bonus to an ewar shipthe retribution does in fact specialize in a role right now it sucks all by itselfif you were going to have afs in a gang because honestly right now in 00 they are the bottom rung of the food chain you would want any other af besides the retribution simply because it does not have any ability to tackle your blinding yourself to the fact that most pilots in dps ships are expected to and want to be able to stop an opponent from warping away on their own and your also being blind to the fact that every other dps ship in the gameevery otheronecan do that except for your crappy example in the coercer a ship in a class so hopelessly broken that only a complete revamp could save themby your own argument that the ship is a weapons platform only the ability to fit the now changed scrams becomes a near must for ships like afs so that they do have the option of keeping damage on a larger target by disabling the mwd capabilities and using the ab to keep safely in range
my loltribution is collecting dust in my hangar because of this lolayout supported
this is a great solution to this problem just make sure we get mass unlocks too as well as maybe a warning if you try to lock down a stack of 200 blueprintsjust because of the spam potential also yes to all and no to all options on the vote page would be handy
i think this is a great idea it would save my corp so much time the only thing i would like to add is maybe only getting one evemail about the votes if they are created all at once filling someones mail box about proposed votes is rather pointless
well yes this would be amazing i would also love the option to record a replay from the game into a file say a fleet battle that could be later reviewed say to see what was done wrong or to be used as tutorial just place everything that was happening on the grin into the replay file

this is an excellent solution to the local dilema good job
bring back the old days
the peace of mind you seek comes from having comrades who will defend your csaa pos and blow up anyone who comes along trying to harm it this is 00 security should come through diplomacy and firepowerwhyweve seen a plague of titans over the last 2 years and a large factor in that was sov4 allowing any smallmidsized alliance to plonk down 3 outposts and start churning them out under a blanket of invulnerability you are complaining that supercaps will die more and be harder to safely mass produce but you seem not to understand that thats exactly what ccp want
these goals are incompatible if supercaps become harder to build their prices will increase to match thats not going to make people more likely to want to field them in frontline combat yes were looking at a 10 drop in material requirements for motherships due to the removal of clone vat bays but that will easily be cancelled out there needs to be something a bit more substantial than a standard deathstar pos if ccps objective is for prices to remain the same
put hardeners and strontium in your manufacturing pos and be prepared to defend it when needed this game needs less afk invincible structures if your manufacturing lines need defending get people to defend it
who said anything about prices what makes you think ccp want the prices to remain the same
this is a great plan i holeheartedly agreei doubt ccp would do it though because they intend to remove local as an intel source seriously why would a ship that is trying to be stealthy broadcast that its in system to everyone local needs to be removed and a very effective directionnal scanner needs to replace it
yes lets make the broken overpowered intel tool even worselocal has prevented more fights than it ever helped find the sooner it is removed the sooner actual spontaneous pvp can happennot supported
same old
confirming that i do it because im willing to risk a factionfit cnr to gank a heron
i like this idea a lot i really like the potentiality of abuse on both sides of the coin makes things a bit interesting also i think this goes along well with the fleet finder they have planned easier ways to move your fleet around are always good
listen to this man hes 100 right
assuming it can be done without making the hamsters or the devs cry im all for it
i agree in addition i wish the api showed how many market slots you have open no other details just a simple little number to help the merchants of the game know when products have sold but not which ones have sold
thanks for the update hope to see them soon
so here is a crazy request as well can you please send them to me as a standing csm i think i should have gotten them by nowissler
why does it take two months and many threads later in forum channels that they supposedly watch before they actually let us know whats going on
erik shouldve sent them to you last week did you check your csm mail
yeah interesting to finally see what exactly happened nothing like evil ccocsm not doing what they are suppose to its just a minor mistake op has a point 7 weeks is quite long
in eves chat there are options to link a word or a phrase to a character an item a solar system a station or a url but there is no option to link to an ingame channel as lots of discussions and out of corpalliance actions are being held on public channels the ability to link them in text and have other people click on them to join them would help a lot when communicating the existence of chat channels
sure
id be fine if it only worked draganddrop like ship fittings do so as not to clog the rightclick menu but this seems reasonable enough
seems like a reasonable request and i cant think of a good argument against it so that adds up to a support from me

so nerf amarr pulse dps or start fitting them on your megathrons and deimioiextending hybrid range woulf effectively make them pulse lasers with expendable ammo which would then result in the inevitable whine of why do ammar get no ammo usage blasters should have that toothe problem aint the blaster being underpowered as its meant to be short range and vhigh dps the problem is the pulse being overpoweredif infact there is a problem i cba researchign it myself
maybe if we all start fitting brutix and deimos with lasers ccp will listen
agreed blasters are a bit pantsput up the damage and particularly tracking and they are fine they are pretty much intended for fighting at 0 so make it work
easy fix give us back 90 webs and dont listen to the idiots that cant grasp the concept of staying out of web range i still cant believe ccp gave in to all you whiny pilots crying about getting d because you went into web range
confirming i want to hit people harder
oh noes my shortrange weapon is shortrangedthe problem is lasers and scorch in particularits always better to nerf than to boost it avoids power creep and creates entertaining whine threads

following my thread in the featuresideas section  the positive reaction i want to post this hereon my way searching through the lp stores i found some items that imo need some buffexample 1 cap rechargers t2 gives a 20bonus to cap recharge faction give the same bonus with a little less cpu need and then we have the uberexpensive officer mods my proposal would be to buff the primary effect on the mods eg cap recharge rate while leaving the fitting req the same maybe give the faction cr a 24 bonusexample 2 eanms this is more fed navy specific but it also needs a boost of at least 10 to be comparable to the amarr versionfeel free to add other mods

hi ccp et alcharacter scamming has become more and more prevalent these days which produced three major issues1 highly frustrating for players2 causes a huge workload for gms to back trace the isk3 gms are tied up with resolving this work load than focusing on other areasfrom a players point if view there is nothing more aggrovating than waiting for your isk to be returned because of a loophole in the systemfrom ccps point of view youre having to pay people to resolve the issue ie financial lossso  if there isnt an alternative method found then the financial cost incurred to ccp via paying a member of staff to resolve the issue will be in effect astronomicalproposal1 change the process by which one can edit the email address associated with your eve online account this step is vital for the process2 when wanting to sell a character you must log this via a portal on the eveo website3 this portal sends an email to the email addy which contain a confirmation link which must be clicked ie similar approach to when you sign up to a forum to confirm who you are etc4 when posting a new topic in the character bazzarre a new option is added where by you must select if you are selling or putting a wtb thread up you will only get the option available if you have gone through the process described above also the thread will have some sort of recognisable confirmation on it to show the sales thread is valid5 character sale process continues as it is nowthe way in which i propose and email address is edited is via the following method1 log into account management section2 load the edit account details page3 change the ability to free text change the email addy to where you have to click on a link called change youre email address4 that then generates an email which is sent to your existing email addy the email contains a link which must be clicked  then you can change your email addy therethis system should make scamming on the character bizarre much harder but could have two painful biproducts1 scammers try and attain email address passwords which could be more harmful than good2 problems stemming from the system not working or scammers petitioning that they cant log a sales thread and bully a lowdown gm into allowing a sales thread to be posted without prior authorisation from the steps highlighted abovestill its an idea and im sure its full of typos  loop holes and will cost millions  millions of pounds to implement but figured id share3 to allgrootedits 1 removed typos  tried to make the post read better2 have thought more about the systems described and elaborated on potential downfalls
this basically
do it
this is the most beautiful thing ive ever read true story
this is a good idea but there should be an alternate way as well for instance if you lose access to your email account via switching isps or losing the password etc i think a simple call to your nearest ccp gm hopefully via telephone to verify ownership of the accountanother method is the common security question this could be required whenever making any changes to the personal data on your accountin either case i support this measure
hi chap thanks for your support thought id answer the points youve raised  hopefully we could together figure out a way of improving the original proposal as i alone cant get it to 100 resistances across the board oh my words evejokes are laimi had considered having the option to contact a gm in which ever form that may take but thought the work load incurred by this could be much highers  introduce a human element into the equation which could open up a loophole ie scammer pretending that theyd recently changes isp  no longer have access to email account so is there an alternative methodalso  security question is an entirely valid option and is an argument which holds a lot of water my only concern at this point was how willing people are to release that information to ccp and am not intending to put a negative slant on either side here was just a thoughtstill  i like your thinking dude a lot do reply here if you can think of a way of adjustingrevamping the proposal so as itll be safer easier to use and incur less ongoing costs time or cash wise on both the players  ccps timegroot

there is no reason for the faction cap charges to not be on the market if they are gonna kill my sisters probe cash cow may as well ding it allas to adding all the rest it does not make sense you would end up increasing the data base size by a large amount and getting little in return for it ifwhen the equipment can handle the extra load then you could add all the extras

the eve forums are quite frankly a mess the search function never works properly searching for a characters name brings up a bunch of irrelevent quotes and ccp discourages topic bumping but leaves us no other option other than to let the topic dissapear into the cluttered mess of the second third and so on dead pages never to be seen again untill it is locked and eventually deleted with old age the eve forums are in desperate need of an overhaul 1fix the search engine to support filters and advanced boolean functions 2on search results always display topic date and character first followed by a small exercpt from the post right now the results are jumbled and rarley contain exercpts or any other relevent information for that matter due to long topic names3make it easier to find and view other character profiles and add a clearly labled button to list all posts by a user that can be easily sorted by date or topic 4add in a bumping feature with a time limit so posts dont fill up with garbage bumps5add a function that allows innactive topics to be unlocked via automated voting feature6allow players to delete their own posts and topics rather than having to change the post to delete me and waiting for a moderator7editing a post should bump it it isnt fair for someone who has somthing to add or change in their proposal to have the changes ignored by the forum8and lastly fix the danm scroll function so you can see what the hell your typing on long posts withought the screen popping up to line one every time you press a key see look i cant even properly correct the spelling on my cursesi dont think this is too much to ask and if it is too much for the current forum engine might i suggest a subsite running lamp it isnt that hard to move php data to a new system provided thats what your using to begin with

its been brought up time and time again  why cant you move drones from the cargohold to the dronebayanswer  because then youll have 600m2dronebaydomisofdeath constantly spewing out legions of drones at you and it would be painfulfair enough refilling your dronebay while in combat is a bad idea but what about when youre stuck in a wormhole and the sleepers just killed off a wave of your hammerheadsor youve made it through a fight gone to a safe and want to redroneto stop a massive imbalance in pvp yet still enable drone users to do what you can with every other type of ammo perhaps we can leverage an existing ingame mechanism and tie it to our dronebay restocking problemits fair enough to say that if youre engaged in a pvp battle youre going to have an aggression timer so how about aslong as you dont have an aggression timer you can move drones from your cargohold to your dronebaythis would then allow drone users to do what all other ammo types can already yet still prevent them from gaining an unfair advantage in a fighttldr allow drone movement from cargohold to dronebay aslong as you dont have an aggression timer
supporting my own proposal
if you dont have an aggression timer you can also dock and refill your drone bay or warp to a pos and refill it on the ship maintenance array
as long as you have an easily accessable station or pos lying aroundme supports proposal
i do think the pvp balance comes first but also think you should be able restock your dronebay in some way from the drones in your cargobay add scotty the drone bay manager with his timers if it is needed but this would be a nice thing to have anyway
while ratting i got lag and disconnected from my drones had to fly up and pull into dronebay but not before accidentally pulling one into cargo annoying had to go 5 jumps back to put it right
10
ok since nobody else pointed out that ccp already answered this question and why heres the issue with this proposalby allowing drones to be moved from cargo to drone bay you are forgoing the preset balance of the size of the drone bay granted i would love to be able to scoop drones from the field and reuse them after i lost some other drones but it threatens the game balance and is therefore a bad ideaso no support
i dunno is it that easy to create free websites i realize tinyurl can do that sort of thing but then you can just put tinyurl in the block list and it would take care of that i would think its certainly more difficult to create a brand new web site than to create a new email address to use for a fake trial account as they do now this wont help at all wed be no better off than we are today if folks are inclined to buy the isk theyll ignore the motd when they see the isk seller but if they never see the isk selling spam in the first place theyll never know about it
 word blacklists in the ass censorship sucks filtering strings is very cpu intensivewe just need a right click report isk spammer that doesnt include the 5 minutes of screen lockoh and ing censorship sucks in ass
thisjust need rightclick  report isk seller  3 reports and theyre temporarily banned  gms investigate bring in the banhammerlog those doing the reporting and come down hard on misuse
oh crap guys my titan is tackled quick make trial accounts and get those hictors temp banned

if i want to censor you in my channel it is hardly an issue overall and report hardly helps as they have already broadcast their message
i am sure you have seen this warning message that pops up before you enter lowsec or nullsecplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesit warns people that they are leaving concord protection ie leaving safe space for unsafe space similar warning messages should be implemented for when you are about to enter space in which you are kill on sight kospilots with a low security status should be given a warning message before entering dangerous highsec space for example a pirate with a 267 security status should receive this warning prior to jumping into a 09 security system the destination system is 09 security status this is extremely dangerous as concord police will confront you do you want to proceedin addition pilots with low faction standing eg missioners should also receive a similar warning message for example a caldari missioner with 538 gallente faction standing should receive this warning message before entering gallente highsec the destination system is gallentecontrolled this is extremely dangerous as faction police will pursue you do you want to proceedsuch warning messages could prevent countless fatal mistakes when traveling through new eden it is a simple solution to a massive problemoriginal post is here

you may note that i used the word iflike everyone else im in the dark regarding ccps exact intentions in this matter my concern is simply that even after all the positive changes the price hikes that will inevitably result from the loss of sov 4 are going to deter the vast majority of pilots from using supercaps in combat in situations where any doubt exists as to the outcome people are already reluctant enough to bring them to beara price hike will also give people who already possess supercaps a significant selfperpetuating advantage over those who dont not that i particularly care
so current domination timeframe looks like this if im not mistakenstart of december expansion and new sov system is introduced but sov is locked for 3 more weeks in the state it was right before dominion got deployedthis puts the end of the sov lock period right at the begin of the holiday seasoni think it would be a nice to prolong this period for another 2 weeks since there are a lot of people who will be spending the holidays with family and friends and not playing an mmo yes i know it sounds weird bit it is true or even better spend an extra 2 weeks working the kinks out of the expansion deploy it mid december and then have the 3 week lock period
i disagree make sov drop instantly let chaos rule
no problem with that either as that would be start of decemberbut putting the hotspot on the holidays is pretty silly imho
oh please this i dont take part in 00 politics but man it would be hilarious to watch that might cause a new peak user record for sure totally distabalise goons and the other big alliances please ccp do this
i can understand why super alliances would get a little ed at this even smaller onesbut sorry to say i think a sov dump would be a very healthy thing to doeverythings been locked into a holding patteren tugowar match status quo and suchbout time the whole damn thing came crashing down to restart itthis new system will def be a good thingso yeah id hate it myself if i fought toothandnail but realistically speaking pvpers and the likes are gonna love this
all good things are three and this has just been quoted three times oh waiti agree with this
just hope that you do not have a super cap in the cooker would suck to have 2 days left on it but because sov dropped you lost it all
chat was never intended to be an intel tool c ccpdo you think this attitude has changed since it was said
tldr no matter what happens or doesnt happen with local the ability to manage that information in a better way is neededwhile i agree that it should get a nerf that change in no way would make this feature reduntant even if i only see a limited part of the people in the system i still could use the ability to filter or sort them by what is actually important you know just like the overview so you can set it up to show only the relevant info instead of spamming it with all kinds of space rubbish it doesnt have to show anything extra just sort by importancethen there is the cold and hard reality that local isnt going to be removed from empire space it will propably stay in 00 too in the form of infrastructure upgrades when i buy stuff in jita i dont need to see the thousand trade alts i need to know how many wartargets are out doing the same thing without having to scroll up and down the infinite list of people every 5 seconds for updates same thing in a station system with people who are not blueagain this wont give any extra information but only allows you to filtersort by your needs it wouldnt make local any more overpowered then it already is and even after any possible changes this feature would remain usefulthey failed horribly and havent done anything about the fact for years so it seems reasonable to think it doesnt bother them that much i also deal with the reality of how things are now and im not too conserned with how a wide eyed naive dev saw the situation when he first thought about it obviously it is an intel tool a useful one and as i said could use a nerf but that in no way means it should be left in the condition it currently is ccp should either fix it if it isnt working as intended or shut up and start adjusting to the fact it isnt going to go away i dont care what they choose to do with it but i want the ability to manage the information ccp decides im allowed to know
i cannot support the removal of local and this which turns local into an idiots intel tool
allow me to be a bit clearerlocal being used for intel in any space is wrongits a chat window thats it empire low sec 00 it should all be the same a blank window unless someone is talking and in that case it should simply have what was said the list of people in local is so ridiculous in concept i cant believe it ever made it into the gameagain a chat window should never ever be used for combat purposesif you want to change things think of ways to modify the scanner to provide limited friend of foe information as no player should ever benefit from an all seeing eye chat window in any form
completely agree change local to be like wh space give us a better dscan or an actual intel mechanic that is not so op
what most of these topics touch on yet fail to mention in any direct sense is simply this the rule of law in empire spacethere is alot lacking in this aspect i dont think ive ever been fined for carrying contraband materials past more customs agents than i can count more than a few times why is thisare the ais not functioning as they should be did someone at the office switch them off years ago and forget to turn them back on againshouldnt some offenses be a regionalconstalation related matter and not require concords involment  what exactly do all the various security forcespolice do aside from float around as window dressingdidnt mean to hijack your topic but i just thought it needed saying aloud for once
i can be sarcastic too but i wont its not worth the effort anymore

hi everyone i am currently working on an ingame solution for getting a community census on topics relating to eve and to csm that requires little effort on behalf of the end user the solution is an ingame voting site where users may vote on questions using multiple choice answers this is not the same as the csm candidate matching website and it is intended for a different purposeif you would like to help me test this please try it ingame and out of game so we can see how well it works i am not a programmer so please post any suggestions or comments in this thread ill be testing a few options to see which will work best and with the upcomming moondoggie im sure it will be even easier thenwwwshipsofevecomvotethere is currently only one test voting topic so that i can test the code in particular testing the restriction on the amount of votes you can make which is one per person atm using a combination of cookie ip and igb character command teststhis is an update of the original post which required you to have a share in a corp to enable you to use the ingame share voting mechanics which was taking me a while to distributetamber
i like this this is exactly what i want for the csm everything ingameeventually i hope that ccp will make official tools for this sort of thing but this is certainly a good alternative good innitiative

twice discussed in iceland black ops need some new love the previous boost has not been really a succes acourding to the qen q3 they are currently the most unpopulair ship in eve maybe they need a new role in general like the stealth bombers or just some more tweaking examle the jump range need some love with jdc 5 u can jump 45 ly max i think covert cynos will be more populair if the max range get a boost black ops are not solo pwn ships they need to be flown in groups to be effective currently the most populair black ops are the widow ecm and the redeemer damage the panther and the sin are not so succesfull as the other 2 mentioned my proposal is ether to revieuw the sin and the panther revieuw the black ops bonusses or revieuw them in general

this has been pointed out before in the thread as the bay should only be able to be used in space and there should be a maximum amount of drones which takes the fighters in the repair bay and the fighters in the drone bay both into accounthowever as im not sure how the code would work im going to stick with the repair bay so far as in my opinion it creates a better overview instead of having to scroll through a list of drones to see the repairing drones

started amarr cross trained minnie and caldari cant see a reason to use a caldari hac at all atm and my galent alt would rather fly a phobos than a deimos
the diemos need some work the eagle is a hard topic to it is not a bad hac it is just a over specialized one in my opinionproblems with the eagle are powergridat least enough to fit 5x250mm  mwd would be nice and the utility high slot that might be better used as med or low slotsimilar to muninn that also needs a med or low more and a high lessthen again iUFFFDm not a eagle pilot and might overlook some important things on it if you give the diemos a optimal bonus you nerf the blaster diemos with this and the eagle to also this kind of general med rail boost might look ok compared to a beam zealot but in general itUFFFDs a lot to muchsince it would be the gun with the most dps and range at the same time on a diemos with optimal range bonus it would also outdo eagle and muninn by a fair amount with this and might break even with the zealot in general it is not a good idea to work with optimal bonuses on the diemos since you will wrack the long range balance pretty quickly at least for eagle and muninnthere is a large diemos thread on shc about what to do with it atm it mostly boils down to more speedagility or more flexible blaster and medium range2070km rail hac while both ideas also increase the durability a bit
ishtar is for sniping deimos is for blastingdyingi would agree though that the eagle needs more damagemore pg and the deimos needs to be able to survive better
well if you put it that way
didnt the eagle get the same turret boost as the zealotbesides i still consider the cerberus the better ship for long range hac gangs
the deimos needs alot more powergridi need to fit 2 anciliariy current routers on mine to be able to make a decent fitand it needs more damage plain and simpleeither give the deimos more range or speed but basically make it something else than an overpriced brutix i personally think it needs more damage and speed to close on enemies faster vigilant gets a 60 damage bonus in the next patch give the deimos 20 to 35eagle is a bit meh give it more damage or even more optimal not sure about this one though
i disagree here eagle is useless in current state theres no balance so comparing it here is pointless 5 optimal per level will mean somewhere around 114km which is the same as zealot and muninn also dont forget muninn has twice the alpha of a deimos with better tracking its a fair tradeoff im not sure what you mean with medium range hac and really dont wanna know cuz nobody actually flies such things as simple as that and about the gun with most dps and range god save us nothing should be even comparable to a zealot and nothing should get even with it even if deimos has the same dps as a zealot the zealot has more favourable dmg type more scan res 30 les sig radius and more optimalso i completely fail to see the point of your objections
ugh i want to support the idea behind the topic boost eagle and deimos while strongly disagreeing with most of the content in the op the deimos doesnt need to be yet another sniper hac and i like the idea of its role as a scramrange face melter what it needs is more survivability in that role  some of the vagas ability to disengage and gtfo when things turn sour id really like to see it and the enyo redesigned as shield tankers but yeah that isnt happening anyway agree the deimos needs a fix dont like your ideas at allspeed aside the eagles actually kind of sort of ok  with cn thorium rather than lead it can do 243 dps100km optimal and tracks significantly better than any other sniper hac the problem is grid  making it work requires an acr and an rcu ii with deimoslike grid you could drop the rcu for an od and it would have speed and agility similar to the muninnzealot
eagle holds a tracking advantage at 100km and gets better with any km you go over 100km since it will still work in optimal where other hacs drop into falloff the main problem with it you would need a full fleet of eagles to use this advantage since you will have a hard time in a mixed fleet with ityou only can use the tracking bonus of faction ammo at ranges where other need t2 long range ammo it got one more low slot so it will out range and out damage a muninn it also got more base lock range so it will need one less sbwhat you can use for tracking or optimal the diemos with a optimal bonus got the better base statslock range turret optimal dps and one more low slot by this it outdoes the muninn it also out damages the eagle at 100120km something that can play in the same role as a heavy puls zealot reasonable well with rails it is also a lot worse at 100km sniping than it is atmat the same time it also fixes the close range diemos instead to nerf it even more you can use rails on a lot more ships than just the diemos and eagle and you try to buff the weapon directly to compete with the best long range hac that has the strongest damage bonuses an the optimal slot layout for it
currently dedicated remote repair ships only come in one flavor the cruiser sized logisticsi would like to see that role expanded to frigate hulls as well the logical choice would be tech ii variations of the bantamnavistastormentorburst frigatesthis would in my opinion be a nice addition to frigate gangs as well as an introduction to logistics for newer playersi am thinking assault ship resistancetank maybe slightly less no drone bay enough powergrid cpu and capacitor to accomodate a speed module plus some self tankcapacitor upgrades they should be limited to fitting the small shield transportersremote armor repairersnot so sure about carrying over energy transfer or tracking links from the cruiser sized ships perhaps a secondary bonus could be remote sensor boosters or remote eccmlet the trolling flaming and hopefully constructive criticism commence
carriers were herehi
even with the rep power of a logistic cruiser it is hard to keep frigates alive under any kind of reasonable dps so even a bonused frigate which would only fit cruiser sized modules at max assuming similar fitting bonuses as the logistic cruiser would still have problem to keep you aliveimho frigate gangs together with scimitars are the way to go maybe oneirosguardian if you want to try your luck with armor tankingedit honor to the amarr brothers
key word dedicated
wouldnt mind flying these things logistics can certainly benefit frigate gangs too though cruiser sized logistics will not fullfil this role too well
you mean more dedicated than having bonus for logistic modules and triage
i have no doubt a scimitar would outperform a logistics frigate in repping power but that is also the point it would serve as a cheaper more mobile and more accessible option especially for newer players there is no introduction to the logistics role at the momentreasonable dps depends on what league you play in also remote repair will do more for an assault frigate than it will for a stealth bomber or interceptor any tank will crack at some point i will argue that some remote repair will keep you alive longer than none
key word dedicatedyou mean more dedicated than having bonus for logistic modules and triageas carriers also have bonuses for fighter drones and warfare links i would not call them dedicated remote repair ships being capital ships they are not exactly easily accessible to new players neither would one do particularily well trying to play dedicated remote repair in a roaming frigate gang especially in hisecbut lets end this one once and for all carriers do have bonuses to remote repair they can be set up to do it quite well in fact congratulations you winyour prize 1 pcs chocolate chip cookie should be arriving by mail within the next 714 business days enjoy

with the upcoming change in the ingame mail system sorting by date yay please add the possibility to send mails to corporationsthe current system requires you to have contact persons  if the particular one leaves the game you have to ask your way through the corporation to get a new contact especially while having business relations to several corps this can be quite difficultmaybe add the possibility to give people in your corp specific roles in order to view the corp mails answering from the corp mail address isnt that necessary but sending mails to your partner corporations would be niceif this feature is already in the game i stand corrected and would like to know how to do it
i like the basis of the idea  id like to try an offer a refinement1 on the right click menu for a corp or on the show info screen add the option contact corporation2 add the role corp diplomat this would automatically be assigned to the ceo and all directorsany time someone chooses to send an email to the corporation it gets routed to the individual email boxes of the people with the diplomat role now theres no more need for eoutside websites to track who your diplomats are and nondiplomats are not privy to the contents of email sent from outside the corporationfor alliances you could have the same options at the alliance level with the diplomats being assigned as an alliance role and defaulting to the ceodirectors of the executor corporationat any rate id really like to see something like this  it would make contacting corporations you have no previous experience with much easier and as the op said when the one person you do know leaves now youre back to emailing the ceo and hoping he respondssupported
make it possible only if you have no drones deployedthat should keep the game balance intact
having to wait out the 15 aggression timer seems to respect balance enough supported
a lot of ships are balanced in the way they can carry many spare drones dont forget thatand 15 minutes arent enough only docking is
this is a fine idea and doesnt even require the aggro management just allow one drone per 2 minutes to be jettisoned from your cargo into space and have it appear as a drone in space uncontrolled then you can take control of said single drone instantly it lets you restock a flight of drones every ten minutes  which hardly negates a drone ships large drone bayliang
how about the followingcreate bribery contracts when applied to a targeted player security forces will look the other way and not provide any security if the targeted player is attacked the applied contract will last for 1 hour of play time the number of bribery contracts created each day is limited to some percentage of total hours played by all players say 1 or 1 contracts could be auctioned off in all major trading hubs targeted players will appear red or some other special color to indicate their status contracts can stack making it near impossible to travel without the risk of being shot down effectively sending them to jail of their currently docked stationedit changed sold to auctioned off
well that is the real life solution though it would be way too abusable in eve since the goods or some percent of them are still in play unlike the current insurance system where the destroyed ship has been removed thus you get a net isk sink if cargo was going to be insured it would have to be done in a way that on average more isk leaves the economy from the process then enters it
the easier fix is stop paying insurance for acts defiend by the game mechanics as criminal iow if concord shows up and knocks your  in the dirt you lose your insurance on the spot this has nothing to do with making pvp more viable if you want to pvp you can fly your happy ass out to lowsec or null sec or war dec someone and shoot them to hell and back without concord even pausing in their consumption of space doughnutsbesides think of all the whine tears from mission runners duped into concording themselves  now theyve lost their ship  and their isk
helloin the sell forums there are often times lottery format sales these lotteries allow for some interesting functions1 it allows very high priced items to go for market value much easier 2 it allows for most players to spend a little and possibly become instantly rich3 it is funi would simply like to see this as a contract type along with auctionsitem exchanges same basic format as current lotteries but ran ingame seller sets up a contract as type lottery and sets minimummaximum available tickets and or draw time seller sets up ticket price and maximum per player if needed buyers can buy a few tickets and come back later to buy more should be simple and fun but not sure about the hit on sql servers tracking this sort of datathanks
not supportedcurrently in order to successfully hold a big lottery you need to have cultivated trust in the eve community that makes trust a very valuable commodity and one i believe is rightly compensated a formalized lottery contract would be a stealth nerf to trust in order to boost what is in all honesty a peripheral issue to the game
after an initial reaction of that would be cool i read the first response and i have to agree with the reasons why it would be bad sorryno support
given how sketchy the contract system is i cant see this being anywhere near as flexible as the forumbased lotteries and while the lotteries i ran were all legit i do like the fact that scams are possible cool idea but no dice
so youre looking to make having a low security status easier one of the things that appeals people to a life of piracy is the attraction to living life on the edgethe warning is there so new players dont make the mistake but theres no way a new player not an alt or such will use this message i do not support this idea
as a 10 individual i occasionally take shortcuts through high sec assuming im in a fast enough ship to avoid the faction police to escape pursuers who might not be so keen to follow me there i dont want or need any message like that popping up and stopping my progress in the heat of the moment in general i dont support any kind of handholding in new eden for folks with negative sec status you break the law you live with the consequences if youre too dumb to figure out what systems you can or cant go it you deserve whatever ill fate awaits youif such an idea were implemented it better be a setting in the options window that was by default set to not give me those warnings easiest solution just embrace the 10 and avoid confusion altogether
pretty much this its not like you can become kos without some indication that youre headed down that path you blew up the opposing empires ships you got concorded whatever so this shouldnt be a surprise to the player

i havent thought through the whole real life economics of this plan and the negatives but i would like eve to have a new subscription type that would be one where you could at a reduced cost of the normal subscription be able to continually trains skills already injected into your toon the cost i thought of would be like 5 a monthi know at times with this game ive gotten bored with playing the game but still wanted to train skills but i didnt feel like paying the whole price just to train skills this would enable those that want to take a break from the game but still are willing to come back eventuallyevery once in a while you would still have to subscribe completely for a month in order to inject new skills you had unlocked but it would still be profitable it would be a negligible bandwidth usage on the eve servers so that wouldnt cost eve too much

character farmer detected
ok i never even thought of it as a character farming systemi just saw it as a system for when you get bored or lack of time with the game as a way to keep training skills while not having to pay the whole price my main only has a little over 6mill but ive been away for 2 years prior to starting back about a month ago
unfortunately this the character farmers would latch onto this like a fat kid with a chocolate bar the could now train 3 characters for resale for what it costs them to train one now
as i said and i will personally admit since i havent ever even considered buying a toon it never even came to my mind in retrospect i see where this is not a good idea for the whole of eve though i still wish i could do it myself
wow you read my mind lol
personally i think turning down the alpha on the shield to make the effect more solid would actualy make the newer effect look better right now they dont look any were near substantial enough to be working properly
good idea
they should make the front end rotate just like the thrusters in the amarr shuttle of old

introducitonit has previously been identified by csm that enhancements to the ship fitting interface is needed and by all accounts ccp has listened in the form of our current interface and the ability to share fits amongst fellow pilots and corporationswhat might be missing from this current interface iteration is an aggregator one that can pull all the modules from a fit that you may have never built before and will locate the corresponding market item types for the usersuch an enhancement has great potential for speeding up the fitting process and getting pilots out doing what they do best by simply linking the current ship fitting interface with an aggreggator that can locate the modules into a singular view on the market interface thereby allowing quick purchasing ability by the user for the modules in a particular fitproposalexpand the ship fitting interfaces current role to an aggreggator that can pull or push to the market interface the module types of a particular fit thereby providing a single sheet purchase list as is currently when viewing subcategories via the market interface of the corresponding modulesconsiderationswhile there may be negatives associated with this proposal  based on the current igb enhancements and the current iteration of the ship fitting interface it seems that it is both appropriate and benificial to offer suggestions that will streamline the buy to fly time associated with buying and building ships and then flying themsome positives that i feel are worth pointing to are enhanced new player experience by limiting the amount of time required in fitting ships and thereby decreasing the learning curve associated with memorizing market location of all module and item types associated with a particular fit enhanced veteran player experience by streamlining the buy to fly experience getting pvpers etc back into their prefered ships doing what they want to do increased market activity by potentially boosting market volumes of various modules as a direct result of the streamlining of user purchasesclosing summarythinking about this proposal i hope it is not taken as a make my life easier type of idea but rather simply pointing out a area where two interfaces all pilots use can be dovetailed together to create a streamlined buy to fly experience that can only benefit everyone in my humble opinion

1 give drones hitpoints that take into consideration that drones are going to be shot in short increase here hp so they do not get insta popped by sentries in lowsec frigates in pvp and sleepers in wormholes decreasing there signature radius could be a valid option because a light drone has sig radius of a frigate and that is not right drones shouldnt be inta poped by sleepers as that leaves drone boats extremely ineffective 2 give t2 drones increased resistances like those of a hac this is advanced technology that uses advanced materials to improve strength of armor just as it does with all t2 ships3 rig that improves dronebay size would come in 3 flavors small medium and large each rig would give 10 m3 for small 20 m3 for medium and 50 m3 for large4 rig that improves bandwidth allowed 5 mbs for small rig 10 mbs for medium rig and 25 ms for large both of these rigs must have drawbacks 5 t2 versions of all drone upgrades please including tracking link and navigation computer 6 a t1 and t2 version of drone damage mod same stacking penalties as those for standard damage mods apply drones are the only weapon type that has no damage mod 7 change the sentry drone damage augmenter to give damage bonus to all drones 8 make sentry drones require and apply racial skills that provide them with a damage bonus of 10 at lvl 5 9 make drone control range dictate at witch range you loose control on sentry drones rather then how far can the target be from you in order for you to be able to make your drones fire 10 add more options for tweaking drone aggression that would include prioritizing targets for drones like i could make all my heavy drones first attack cruisers then attack battleships and only then attack frigates this helps both in pvp when jammed and in all sorts of pve situations allowing us to prioritize target drone is attacking according to what it is doing to drone owner scramming etc would be awesome 11 hull repair drones 12 t2 version of every ewar and combat utility drone that reqires there respective skill at lvl 5 13 make drone interfacing and ships bonus to drone damage apply to all effects of utility drones including ecm and webbing drones yes this means that domi with webbing drones would be a threat 14light target painting drones suck they are useless maybe there should be only light variation of tp drone with proper stats of a heavy drone maybe something else should be done i am not sure how this should be resolved 15 let us see hp of drones in baymy proposal is an attempt to improve versatility of drone boats and comfort of using themplease point out specifically which part of this proposal you disagree with if you do all numbers suggested are approximals and are to be determined by ccp
numbers 5 11 and 15 would be ok and ewar drones need a buffas for the rest no way too much buff and i think all current rigs have the same bonuses regardless of size and i like thatishtar 100k away from you shooting with drones 50k away from you with mediums full of traking links lows full of damage mods rigs for more damage all v set of sentry drones which are freaking hard to kill and automatically go for best targets regardless of players control no
damage mods and rigs for damage do not work togethernoone stated that damage mod for drones has to go into low slot in order for them to go for the best target you would probably have to spend hours tweaking there behavior and you can still trick em maybe the drones shouldnt go for the best target but being able to control if drones it untill you tell them to fire fire at what you fire or fire back at whatever fires at you would be nice now there behavour does not make sence you launch them at one target and then they go for random targets well giving a frigate sised ship a rig that increases its drone bay by 25 m3 wouldnt be right would it
mixed bag herei dont support these ideas the benefit to drones is you dont need ammo the drawback is they can get shot if you make them more tanky then you damper the kill his drones first aspect of pvp especially solo pvpsentry drones already get 5  level of the sentry drone interfacing as well as 2  level of racial drone specialization for t2 sentries on top of that they get a whopping 20 dmg bonuslevel for drone interfacing these all seem pretty good more diversity in builds is good dont care for these either this would be ridiculously overpowered theyd have to dramatically drop the jam strength on all ecm drones to compensate crunch the numbers if you havent last time i ran the numbers i think the odds of 5 vespa600s jamming something like a deimos were in the neighborhood of 43 every 20 seconds impliment the drone interfacing bonus alone that you suggest that number goes to 86 every 20 seconds and with the t2 ecm drones you propose id guess that number would hedge over 90 i guess id commend you for making the deimose a viable ship but the game would become one big ecm drone fest of everyone filling their mids with eccm and filling their drone boats with ecm something probably needs to be done to make these worthwhileapproved
read along and you will find that i support many parts of the proposal but i dont support them all together there would still have to be much balancing between them because drone boats are very powerful as it is for people that know how to fly them simply because theyre like 6 ships all in one1 i support slightly lower sig radius but i will scream if their hp is touched2 supported but only by 10 over t1 drones and only if t1 drone resists are lowered slightly3 supported if implemented as a percentage and if the drawback is two of these three sig radius speed and align time4 not supported a lot of work is put into making sure ship types are balanced and i dont want to encounter somebody flying a raven fitted with 6 t2 siege launchers and also be able to throw 5 heavy drones at me5 supported but lower the efficiency of t1s6 not supported7 just no8 ive never encountered a pc sentry drone to be honest so i dont know how powerful they are right now no comment9 it is my understanding that sentry drones have a pretty long range of their own this is supported as long as there is a 75 or something else that makes sense penalty to drone control range with sentries10 no no no no no no your drones are not sleepers they are dumb and we dont need to make things better for people who dont know how to use a drone boat if you do not directly control what targets your drones shoot at and just let them attack whatever you are a bad drone pilot end of discussion no11 either that or have a ship repair array for poses as things are it is a very bad thing to get into structure when you live in whs theres really no need for hull repair drones other than at poses though whos going to be using them in combat12 just make them balanced13 no but make separate ship bonuses for different types of drones perhaps we can make ewarspecialized frigs have bonuses to ecm drones or something along those lines14 i say lets get rid of tp drones altogether15 yes and maybe just maybe have a highslot module that repairs your drones but only while theyre in your drone bay and make it take several minutes to do its job
ok according to responses i am going to modify the proposal lets see if the second version is any better 1i think that currently in many instances drones are too easy to kill especially it hurts when you try to fight sleepers solo and when its t2 drones that die so i propose one of the three solutions lower sig radius increase hp or increase resists imao the t1 drones could be left as they are but t2s need to become tougher how much tougher so that following scenarios become truelarge drones are harder to track then a cruisermedium drones are about as hard to track as a frigate with an absmall drones can be hit with reasonable efficiency only with small guns2 rig that improves dronebay size would come in 3 flavors small medium and large each rig would give 10 m3 for small 20 m3 for medium and 50 m3 for large3 rig that improves bandwidth allowed 5 mbs for small rig 10 mbs for medium rig and 25 ms for large both of these rigs must have drawbacks 4 t2 versions of all drone upgrades please including tracking link and navigation computer 5 a t1 and t2 version of drone damage mod same stacking penalties as those for standard damage mods apply drones are the only weapon type that has no damage mod it could be midslot or highslot but i think there should be one if not then at least change the sentry drone damage augmenter to give damage bonus to all drones or give us rigs that gives damage bonus for every drone type6 make sentry drones require and apply racial skills that provide them with a damage bonus of 10 at lvl 5the problem is they do not receive a 2  level of racial drone specialization for t2 sentries and i am proposing that they should7allow me to choose wether drones should agress only after direct order if they should agress whoever i fire at agress whoever fires at me or automatically attack all hostiles withing range 8 hull repair drones  9 make hips bonus to drone damage apply to all effects of utility drones including ecm and webbing drones yes this means that domi with webbing drones would be a threat after all drones should work better on a drone boat10light target painting drones suck they are useless maybe there should be only light variation of tp drone with proper stats of a heavy drone maybe something else should be done i am not sure how this should be resolved 11 let us see hp of drones in bayrepping drones especially for a group of people isnt all that hard with a couple small hullreping drone and 1 remote repper it could be done although it takes timethe problem with implementing it as w percentage is that you get myrm with say a rig that gives 15 bonus to drone bay capacity that is going to be 1725 m3 and that is kind of stupid because the last 25m3 cannot be used for anything a fixed value that is different for frigates cruisers and battleships should work better
gday alljust wondering if you can put forward a minor thing im frustrated about hehbeing an agressive pirate and all using my specialist guns with the various mods i also use to get the best from them im constantly annoyed by the fact that the preset orbital ranges supplied by eve ingame cannot be preset by the player or on the flyis it not possible to set a box up where we can manually preset the orbital ranges we wish to keep from our targetsthis would greatly affect the optimal ranges our guns require without affecting the gampeplay mechanics in an unfair way to all players involvedjust a thought
you should know aboutright click on the orbit button on your overviewclick set default orbit distancetype in desired orbit distance in metershit enterleft click the orbit buttonedit thatll only give you one custom preset distance but its something you can use right now without a csm proposal and a bunch of waiting
maybe set distances when you set up your overview settings so you would load vaga and you would have x number of orbiting distances that you have previously set that would fit your optfall off ranges you could right click orbit on your overview and you could select the presaved orbits and or enter the distance
hi everybodyid like to ask a question do you agree with current ccp policy supporting corp thieveslets consider what we have we have corporate hangars that have only 7 divisions and if someone has access to division x he has access to all divisions x on all poses and offices sure you can place pos for each corp member but it will cost a lot of time and isks ship maintenance bays much worth because they have only 1 division why pilots cant have personal assets divisions on poses lets compare corp thieves and pirates if you are attentive and understand game mechanics you can always avoid pirates in high sec systems also it is not hard to avoid them in low security systems it is a game you can play with them or not  it is your choice but if you wish to avoid corp thieves attack you have to place outpost in every system where you live do you think it is normal that ccp made incredibly hard to keep private assets in space untouchedso i can suggest 3 ways of solving the problem1 corporate hangar arrays ship maintenance bays should have some personal divisions accessible only by a certain character2 make corp hangar division access system more flexible to have an opportunity to give access to a pilot group of pilots to a certain division on certain pos office3 make personal hangar arrays with ship maintenance in itthe first is best because the second will be hard to use and third will need to onlineanchor to many structures also first and third solutions need to support the mechanics of unanchoring structure when personal assets placed in ps i thought about posting this about a year but as usual it happens an incident pushed me to write it right nowpss havent checked character which starts the topic sparkling lord is main
first off your ops reasoning is just flat off the wallcorp theivery is a poor excuse for a premise to change the systemthat said i have to concur the system is just flat wackedin all honesty the corp hanger arrays should use the same permission system of the main corp hangers in the stationsoutpostsposs apparently do not as ive found out recently frustrating as hellas for personal arrays i dont know about that but it is a problem and it does need fixingps im a bit of a pos noob yes but it should be obvious how to set it up its not
poses already have personal hangars theyre called giant secure containers it is your duty to ensure that you trust somebody before you give them access to anything that you dont want to lose until that point if they need to store things of theirs in the pos you tell them to anchor a container
as i remember it is impossible to anchor containers under force field anchoring out of force field is rediculous in 00 also i dont think that you can place everything in giant secure container for example ships to have only one ship on pos is not good idea because you need at list 1 pvp and 1 hunting ship
well thats not a big deal you can give people access to a ship maintenance array with reasonable safety even somebody does steal a ship it can only be one and it can only be one they have the skills to flyalso i know that my corps pos has a container in it whether its anchored or not i dont know i thought putting it out made it anchored but its been there for 2 weeks and hasnt gone anywhere
the trust  the only thing you cant buy in eve
if ccp would let us use giant secure containers in poses it would solve alot of simular problems and i would be happy
yes yes and yesyes
tracking advantage with rediculous dps and a whole lot of other problems and 100km is still far shorter than 114 eagle got 10 bonus better tracking and better alpha and noit wont outdo the muninn same range better dps worse alpha worse tracking and what you mean by one less sb muninn needs one deimos will need 0 kinda wrong here too the same role that noone needs and noone wants you propose the rail deimos to become a close range hac great idea i see what you did therenot really you got brutix and well thats it you forget that most ships doesnt even have the grid to fit 250mms this including the brutix so no read above and youll discover its not all about the dps of the zealot and currently lasers do more dps with better tracking instant ammo switch no reloading
looks like a very convincing argument for nerfing the zealot
deimos needs power grid extremely bad it starts off starving for power grid also boost the damage output
the eagle would really benefit from a boost to pg more than anything else id also like to see the scan resolution normalized between the ships there doesnt seem to be any balance need for one ship to lock slower than another it is not an insignificant benefit to be able to switch to normal ammo and get the same range without the tracking penalty other ships have to take with long range ammoi wouldnt mind seeing medium rails get a slight boost and rails in general have slightly reduced cap usage but 20 damage would be way over the top
eagle can do 189 dps at 12615 with fn iridium with 00315 tracking what is balanced compared to the muninn add the 20 rail boost and you look at 226 dps here so you out track out damage and out range the muninn at the same time if you fit 3 gyros on the muninn you will also have 30km more lock range that you can use without any falloff penalties deimos snipemagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iimagnetic field stabilizer iitracking enhancer iitracking enhancer iitracking enhancer iiyt8 overcharged hydrocarbon i microwarpdrivesensor booster ii targeting rangelarge shield extender ii250mm railgun ii spike m250mm railgun ii spike m250mm railgun ii spike msmall energy neutralizer ii250mm railgun ii spike m250mm railgun ii spike mancillary current router icore defence field extender iwarrior ii x5hornet ec300 x5muninn snipegyrostabilizer iigyrostabilizer iitracking enhancer iitracking enhancer iitracking enhancer iiyt8 overcharged hydrocarbon i microwarpdrivesensor booster ii targeting rangelarge shield extender ii720mm howitzer artillery ii tremor m720mm howitzer artillery ii tremor m720mm howitzer artillery ii tremor m720mm howitzer artillery ii tremor m720mm howitzer artillery ii tremor mstandard missile launcher ii caldari navy sabretooth light missilestandard missile launcher ii caldari navy sabretooth light missileancillary current router iionic field projector iwarrior ii x5diemosmuninnrange 11415  11422tracking 0009  0012alpha 824988  1370 1712  20 rail boost  25 alpha boostdps 235282  198  you really would use a muninnspeed  align 1657ms  69  1616ms 72 ehp 192k  18klock range 130km  134km  after extra rig if you use 3 gyros you will end up with 110 km and only 0011 tracking dps will still be sub par to the diemos with 223so the long range diemosalso the eagle would make the muninn inferior at long range and this is the only role it gotthat is more a problem with the diemos concept than his actual rolealso a lot of people liked the medium range diemos since it addresses all the points why hacs with long range guns are useless at lower rangesehp dps tracking and flexibility it also donUFFFDt messes with the long range hac balance since any kind of optimal bonus willbrutix thorax astarte moa ferox vulture
agree with topic starter2 the djegocompare deimos with ishtar in close and long range and you will understand the idea of deimos reviewing
this i dont really want to convert the deimos into a sniping hac but it does need a buff as few people fly them because they are a bad investmentin order for the deimos to be worth the price it needs to do what it does better than the brutix it needs to be much faster and much harder to hit while heaping out damageright now you have to plate tank them which makes them slow they also have a large sig compared to other hacs so youve got this blaster boat that is slow to align slow to move and easy to hit its dps is fairly gimped if you put a 1600mm plate on it as well because then you can only fit electrons unless you burn your rig slots on acrs which you shouldnt have to dothats what needs to be fixedbuff the grid lower its align time lower its signiture buff its speed slightlydo that and you have a ship that can get into range wont instantly melt and can apply a healthy share of dps before its primaried off the fieldit seems like this is what the deimos is supposed to be its still going to be primaried but at least this way youll get your monies worth out of the hull before it explodes
although im in favour of even more frigate sized ships which is why im supporting it isnt an introductory logisticsstyle ship covered by the t1 cruisers that the logistics hulls use augoror osprey exequror scythe
the t1 logistic hulls is like getting first aid from a person with 1 arm first its funny then you bleed to death cuz he cant apply that bandageedit  not realy but most of them are of no use
yes would be nice carriers have nothing to do with this there is enormous number of instances when carriers are not available or are useless you cannot get carrier in highsec and getting it into wormhole is a pain
wow hadnt realized it was time for another logistics frigate thread yetsaid yes last time and the time before that but if you want to see it in game then be prepared to bump this thread for the next year bribe csm candidates and possibly top it off with a naked demo outside ccps officeswould seriously love to see this in game on the hulls you mentioned with the following bonusesfrigate bonus  xx reduction in small transfer fittingfrigate bonus  xx reduction in small transfer cap needlogistics frig bonus  160 range to small transfers per lvl just under 40km range at lvl 5logistics frig bonus  15 reduction in mwd signature radius penaltythe bonuses would affect whichever type of transfer unit applied to each racethe reason for stealing the mwd bonus from interceptors is because logistics frigates would have to work outside of neut range and if youve ever flown a frigate at 20 km distance from a cruiser youll know that an af type tank wont make the slightest bit of differencea bonus to ab speed could have the same affect but it would need to be sufficient to keep range on a mwd cruiser
i would really like to see this as the step towards logistics cruisers can be quite a pain with the logistics skills to 5 for a logistics cruiser a midway stop which doesnt make the logistic cruisers obsolete would be niceit could be a nice addition to small roaming gangs with afs interceptors etc if it were to receive bonuses to speed and signal reduction as it would make for specialized ship which could quite easily be taken out by one of the same size but would be a torn in the eye of bigger ships so i definitely see a place for it in eveand please to you who keep on dragging the carrier argument in here it is neither meant for frigate gangs nor roaming gangs
nolook we dont need every role replicated in a frigate hull i swear people are going to be asking for frigate sized dreadnaughts next because pos sieging in frigates is coolthe essential problem with a logistics frigate is that logistics are well in short too powerful to fit on a frig hull which means those frig hulls become expensive caskets because of being primary every time with frigate ehp or become op due to being basically unkillableyou know like frigate sized ecm ships ecm is powerful enough it guarantees that everyone who is capable of firing on you will fire on you and you have frigate ehp frigates dont have a lot of it this is why frig recons were a bad idea too
this is relevant to my interests
signedlast day of apocrypha 1030 eve time right before they screw up doomsdays cmon ccp you know you want to watch this
someone force a ccp member to do itnot with a normal dd nobut with a gm dd that does omni damage for 200kmover 9000 million damageperiod
way to nerd it up geek google maps punctuation hey look it is a town in mongolia here is some you can use for the above and below message nerd         hope they help for future forum rages and way to go if you did manage to keep your decers docked lol what you went at them with 20 ships lol v 2 yeah cause they deced you they should undock lol the chickens you friggin nerdseriously if you wish ccp could place a point system linked to battleclinic victor in points gets the price how does that sound if no points counted on either side no reward to either partybut come on forum trolls this was about a very simple request not a whole redesign of eve there needs to be something done to memberscorps that leave a war deced corpalliance thats it very simple easy as nothing big
cant find the devblog but its something along the lines ofanyone at any time may leave a corp for any reasaon as long as the corp they left doesnt fold  its working as intendedstraight from ccp
was going to see who out of the two of you had more experience seen this and never bothered to look up the other guy 
so you run out of arguments and start attacking people personally that is what i call style neverthelessthis
with the new fleeting changes  which i love btw  fcs need a feature that lets them know how many of x hull are in their fleetsif i call for sniper bss and tackle i have to sit there and count how many of x ship type are in fleet etcits annoying and time consuming and it makes the situation very foggy if i have the numbers to engagealso having a icon that says x person is 2 jumps from fcs current system is huge too and seems very easy to addplease work on this ccp 
this sounds like a great idea im not an fc yet but i often wondered how the fcs keep track of what ships and where they are
i checked here to support this ideadiscussion
supported
supported whole heartedly
supported  though just rename personnel manager or something make that the required role
this issue was raised to ccp during our september iceland meeting
good news what was the response or is it nda atm
problem with this is theres always a way around for example if some saysselling isk 1499  500m 2499  11bwhat do you ban all words included in there are vital to this game except 1499 and 2499 say you ban 1499 and 2499 the isk sellers will just do 1498 and 2498 and then 97 96 95 and so on they can make it very brief if you attempt this and make it almost impossible to catch i recommend using the block function eve has put in place to block them quickest approachsecondly the idea about the pw every so many minuteshours the problem here is say your in the middle of combat the message pops up and you need to turn on your reppersyou die petition process increases because people wont settle with this problem furthermore the people your targeting with the pw simply change their macro to type it in every interval thus it would be redundant before even implementedif there was some miracle process to stop these spammers excluding the removal of noob trial then ccp would do it as it is in their best interests to keep the game alive furthermore there could be taxlegal consequences with having people use ccps game as a income producing activity i have seen alot of games which have implemented these sensor word programs and they just end up horribly wrong
i like lotteries and all but this one gets the rock thrown at it
some decent points here though i believe high price item movement in eve is more than peripheral i really like to stay in game and not come to the forums to look for contractsitems and would simply like to see as one point made the complete contract system get an overhaul and become more robustmaybe in the cosmos site something like this will be implemented
bolded is the reason i would agree with this while im not really a full fledged pirate ie im not all 10 and flashy everywhere i do my fair share of naughty stuff and i did recently lose a ship because of this jumping into a 06 system not because i was running from anyone but because i was simply roaming in random directions looking for something and i jumped into a 06 and died a horrible death to the faction naviessupported but only if it is default set to not popup
not supportedi am in support of a way to more easily see the secrating of the system on the other side of the gate though the way things are now takes too long to obtain that information how about just putting the sec status in parentheses behind the gate name stargate jita 09 or stargate jita 09 or maybe put the secstatus like you put the bounty amount in the info window in the toprightstargate jitasecurity 09if your secstatus is low enough that you cant go into some highsec systems then you should have enough experience to know which secratings you cannot go into and ccp should not be holding your hand via popup boxes
did you already notice those shiny little dots on the left side on your screen next to the system name in the route listing they give you a nice idea about the sec status doesnt helps with fscked faction standing oh well you cant have everything i guessthough i am not sure what all the crying is about i even run cruisers through highsec with the navy chasing me
sometimes people just roam around without setting a destination
the first time faction police started shooting my i had no idea that they would attack you if standing with faction drops below 5 please make some sort of warning as we all know all popups can be turned off
maybe use the tools god err ccp gave you especially if you know that jumping in certain systems can get you killed
putting a warning in saying concord will come to kill the pirate is a lie concord doesnt care about sec status only faction navies does
failpost is failive been playing this game for 3 years and have only fairly recently topped 50m skillpoints to give a new player 510m skill points would be a kick in the teeth for older players who have invested time and money in the gamei started nearly all my chars on the old 9000 i think sps and built up from theretheyve messed around with more skill points for noobies before and stopped it now theyve got double training speed for a bitlife is rewarding for those with patience for those who cant be 4red to wait then wow is waitingeve has got a steep learning curve which is good since it sorts the wheat from the chaff those with the patience to stick with the game are better than the omygodzinturnetspaceships to fly type player who wants everything now think of the l5 days on the test server where people just got giddy and shot at anything undocking from the stationif your that way out and want to sit in station to train for 6 months thank you for helping to fund the game i play and by not creating as much lag by flying your inturnetspaceships around inconveniencing the rest of the playerbase
nice idea it would promote overheating even more cause i still think its not used as much as it shouldi will raise it
good idea i prefer option 1
agreed
great idea had a similar thought a while back but scrapped it as i couldnt come up with a good thing to hit with a drawback so forgot about ithad thought of cap consumption but it has no impact on most midslots and the capless weapon systemswhat would make a good drawback one that does not benefit one side more than others
fail post strategic cruisers are irrevelant to the question herelets say the bonus would be 01 would it be overpowered noit wouldnt be very useful eitherits all about finding the right balancealso it has to be a rig 
well the topic is here for quite a while and many things have been said  both supportive as well as those which are in contrarylet me do a quick summary and speak up my suggestions which i would like to address to ccp devscurrent situation apocryphatalking about damage in eve ranging from frig to bs we have basically 3 primary weapon types1 missiles2 turrets3 dronesit is quite important to make it clear here that by primary weapon we understand an essential part of the ship which is bringing through the nature of its purpose as well as through bonuses given by specific ship the major percentage of total dpsnow there are ways in eve to counter this is very important word in my understanding counter not to remove entirely any of primary dps weapon by multiple means as an example you can use ecm to counter basically any primary weapon  for drones assuming you manage to keep a perma jam from the start on top of that for missiles you can use fofs which we know suck quite a lot i know that ccp is looking into it atm for turrets you can use tracking disruptors sens damps are here as well as a general tool ofc ofc not much use at a close range on top of that you can pop any drone which is harrasing you any timethe message i want to deliver to all of you  players of eve as well as ccp devs is sentries in lowsec should not interfere with whatever pvp aggression by means of removing entirely the primary weapon of any shipthis is not about favouring any race or ships this is about the way dps is being delivered in eve existing types of weapons should be respected and allowed to have a fair chance to live to its purpose in this gamei have read carefully this entire thread and other similar as well i know thoughts many of you thinking now that with drones being safe in lowsec we have a problemi do not agreeandy why1 a drone boat itself will be aggressed by sentries the same way as any other boat missile or turret based in fact there will be more dps landing on the aggressing side because sentries will not cycle through bunch of t1 drones used just to divert sents dps2 you all use eft the same way as i do and i believe most of you have done the homework to figure out that there is a balance in general and as such drone boat of its class has roughly the same dps as turret boat of the same class ofc with some variations etc etc but in general yes it does3 pirates are today not ganking you in lowsec with myrmidon but with brutix hurricane or harbinger but they do i am using those t1 bcs ofc just as an example  if the balance is restored some of them will use myrmidon instead of any of those 3 but the damage output will be similar so what is the dealwhat will it bringmore balance to lowsec in my eyes and i am sure many of eve players can support it people will be able to field also drone boats with their primary weapon in tactshould there be still a concern about too much ganking in lowsec i do not mind this being topic to be discussed as well there are ways to do it eg give sentries more dps implement tracking issue on sentries to allow smaller  faster ships to operate etc etcbut the issue itself is not about drones it is more general and defines the lowsec as a wholeso or so drones as being for many ships primary weapon by its nature should not be disadvantaged to other primary weapons in lowsec they are not in 00 and not at war time as in such a way substantial amount of offensive warfare is removed but on a selective base which is not fairlooking forward to read your responses hopefully one of such being from ccpmany thanks for reading this

or how ccp plays favorites and continues to screw the little guyi dont know how many people have decided to make npc space home but its a lot and im sure a lot of them including myself want to know why ccp thinks that people in npc 00 space are fine with being left out of this upcoming patch of course they say theyll look into doing something with the space in the near future yeah right after they implement the changes to rigs changing the ratio of salvage drops limiting insurance on criminal acts in highsec introduce flying through planets or my favorite walking in stations ccp saying they will look at something in the future has become code for we dont give a rats ass it will never get doneif this change isnt implemented fairly across all of 00 at the same time then people can expect npc space to become a wasteland and the players who have a home there may not just move to another area but move to an entirely new game
well i get the reference im not sure how many others will p
apparently you can only say things like that out loud if you are the company president who knew

i like the idea of dust 514 but ill never play it in its current form which is sad because im an fps player at heart
im gonna go with not enough info on the dust to eve mechanic to really discuss this properlywe dont have any real information on how the actions of the console merc corps will affect the universe in eve ccp hasnt announced it yet probably because they havent finished it yeti think there was a link to be created at launch which could be built upon over time to really bring the two games togethernot supported for lack of information on game mechanics only
well if mazz was just crying out for attention i think she got it just heard the latest channel massive podcast and this whole business of csm issues for sale was mentioned another dark spot on the csms already tarnished reputation
haha wow ive never heard of this channel massive podcast before but apparently someone with my name submitted a lead to the story i downloaded it and finally found the bit i loled mazzs alt
one only has to compare votes cast against accounts subscribed to realise that damm near nobody gives a flying fig about the csm or their fevered egosyou can automate the role of csm we have now its called a forum poll everybody else has had them for a decadegive us the csm we were originally promised and stop charging us money for this weak talking shop that we cant do anything about

i support wallet divisions for individual playersi also support the idea of a self tax which can be used to siphon off a bit of isk which can then be put into one of the personal wallet divisions of my choice
o thanks for the bump thought it died
a very good idea idea would make things alot easier and faster
i agree with this ideakind of having one pane of multiple sell orders would be a nightmarea better idea might be to make them added to the quickbar that way you can view each module individually and still have all the modules saved you could even use the ship name as the reference in the bar and have various fits compress to folders similar to buddies or other market categorieshonestly given the amount of scamming in a station where items are sold well above their value the aggregate would be a headache to work with i like your thinking and i support the idea but not in the way you have stated
yeah that would be sweeti do support
massive thumbs up
thumbs up as well implementation of the whole system could be very problematic true maybe just give the option of opening market details on item in fitting at last dont know why you cant do it nowalso with new igb an option to link a fit on a website would be great add special tag for eve browser only fit  for example or a js hook like the ones that are present already and make it feed xml data into eve browser could check if content of the xml file is valid and contains no binary code that could present a security risk that way you could pull fits from killboards alliancecorp forums battleclinic etc
really good idea killing a bit more of the admintype jobs you get bogged down in that acumulate to hours of drudge
hmm ya
supportnothing is more annoying than clicking load fit in jita only to find im missing one mod or have another meta of the same modwhile were at it how about we have it pull from cans as well i actually keep everything i have in a freight container to cut down on clutter
dumbing down is for wow they did this in daoc they did this in wow  is it a sign that an mmo has jumped the shark when they do thisso much for the exploration profession which brought a lot of players back and kept many more in the game i guess its back to gank and blob or mining and productionor leave
more sites spawn than before and they are easier to find with a newer probing system than before now the skill reqs are coming down meaning more people than ever can probe meaning the loot gained loses value as its way more commonall this adds up to a reduced reward for people who really want to do this as a profession especially with the chance of very little or nothing dropping at allpersonally ive gone from someone who used to probe and plex regulary and getting a good income from it to a person who now shiptrades afk as a much more guaranteed and less frustrating way to earnthese changes may encourage new or noob players to explore but for advanced players they are a kick in the teeth as it leaves no room for serious specialisation nerfs the skills we spent ages training and surely reduces the chance of good drops and the value of whatever does drop due to larger numbers plexing
this would be awesome
agreed roll back the hackingarch change
its dumb that something as complex and widereaching as an alliance is easier to disband than a war dec is to get approvedi suggest that disbanding an alliance require a 24 hour vote from directors of the executor corp similar to the vote required to approve a war dec there may be better suggestions than this but at least this would be a good startthis may have been raised before but i havent seen it mentioned lately and considering what just happened with cva it merits some attention
supported
there is no reason to have a one click disband option when there are so many other corporatealliance protectionssimple fix long overdue
100 its silly that its harder to execute a war dec than it is to disband a multithousand person alliance  didnt they say theyd fix this after bob
very supported
at least the third time that this has happenedit takes 24 hours to drop corp rolesit takes 10 hours before you can biomass a charit should certainly take at least 24 hours to disband an alliance and maybe 12 hours to kick a corp
i fully support this its just to simple to disband a 1bil iskinvestment  venture24hrs minimum waiting time atleast with a final prompt at the end
yup
about time
long overdue
very much yes
supportings3 the mynx
this is the very least that needs to be done better yet ccp needs to adjust a variety of mechanics to allow corps and alliances to secure their assets and organizations
1 ceo of executor corp pushes prepare to disband2 begin 48hour timer during which time no corps may join or leave the alliance no alliance dues will be paid and no wars may be declared by any participants alliances declaring war against this alliance during this time are notified that the war may not last long because the alliance is preparing to disband3 all directors of all corps in the alliance receive a mail and perhaps an email as well announcing the button push4 all ceos are given the option to vote against the disbanning if onethird of the ceos vote against the alliance must be disbanded via petition so it will be investigated by ccp and made sure that the person who pushed the button is the person that rightfully owns the character5 after the timer expires with littleno opposition the disband alliance button activates for 24 hours if the button isnt pushed within 24 hours it goes away and the alliance returns to a normal statecorp ceos are only to oppose the disbanding if they believe the ceo of the alliance has been compromisedseriously of all the timers and protections that different things have for the matter of security in case of account compromise the disbanding of an alliance should be the hardest
i concur with the opcopied from my earlier post in caodthe ability to nullify a power structure as important as a large scale player alliance from a single account is not right within the context of the universe ccp is trying to foster in my opinionweather you like cva and its policies or not is irrelevant this discussion should not be about politicslikewise this is also not a condemnation of the value that espionage and covert operations play within eve i strongly believe that black ops politics and spy games help make eve such a great game and help contribute to the sense that players are the ones who control and alter the history of the universebut if ccp wants to foster the growth of all kinds of player alliances security in the controls and mechanisms affecting large power structures need to be more thought out and formalized its not as if the ceo of a real life corporation can liquidate the company without the consent of the board democratic government figureheads like presidents cannot dismantle their governments with a single action without incurring retribution similarly there should be no such way to do a similar thing in eve without at least a vote or formalized consent from the leaders of all the predetermined affected parties

indeed stupid mechanic is stupid
definately agreed it should not be faster to disband an alliance than quit a corp
so when it happened to bob it was all hell yeah but now that it has happened to cva it is all stupid game mechanic it should be reversed and fixedi could give a rip about either alliance right now but the exact same thing happened before and ccp stood by their guns i hope they do the same here as wellmaybe if people would stop account sharing or giving too many people access to such power in a holding corp

signedccp get this done now no dont wait a year before you can be bothered to do it or just ignore everyone as usual do it in the next patch its pathetic that such a game mechanic exists and it should have been fixed shortly after it happened to bob
going to war takes longer and is apparently more complex than disbanding an alliancehow is this a good mechanic
the topic is about fixing the broken mechanic that is being used to do this it isnt about reversing the disband im sure that during the bob disband threads that the broken mechanic was discussed but with all the lol posts it might have been missedi seem to recall that this is at least the 3rd time this has happened but i cant for the life of me recall who was hit before bobagain we are not suggesting a rollback here we are suggesting that the mechanic is broken where as i understand the process you can kick corps and then disband the alliance in minutes when you cant even resign from a corp without dropping roles which has a 24 hour cool off periodi agree totally therehowever there is a mechanism to stop people being kicked from a corp when they have roles and a 24 hour timer to strip their roles there is nothing at all in place for kicking corps etc
this is stupid and needs to be fixed asap
yep a vote by directors would be a sensible mechanic instead of clickdoom

or you could limit who has access to the executor corp youre cool heres the keysor you could not share accounts sure you can borrow my carrier any time you wantor you could not  off people who will wait for revenge did we say nrds yes but not like that this game mechanic is easy to protect against and has only been a problem for idiots
supported actions that have increasing levels on impact on characters corps and alliances should have increasing levels of security not less
the problem which most posters arent realizing istheres not button disband alliance you can only kick corporations one by one until no one is leftmy proposal1 fast change for dominion you can only expell 1 corporation per hour this way a complete disband would take longer and would make it complicated do and getting uninteresting when do you really have to kick more then 1 corp corps can still leave on their own without the delay by pressing leave alliance  mail send to all corporation ceosdirectos of the alliance that corp xyz has been expelled from the alliance2 longterm change for alliance exucitve alliance executive corp ceo can directly expell corporations 1 per hour directors have to make a vote for kicking a corporation similar to war decs atleast 2 directors expell more corporations per hour vote created by ceo overhaul corporation and alliance management interfacei think that my first point should be easy to implement without the needed overhaul of the complete alliancecorporation management interface it reduce the risk of a sudden death of an alliance

one additional thought in support of thisat fanfest this year one of the big themes was social networking and building communities in eveif ccp think there is value in those things then they have to adequately protect them the action with cva is absolutely correct now they need to provide mechanisms to make sure people can protect their communities without having to be ultraparanoid with absolutely everyone sure eve is dark and sure trust has to mean something which is to say it only means something if it can be betrayed but some things are just a nonsense on stiltsif it is wrong to let one character kill 300 ships with one weapon blast then its simply stupid to let one character destroy an alliance and all the history and shared investment people have in itcosmo

absolutely  much better control is needed for something as complex as an alliancepersonally i like the idea that as long as an alliance has members and their fees are paid that the alliance stays the only way to end it would be for all members to leave or the bills to be unpaidof course in this case you would need a solid mechanism for preventing the kick everyone and then leave to close it method  so kicking perhaps should be something that requires more than one person and a timer if the vote isnt unanimousmy 02 isk anyhow

this is first step but there should be more ways corporations and alliances can secure their assets
the issue isnt that metagaming is bad to the contrary i think that it is amazing that we have people that care so much about eve and playing that they spend years to build themselves into an alliance only to wreak havoc hacking is differenti think though that with the current mechanic they are able to wreak way too much havoc theres nothing wrong with a spy throwing a wrench into the cogs but to be able to throw the entire machine out the window and ship it to antarctica without anyone noticing seems a little extremeall we ask for is better management tools for something as complex as alliances so that all the eggs arent in one basket yes spies can still do damage internally but the ability for one person to close out an entire alliance is a bit ridiculous
210 for effect710 for effortoverall  410thank you please troll againsupport as the bob episode and now cva has shown there is somthing broken when an alliance can just dissapear in 30 seconds plus recovering from somthing like this can take weeks for sov regains and billions of isks for recreating the alliance jobs outposts ect
while the drama is always entertaining the mechanic doesnt seem like a good one this becomes even more obvious when you compare the effort needed to disband an alliance to the effort needed do much simpler things they often have timersrequire voting so it seems intuitive that actions with greater affects would require similar safeguards at minimuma high level traitor could still cause critical damage and would remain very useful to the enemy so you would still need to maintain high security but the shenanigans would stay at a more reasonable level

please fix it
given the latest wave of account compromises i propose the following feature which allows a user to detect if his account was accessed by someone other than himselfon the character choosing screen display the time of the last log in together with the name of the network host accessing obtained by a reverse dns lookup this reveals the provider used so if the user is a roadrunner customer but the last log in shows something like iphsd1micomcastnet its obvious that somebody else accessed itto be effective the accesses to the account and character management pages on eveo must also be logged and displayed the feature can be further enhanced by using a whitelist where the user specifies his provider or ip range as soon as an access from outside of that whitelist happens a warning mail is sent to the user this could also trigger other measures but that is to be discussedshare your thoughts
ccp has those logs anyway so i dont see technical problems but currently they can only look at the data after disaster has struck this feature gives the players a warning system
bweh heh heh this would be awesome and the mechanics of implimenting this idea could also be used for giving ships dressing flags for showing off on special occasions such as parades and stuffall of these ideas sound great actually add a less functional more fun side to eve that isnt seen often enough i think the fireworks display i saw in gallente space a month or two ago is evidence enough that people are interested in exploring that side of eve even if at the moment they need to improvise with torpedoes and utility drones
i dunno personally i like the sound of all of this or at least what applies to the drones i use but then im a droneboater so perhaps im jadedi also had an idea for two subcapital carrier classes that would be usable in highsec that would use drones instead of fighters but get similar drone number bonuses as well as damage bonuses in exchange for not having any weapon slotsone would be about the size of battlecruisers the other of battleships though they would use their own skills for instance instead of battlecruisers or perhaps ontop of battlecruisers the person would train escort carriers and instead of race specific battleship the person would train race specific light carriereach of the two would have about the same abilities as its conventional counterpart battlecruisers and battleships however instead of guns or missiles or those and drones all of its damage output would be in its drones aloneunfortunately i had some trouble explaining my idea and it got its share of flames mainly from caldari missileboaters fearing their pve superiority would be threatenedeither way drones do need more love and at the very least a reworked drone ui with some nice shiny buttons like regular weapons get would be lovely
this is a great idea

plz make the client mail motherer when u get mail
did i miss something or are you proposing a void fix that still includes the current tracking penalty i dont like that tbh id like a void that obsoletes everything but maybe dg am or is there something im not realizing seeing
yesgod no why
it is your luck that you know nothing about corp thieves   pilot that has access to ship maintenece can launch all ahips into space and scoop them into carrier no need to fly them all and you have to understand that some ship may cost billions there is no need to steal all these ships just some expensive onesyou can launch containers under force field and they will not gone after 2 hours like jettison comtainers do but you cant anchor them and set password eitheri agree it is not the best solution because of ships but it will sort things a bit
most discussion about ecm revolves around the strength chance of jamming eccm other influencing modules and ship bonuses  sensor strength this proposes a change to the mechanic itselflets take a quick look at sensor range dampening when applied the targets locking range is reduced making it lose any lock beyond the new reduced range or locks being acquired it doesnt necessarily lose all locks it just reduces the choice of what can be locked and attacked range being the deciding factorwhat makes ecm in its current form so powerful is that it acts on a higher level jamming a whole ship yes or no the change i propose is to bring ecm to the same perlock level as dampening meaning roll the dice separately for every existing lock or lock being acquired this way some locks can be lost but not necessarily all it just reduces the choice of what can be shot just like with dampening but with chance being the deciding factorif this is implemented ofc some rebalancing of the strengthsbonuses would also be needed
interesting idea only negative is it would cause alot of calculations on the server for doing a per target chance but otherwise sounds interesting
lock acquired  lost is calculated by the server anyway those few additional random float number that have to be generated are peanuts you could probably generate hundreds if not thousands in the time it takes to do a single database call
interesting idea but personally i think ecm is fine as it is currently you need to be in a specialized ecm ship which have all the armor of a wet paper bag and have good skills to jam anything other than a frigate with relitive safety i find that ecm is good against bc and smaller targets but that damps are better against bs sized ships reason bieng a maxed falcon has a str of 15 against a bss base str of about 25 35 chance means that if you dont have 2 jammers on a single bs you will likely miss a jam and the bs will be able to instapop you on the other hand damps work in a smaller way by only killing their range but are 100 damp chance so as long as you are out of max lock range a bs wouldnt scratch a freighter
ecm just got redone not long ago they arent goin back to itremote damps need to be buffed
i dont think most people even know theres a 2nd caldari hac and the deimos is generally lolfodder waiting to happen they could both use a boost
deimos and eagle need some loving
its not a ships problem its a railguns problem
frigate sized dreadnoughts really no mothershipsyou seem to be taking only the two worst case scenarios into account overpowered ships or useless ships again the idea was not to make a smaller cheaper version of the logistics cruiser with the same performance the idea was a class of ships intended mainly for skirmishing in frigate gangs not 200 vs 200 nullsec slugfests less ehp less repping power more speed and more mobilityif introduced they would have to be balanced anything else would of course be a failureas for frigate recons i take it you were referring to the electronic attack frigates far as i know they have had some success though they cannot be used in every situation according to some they are a bit lacking that may or may not be true they are a fairly new class of ships though and ccp seems to be fond of introducing new gear prenerfed and changing it as they go along an example of that bombs
well if you put it that way
wouldnt logistic frigates fit medium reps to keep them in line with their logistic cruiser counterparts using large reps tbh i dont think they would ever be used without medium reps or a bonus to rep amount

when probing in a system where youve got other members of your fleet floating around it would be helpful to be able to exclude these ships via a checkbox or toggle from scan results window as it works now i need to ask them to all huddle up on me while i run a scan and then manually exclude them this is kind of a drag and reduces the efficiency of scouting out a system for wts

i propose that ccp creates a mission editor for playersplayers then send in the missions they create to ccp who runs their quality assurance process on them and make sure they stand up to ccp standards there could even be some public screening to take away the crappiest missions so ccp dont get bogged downonce the mission is checked and cleared it can easily be added into the normal agent mission rotationim sure we would get a lot of new fun and innovative eve missions if this was to happen
um no city of heroes tried this and everybody started making missions with high payout but minimal risk it turned into a powergamers wet dreami admire qa but theres no way they can detect how a player is able to run a mission well theres a specific team for making missions and they work their tails off making themnot supported
thisnoediti dont think a process to submit ideas for missions would necessarily be a bad thing although i am not sure how such a thing would work but as for having players actually assdemble mission elements and rewards directly lol no
however in eve thats easy to avoid to wit1 level in missions is determined by number and type of rats and a few other things but thats the big one hence the mission generator sets level not the player lp and mission pay can be generated by formula2 bounty and drop is determined by type of ship so thats not player set eitherso really in the specific mission set of eve powergaming is pretty easy to avoidhowever many of the really good missions need specialty stations etc these cannot be player generated  so the tool would have limited utility to do really customizable things  but it could still be easily used to generate a lot of stuff that makes up regular missions such as blockade portal to war etc etcits a good idea the csm should at least present it with the nature of eve missions the powergamery bs you are concerned about should be very easy to avoid
i dont know how city of heroes did it but if it is as you say they obviously werent restrictive enoughhere im talking about maybe 510 missions each month going through the qa process only the best of the best im quite confident the qa people can fly a marauder through the missions and see how long time it takes in relation to how much the mission returnsif this was to be realized the people working their tails off making missions could be freed up doing something else qa for the player made missions perhaps honestly they seem to have lost their imagination a long time ago anyway the only thing that differs one mission from the other is how many waves of rats you get against you some fresh thinking from the players could give some more interesting missions protect a shipyardstationfreighter do something with a time limit deliver a bomb try to hold different strategic locations king of the hill freight large items too large for battleships through a mission where rats constantly attack you get support from npcs destroy gates that spawn enemies before you are overwhelmed play small minigames with shuffling around stuff in different containers perhaps missions where more than 1 person is required to complete it maybe have to hold different locations at oncei could go on and on about cool ideas that we probably will never see in eve
this is what i mean lets make an eom mission with lots of eom death knights 1m isk bounty light damage well have four or five of them come per wave in about 5 waves payout is about 25m for the bounties alone and one lar ii can handle all the incoming damage this mission can be completed in about 30 minutes max with a good setupand this is just one example think of the other highvalue bses with light damage i dont think i need to say any more
let me quote myself for you as you dont seem to read what i write anywayyoure not implying that the qa people are so stupid that they cant see such an obvious flaw even if they dont react on the npc rat type at first they sure as hell would notice it when they breeze through the mission when they test itits not like im suggesting here that anyone can just slap together a mission and have it running in eve the next day that would just be stupid for a mission to be accepted into eve it would have been looked at from every possible angle poked at drenched shaken dropped from a high building and then dry tumbled until it starts smoking
so we want to make their jobs harder not to be rude but doesnt ccps qa department have enough to do without this added load these are the folks that brought us or at least qad the bootini problem and shield hardeners that completely drown out all other sound effects among other things after all id say theyre busy enough without having to check to make sure someone isnt submitting a mission thats only available in 10 systems pays out 80 million in bouties gives 45k lps and can be flown in a discophoon on autopilotif you want to design your own missions go play a fps dust anyone  most of them seem to have level and mission designers as do most of the rts games ive played starcrafts rocked because you could do exactly what were arguing against here leave the designing of eve missions to the people whos job it is to design them
i think you are overreacting here and focusing on the wrong stuffbut ok say that the normal mission creators produce 5 missions each month that have to go through qa now say that instead the players make these 5 missions each month which means we still have the exactly same load on the qa people  we freed up all the guys that were making missions if we put them in qa maybe we can churn out 78 missions each month instead with the same load on qa i cant see why you insist that this is a problem
because the players wont submit 5 missions a month if youre lucky theyll submit 500 but i expect the number would be higher given the number of players eve has who decides which 5 make it to qa players thats not really correcting the flaw in the process
there is just no end to the complaining its not like we have to solve all the problems right now this is just a general suggestion for gods sake you want me to give you the source code for the editor and three scrum iterations too while were at itid imagine that there would be a new forum for the mission makers it would work like this forum where players grade the missions if each mission suggestion would be put under as much scrutiny as this thread they would be practically perfect even before they reach qa ccp then just pick the 10 with highest score each month and qa as many of them as they have time for not really rocket scienceso now i have almost drawn up the entire process happy yet
nowhat you dont get is that players could and will design missions with a hidden flaws made to helphinder some kind of playstilefor example a mission with lots or neut towers and timed spawning reinforcements done right it will be a passive drakenightmare heaven and almost impossible for any other set up it is only an example but it would be easy to design missions to play the strong point of a model of ship while being hard for all the others and no forum scrutiny will notice that you need to do the missions and see how it work theoreticraft can easily be fooled
guess your just lazy maybe you should have checked just a little bit harder linkage
i am simply tired to shoot a bs bc or any other highpower asskicking energypacked space vehicle that goes pooofff leaving wreck behindthere was a beautiful in its own days game called independence war 2ship explosions in that game are still unsurpassed in beauty and cpu efficiency just look on youtube

would be especially advantageous with pos mails instead of them going to the inbox of directors

good idea definately
this is a good way to balance it out a bit and makes using drones in any ship on longer trips more viable 
as the title says it should not be possible to disband an alliance in less than a minutewhat i suggest is that there should be a twentyfour hour cooldown period when a director of the executor corp attempts to evict a member corporation or disband the allianceduring this period any director of the executor corp can reverse the decisionsimples
and two seconds after posting this i noticed the other thread
i like this idea perhaps have pilots jetcan near the storeactivated orca right click their can and set up a sell order or if all the stuff in the can falls within a buy order from the orca the person can right click the can and sell to that order and then the orca can tractor it inif all else fails perhaps they could just fly up to the orca and open its market like they would a ship maintanence bay it would definately improve the newbie mining experience and give people something to do with orcas solo not to mention build a community of small time miners and small time buyers of their oreor even an all of the above approach either way this would be an awesome feature
no kidding all the more tragic that there was that conspiracy against him to get him removed from officereinstate larkonis
i think some of you are missing the point this isnt lowsec or 00 its highsec and not just any highsec its jita itd be the equivalent of somali pirates raiding a ship in the middle of new york harbor blowing it up and making off with half the cargo it shouldnt happenunfortunately its becoming increasinly common as evidenced by the general freight containers that can now be seen floating next to 1525 of highsec stargates in eve 50 in some areasi believe this problem could be dented by revoking insurance on concorded ships however this wouldnt be much of a dent as the potential payout still far outweighs the losses pirates could suffer a delay in smartbombs could be considered that would give concord a chance to kill the offending parties with less damage being incurred but this could negatively effect other aspects of gameplay since as difficult as it may be to conceive smartbombs can have a legitimate use alternatively concord could be made to react more quickly and harshly to smartbombs than other weapons andor freighters can be given some low and medium slots with which they could have the option of strenthening their defenses against attackeither way this is a problem that needs to be addressed it severely hinders commerce exploits a loophole in game mechanics makes little sense to canon and litters the spacelanes with unsightly general freight containers
they just need a rclick the person and click spam immediately blocks that person to you so long as you remain in that channelif enough people spam block someone in a period of time they get gagged if this continues they get a temp ban were talking hours to get that ban just by player spam blocking after enough temp gags have stacked up they get looked at by a gm whether or not theyve been tempbannedalso a rclick petition type limited range of types that automatically inputs the name and their last messages and fires it off
damar is perfect for the csm to represent faction warfare he led the caldari way for months because he had a goal and set out to see it happen there were 4 major fw corps plexing continually while damar liased between them all to get us all working together it worked brilliantly he represents many of us in fac war for the sheer reason that he leads from the fronthe openly talks about the difficulties in the plex mechanic the exploits possible the ways in which fac war is flawed while suggesting possible fixes for all of them he is selfless about all of this with good intentions to fix the flaws and now has the guts to put himself out there as a candidate for csm because he is the most qualified for the job he knows it we all know itexperience talks buckets more than some of the above personal opinions and i hope that you all see that and vote for him in the election
well said
im running for csm and available for an interview
another interview went out this issue but there are still lots more of you out therewe get thousands of hits every day  so this is a good chance to get some free publicity
i agree with you there about the merc corp maxsim plus a simple solution is to just surrender if they pull this tactic dont even bring pride into this situation if you are annoyed to the point you bring this topic up people then you dont even have much pride so what if they hide on end its their money theyre spending on it if you think they will strike your miners send protection if they try to run from a fight then warp scramble them
i has not seen minutes so i have no reference for it 
ive never used a neutral rr  and support accepted even though your alliance sux
keep the feedback coming guys 
blasters can barely outdps pulses and they have massively shorter range that is not right
move blasters to the highest tracking position leave pulses as they are maybe lower tracking a little due to their range bonus this will give gallente blaster boats a uniqueness to them which will also make them deadly they still have to climb up to within 5km range but from there on in blasters should be king
agreed pulse are awsome they got tracking range and damageblasters are simply not powerfull enough for their extremely short range either boost the damage output or increase the range
they look cool want to use em bump
please do this awesome thing it would make people happy
good idea
just a little bump
actually you dont have rights you have the priviledge granted by ccp to log in thats all any of us has you may leave your sense of selfentitlement at the dooredit i went back and read the op for this thread its been kikcing around a while nowid support a dual flagging mechanic
i think the thread is about dust being a console only game not its interaction with eve
the tears never stop in this threadconsole fps  pc fps any day of the week and you know itbut please dont stop the emo tears keep them coming but mommy i want it on pc now
just wanted to quote that for the sake of posterity before an op editfor the record i am not in agreement with the quoted banter at all furthermore i have no interest in a mineisbiggerthanyours urination contest thats what the jita  dodixie 
havent read the rest of the thread but supportedwont be buying dust if it isnt on pc
agreed
im going to hazard a guess and say that their reason for keeping it strictly console might have more to do with certain contracts which have been signed for instance if ccp has received any kind of prefunding for this game development then they are most likely required to keep the official statement as console only however i doubt this will be the case forever my best guess is that dust514 will become available for the pc maybe 6 months after console release giving the game enough time to travel around the world in xbox or ps3 form before its developed in a pc version after all you can play halo 1 through 3 on the pc which was something i thought id never see happen given that halo carried the xbox through their dumptruck of suck since 2001
after a ship or cargo scan is complete allow the user to rightclick  view market details on any of the nonfaction items listeda further improvement on this would be to add a view available contracts feature for contractonly items
im nestor and i approve this message
this would be very useful when scanning random people in niarja to be helpful by making fitting suggestionsthis would help me make friends
more proof that there is some kind of iron law at ccp that solo pvp must be nerfed this decision is beyond ed clearly no one at ccp hunts ratters
signedespecially useful if we are able to set incoming and outgoing options for example income from the market goes into this account etc
i support this itd be great to look at a fit and see the current regional market price for it and a easy way to buy the modules quickly or move to another region and check again the ability to set a jump range would also be good kudos to who suggested that too
if the prerequisite skills for hacking and archeology should be lowered there needs to be added new and more time demanding skills to bring the deepness back into those miniprofessionsabove the base skills that allows you a chance to open the respective canisters the ones we have now there could be a skill that improves your chances of actually finding some in the canister above that could be a skill that increases the amount of any particular item you find
this really has to be done i am supporting this
im all for a change to the mechanics but there should still be a case where this can happen if an alliance could have a board of directors each with an allocation of votes per director then you can still have a dictatorship there is no rule saying you must have more than one director if in the case of many directors an infiltrator can get themselves in a position where they control the majority of votes based on a share not the number of directors then well done and much more impressive any alliance that wont give other directors some voting share has to be aware that there is one person who can take it down leave it open to choice if you want to run a dictatorship then you can if you want to ensure there is oversight and checks in place to stop this also fine
agreed
the alliance mechanic should be more symbolic and ease the gui rather than provide weakness to the system it would be better if the alliance cannot be disbanded and members could only be kicked through majority votes unless the alliance is specifically totalitarianalso the fact that internet spaceships is serious ing business means that there will eventually be situations where people start paying rl money in order to get an alliance disbandedremoving this metagaming strategy will allow for alliances to properly be destroyed and will make for many more epic battles the whole bob disband thing is not really respectable as it was not a gruelling battle of the forces but rather a sly deception and lack of trust the cva disband was the result of an outright hack anything and everything they lost was due to something that was not just at all
it was kind of amusing the first time but still stupid if its going to continue though the mechanic needs changing asap supported

increasing bandwidthbay size would be vastly imbalancing to the lowbandwidth lowdrone bay size t1 nondronespecialized frigateswith 2 bandwidth boosters and 1 bay size booster a caracal already a decent ship for missioning and pvp would get a drone bay and bandwidth of 30allowing it to easily field 5 light drones instead of its normal complement of 2
the numbers need to be adjusted to that gein in dps would be about the same as if you would use damge mod rigs  the rigs would have drawbacks ofcorce
needs looking into ideas are nice numbers can changeagreed
supported with criticisms1 full support drones are totally expendable at this time either give them more hitpoints or open the drone bays up to support multiple launches the no ammo use arguement is null because it still takes a drone to do damage just like a crystal or a charge and if i remember correctly they dont have a tech2 hammer that i can throw to knock out your crystals or jam the loading bays of your guns2 oh ya total support in fact just buff tech2 drones leave tech 1 alone it takes forever to get your drone damage up to competition with guns or missiles and you should see a pay off for all that skill training3 sounds cool but ive alwyas felt drone bays should be larger anyway so why not415 need tweaking but are also good ideas the more diversity in drones the better i say
now thats an idea
if you understand the web nerf the main principle was the idea that once you got into web range you where dead there was no way to mitigate damage and no way for faster more agile ships to get under the guns of larger shipsgallente pilots have really been asking for this change to be reversed im about 51 convinced that this is a bad idea and instead blasters should just become better at killing ships at the same size quicklyon void ive got other ideas on how it might be completely changed along with all high damage ammo stay tuned
putting divisions on smas would be a very nice change yes but when it comes to poses having personal space the problem to my understanding comes from the sheer awfulness of pos code from all ive heard its one of the prime candidates for being the part of the code base in most desperate need of razing and rebuilding you cant have personal assets in a pos structure  its all corporate from there stems at most of the problems but its not an easy thing to fix
freakishly enough i agree with jason edwards no support though i must say its a more interesting ecm nerf than most
first time i ever agree with jasondamps are so weak that it takes 3 of them to annoy a single target while ecm can jam multiple shipsboost damps
damps are horrible against bs because of their huge lock range at least against frigates you reduce their lock range to 10kmimo they just need to remove sdas and everything will become better less range and less jam strength especially from those cheap blackbirds
ecm should not be based on chanceit should either work or not work based on a targets sensor strength ships with a high enough sensor strength would be unjammable frigates with their low strengths would always face being jammed by even multispectrals thats my opinion anyway
deimos has more locking muninn has better scan and it can still lock 121 well beyond its optimal theres something called gang bonuses you dont really get why people do not fly eagles i cant do more for you sorry read my previous postsand how is a 560 dps deimos useless theyre useless only to people that do not have a clue weve killed carriers with fleets of 20 lr hacs get outso when was the last time you saw any of these fitted with rails you must be joking
i would agree with that railgun dps is subpar
i disagree with the ops deimos change do not balance the deimos based on sniper hacs ffs deimos can be shield tanked btw tho it could use a boost for thatbut a definite no to changing the deimos falloff bonus useful with blasters to an optimal bonus now current falloff additional optimal i could live with
perhaps this is a bit radical but lets look at this a bit closerwhy is the deimos so problematic a lot of folks seem to be saying it cant be shield tanked which translates to armor tanking isnt viablethe reason of course is that armor tanking cannot be passive as armor unlike shields cannot fix itself over time and anything active gets neuted there is also the additional problem that within short range you lose your mwd to the dual point scramsso you have a ship which needs speed to close but loses it and needs cap to tank and loses that yep thats a problem all rightprobably best to fix cap warfare to not be so mindless  that would make active tanking a bit more viable  and make the ships base speed a bit higher so that if it websscrams you back it can actually close with something of the same class in a reasonable timefix the disease folks not the symptoms the deimos is supposed to be a close ranged blaster boat which armor tanks balance that and youve fixed the problem
i think they are talking more along the lines of long range hacs and not so much close range
you mean more dedicated than having bonus for logistic modules and triageas carriers also have bonuses for fighter drones and warfare links i would not call them dedicated remote repair ships being capital ships they are not exactly easily accessible to new players neither would one do particularily well trying to play dedicated remote repair in a roaming frigate gang especially in hisecbut lets end this one once and for all carriers do have bonuses to remote repair they can be set up to do it quite well in fact congratulations you winyour prize 1 pcs chocolate chip cookie should be arriving by mail within the next 714 business days enjoylogistics have bonus to tracking links or cap transfers they can do other stuff carriers are suppose to be logistics just bigger and more flexible
true quite a lot like a logistics frigate would be really

i like this idea quite a bit
instead of a mission editor run eg a yearly mission writing contest  no software needed1 submissions could be writeups of no more than eg 1000 words whatever is deemed a manageable workload2 select a bunch of them as finalists dropping cookie cutter gothereandkillstuff missions and ones that are unimplementable etc and call for a public vote on the rest3 implement the winners3b consider the ones that were neat but unimplementable in the current framework as suggestions for future feature development
thisim glad someone gets it
the specific powergamery thing is yet another reason why we need variable less predictable missionsthat would make the kind of specific mission abuse design you describe impossibleinstead of you have 3 bs of x type which spawn at y time you simply assign mission level 4 angel cartel threat level 2 room with these 2 characters it gets much harder to powergamemind you  the whole pve macromission napfest thing desperately needs fixing which is why this is on the csm agendathe most important thing that players can bring forward is a skeleton of a mission and appropriate background anyway
good ideathe missions allready in game are made for power gamers so thats a quite bad argument against this ideaofftopic rant all the missions need a change whole mission mechanicsstrategies need overhaul eve missioning is most boring grind ive ever seen in any mmo salvaging and looting the mission is even more tarded nothing good to say about it

its already coming out called cosmos check the dev blogs and other information about coming attractions in the game we should see the first iteration of it with dominion due out in december
i havnt read all the replies so just commenting on the issue raised by the opin my oppinion wars decs are fine as they are you should not have any spoils of war since you dont really gain anything basically you can imagine empire like a school playground the teachersattendants will not do anything to stop you from fighting another boy since you have an agreement but it is still their playground you get to play in it but they are still supervising youif you want true spoils of war you will have to go to nullsec where you actually conquer a playground and dont have to ask permission to hit another buyrough basic of my view on empire

no thread yet website maybe up soon but i have a list of items that may be interesting
a platform to discuss would be nice yes i prefer to discuss issues
running for csmready for an interview
could they not use their admin tools to put their reply underabove the original post instead of wading through pages and pages on stuff or would it mean they wont get the bluered line on the sidethere must be an easier way of reading the official responses than having to wade through countless pages and scrolling through each page
on the left sidebar under eve forums theres a link called dev finder its not entirely complete and the archiving stinks but it gives you most of the functionality you want
like it says in 10 days time it will have been over 2 months since this meeting took placei for one think that there is no sane reson why we are still waiting for the council that represents us to publis these minuteshere is the thread 
tinfoilhatit is because ccp tries to hide the corruption and wowification plans that happened and were discussed during the meetingtinfoilhat

sorry to have kept you waiting but ive now compiled the results of the survey and will give it to you in full well start off with the player activities priority matrix it looks complicated and properly analyzing it really is so posting the complete results rather than just my interpretation of them is very important
important i forgot to mention that the high priority  low priority sides on the priority matrices are tallied by the program in reverse meaning that a low total score means a high place in the priority scale you can verify this by tallying the votes yourself

bumping for the love of my little assault ships
i agree wholly with this guymake webs useful again currently even a rapierhuginn has to throw multiple webs on a target just to begin slowing them downif i decloak my rapier with max skills at 10km from an inty and it immediately mwds away by the time i lock and throw my webs on it the ship is already at 40km and if i overheat it can still coast beyond maximum range of even faction webs before they begin to slow appreciablyblasters now their tracking could definitely use a boost to make fighting at point blank with one suicide even for a frig v bs but leave their range alone

i would prefer more damage than more rangebut yeah atm blasters need a boost really bad
you noob  its the only way to use blasters efficiently atm try orbiting something within blasters optimal then speak again  and no your frigate orbiting bs doesnt countblasters needs a buff badly  their dpson paper output is not even close to compensate for their pathetic range and inability to properly track targets in their optimal while with large blasters issue isnt that great  small and medium are broken badlyi suggest  their range should stay the same but increase their dps or increase tracking or bring back 90 web with slightly tracking increse or  nerf lazors
id say that blasters need to be changed entirely and give something new to the gun field currently lasers have their niche projectiles are getting reworked to allow for some nice damage switching but blasters work just like lasers just worsechanges to blastersrewrite description to say they are a high damage weapon that has difficulty hitting at anything but close rangeincrease damage by 50increase tracking by 300reduce optimal to 1tweak falloff to slightly lesschange optimal modifiers on ammo to falloffnow blasters do incredible damage at close range but have difficutly hitting anything and damage decreases with every km of range it turns blaster ships into close range death dealers that suck for anything past 5km or so im ok with that
supported small blasters are somewhat ok mostly due to some great hulls to slap them on but med and large blasters do need loving or their bonused ships or the metagame i never went with the amarr bandwagon yet but incidentally i started to go for med projectile spec just as the boost was announced and can quite fast crosstrain lasers after that
yes fix explosion velocity i think the first digit must have been forgotten on it further either increase rof and clip size to boost the dps a little but not the alpha or increase velocity and damage to give more range and alphaeither is fine but the former option is more spammy and i like spammy
help me please

it should be like thiskill someone in a way that does not incur gcc 00 wartarget they aggressed you first  loot is yourskill them in a way that does incur gcc  wreck it theirs and if someone ninjas the loot they are flagged to the victimthat seems fair to me and ostensibly as a pirate it would be to my disadvantage

never once did i attempt to compare hardware of a pc vs a console you are missing the entire reason behind why dust will be on console only maybe you should rewatch if you watched at all any of the videos regarding this game and why ccp said it will be on console instead of pcalso are you a share holderstay in school you should actually go to school there are lots of things that you would benefit from like reading and comprehension oh and on your level you would get to play with building blocks and stuff also you might get to make friends dont be scared once you make your first friend you will learn that having friends is awesome and you will try to make more
you winperhaps i will check my spam for some growth enhancers
agreed
i do not support this issue there are games that have failed due to combining pc and consoles togethor for example shadowrun was a great game but the pc users usually dominated the xbox 360 userslittle background i own both a xbox 360 ps3 pc and laptopfor eve i enjoy a vast many games on my consoles from rock band to halo i know from experience that combining pc and consoles against each other in a battle is a bad idea separating them might also be a bad ideato be honest i already plan on buying a copy of dust 514 for my console
supported had a similar idea while ago but couldnt be arsed to hash it out completely would improve new user experience significantly imo the first time you go 15 jumps to assemble components of your new ship is magical  next times not so muchitd also be nice if such a shopping assistant why limit it to fittings could also add waypoints to your autopilot a buy all button which works according to a specified range which as you change it it gives you an estimate of cost and say x items not available under current limit possibly avoid lowsec ticker when you buy all it goes and adds all the relevant wps if you so choose i wouldnt mind seeing a simple fetch mode for autopilot like get x from station y in z autopilots there warps to station at 15km docks tries to move items into cargo undocks and continues to next waypoints doubt it would happen though omg trader buff  this isnt afk online etc etc nor do i personally have much use for itreally all that is needed for the op is some sort of list input which then has a window with a market widget  highlights the best choice according to the range selection you either buy from it quantity inserted automatically and it moves to the next one skip it or cancel be nice to see an estimate of isk cost under the current selected market filters

itt people who dont understand how it works making dumb analogies
git er done
supported
who said analogy i just happened to think of that scene when i realized that its harder to disband a corp than an alliance to disband an alliance you just click the button to disband a corp you need to kick all the members fisrt and then right click close corp takes a lot more effort than whoops ah well didnt want that alliance anyways
this post is so v funny but i doubt you would understand why
its high time to do so

some or all of this plz
im using my 5 minute token to approve this product andor service
all the suggestions are worth consideration from ccp that dont mean that they should be taken exactly as suggested but that they should be considereddrones are the most neglected weapon system the last true addition was the t2 sentries the faction and augmented drones are a curio not something really used and the only weapon system without namedt2faction variants of the support modules
gallente need bust but devs hate us
even more chatter would be nice if you played freelancer this is what i mean
please bring up to ccp that we would like to sort our corporate deliveries the same way we can sort our personal assets by system constelation region and all it makes pickups so much easier when youve got 500 different stations with deliveries across the cluster
supported loldont forget to support your own thread mate
ok some points have been raised which id like to addressi belong to those who believe ecm is not fine as it is both its current mechanic as well as the fact you mention that only specialized ships are viable and them being paper thin please realize that while my proposal is a nerf of the mechanic im not suggesting that ecm strength is reduced in fact it should be boosted after the proposed changecurrent ecm boats are so fragile because the ecm mechanic is so powerful and ccp had to balance them in some waytoo bad for ccp if they had just looked at ecm but did an incomplete job they only rebalanced bonuses they have not addressed the problems with the mechanic i agree they need a minor buff but only in effectiveness the mechanic is fineyou are proposing a different solution feel free to open your own proposal thread
support
and thus this thread needs to be silenced do not think that everyone that wants to fly a hac is a mindless 00 drone and definitely do not balance ships around current crappy blob tactics fix 00 instead tho hopefully dominion will help in that regard
given ccp wants 00 warfare less capital blobbing  i see more hac gangs
how about true small gang warfare where sniping has little place please im all for a buff for deimos but i want to see it benefit blaster users 4th mid more grid maybe more dps and or falloff etc
support no jungle camo on spaceships please
they do not need to be black but there current look does not appeal to me
thread should really be calledplease dont make the navy mega the ugliest ship in the game with woodland camouflageimo the navy mega in particular is sexual in its current formim begging you ccp please dont change itseriously woodland camo what place does woodland camo have in space anywayif your gonna go there why not have us army plastered on it or maybe rambo would look nice all the way down both sides maybe even hello kitty decals for the girls
supportedim against the camo look but if they wont keep the black color scheme because of the vindicator or serpentis bs give us another color that doesnt suck or make the serpentis faction version a ship that can be got
give me back the black nmega
from roleplay point of view such terroristic act can explain doomsday change in dominion supported
you can already warp directly to your fleetmates as if you had scanned them down to 100 through the fleet interface  because of this theres no reason that you shouldnt be able to filter them out of scan resultsalternatively have them show up as 100 hits on any scan that has them in range just as a different signature iconsay make the dot purple instead of green
agree with op this would be a good addition

im in mm and the way ive seen this guy threaten and rant and profane and insult people for dumb  in alliance chat id never vote for him ever steer clear some of his endorsers here are genuinely good people but their recommendations are flawed in that theyd back up someone like this just because they know him personally and hes in our corp heh right politics ftl get wise people its better to have an honest enemy than a friend like this in officeedit edited out a couple of typos

thats totally true but i am only an fc that shoots stuff and makes pew pew elvenlord is more experienced looks almost as sexy and knows what he is talking about thats why he is our candidate
elvens a fantastic choice for csm unlike many that came before him hes got such a dedication to the finer details of the game tirelessly testing out new changes on sisi while running logistics on tranq he can be short at times but only because hes brutally efficienta big thumbs up and votes incoming for elven

my name is ashina sito and i am running for csm why should you vote for me first a little about who i am my main involvement in game covers an area that has been left out by previous and current csm entry level pvp within eve for the past year and a half i have used my in game time to expose new and old players to pew pew pew pvp within eve both with fleetgang support and experience as well as basic pvp class instruction you can check my blog for more detailed information about the planks i have for my csm candidacy platform a brief rundown follows more incubator systemsconstellationsregions places in 00 for new playerscorpsalliances can start out  the ability to activate plex from web site  more development of anomalys in 00  basic ui fixes a strong desire to beat to a pulp the designer of the font used by the eve ui also a strong voice to have that font changed so you can actually read what it says a link to my evetribune interviewweb siteif anyone has any questions about my candidacy just make a post here and i will answerwill add more later off to teach a pvp class atm edit teaching a class on halloween is not a good idea if you want people to attend
a few people have asked be about the pvp training i do here is a video taken during one of those events we had a nightmare scanned down and attacked it with t1 bccruiserdesys and frigs note i can only record after my ship has gone down do to voice issues so the fc is out of the picture by the time the video startsnightmare in venalthis is a link to a training video i am still looking for some editing software that will work for me i plan to make a bunch of short hopefully smaller sized pvp training videos in the futurepvp gate scouting videofinally i am posting a poor resolution video of a battle hulk in a can flipping fight vs a rifter you can fight back and make the pirates crywhen hulks attack
although due to work obligations i was not able to participate in the pvp training she outlined i can vouch for ashina she has been a strong presence to help out the new cas members with the ccd cas combat day program she runs she knows a lot about eve and would be a great asset to the csm team
i am going to make this shortmy life in eve started in spring 2003 and i have stayed with the game for the past 6 years over that time i have explored everything the games have to offerif you want to have someone in the csm that has a broad knowledge about and deep passion for the game i am your candidatemy only focus is keeping balance in the game balance to be understood in the broadest sense balance professions balance of combat balance of economy balance of skills etc having a good understanding of the games aspects is essential for that and that is what i can bring to the csmthank you for your time
i really put my foot in it didnt ias candidate for the 4th council of stellar management it is my goal to ascertain the needs of miners researchers traders and builders and make these needs known to ccp and the devs too many times the producers are overlooked or even nerfed in favour of the pvpers in the game i am here to make certain that we are given a strong fair reliable voice in the councilwe work hard perhaps too hard for our isk yet we are constantly beset by pirates gankers griefers not to mention the inevitable npc pirates one thing i have heard from fellow production characters is the need for better yields whether mining or researching a blueprint other topic of note access to some highend asteroids in lowsec ability to mine a moon dry similar to asteroids as a member of the csm i intend to press forward these issues as well as the many others of interest to those of us who provide the materiel and products that pvpers blow up
would i be correct in assuming that you are a girl in real life
hallan i would be more than happy to answer any questions you may have for your readers
there you go 
this is in interesting and very cool concept i will try and get on the site and input my information sometime on saturdaythanks for the effortashina sitoafter filling out the questionnaire i waned to add some responsessome questions are interconnected removing meta o1 loot from the mission loot table would make l4 missions less profitable this would remove any need for l4 missions to be moved to low sec at the same time it would decrease the available minerals in eve which would result in more profitability for people who mime with mining lasers instead of guns which element is important depends on which one you adjust firsti did not like the mandatory 3 important question requirement mainly because only one of the questions warranted that designation from my perspective even then it had less to do with what i am intrested in promoting and more to do with being good for the game as a whole then again i do understand it is needed to have a functional weighting systemyou will have candidates like myself that will not be well represented with this effort a suggestion for the future would be to have some of the burning topics on the forums on the questionnaire and then have each csm candidates submit a question some of them will overlap but you should be able to get a broader sample of the issues all of the csm candidates wish to promotelastly it would not be bad to have a comments option ether attach it to your important question or give the csm the option to add it to 3 questions a brief twitter type comment would be bestanyway thanks you for the effort it looks like it will be a valuable tool for a number of the voters out there who have not as yet made up their minds
thank you dierdra vaal for setting this resource up greymousespeaker for all things industrialist has completed the profile survey i will be interested to see peoples views especially with dominion unfolding in just over a month greymouse
good initiativei have filled out the candidate questionareand i guess this is my first post as an official csm candidate let the fun begin
profile completed and doing my bit to spread the love d v
profile completed
thank you all if you feel you are not properly represented in these questions please let me know i cannot change questions for this term they are locked now but i will keep it in mind for next term
i thought it was a decent balance between different game aspects just a tad few next time expand it a bit in each direction to get a more detailed coverage and thus more detailed matches
this question should be devided by 2 r64 moons are not just a point income sources but also a passive income  and therefore should be nerfed static complexes were main conflict drivers indeed  i learned my first pvp lessons there you have to fight every time you want to take resp that was good and i have lots of friends i first met there
i had originally planned to have 50 questions but after talking it over with my host serenity steele i decided on 30 so it wouldnt scare away users who felt 50 questions was too much work ill reevaluate it after the csm4 election tho  maybe i underestimate the users
see it this way if someone is interested enough to click your link and read the site then he should also have the courage to fill out a few more questionsalternatively you could make a short and a long version 10 and 50 questions p
great initiative but my interests in seeking representations with the csm is rather conflicting with this comparing  the stemwijzer you put forth argues over several topics in daytoday governance of the game itself i am interested in making the game a lot bigger and diverse i find myself completely disinterested in quite a few these issues you put forth that isnt to say they arent valid rather i am not interested in putting forth an opinion on them ill be really clear about this  i am just not interested in representing anyone who expects me to argue on these points either for or against however if players would like me to cautiously argue with ccp games for a drastic expansion of the game itself either through adding ambulation either through adding an extra layer of real estate transactions or more permanent structures in space squatting of structures in space inworld political manipulation founding more diverse organisational structures playergenerated content player generated missions having an organisational network of npcs work for you extensive ship crews maybe even really lateral concepts such as a new fifth faction  then vote for me if you absolutely dont want any of these please do not consider voting for me because i wont represent your interests my representation concerns eve five ten years from now i simply do not see where the questionnaire allows for me representing these maybe i could have inserted these ideas on the forums  but i dont like reading acres of forum posts they bore me to death so far  that might change or it might not
filled out my survey good batch of questions you wound up with
as youll have seen by now ive done my best to figure out if what the majority wants is the same as what the csm seems to feel they want and from the survey ive done there is plenty of indication that the two arent exactly on the same wavelengthtrue my survey was limited the tools i had at my disposal where limited the people i could reach where only a small number but then shouldnt any csm candidate be provided the right tools to see clearly what the ingame majority wants isnt it absolutely essential that every csm has the tools needed to reach the entire playerbase and not just the people on the forum and those in their own alliancesive seen some people call the pvegamers the silent majority this is quite spotonbut as my survey showed me when i go ingame and get people to fill it in there the results do start to sway towards pve whereas when i promoted the survey on the forum it goes towards pvp no wonder that the last csms where so pvp orientedto truely represent the whole playerbase there must be easy to use ingame tools accessible from the graphical user interface that lead directly to survey tools the voting system the assembly hall etc etc this will greatly alter the types of suggestions made and how they are voted upon it will alter who gets voted into the csm and thus what changes the csm will bring about it is the core of most of the issues that people currently have with the whole systemi feel that pvp knowlage and voting power is allready greatly represented on the csm i need not add to it its in good hands but as a democratic system the csm doesnt have the tools it needs to complete its most basic functions this is the groundwork needed to truely represent everyone and i want to lay that groundwork for yousee you on the campaign trailaynen
i had a look recently on what the topics are for the eve regulars and i found myself not really all that interested in the current talking points of csm meetings sure in a year ill probably care about some of these issues but for now i could care less rather having registered myself as candidate invite another kind of votein short expanding the game far beyond the current content adding ship crews adding power play mechanics adding a range of new gameplay tools adding ambulation and fpsambulation based skills for actively exploring planets derelicts wrecks stations vessels and planets adding habitats skyhooks solar arrays to the game allowing vastly more player control over structures real estate investmentsin short doing whatever it takes to have ccp add a whole range of new aspects to the game while sacrificing none of the current content or quality
soare you essentially saying that you do care about these issues now or that you couldnt care less at the momenti believe that this is a crucial point of understanding
in case i am elected very slim chance id say i see solid ground for a coalition
id say slim to none tbh
feel free to email me any questions
well ive finally seen them cant say anything specifically except if you are an industrialist you will just break down into uncontrollable weepingissler
thank you very much for this feedback really all that was needed from the csm was the occasional status report such as thisskunk
well as written in my description i positioned myself as candidate from russian speaking players but its not the main theme for my election campaign first of all  little about myselfi play eve from spring 2004 i expirienced most of all areas of game i do not like pvp for myself actualy i dont like pvp without reason just for fun so i dont look at eve as some players which want very few things in one area  give me more dps  they say i say  no eve is very very very complex game and you know it eve needs careful steps to be enchanced without disbalancing it and i have this expirience from my real life more than 10 years i making lifeaction roleplay games its wonderful how similar laws governing people in game envirointment and more interesting thing  its almost have no dependanse on scale when you pick 200 people or 2000  they mostly do same things in same proportionsso combining my real and eve expiriense i think that i will do good job for you allthank youmy bio and other stuff located on my site and avaliable on russian atm if you interested  ask i will tranlate it for youdont hesitate to ask questions heresorry for errors that can be present in texts english is not my native
thread and process updatedtamber
it is extremely easy to have a year of csm members elected largely by chance that has no effect whatsoever the people argue back and forth ccp listens nods politely and does what it wants and that is the way it ought to be however if you have one iota of common sense you have an afternoons talk with some developers and artists and coders at ccp without being a hassle and get a feel for what compells these people and what is a consideration in the game and then you present your points in that light and you woo them you seduce them and you bring them into your way of thinkingi cant say for certain i would be able to pull that off but ill give it a decent try
i might vote for lark
