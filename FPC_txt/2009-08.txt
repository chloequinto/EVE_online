it has to be done
fully support bringing back the old capital jump effectsof course if ccp would like to make them prettier so they are more inline with the new graphics engine thats peachy too when caps hit the field they should scream im a capital im going to put you in a world of pain yarrrr not oh hey sissy and auntie thanny are having a tea party in the back yard do u care to join
agree
let me ask you this question then supportersif a battleship putting multiple webs  a point on an af shouldnt be able to kill the thing what should ffs its a frigate it takes 2 weeks to train for a full t2 fit and about 50m isk to fit with rigs you think they should be capable of taking out antiaf bs
as for rockets again youre looking at it on paper gl fighting against a venge with those small acs of yours last time i checked they do a bit less dps at 20km
why do you have to be an idiot and a r3tard
common thing ive herd from our wts that all we do is fight miners and hualers not true aly with a 00 corp and get you miners out of harms way or leave them in a npc corp and do contracts its war ffs anyones a traget including your industralswhy would i find a active ship an agressive act or a corp mate rring for that matter the subject is nuetral remote repping not in corp reppingproblem with that is we bring a fleet of say 5 bs couple of tackle maybe a hac or two to fight a maybe slighly better quiped fleet and as soon as it turns in our favour out come the neutral rr they deaggro dockup or fight on and we are left trying to break a buffer tank being repped buy a t2 logistic thats 50km away from our fleet of shipsps in ggbs case that probably more nuetral rr than they have members wi i think even you guys would have trouble in counter the sheer amount of nuet rr they have now that kai86 is in afgan there corp has wound down a littleit effects minmatar the most we cant just change ammo to gain alot more range like amarr yes there is barrage but on a ac that maybe an extra 510km at mosti am all for in corp repping dont get me wrong if they bait us and out come corp mates start repping in a huge buffer with no gun on there ship then well we should have never let our selves be bated like that and its our own fault if we loose a ship but nuetral repping is just a crap way to win weres the buzz when fighting a wt with balls to fight back where the buzz when you win by 50 struture how can you smack talk in local about how crap you wt was when you have to use sutch crapy tatics like nuet rrgrow your corp a pair and actauly fight even and stop being scared to loose a ship i might smack you in local but atleast poeple would have more respect for you
i challenge you to reference one engagement even a single engagement in which any member of f9x has fought against the privateers and were not outnumbered by the privateers the one exception i can think of is when we helped ggb station blob you but i dont think that really counts as it wasnt our fleet and yes i am including rr both neutral and in corpalliance on both sides of the engagement
gotta be done
woo
let them get concorded or what op suggested
bullocks1 then why does the repper turn red  dude take vitamins you are completely unable to think logically let me repeat more slowly w h y d o e s t h e r e p p e r t u r n red  understand now 2 please tell me what the counter to constantly docking and undocking getting a few reps off each time how can that be countered  go ahead and say stop fighting on stations then we know you just want to nerf station fighting because station fighting should not be part of the game at all right  again not a discussion about rr its about the penalty timer3 no it certainly doesnt you are basically defending as a small gang tactic the ability to dock with impunity4 again the argument is not about rr you keep squirming offtopic when its convenient the issue is penalty timer not the use of rredit1 forgot to check supportedit2 addendum to 3 to use your own argument against you blobbing is a perfectly acceptable mechanic everyone can use blobbing see how that works edit3 addendum to 1 if rr is not aggressive as you claim and is purley defensive then the same is true for falcon after all a falcon doesnt actually hurt the ship its jamming the hurting is done by dps from other ships the falcon is merely a defensive boost yeah purely defensive again using your own argument against you to show how utterly stupid it is
supported rockets are supposed to be highdamage shortrange unguided explosive projectiles and theyve been nerfed to near uselessness
rockets need loving too
tell me more of this raven of yours that can shoot in 2009 torps out of cruise launchersits page 3 lots of positive feedback and you dont even know what you are fussed aboutalso the comparison of those 2 bss is  offyou can see a torp raven with 4 damage mods you will never see a blasterthron with neutrons with 4 damage mods
the comparison is completely viable since the cruise launcher issue seems more like a typo to me a torpraven will without any problems deal those amounts of damageadditionally 4 damagemods dont change anything related to game mechanics  the proportion of the damage between those two ships will always be there since a magstab does the same thing a bcu does  same percentages and alland no matter if you cannot see a blasterthron with 4 magstabs in a year it still is a possible fitting the damage of torps is in par with the damage of turretguns with heavy penalties to speed and sigso please ccp hell fix this issue i want to be able to fly a hawk without getting laughed at in local when someone hostile enters the system give them blasterish dps or make them almost unpenaltised but please fix themso supported

supported a working sound engine is generally a vital part of any game fix it 
i give my full support to these efforts the game is too mature and too polished to have these sorts of issues this late in the life cycle i hope that it will be looked at as soon as practicable
please give earcandy love like you give every other candy love
i pipe my pc sound via my hifi and the eve sound engine does bad bad things popping broken stereo random silenceand when using headphones the popping is genuinely painful something really wrong is going on here
glad to see someone taking this up i have not being able to trust the sound for anything guns dont make noise all the time when you are starting right at your ship oh and the popping may it burndefiantly supported
i stopped exploration because the popping sound in map view is so bad fix this soon please
i support this thread and the ability of the csm delegate to represent the players who are experiencing these issues i myself have experienced most of these issues and ccp replied to me telling me to turn my hardware acceleration down until it works it didnt do anything it is not my pc its the damned sound engine
the sound system is so very broken and does need attention its crazy that shield hardeners generate so much sound that everything else is drowned out
the sound system is slowly being reworked but i still get earshattering pops when for some reason a sound is supposed to come off a direction and i pass a distance thresold off itmoreover many effect sounds of the past would bring a better feeling than apo ones visual effects as well beginning with the legacy client roids being nicely flashed by the lasersother buff effects are disturbingly loud or just annoying and they are supposed to stay up for hours
i find it difficult to underestand how ccp can tolerate broken sound in their game one would thing that such broad range of defect would get a high enough priority from the dev team to fixi support this cause
me endorses this request
although a lot of pilots dont use audio for some reason its an important part of the game for me and it would be nice to be able to properly hear eve in al its glory rapid fire dessies electron blasters pulse lasers on an omen seems buggy as welladditionally the sound effect of the shield hardener and sensor booster just blur out everything elsethe sound itself matches what one would expect shield hardenings having a humming sounds makes sense to me but it shouldnt drown out every other sound to the point where you gotta zoom out or keep them offline
supported the map causing the sound to mute and pop only occurs at gates or moons when another player is shown in the overview this has allowed me to get round the problem for now when scanning it also occurs if the ship gets to 50 hull damage
sad that the paying customer has to go to such lengths these days to try and convince the developers to take notice of such a glaring defect
signedthought it was my hardware conflicting with eve audio on 1 side or dissapearing audio at all untill you look around then it pops back salso no gun sounds because of a booster or hardener come on
signed
ive played only one day so far and i avoided using the map because i get a loud pop when opening the map in my headphones which is really disturbing please fix the sound engine
i believe that eveonline should have sound that works without screwing up the game if ccp have been paying people to resolve improve sound issues for the last 2 years i would be shocked1 currently sound are not used by anyone that i know of in game due to to the cpu lag issues it causes does any other game exist where sound screws up playability this bad2 sound effects are now so random and washed out suffering turning it on is not worth it this also it makes voice coms difficult and there is no support for this sound effects should add to the game not distract from the content3 a reactive mute support for incoming voice coms would be very helpfull an instant mute buttonfast access customisable volume control support may also be helpfuleasier to introduce for the large number of people who use voice coms 4 the only improvements made in the last year or so appears to be the same old music whales dyingbarfingmaking love to synth totally different music for each race would be interesting 5 dynamic music would be good based on ingame events with scriptable customisation possible6 support for player based music would be good ie eve radio use of your own music
the only way this would work if something that if it was a new class ship bigger or stronger than titans or more effective and they only way to operate such beast if muliple players had to be inside it as a crew and operate and manage it for combatdefensesand propulsion
meaning you would have to find players near your sp or whatever to even get it useable so u would have to have titans 5 or something
agreedalso it would be extremely difficult to implment game engine wise and i could see 6 months of bug solving constant server down times etc
love the idea but i agree with above its icing on the cake and complicated to bootthough if i was gonna do it i would do it as such5 crews availible for purchase levels 15level determines how quickly they gain spdrones from each race have different bonussgallente offer dronehybrid bonussminmattar offer sig radius reductionagility bonusscaldari offer missleshield bonussamarr offer energy weapons armor bonussbonuss climb from 1 percent to 5 percent over time you could purchasehire them as an npc market item but only at the base level above that would be player seeded crews could be sold but the purchaser would only beable to use what their skills reflected like implantsthis way they arent complicated but also reward pilots for flying ships and keeping them alivealso give a rp a lil more to play with
its a pretty neat idea ill give you that but i can think of 5 bugsimbalances off the top of my head that could be fixed by the time this idea even got off the ground when it comes down to it i would rather see the bugs and imbalances get fixed before something like this gets implemented what you are suggesting opens up a whole new aspect of gameplay that is extremely complex and would add to eves already steep learning curve which can be a good or bad thing maybe one day after some of the bigger issues are dealt with this could be implemented but i wouldnt hold my breath all in all its an interesting idea that i would support if it where not for some other issues that really need attention first before an idea such as this gets even looked at
sorry dude but the lag from this one point would be horrificas for the rest of the proposal i like i like
i think it shouldnt take a rig slot instead being its own thingotherwise i love it
supportwould be easy to implement  just allow only one name change per 12months or something and charge a feeedit not that i want to change my name but i dont see why you shouldnt be able to it could even be once per character lifetime as someone p
i think this is a wonderful idea and would support it 100 has there been any dv update on this possible implementation of this feature
youre supposed to have other friends protecting and helping you to fuel them if you fail protecting the pos while unanchoring or fail fueling it then it should be free game for anyone to takeas it is now its mostly up to how much isk you got to buy towers modules and fuel not really really logistics not military power or well you either have 500 man blobs or not this is an issue too imhoat least let ppl loot abandoned poss
supporting this 2 times a year 
supported but make in any faction bs please i dont and never have flown amarr
supporting this for tq only 
hell yea needs more servers etc as i failed to be able to logon last time after getting dissconnected a few times after waiting ages to get on 
your title says that gallente ew ships need a boost your post says that gallente ew mods need a boost how about you decide what you want and then remake the post ps i do agree on the rsd thing though
the way i see it it could go either way either boost the modules so that the existing bonuses actually make them worthwhile to useor boost the bonuses so the bonuses make rsd useful to useprobably the best idea would be to boost the bonuses a tad so that it would not become an overpowered module againedit i actually bought and fit a keres yesterday the fit will barely give me room to tackle and stay out of targeting range though
the ships are fine right now gallente recons are very strong even despite their ew issuesthey used to be not so good back before the scrambler change but now gallente recons can put a warp scrambler at the same ranges a nonbonused disruptos is
i support
i stopped after thiswhy because you fail to understand that a mmo is dynamic what was was pimp 3 yrs ago  t2 is now given what was unthinkably expensive 5 yrs ago  arbalest siege launchers is now affordable to everyone eventually what is an option to use to gain an advantage will eventually become a requirement to give a parallel in your ingame life you kicked the goons out of syndicate when they were in frigates and they came back 2yrs later in hacsreconscaps
that a bc gang can slugfest better than a t2 cruiser gang if the bc gang can catch the t2 gang get in range and tackle them is a red herring the difference is t2 cruisers have more range and can gtfo when a blob of two or three times your gang size comes chasing you while bcs cant the dividing line is between cruiser hulls and bcsim rich enough to be able to fly whatever i want but remember not being so this does boil down to class warfare because a the rise in t2 pricing has made it so that poor players for the most part there are of course tactical exceptions for example fitting amls to a caracal and going t2 frig hunting but these make up a minority of playtime experience for a minority of players cannot both remain highly effective without blobbing and still be able to gtfo when the inevitable blob forms up and b because the grind for ship replacement has gotten way too longthe rise in t2 prices has created a legitimate class gap problem and for many of the people who think cheaper although not crazy 100204 cheap rigs for smaller ships is a good thing this change is a way to address the yawning gap in effectiveness between the rich and poor in smaller gangs and increasing price disincentives to nonblob pvp
ive already addressed several times exactly how its not shrinking the gap of rich v poor if i dont spend 60 mil on 3 rigs for my cruiser ill just have 60 mil to spend on faction gear how is it any different being rigs or gear that the money goes into both drastically improve my ship a poor person will still not elect to spend as much as i will and will ultimately suffer for itits not fixing the class war its just reallocating it elsewhere and because of that it makes no sense
sorry just have to clarify something herethese expensive rigs can clear the dirt between the absurdly rich pilots and not so rich pilotsjust cause youre rich enough to afford rigs on your frigates doesnt make you good
ehh when you drop that faction stuff itll get immediately sold by the poorer players funding their t2 and rigs i dont think thats as big of an issue id happily fight your faction fitted ship with my t2 fitted ship faction stuff costs more than rigs did imo
you dont quite get it cheaper rigs on t1 ships wont close the gap between the difference of t1 rigged and unrigged because except for t2 frigs poor and rich will make the same rigging costbenefit decisions more or less this difference doesnt matter rather making it worth rigging smaller t1 ships closes the gap between nonbs t1 hulls now not worth rigging now would be after change and t2 hulls worth rigging now and laterif someone wants to buy faction to reopen the gap perfectly fine for them doing so is really isk inefficient and the mods can drop so it doesnt pose any sort of systemic problem like the t2 ship price jump doesfinally the point is not to erase the richpoor gap but rather to return it in both magnitude and nature to the balanced point it was at before moongold prices went through the roof
exactly thiscant support the op but its obvious the new rig prices will be bad
daily bump
no support on this one who really wants more carebear stuff fix the bugs plz
yes please
still no arguments against
nope
not supported cloaks are cloaks and that shouldnt change
this
put null sec into delayed local mode like wspace problem solved im a chronic afk cloaker i dont do it to grief people i have to do it because everyone docks the instant i enter system i have to sit there afk for hours for them to think im just a scout and come back out before i can attack get rid of local and both my and their waiting goes away i can hurry up and make my attack and regardless of the attacks success everyone can move on fasterultimately this is really an argument over whether or not a single or small gang of attackers should be able to do damage i say yes the game should allow terrorism crime and sabotage not every fight need to be a fully consensual 400 vs 400 lag fest in fact those are stupid i fully support putting a hard limit of 10 people per system except for trade hubs
zzz this is all a bunch of crap 1 if your able to scan a cloaked ship then ccp will have to put a station in every system so everyone will have a place to hide if they so choose2 why cant you just be happy the way things are if you cant find the bomber you suck if you think one bomber on your turf is the end of the world you need to find a new gameeveryone knows what this is about keeping people out of low and null sec if they have no way to hide then theyre doomed more people will end up hiding in empire thus letting the select few absorb all the riches of null in the end it boils down to isk not every person that rats is a macro ive made a lot of isk killing rats but as soon as anyone comes to they system im in i hide i dont have the assets to lose a battleship on a whim and my corp doesnt have the inferstructure to replace it for meleave the cloak alone and stick to greifing hulks
honesty wtf would be the purpose on having a cloak if people can find u its alredi balanced enough ur speed scan res and locking range gets gimped covert ops cloaks are 10mil a pop and can only be fit to certain shipsjust coz theres a guy cloaked up u cant kill doesent mean the cloaks are unbalanced100 unsupported and would classify this as a whine thread
im all for thisas far as the outlaw issue why not have a system that removes the ability to if your sec goes into outlaw status and this be considered a privilege by concord rather than a right
the only thing that comes to mind is if t3 ships with a covert reconfiguration subsystem can be cynod by a blackops ship even so any wartarget will have some kind of warning local muchi cant see trade being significantly impacted because of the fuel cost associated with moving such a small amount of cargo anything giving returns at that rate probably already has stability issuesas for the lowsec entry being an issue all it does is reduce the exposure of a well organized operation to opportunistic pvp which is the reward from being organized in the first place give effort get rewarded for actually putting in the effort i know there are going to be some pirates that are unhappy about this and here is your solution pop the fuel carrier for the pos that is getting stuff out that way or simply wardec the empire corp and probe down the cyno vessel while its in the middle of a cycle then clean up the hauler as it comes throughedita couple of things i forgot to addone thing that has been said over and over again is that highsec isnt safe space its safer space this motion would highlight that nicely and add more possibilities of play to those that live in highsec and not just the carebears at thatalso it would give blackops some kind of usefulness beyond 00 pvp operations which it badly needs solves that gripe without a nerf or a buff
i still support this
i agree
signed in support
already explained how a realistic concord would work if you are willing to accept the consequences of being an outlaw your idea could be feasible but no no consequences for cank in the name of sandbox proposal please and no 400 man fight in jita would be the norm proposal too i dont want server crashes every day till the trade hubs disappear completely and we live through bartering
op the simple fact of the matter is concord is there to give the players who live in empire some sort of feeling of security sure it would be pretty neato to amass a fleet of 500 and go rampaging through empire killing all in your way but it wouldnt be fun for those who where living in the system you just rampaged through eve needs a nice balance of pvpers and carebears to make everyone happy and if concord was made destructable to the point where you can kill people in empire willy nilly i dont see the carebears hanging around eve too much longer which inturn would affect the pvperscome on finding those juicy carebear haulers in lowsec is funjust my two cents
not to mention the fact that i dont see the pvpers stopping long enough to mine the minerals necessary to make themselves a new ship when the old one gets asploded
or when they run out of ammo or when they need a rig or 2 or when they need
and now we all imagine the embarrassment of hardcore pvpers getting ganked in their mining ship di am sure mining frigates will be quite popular in the end d
i to can agree upon that the empires use a cheat to keep sov but empires can be beaten concord cannotop the thing is what youre suggesting is pretty much how the region providence under the rule of cva works theyre a player alliance theres no concord there theres no factional police theres just cva and cvas allies if youd commit a crime say shooting upon a cva vessel that player would cry out in local and intelligence chats bringing a blob upon you with players policing the region of providence but when you have attacked this cvacva ally you will forever be damned as a criminal a terrorist that will be killed on sight not only in providence as a podpilot youre the best of the best your nation invested in you gave you a chance only a few rp warning have when you enter highsec you need to learn to live here without the wings of the empires you have a free safe haven the only cost is to follow the rules and if not say hey to concord as to the part of empires cheating with keeping sov accually i cant see any player driven alliance beating an empire if say a 5001000 man bs gang would enter jita with guns blazing the caldari state would respond pretty much like this inderdictors would come in dropping bubbles making you unable to flee sniper fleetsif youre lucky would hammer you away with missiles and railguns perhaps a state cyno flares up a fleet of motherships and carriers enters the system unleaching doom upon youor they hotdrop a titan or two reducing your bs fleet to ashes i have yet to even look at uo but it seems to me its a medevial theme correction please but this is not townsfolk this is several thousands of years into the future one would espect them having more than one sheriff in town so as many others already said if you think highsec is unfair go to nullsecpersonally id say take a trip to providence fins a cva dude to chat with be an ally build providence or just apply to another alliance nullsec is the place youre seeking not highsec highsec is just the safer place in nullsec people can hear you scream but almost never can they aid you
for a long time i am trying to write down this issue without using to much curse words in it its part of the problem that i personally had a lot of bad experiences with gm team and i had to try to be as objective as possible esp cause i am csm delegate before i start my rant i will say that i understand the workload gm dept have on their shoulders but its the job they choose and they are to blame for increased workload due to incompetence in their dept i can speak for the good chunk of people i am in day to day contact and its several thousands of 00 dwellers and most of them lost any confidence in gm team i was personal witness of i will not use word ed completely clueless low level gm answers regarding various gameplay aspects sadly due to roc i cant post any communication between players and game masters but i assure you there is lot off  there in many cases you can get the hint that gm actually read your petition not before 3rd reply then its really no wonder why many people ask for escalation to senior gm right away thus increasing workload on senior gms that would be the 1st part of the issue low level gms regardless if ccp iswas outsourcing them must imho be the active players on top of that they must pass rigorous knowledge tests so they shouldnt embarrass both gm dept and ccp as company the much bigger problem then low level gms are lead gms i will not mention many dubious decisions but i will focus on one case which basically pushed me to actually raise this issue i must say that as i met during csm 20 iceland meetings three leadsenior gms and i saw the passion they have towards eve and gm teamccp really did great job during pos exploit issue but simplythere is so much things to improve there anyway most of you were introduced to one of the biggest ups of ccp called UFFFDbob reloadedissueUFFFD it was discussed with gm grimmi during csm 210 meeting chatlog can be found here chatlog from csm 210 meeting

wtf does anyone else thinks its something wrong here and this is just crown jewel of gm dept there is lot of other mistakes that could or did interfered with 00 warfare in certain weightalso i dont see point of internal affairs dept when u complain to arkanon about lead gms and he just forward your complain to them to give you an answer i know they are in same rock band but guys u are running the company with 400k customers this is not the way to deal with thingsanyway there is not much i can propose what i already didnt said several times to gms but they need to get their  sorted  clear rules and policies i think there is only policy about reimbursment which is vague and doesnt a mean a  with UFFFDour logs dont show nothingUFFFD generic answer proper training of all gms ia dept actually doing their job and start slaping gm dept for their mistakesi will naturally raise this issue for next meeting and i am asking for one more csm UFFFD gm meeting in iceland cause a lot off things were said to csm in january and nothing actually happened
i am definitely on board for explicit trainings of lower lever gms as well as testingvetting of gm applicants
now gimmie my isk vuk
gms should not abuse their power at all in the game and those that do get slapped down rightly so
our logs indicate that there is no record of your existance you do not exist nothing exists we are all a figment of your imagination deleting life kbye
i too would love a degree in game mechanics
fully supportedme too was a victim of the our logs dont show anything generic answer more than once
supported
its quite aparent that the logs show nothing means your petition was too long ie it had more than 1 word in it and as a gm they were too lazy to check anything every time i get this response i have discovered that calling them on the fact that they never checked the logs usually makes them actually check the logs and normally makes them reimburse if its actually their bad this is a poor way of doing things but i think they are taking their lead from the way that government agencys delay people to the point of giving up somthing should be done but what

the staff should not manipulate anything ingame  just giving support
i have to agree with you about a coherent reimbusement policy and implementing it vigorously this also goes for the training of the front line gm they are there to take care of the routine items and to gather information for a higher level gm that would actually make a decision i have had the standard our records dont show type of response and i had to whip out my own logs and post them as well as asking for an escalation to someone higher in the gm chain why did the front line gm not access the recordsit also took over a week before i got a response from a gma recommendation gms should reply within 24 hours with something even if it is a statement that the petition is assigned to a gmand give the gms name so you know whos hands it is inok that is my 2 cents worthmalyou the man vuk lau
this is absolutley correct with the ammount of time and money that many people invest into this game ccp should be beyond reproach if my mobile telephone company was found to break its rules it would be liable for a law suit no matter weather it was a supervisor or a person answering the telephone ccp as a company needs to appreciate that people will vote with their feet if ccp continue to fail they will loose their customer base to other similar game titles and will eventually fail on a corporate level leaving the same dedicated players holding either a much larger subscription bill to keep ccp afloat or with their fave game being taken offline as the provider goes bankruptlet us not forget that ccp already charge more per subscription for this game other companies with lower subscription rates manage to keep their gms in line so how come ccp cant when they cost us more money personally this me me very sad as i can see that ccp has next to no respect for its customersuse our money wisely and sort this out gms who abuse the syste or fail to do their job properly should be fired no two ways about it it may just be a game but ffs ccp its our game and your ing job if you cant do that right why not take a course on plumbing and see if ccp can get that right
totally agree vuk
spot on vuk same rules for us for our enemies and for everyone else there need to be straight policies that we can trust in and for that ccp need to apply and enforce straight rules within their operations
get it together gms and start doing your jobs canned responses help no one
go get em tigeri mean vuk
go vik luki amwe are not giving a thumbs up because hes in myour alliance as this may come across as such with alot of mm voting i for one dont bother with petitions anymore i can get myself out of  much faster and without having to deal with some ed responses and wasting time the eo incident did it for me short sighted reasoning from gm dept got me really ed off you need to actually read the bloody petitioni better stop now before i keep ranting
i just hope well all live to see the day

id like to mention there was a time i reported over 20 macro ice miners linking all of their names so that it would be easy for the gm none of them ever got banned and they are all still at it today fly over to anatolare in everyshore and see for yourself the only response i got was to summarize well look into it but we cant tell you if we take any action
i have to agree with the assessment of the gm team there are many people i have told to not bother with very legitimate issues that have happened due to the game screwing up for some reason or another and knowing how the gm team works i have told them to not bother because im almost certain that they will get the short curt response of our logs show nothingon another note i have heard any a horror story and witnessed a few my self of gms stepping over legitimate in game mechanics and returning stolen property to people mechanics like a friend of mine stole an unmanned orca out of a belt the pilot of the ship complained to the gms and was returned the ship im sorry but where in the rules does it say that that sort of action is illegal or against game mechanics another example is that a friend of mine i dont know how specific with this one i can be managed to snag a good pile of t2 bpos from a major alliance they were given to him by a friend in the alliance the gms got involved and put a temp ban on the person who got the bpos account and returned to the bpos to the former owner who promptly trashed themyah i know this kind of stuff sucks for the people who lost those very expensive items but it must be said that if the gms got involved in the same way with other much more famous robberies and or spy jobs example ghsc and the fall of the imperial apoc the disbanding of bob the killing of the first titan to name a few this game would lose a lot of the rawness that it already has this is a game where there are no punches pulled where only major meta gaming issues are illegal
i agree 100 but ive got a much better example of incompetence about 5 months ago i petitioned a group for what appeared to be a pos exploit in the petition i listed the corp linked the system and put the planetmoon where it happened i recieved a reply back from a gm stating thanks for the information but in order to help you we need the following informationplanet moontype of exploitcorp holding the moonand system location
hahahahahahahahapure win
too often i have had a wtf reply from a gm who didnt seem to understand the suituation support for players is where eve really falls behind others we need ccp to do something about it
constructive replies
i think ccp stated this problem somewhere that using a macro doesnt modify the game client and you cant see it in the logs when i am mining myself i also look like a macro miner p so if apparantly gms cant see this fraud in the logs its hard to ban someone for something you cant proof and afaik ccp only bans people when they have proof in their serverlogs
i too stay awake for 23 hours a day 7 days a week its pretty bad when you have a department that creates multiple multipage threads with not a single good thing said about them at all
when you have ships getting reimbursed for lag and others not getting reimbursed for losses due to a bug on ccps part theres a bit of an issue support
need moar vuk lau in your life
the goonswarm titan theft which occured at the start of the year is probably the most glaring example of gm idiocy i can think of for those of you unaware a titan was stolen using a compromised account and transferred to another character the character flying the titan was banned but the titan remained on the banned account and was never returned
insert random our logs show nothing commentseriously this is the 1 thing that es me off we can even provide videos have dozens of petitions from a single fight and still get the near robotic response of our logs dont show a problemif you apparently allow gms to use their own discretion in such serious matters as alliance names how could you not allow the same discretion in reimbursementsat the very least large fleet fights that generate multiple petitions need to be reviewed by someone beyond a senior gm problems like these are huge issues for eve and need more attention than a firstlevel gm pretending to be a petition autoclosing bot

for all of the people saying that wis will have no impact on gameplay and that it will simply be eye candy when did ccp call you and tell you every little plan that they had for the mechanic how on earth do you know every little detail they have planned for wisdid you ever think for one second that this is going to springboard into something more expansive than the tiny bit they showed at fanfest last yearhave you given thought to the fact that it is still in development and that they could be pumping out more actual content for wis as we speakmy guess is no my guess is that those of you who are claiming wis is worthless and can contribute nothing to the eve universe simply heard torfi say there will be no killing in stations upon release of wishowever i digress the fact of the matter is you have no idea what wis will bring unless you are playing the final build how can you possibly speculate as to the merits of wis
i agree
no support the biggest are you kidding me moment when i started playing this game wasnt the ridiculously counterintuitive ui or the lack of documentation it was that i wasnt able to leave my ship i almost stopped playing right there im glad i didnt but as soon as i found that out it seemed like the game was just fundamentally halfdone the game is great but the whole universe feels so empty and pointless walking in stations will do a lot to create a sense of immersion also the development of it is tied to another game so its going to happen anyway so this entire whinethread is completely pointless
so true it would give black ops a place in the fleet thats not just running cloak and dagger like recons bombers and all the other stealth ships they have their place in their own fleet and in a regular fleetthough the cost of one would have to decrease and the hp would have to be increased i think its a viable option

1 the repper turns red because yes he is aiding someone however the repper himself is not shooting he is adding 0 dps to the fight2 there are plenty of counters as ive stated multiple times if rr is so overpowered how come im able to kill people using rr daily again ive linked plenty of related kms so i wont get into that 3 youre somewhat correct here i believe that small gangs who chose to engage station camping griefers should be allowed at least some form of gtfo button think of it this way if they werent in rr battleships theyd be in gank fit battleships so they really are sacrificing a lot in order to use teamwork to take on overwhelming numbers4this is very relevant to the discussion are you saying that rr has nothing to do with a docking timer revolving around the use of rr come on now
yes
its theft that should have concequences for the offender i agree with the offender being flagged to the killed and the pilots on the kill mail and also getting a timer so they cant dock or jump for 60 seconds o
hey warfighter take a break you dont have to be a r3tard every time you make a post
stealing loot should flag one for all players in system cause you know stealing loot is wrong
wars dont pay the bills i think thats simple logicccp has already stated that they arent going to change this in case people didnt notice
i agree on the npc corp issue it is an alt abuse imo and i would go furtheranyone not in corp taking from your wreck should be flagged in any system including 00 as an agressive act ie they cant jump immediatlykillrights should not be given in 00 as is correct however an eve mail should sent to the owner so you can find and shame kill the little 
i really feel like i need to make something cleari believe that the issues involving cans not being properly displayed in the assets window is a valid concern and i an all for changing that i think that you should be able to open up containers remotely and do things like make contract for the items within remotely however i dont want to see this thread turn into a how can we fix cans to make them less horriblethe idea for the item tabs is to have sorting mechanism in place that doesnt involve the hassle of cans at all now this is not to say that cans would be obsolete quite to the contrary they would compliment this system perfectly much like cans in corporate hangar arrays can give more detailed sorting optionsi also would like to clear up the assets window discussion i want the assets window to compliment the item tabbing idea not to overtake it it doesnt make sense to use the assets window for instation item sorting when we have an item hangar where your items are stored anywayi want to see something new with the item hangars this idea is for sorting in a way that the individual sees fit i would like to take my pvp gear my ratting loot my minerals my shared gang loot and anything else you can think of and sort it in an intuitive and easy way exactly like what we have in corporate hangars i just want to extend that functionality to personal hangars and have the individual be able to tag them as they see fiti reiterate the fact that i want cans to change i just want this morethank you to the csm delegates who have supported this idea and please let me know what ccp has to say about it
support i literally have dozens of station containers scattered across the universe because you cant just get rid of them when you move two week log timeout go figure so it gets the assets window all clutteredthe existing api does see through containers already so it shouldnt be hard to implement

make it kind of like implantsonly for shipsoh waiti like the idea but i feel theres more pressing matters for ccp to worry about really i once played an older dosbased game battlecruiser 3000ad that used something like this except that micromanaging crew is so damn tedious its sometimes not worth it
i agree with herschel here it is an awesome idea one a hell of a lot of eve players would enjoy imo but im not sure itd be good for eve itself per se
it makes sense for people like myself who were idoits or were not sure if they were gonna play the game when they started
hell nocharacter name is the single most important choice you make when you create a character right at the start of the gameeve is a dark harsh game its about consequences for all the actions you perform and decisions you make in gamenow case in point think back to when you started the game the first time you left the safety of empire you were happily exploring ratting or mining then along comes a pirate and makes that ship you worked so hard for explodeif you do not quit the game in frustration chances are you are going to want to hunt this guy down and kill him later on when you are stronger this lust for revenge drives a lot of new players to keep playing i have heard plenty of tales of how people have caught up with people who podded them in the past and killed themso fast forward to now for arguements sake name changes come in next year hundreds of new players will likely go out exploring into low sec and will get podded but since the bad guys can now so easily change their name the new guys will never manage to get their revenge its just a little food for thought just because you dont like your name in game doesnt mean the end of the world sure starting again is not an easy decision but the option is there you are free to make another character at anytimethink about every side of the story before you jump in and demand change

agree on boosting sensor damp effects on arazulachkeres et all by around 75 per skill levelas per the rapierhuginn it may be worthwile replacing the pretty pointless damage bonus damage bonus on an ew ship lol for a ew strength bonusa boost to the drone bays not bandwitdh of all recons other than the curse which is perfectoverpowered in this regard wouldnt be amiss so they can be more flexable in the drones they can carry arazulach should be the top of the drone bay sizes perhaps the t1 varients could do with the same love
supported
supported having to use two webs per target to get them to slow down enough is annoying for a webbing specialist ship
indeed the rapierhuginn are weak with regard to say a curse or a rookcurrently a rapierhuginn is barely able to hold down one target they need to basicly be double pointed by a friendly and double webbed and often bubbled as warp stabs are pretty much the item to fit for some ratters even then they can make it back to the gate out of point range because webs take about 10 years to slow a ship down after they landtarget the poor painter bonus is a waste of time and mid slot noone fits this target painters are pretty rubbish unless you have a couple of them and really they are so that missiles are usable and to be honest allot of stealth bomberstorpheavy missile ships bring their own now anyway because as we know missiles suck otherwise the rapier needs a strength and range bonus to webs each web should be able to reduce speed about 80 basicly deal with one shipthe rapier is still a very good scout ship due to its speed and sometimes usefulthe rapier is still a decent solo tackler with some guys in dps support and works very well in support of bombers other recons it is however probably the weakest of the recons as other recons can deal with multiple targets easily other recons also will own minmitar ones if they dontcant webrun in most circumstances great for a ship that costs about 180mil to fit properly as we know recons are also always primaried so they rely on their abilities to survive so why engage in a min recon in a fleet battle where they should shine like other recons today i basicly dont fly my huginn anymore its slow cant cloak cant keep stuff of it with the webs and it gets primaried as an easy kill which is a shame because it used to be a top notch support ship
you make a fine argument  i hate that the game is becoming more cookiecutter with regards to ship fittings the rig abilities themselves should be balanced out but smallercheaper rigs should be stopped
supported also because opposite to what you think i beleive salvage and bs sized rig prices will go up
not supported the rifer doesnt have rig slots for decoration they were intended to be used current market forces make rigging t1 subbc ships too expensive this needs to be rectifiedcertain small and medium rigs may need to be examined closely to ensure that they dont break game balance a frigate will get a bigger benefit from a speed rig than a battleship right now this is not a problem because the rig would cost you significantly more than your hull but this could become a problem when rigged frigates are prevalent
i like the rig changes on sisi so no support from me im afraid
the advantage of a t1 frigate is its cost benefit its player choice that removes that advantage by adding a 3rd rig over a t2 shipits not an issue with rigs that drives the problems youre speaking about its a jacked up economic model which i ranted about 2 years ago that is messing with the price difference ships are way more disposable today than they were 2 years ago if you assume that a rigged battleship dies more often today than it did 2 years ago for the same player then thats an issue with the income being far to disposablepeople argued about inflation and inflationary pressure 2 years ago most saying it didnt exist look what happens when supply in a t2 market becomes limited again after an exploit was found prices shot up and continue to go up daily still 6 months later the argument is always about cost of rigs vs cost of ships well what if the market werent so jacked up that t2 ships were wildly expensive by comparison if you removed insurance in 00 for instance imagine how much more cautious people would be with ships and how much less inclined they would be to rig those ships less loss means less demand which ultimately means cheaper rigs less stupid loss means less t2 loss which means lower t2 ship cost again skewing the same argument about ship cost if price is 100 of the reason for this patch then i think theres far better places to put dev resources than tweaking something that isnt broken changing rigs isnt going to fix a ridiculously jacked up economy
supported but the only problem i see with this idea is that a lot of ships used in mining ops are very soft and can be picked off before the guns could lock and do enough damage to prevent it plus if the ai of the guns is like that of pos guns then the guns would cycle too oftenanother idea i heard someone suggest once was having rorquals be able to deploy a very weak poslike forcefield within which the softer barges could mine with less fear of being instapopped which might last for say 1 minute or so before a small 34 bs gang could get it down it would still be a big race to gtfo with the rorqual itself also being at risk and you would still need proper pvp defense in the form of the proposed sentry guns and player pvp guards
no in every possible way i wrote a reply but theres just so many problems with this i cant be bothered
sounds reasonable enough effort vs gain basically imo thats what eve is all about saying that i agree with herschel mid range ores should be more valuable however that still wouldnt solve the problem with risk vs reward in lowsec this topic is a good step in the right directionsupport
there some stealth nerf to outlaws using thesecause if these get added to the game we are going to turn lowsec into a fortress
no to mobile mining guns this is what sentries are foryes to balancing low sec better right now there isnt any justifiable reason for going to low sec since you are likely to get popped by a gate camp as soon as you go throughif youre lucky enough to get through you can be popped while mining or missioning per game designi think that bubbles should not be allowed directly on the gates which would help balance lowsec you would have to place the bubble no closer than 10 km from the gate meaning pirates would actually have to decide which entry vector they want to cover instead of blanketing all entry points creates a strategic requirement for these guys instead of letting them mindlessly drop a bubble where it covers all entry vectors in 0sec bubbles could still be allowed on gates though since that is a big part of nullspace tactics
sensible
current situation it is not possible to determine what the fittings are on an assembled ship unless you are in the ship alright that isnt completely true you can create a contract and see everything listed by that is hardly reasonableproposed solution add the capability to see ship fittings with show info whether youre in the ship or not
this would save 10 seconds a million times a week
ye your fittings should be available to be seen without boarding ship
nerve and time saving feature especialy when you have several pieces of the same ship with different fits in same station
this would be a sought after function
yes his please yes nothing worse thn gettin into a ship just to find out its different fir thn u thought save you 30 seconds of ur life
lord yes

supportin dise or i would if i checked the boxhell yeah check boxes
what i think would be a cool anti cloaking feature would be a way to anchor a decloaking lattice or maybe even singular cans the thing with these would be that once they are anchored they cloak up kind of like a decloaking mine field so if a ship gets too close to one it decloaks the same as cans except they wont be able to see them until theyre on top of them you could try and balance it by having a skill determine how many lattices you can anchor or something your thoughts
never it would be another buf to carebears
i say this as a pilot who uses cloaks allot on reconscovert ops dictorsships fitted with cloaks should be eventually probeable with good skills in covert ops only with the probability based on the ships sig radius t2 cloakers should be harder to findif a ship is cloaked and slowstationary it should then be possible to decloak them and kill them sitting afk in a cloaked large ship should be risky not lol give us the ability to kill macro rattersminers and solo titans more effectivly for you ccp ships using covert ops cloaks should be harder to find and since they can move at a reasonable speed able to warp cloaked very difficult to catch unless cloaked stationary and afk for 2 hours like a muppet i believe this would add more excitement to the game and require more skill with people working together to be safe or indeed find targets

fuel idea rules
as my previous thread had too many ideas with too little response ive narrowed it down to this one basic principle i and perhaps many others would like to seewe are able to convert cash to game time codes we can then convert the game time codes into pilots licence extension which when used add an extra 30 days of game time to your accountthe premise is basically as simple as the topic subject  the 100 bonus to trianing speed mechanic is available ingame already available only to new characters upto 16 million skill points id like to be able to trade a 30 day plex to receive a 30 day bonus training speed to my accountim sure this would be a relatively simple procedure given as the bonus training and plex structures are already ingame and im also sure ccp would like to receive some extra monies and the playerbase would like some faster learningwinwin all round make it so
noi cant see this happening nor how this would be goodtheres no point in training to lvl5 unless youre getting a specialised goods or finishing off something youre really good at adding plexs that increase training time would just make it a wow in space the only thing thats fair in this game atm is training times please do not revoke that
no way
it wont result in really large problems that arent allready there you can now also buy other chars allready or use several accounts at the same time for parallel training that said i dont see any reason why it would need to go even further
not supported never
no thatd turn it into cash shop online
while i dread when i have to train a 20 day  skill and wish there was some way to speed it up this just equates to paying cash to accelerate character advancement however close the already in place methods may come such as purchasing a character who already has skills this would cross the line and cause a lot of protest dont get me wrong if it was in place i would use it i just think it would cheapen the experience of having an old or advanced character
one of the great things about eve is that you dont really have to grind very much a guy who is busy and wants to log in once a week can still advance his character effectively and this is a good thing your proposal would tell people that in order to play seriously they have to grind cash like a wow player grinds xp that is not something i want to see at all
no this creates even more of a gap between the haves and have nots
this is not wow onlinehell no
not now not ever sorry terrible idea
those plexes are called 5 implants and training all learning skills to 5 yes also the rank 3 suddenly training is very fastoh and well not supported
a great idea that would go a long way to revitalizing eves mission systemive got a couple of additional suggestions1 the appearance of propsnonmissioncritical structures that appear in missions could vary based on the security level of the system in which they spawn a guristas base for example should be smaller and perhaps obscured by debris and gas clouds in high security space whereas in say 05 space the base could appear larger and more well established for the same mission2 introduce the sleeper aithe new ai has done a lot to make encounters with the sleepers more exciting and challenging perhaps it is time to start introducing it to known space you could introduce the ai gradually starting with boss ships and their support in the level 2 missions onwards3 semirandomly generate ship waves and turret typesvarying the enemy ships that spawn has already been mentioned it would also be good to vary the stationary turrets that appear randomly inserting energy draining warp scrambling and webbing structures could be a good way to encourage players to modify their strategycheers
hello thereim pretty sure that the topic has already been discussed somewhere but id like to give my thoughts about it im still quite a rookie in eve around 6 months game and i really enjoy playing in this fantastic sandbox but there is always something wrong there is one specific point who makes me very bored eve wants to be a crossover between a solid gameplay and space simulation and you should all know that space is a huge ammount of emptyness with some matter in itso what kind of usual natural phenomena and objects can we see in eve atm  suns planets moons asteroids wormholesbut if you like astronomical science you also know there is a lot of more of objects in space like  comets meteors gas constellation and a lot of morealso each category can be divided in others one like suns in space there is a huge ammount of suns subdivisions like dual suns novae red sun pulsars brown dwarfs etc each of these categories does not have the same attributes dimensions light emission radiations etci know my proposal is an utopic one but my dream is to see one day eve with all these objects in space entering a system looking for a dual suns at the center of it turning my head and looking for a distant comet moving slowly then warping to a planet and being damaged by a natural magnetical phenomenaas you understood id like more eyecandy and astronomical science in eve 
it is theoretically possible to use player policeit isnt practicalfirst of all the empires are needed from background and immersion reasonscome join this subs in space game we have without a story where you will be pressed into servitude isnt a good way to get playersalso the reason why it works in for example providence is since the area is bad enough for the bigger entities not to want it cva and allies have done a good job of empire building probably the only one but compare the value of providence to for example fountainif we were to remove concord and faction navies and empire all together the result would be that nbsi rules everywhere new players would be pressed into servitude as frigate miners or similar if at all allowed to live
i think ccp is just beyond a point where eve is finally shifting from a startup small scale thingy into a complex project technically engaging as well forcing the company to a lot of development and progressive work for not letting the evetrain slow downthe treatment the eveplayers need has grown likewise all those rather technical apects of the game into a complex thing you can change aspects of balancing and and gameplay without many thoughts if you run a free browser game with mediocre sized playerbase but you cant just do that without deeper thoughts if you got literally thousands of paying customers of whom a given percentage reacts to even the slightest change in gamemy point is that not only the game is evolving but the players do so too so at this point a real good communication is necessary between developer and and player to satisfy both in the long run if ccp gets eve thru this bottleneck and if the game gets better by all our discussions and brawls both sides winso to all gms and and ppl involved on a workly basis just because the train rolls doesnt mean you can spare your coal and let the fire within diedang im drunk and senseless i spose

i have nothing to witty to say
the whole our logs dont show  line is ridiculous the only way this could be true would be if they had absolutely no activity logging of any sortthe problem is that the gms will not reply back with any concrete information no list of events tracked no list of events that are logged and reimbursable nothing its not a hard task to extract information from the archived log files around a given timeframe ive got to believe that theres timestampwhowhatwhereaction information that could easily be given in replyis the vagueness a cover for something embarrassing ive never seen sincere people ever reply without sharable concrete facts to back up there findings derhund
not having to preescalate my petitions would be nice
whats sad is i have about 20 other stories that compare to that instance and more still that are lesser degrees of incompetencethe troubling part about gms is that the first response should be the end of most petitions with a resolution yet 910 times the case is the petition drags on for no reason even more frustrating in cases of reported exploits harassments and eula violations the petitioner doesnt even get a reply stating how the issue is resolved so multiple petitions go in thinking each with the thinking that nothing has even happened leading to further frustration even more amazing is that for petitions where bans or warnings have been issued there is no public record to see just how often that happens or what players are abusing the system consistently so its very easy for the gms to further complicate matters because theres no understanding of whats going on ive talked to some guys who claim to have literally had 45 warnings on the same issue how is that possible shouldnt some sort of action have been handed out
even though it is shocking it is kinda cute how a big company has such a backyarder approach to dealing with their customers likely it is a reflection of a company run by nerds who do not have professionals from customer service industries working there it would be much easier to run this company without customers a quote from the ceo of australias biggest retail outlet his concern was controlling the logistics of his stock levels and waiting on customers to buy goods was really inconvenient ccp gives off the same feeling to its customers we are just an inconvenience to them i know it would be much easier to keep the servers up and running without us logging inmost of us here love this game amazing internet spaceships awesome stuff running a research department to observer your competition will improve the game experience what do other mmos do how do they handle customer service how do they deal with in game disconnectsyes eve is a harsh place to live every step of the way is fraught with danger every step of the way cspa charges what is that in the game for why is it there ccp griefs its customers in every way imaginable the harsh environment is part of the appeal it is not for noobs however being told that the logs do not show anything is not part of game play at the very least it is poor log design by ccp and in a product that is as mature as eve that basic component should work properly and do not get me started on the eve instruction guideeve addicts will keep logging in new subscribers will be disappointed and leave when ccp fails and makes their ingame life unnecessarily disappointing getting and giving help is hard in a global game language barriers understanding of game mechanics griefers people scamming gms there is a lot of issues to deal with other mmos handle it fine anything to improve the interaction between customers and ccp is totally supported by meregardskrackatinnybtw thanks for a great game keep up the win
hehe check out my recent experience with a gm
couldnt have said it better myselfi stopped sending in petitions a long time ago doing it just feels so pointless because the gms doesnt take them seriously anyway
this seems like a fine idea
i couldnt agree more with what you are saying ive totally lost faith in eve gms opening a petition for reimbursement is useless because it doesnt even seem like they know how game mechanics work in the first place so theyll just reject your reimbursement almost before reading it i dont even petition anymore because of how helpless the gms are
supported awesome game worst consumer care ever  and creating a csm to make us feel like our issues are being dealt with is just a ing jokeand the funny thing is it doesnt start or end with gms for one we have forum mods so jacked up on crack that they seem to lock all the worthy thread and spend more time monitoring caod troll fest rather than acctually doing their jobs eve needs a complete overhaul and possible replacement of its gmmodsetc crew cause atm they fail and hardsorry if i sound harsh but when 90 of the people i know ingame dont petition or use the forums cause they know it wont make a licking difference even if it was ccps obvious fault
transparency is the key

i have to say that on the few occasions that i personally have had dealings with the gms they have been prompt courteous and efficient however i have heard some pretty sad stories from people i trust about inconsistent or flat out incomprehensible rulingsgiven that its pretty much a nobrainer that more understanding and experience of the game  the extremely complex technically advanced highly competitive game  theyre ruling on is a good thing it would also be nice to have some public policies or guidelines a gm wiki if you will of decisions and precedents that they could refer you to this can be updated as and when when the rules change so you dont need to worry about binding yourselfin all fairness it should also be said that very many eve players have little knowledge or regard for the rules either and i hear a lot of complaints about gms that make me think no duh most griefing and reimbursement complaints i hear of fall into this categoryall the more reason for the wiki tbh

vuk i love ya man but this could easily have been done betteri see that you point out that the gm department s up a lot you pull out one of the better examples from this year and yeah that was a upyou also mention ia which you have basically no idea what has been doing how do we know if gms arent getting warnings for their ups fact is that we dontyou are pointing out a problem which is communication but you are trying to make it into an issue which you think the csm can solvehow are you going to approach ccp about this without making the csm into seeming like a bunch of bitter people who were told that the logs shows nothing
but is that not exactly the pointthe total uselessness of the log files affect every singe one of us  and yes we are all bitter some deal with it some go emo some go emoragequit  but i just wonder if any player reading this has not felt bitterly disappointed due to a petition being handled in a manner that the customer thought was unjust
i once asked a gm what their logs would show to them so i could filter the issues myself an decrease the work on the gms and the answer to it was not the same as your logs
couldnt agree more i hope youre not letting the devs off the hook too they are getting more and more detached from reality these days to the point you wonder if thay actually still play the game
supported for me the problem is definitly the low level gms they are utterly uselessi remember one particularly amusing incident for me i logged off after having some pewpew with bobtri in one system an hour later my ship was destroyed by tri in another system a certain gm a uniquely useless example imo lamentably named for one of those religious holidays in febuary decided that the above was perfectly within game mechanics the next normal gm after i cussed that one out said it was wierd but were not reimbursing i escalated and a senior gave me my ship back in about an hour 3
sort out the jump clones issues and our skillpoints that we losewe should be able to be reimbursed on skillpoints and implants regardless if is not on session logs
it has gotten to the point that you just auto escalate because you know that the low level gm isnt going to read your petition or that is the general impression in the experienced world there is a major lack of faith in the low level gm population
complete lack of faith i never bother with gms when some ingame issues occur as i know they wont read it or deal with it and will send out the generic
vote prodont know where is my tumb up
i like this product
i have given up on getting any sort of inteligent response from gms so that i no longer bother to petition anything also zee logs show nothing
well even if they are getting warningfines which i am 99 positive they dont i still dont see any improvement and i must add that my experience with ccpgm dept goes back to 4s corporation name scandal i am so said that nda tos eula etc tied my hands but you cant believe the ammount of gm  i received in last 12 hours communication is not the problem problem is that gm dept suck and ofcourse i am not delusional to believe that csm can use magic wand and solve the problem i am sure ccp is aware of the issue but i am also sure they are not awareor just dont care cause subscriptions are going up of the size of the problem csm can atleast i believe and thats why i ran for csm show them about importance of the issueyes people are whining about the logs but logs are the least of the problem hereand for the end yes i agree that this could be done a much better if i was not csm delegate and someone who represent at least my corporation and my alliance this thread would be much much worse in terms of civilness spsadly my gametime is severely limited last couple of weeks due to rl stuff so i didnt had much free time to made more detailed and explicit thread on time to meet deadline to raise this issue for iceland meetingalso as i said i met many ccp guys and you can see in everyone of them passion about eve and they really made something unique the game without any competition also the maturity and hospitality they showed towards csm was nothing but exceptional but before csm delegate i am first a customer and purpose of bringing this issue was to make whole eve experience better to everyone both players and ccp
some of the low level gms are very uninformedworse a large percentage of them seem to exhibit bias although this could be the abovea particular issues lies with missionrunners successfully petitioning to have missions reset and ships reimbursed when according to ccp policy they should not have such carried outits really rather damning when someone gloats they know a gm and guess what a few days later something happen that runs contrary to established policyspecial interest and knowledgethere is still a real problem with players having access to information they shouldnt haverecently the aggro alliance forums were compromised and it was exposed that they had been informed by someone working for ccp that motherships were going to be redesigned in the next big patchrconmore recent still are grumblings about the owner of scrapheapchallenge specifically the banning of individuals from a private forum using knowledge only available to a gm or ccp employee edit it would be nice if ia actually functioned as it should they have a reputation for ignoring anything that isnt going to make a splash when they commit it to the bin

imo this is definitely true i havent been playing as long as some of you guys but hell ive seen a lot of bad calls on the part of the gms some of which have lead to long term players quitting the game which is the saddest of all things as player retention should surely be a high priorityi have seen two major issues one where a player i know took a screen shot of him in his ship 15 minutes by screen clock after he was podded to offer supporting evidence of the fact he had no control over his ship loss and was then told he faked the image to get a reimbursementsecond of someone deliberately manipulating the character bazaar to make it look like someone had accepted isk and then not transferred a character the victim was banned from the game and then when the gms actually realized that the post was an edited one when his account was reinstated he had 6 billion isk negatively adjusted from his account nothing was done to the player who faked the post on the bazaar and the victim was never given the isk back there are some awesome gms who clearly take a lot of pride in their work but to be honest the auto escalate my complaint attitude of many players is well founded and based on recieving one too many copy paste responseseve is too good a game to let this continue
thums up  gm have to get their act together
in my time i have had some petitions answered by very competant gms but by the same token had some answered by gms whos grasp of both the english language and game mechanics was pretty poor there certainly needs to be more training and more oversight
ive only seen 1 incident with reinforcing a system that was going to have some 600700 people where there was an issue but that was back in 2007 so it might not apply still where both sides had filled petition but people were lagging out at 200 or so the main reason i suspect why it was ignored because they were less known alliancesdark matter coalition and pure
supporting
i have contributed to the work load with my shares of potitines then again 95 of those are becuase of failed game mechanics between patches and creatings of exploitsuknown bugsthe big problem is when gms have no idea how most the game mechianics should work that or they dont care to read the potition and are so overloaded they skip the point its a joke to get these automated responses expecialy when i have got many responses that are not even pointed to the issues that is in question the best part is there is so many grey areas with the rules and reimbursment that just based off the gms mood or relationship to the player can determin the outcome of the potitionbest yetwhen the denial of responsability by the ccp team to not acknowlage unkown bugs as a right to entitlment for reimbursment if somthing is clearly broken and not normal without having any published note changes then ccp should take full responsability of falt

yeah man we wouldnt want people to think that teamwork is a good thing
i dont particularly support it because i think there are good counters to a standard rr fleet carriers are another issue for another threadbut he does kinda make a valid point between extenderplate setups and rr setups personal active tanks are slowly being diminished overtime for any activities outside of pve its probably an issue that does need some consideration but i honestly dont know what kind
dont support the issueyou cannot do a direct compare of raw statistics for local and remote repair remote repair requires another player to operate and all the possible problems with coordination that entails i favor the use of remote repair as it requires more skillsupport from a player perspective to implement versus just clicking your own module
not supporteda little too off the wall for my tastesteamwork is also a major factor here
this its all well and good to say rr is better until you try to fly soloedit whoops accidentally supported good thing i reread this thread
in regards to this in pvp your not ment to fly solo unless your very stupid this is a mmo after all
on the other hand local reppers cant be jammed
supported it doesnt make sense that a rar is better than a lar by such a degree if anything the lar should be better because of internal repairing furthermore it doesnt have the vacuum of space to work around the way i see it rar should be a supplement to existing repair not a superseded replacementi think switching the fitting requirements would be a good start and maybe increasing the rar duration and decreasing the lar duration so that the damage repaired over time are switched the efficiency can stay how it isbut please give a boost to range 8500m is ridiculously short range should be way higher maybe with a falloff
local tanks are still superior for small gang work imho there are no faction remote reps remote reps are not affected by boosters etc etc
not supportedi think this is just another kneejerk reaction
eve should be a massively singleplayer online rpg cd
well for solo you would fit tanking rigs and then the stats would move towards the lar i think
hooo boy red herring arguments ftw this is not about teamwork its about the lack of place for local reps because remote reps are a much better tool for the job teamwork is good nullifying an internal module because a wingman can do it better is notif youre going to invalidate the issue at least provide an argument to back it upthe lack of faction rr and rr boosters both special cases is not an excuse as to why rr is better in so many ways and furthermore all you need is one wingman to be close to you to get better benefits than you can provide for yourself thats hardly explaining how local tanks are superior for small gangsif it serves the same purpose in much the same way you certainly can compare the raw statisticswith many configurations there is little coordination required and yes it can be a support role but it becomes a matter of mutual benefit once everyone has them equipped then the support argument goes right out the window as for skill theres not much involved except for learning how to operate it properly as is the case for local repsi dont have a problem with teammates helping each other but this isnt a case of helping other teammates its a case of letting someone else do the job for them because nobody is capable of doing a proper job himself taking out a webber is helping your teammate rr is not only helping out your teammate it makes local reps obsolete the fitting requirements alone are proof enough of thatoh and i suppose i may as well support my own ideasupported
unless for shield tanking then we want people to think that teamwork is a terrible thing
allen this wouldnt have anything to do with not listening to good ole viktor vegas and going ahead to try to gank my dominix resulting in losing a couple of rigged ships would it local rep already has a place in small gang warfare for instance most battlecruiser class ships will generally use local rep and in small engagements its not uncommon to see battleships using local rep as well the bottom line is that local rep already has a place in small gang warfare and in pve boosting local rep by the degree youre suggesting would remove the viability of plated setups additionally i think you underestimate the drawbacks of rr as soon as your rr gets jammed or you move out of their short range youre basically screwed imo the system is fairly well balanced as is and theres no need for this change
i would like to see in the future some kind of pos structure like a jump gate that can link between poss in unknown space this will allow expansion of corps through wspace and remain linked to the systems
hello all this has been bothering me sence i got evei have duel moniters so when i was on wow yes i played wow it allowed me to drag its program window from one screen to the other screen and then expand it to fit the other screen one screen is larger than the otherbut on eve when i try this it allows me to drag to the other screen but i cannot expand iti have also tried to do fullscreen mode use the option for it to be displayed in my larger screen but when i do that i cannot get the cursor to leave the screen with the full sized program on it without alttab which causes the eve program to go blackif anyone forum moderators can bring this to a devs attentions trhat would be nice but if anyone has a little trick they do that would be nice too
i was on way to make a similar topic id really like to move only my overview  chat windows to my other screen wich is smaller than my main screen and play eve on the main one
i normally like most others put both games on the same window and the put them into windowed mode drag across and try and pull the edges to fit my screen the best i canother thn tht not much u can do but will support the wow feature to be added ing cant believe i just supported a thread with the word wow in itgib
current situation when the assets window is opened to all items the only determination of where a station lies is either by the name or number of jumps from your current location in the case of outpost in 00 space a station could be renamed to not tell you anything usefulproposed solution the addition of another tab called by region where itll show the stations split up by the regions which they exist in or add the region name in parentheses before or after the number of jumps
this could be very handy even in high sec or anywhere elsesupported
im always in favour of more ways to display information
supportin dis
about time
there is already a tab for that where you can filter by region right next to all itemsi dont see we need any actions
it only give the hangar content of region where you are
wrong you got a drop down box where you can choose over regions i use that feature heavily for planning hauling routes after shopping maybe you missed the addition of the featureedit typos
current situationthere can be a substantial delay with the ui revealing hangar contents when clicking between tabs in a corporate hangar whether it is within a station pos module or capital ship this is especially troublesome when youre in a hurry to find something and have to suffer this wait proposed solutioni propose that ccp investigate whether improvements to refresh rate of hangar contents loading can be improved
oh come on  having to search through a hundred hangars at a pos to find a blueprint isnt your idea of a fun time supported wholeheartedly
supportin dis
supporting to increase the loading time for finding things quickly we got the little search box on the right now 
ha they should do more than that gassing is easily the most boring part of the game it also looks the worst its need a good revamp even if its just visual like what they did with the ore mining but hopefully they also add some more interesting gameplay to it even if it just changing the visuals and having multiple pockets of clouds
always liked the prophecy myself but only because of its looks im so shallow i always use projectiles on it though which is so wrong as its the amarr enemys weapon of choice i love the idea of making the prophecy more of a drone boat amarr are the only other race aside from the gallente that have dedicated drone ships arbitrator and variants legion so it is fitting that they get a bc with drones bonuses too theres certainly no benefit to using lasers on it at the moment
this
i bash people who snipe with unfounded arguemnts that have already been derailed in the original post if you come to make a point one way or the other i expect something more than youre just wrong cause you cant possibly be right arguements it would take one post on here with straight facts backed up with numbers to get me to change my pov when you disrespect me or anyone elses ideas on here or anywhere you damn well deserve no respect in the op i slayed out the numbers describing exactly why tank is not a valid argument for the proph not one person that has argued otherwise has yet to play with eft and show numbers that contradict that statement of the rest you look at guys who took 510 minutes to play with eft or who have vast experience using said ships in game and they agree assumptions drive me insane i mean wtf kinda argument is it has a resist bonus surely its tank is da best its those kinda assumptions that separate people who are good and bad at this game if you show me the proper respect by actually throwing out an educated commentary ill return it to you if you just troll youre damn well right ill throw it back in your face thats life get over it you sure as hell arent protected from it just because you hide behind a computer screen
you need to consider the fact it has no bonus to dmg so therefore rack in 220mm acs and 2 plates laugh with ur 400dps and 120k buffer the ships just not cut out for lasers but can still be useful and cheaper thn tier 2 not supportred because theres is ways to make or work
ok so i went back to do some eft warrioring and i was pretty surprised at the results on paperthe proph is pretty goodthe proph will out active tank the harby with about 150 less dps in my setups in any instanceprophecy pew pewmedium armor repairer iimedium armor repairer iienergized adaptive nano membrane iienergized adaptive nano membrane iiheat sink iidamage control ii10mn afterburner iiwarp disruptor iimedium electrochemical capacitor booster i cap booster 400focused medium pulse laser ii amarr navy multifrequency mfocused medium pulse laser ii amarr navy multifrequency mfocused medium pulse laser ii amarr navy multifrequency mfocused medium pulse laser ii amarr navy multifrequency mfocused medium pulse laser ii amarr navy multifrequency mfocused medium pulse laser ii amarr navy multifrequency marbalest heavy assault missile launcher i caldari navy torrent assault missileauxiliary nano pump iauxiliary nano pump iauxiliary nano pump ihobgoblin ii x5harbinger pew pew lazorsheat sink iimedium armor repairer iimedium armor repairer iienergized adaptive nano membrane iienergized adaptive nano membrane iidamage control ii10mn afterburner iiinitiated harmonic warp scrambler ilangour drive disruptor imedium electrochemical capacitor booster i cap booster 400heavy pulse laser ii amarr navy multifrequency mheavy pulse laser ii amarr navy multifrequency mheavy pulse laser ii amarr navy multifrequency mheavy pulse laser ii amarr navy multifrequency mheavy pulse laser ii amarr navy multifrequency mheavy pulse laser ii amarr navy multifrequency mempty high slotempty high slotauxiliary nano pump iauxiliary nano pump iauxiliary nano pump ihammerhead ii x51 rep on the harby and an extra heatsink for more gank less tankthe proph will be able to put up a better buffer thank than the harby from 720k extra ehp but with significant dps losses 165215 less dps than 545 it would loose a 1v1 but it makes a good bait ship with teethedit they also make fine rr boats 
if your going to do anything with it then remove the turret hardpoints nad replace with launchers and replace the cap bonus with a ham damage bonus and then i will be very happy 
problems with your fitting tacticharbinger has 2 slots left unfitboth ships are using afterburners which are uncommon in pvp setups but well go with that onefittings considerations with your proposed fits proph is maxed on grid and cpu harb still has room to playharb still has the option to remove its heatsink overcome the proph ehp and come to within 49dps tankable dmg all this while doing considerably more damage stillsuggestions swap 6 heavy pulse with 7 focused on the harb youll do 2 more dps and save massive fittings also have at some plate setups also keep in mind you have an extra mid to play with for utility and if you have the fittings an extra high slot for whatever for comparison im guessing your point was to go with max active tank problem with that is you can passive tank a bate harb or proph and get the equivalent of 140 seconds of tank with plates most bate ships dont get a chance to bate longer than that
thats oki like afterburners i like the extra range though  but i see your pointi made some plate setups those active tanks are in no way bait ships active tanks are for solo or small gang work
current situation the graphics affected by effects option under effects in display  graphics menu covers too many graphical effects if you have it turned off you miss seeing doomsdays and useful things like being able to tell is a ship is being repaired remotely or in triage if you have it turned on you are overwhelmed by seeing everyone who is sensor boosting along with everything elseproposed solution create three new options combat effects ie doomsdays projected effects ie remote reps and localized effects ie sensor boosters it could be expanded even further to distinguish between helpful and hurtful effects
im down with this
makes sense
supportin dis
good proposal
yes please
many of us know that the bounty system is easily exploited when a pilot has a large bounty on her head to simply send out a friend or alt to pod her and collect the bounty maybe this idea has been shown before butto help stop this from happening why not let the bounty only be paid when the value of the ship modules andor implants destroyed add up to more than the bounty amount itselfthe value of items and implants destroyed is shown on outside killmail sites all the time and this could definitely put an end to bounty abuse in a simple way since you or your friend would have to lose more items than what the bounty is worthyay nayjust a casual idealz
easier way get rid of the whole bounties systemthread
um no not threadbounties should be a primary mechanism for noncombat focused players to deter aggression the fact that theyre currently completely useless for this is a weeping sore in highsec play balance bounty hunters should be one of the primary consequences for hisec aggression currently there is only the easilyescaped wardec thus the riskreward of hisec is out of kilterit also makes stillborn one of the most popularly enquired about professionsfixing the bounty system would probably be one of the most significant improvements ccp could make to hisec id put it on a par with fixing sov in 00ops suggestion needs refinement but its along the right lines almost anything would be better than the pointless system we have now
not supported the idea is totally ridiculous and vastly complicatedif your going to fix the system you need to put in safeguards that prevent the system from being abusedthe only thing i can think of is bounty officehunters guild or deputy system where they are tasked to hunt down these targetsmuch like a militia but that could be complicate in itselfto qualify youd have to have a positive sec rating with concord youd go to concord offices to get bounties that are assigned by how good you are as far as a citizen or combat rating or what not and you go hunt them hell you could even pay concord to have them track there location to make it a bit more exciting and youd have to have proper standings so altabuse would be a bit difficultconcord is law enforcement so let them deputize bounty hunters to do the jobotherwise all other routes would just make it too easy to abusebypassexploit
what if the bounty system were changed to a bounty countract system when you get kill rights on someone that would enable you to put out bounty contracts on them youd offer a reward set a time frame like 7 days and specify a minimum ship size acceptable ship categories minimum base value of modules etc the payout would be made on the destruction of the ship rather than the pod so anyone with kill rights on someone can create a contract against them and set it up privately to the bounty hunter of their choice while the contract is active the issuers kill rights for the target are temporarily transferred to the issuee you would only have one contract out on someone at a time but as kill rights last 30 days you could place several weeklong contracts one after another with different hunters it means that the consequence for attacking someone in a manner that gives kill rights is that for 30 days you could have bounty hunters on your tail and you wont know who it isof course this doesnt address the issue of kill rights themselves not actually being awarded for much other than suicide ganks which are usually performed in almost freetolose ships by alts or low sec piracy where it doesnt help because the pirates are usually 10 anyway
maybe i expand on your ideas a little bit what if you cant see if you have a bounty on your head you have to have good sec rating with concord and you are given specific people to hunt up to 210 i dont know
a very similar system was submitted to ccp by the csm previously and while the response was somewhat ambiguousin essence wed like to but its a hell of a lot of work the idea seems to have been wellreceived and it was virtually identical to your proposal except more detailed also of note your system isnt as simple as you think it is killboard valuations tend to be hilariously wrong and getting a system that actually works as a game mechanic is not an easy problem to solve
supported as long as its optional low priority but getting a chat client up to 1995 standards seems like a good idea
righto guys were attacking when we jump into through dump a whole bunch of emoticons so they lag
that doesnt even make sense have you ever actually used any program with emoticons
i believe that walking in stations will bring a new aspect to eve gameplay not onnly on the socializing aspect of going to a trading hub like jita and chilling with thousands of people but actual warfare can be improved aswellfor example say have your fleet has a guy warp scammed and webd then everyone one else with the raiding skills or what ever can actually board his ship and try to seize it in a little brawl or fire fight inside the shipthe same can go for pos in low sec  00jump clones can have actual animation not u just pop up somewhere but you step out of a machine where you might see others respawning at to if they have clones there or whateveri mean there are other ways to make this part of military tacticsmaking incomeand improving the game which im sure others will suggest below
i understand that ccp does not want combat in walking in stations but what if you could only combat in low sec or 00 stations or a pos but never in high seci do understand that there could be a butterfly effect if combat was allowed such as a fleet is outnumbered so they dock to escape them now most of the time when your docked you are safe until you undock now if combat was included or wasnt included when you dock they dock follow you in station and torment you until you log off or undock and which you dieor if combat was included in this you could send the ones who docked packing and to a jump clone location so i mean my point is if combat or not there will be tactics that make it warfare so why not go ahead and make it actual combat in some stations on the high sec note maybe a solution could be anyone who fights in a high sec station concord either makes you undock as a punishment of your aggression and cant dock again for 30 or 15 minutes this would prevent violent crimes because even if you cant actually fight people in stations there will still be tactics that make it warfare using stalkingspying on conversationsharrassment each can cause political changes so not including actual combat wont change things you just cant actually fight character to character but it will still happen in otehr forms but there are ways to include such things and add barriers on certain actions
ccp has expressed interest in expanding gameplay mechanics into new areas and down the road something like this might be among them but that will be several more years at least in the short term this isnt going to happen walking in stations has all ready been through long delays and is controversial enough to the current playerbase that ccp will certainly want some time to gauge the impact before even considering something more
as long as it can be completely disabled from settings without impacting on gameplay in any way at alla user who choses to should be able to disable wis 100 and not be missing out on any access to the market etcno feature inside wis should be playcriticala user should be able to do 100 of eve stuff with wis disabled
imagine what could be done to the ui if it was the focus instead of wowesk content expansions
guy dont think about yourselves walking in stations may not appeal to some hardcore ppl but it will to ppl who are interested in the game this is outerspace ppl have to live and etc so showing there is more to eve that just epic battle will bring a more submerging environment having jita as a real civilzation trading hub not just a gas staion with but a actual trading hub and etci mean if walking in stattion is done properly it would bring tons of im sick of wow players here and maybe itll be a become a million plus player game cuz i mean just expanding on walking in stations it can be taken to a whole new height

what do you describe an antiaf bs as dual web  point is too vague
im asking you supporters have been implying that afs suck because a battleship fit to hit an af can kill it what the hell is wrong with a specifically fit battleship that takes months to properly train into and at least 3 times as much to fit being able to kill a frigate you can train into in 2 weeks
supported
tortugan ive not checked this thread in like weeks and youre still here droning on and regurgitating the same debunked objections for no discernable purpose other than to have something to do while you camp the jita undock cpcoadgeneralthat way
yes most definitely yes in almost all classes be it shield or armor missile or turret ab or mwd the afs suffer from being too weak for their price granted the rigs change in the coming 15 patch will improve things but theyll also improve things for the target ie cruisers and t1 frigs will also have access to cheaper rigs in fact after tzhe rigs patch t1 frigs will be even closer to t2 afs and given that eve is very much a rockpaperscissors type of game where you can never fit an absolute winning combo t2 afs will be running an even greater danger against t1 frigs since t1 frigs will as often as not motivated to fit gank rigs since they cost little and t2 afs will be motivated to fit tank rigs to protect their investmentor at least thats the way i see it eve seems to be a game where you win by playing to your strengths and lose by playing to your weaknesses ie the whole risk vs reward thing put in those terms t2 afs are a big risk for the rewards they promise
jag boost gief
this deserves the authentic seal of seppo the biggest sign of approval
agreed
any battleship should be able to take down an af if fitted for doing so if you have some neuts dual web and can turn off mwdafterburner you should be able to hurt them pretty well warp scrambler might work well too seeing as nearly all frigates have mwd equipped i would say youd have better success with a cruiserbattlecruiser for destroying afs though theyre faster and guns dont quite suck as much at tracking i dont see any problem with that

opposed to this idea1 using offline pos to block moons in some systems is a great tactic for space holding alliances for those unfamiliar with 00 pos warfare its done so that if hostiles attack logistics personnel run around and quickly online them they are most often anchored with a number of days of fuel and appropriate level of strontiumin very high moon count systems anchoring even small pos at every moon becomes prohibitively expensive in these cases anchored large pos give the defending alliance an edge on attackers if they can online towers before they are destroyed it helps the defenders sovclaiming count note that all alliances are limited to anchoring 5 towers per day per system there is no limit to how many pos you can online in a day it should remain this waynot every alliance has the income resources to maintain a good buffer of online pos due to fuel costs anchoring offline towers gives the little guys a chance against posspam particularly in station systems with poor truesec which 00 is littered with2 in the case of high sec moons simply wardec the owning corp and blow it up if theres an issue being unable to wardec closed corps with abandoned pos then ccp should address that either by fixing the wardec system or simply remove these towers via the petition system
moon squatters in your spaceinitiate wardecfit and insure tech 1 fit armageddonshoot towergo to bedprofitits not rocket science gents im also against making a tower become unanchored after a set period of time itd reduce slightly the isk sink pos structures are responsible for and if youre too lazyinept to take a moon for yourself then you shouldnt have it
supported  if its the only way you can filter them on your directional scanner
go back and get justification
well you can do that now the proposal simply removes a whole lot of pointless tedium from the process a willingness to be vigilant should be what saves me from attack not a high tolerance for tedium and sifting through five poss fifteen moons ten silos twenty small pulse laser batteries and a partridge in a pear treesupported
this proposal offers one approach to balancing the rewards of mission running in high security space versus ratting in lowsec and 00 ccp plans on revamping 00 later this year or next and i thought it would be beneficial to offer them some ideas from the perspective of a long term resident of 00the problemaccording to my research the iskhour earned running level 4 highsec combat missions on a single account is roughly 20mhour and can be accomplished with a 34 month old character the 20m figure may or may not include salvaging dense missions and the isk generated from items obtainable from various corporate lp stores there is nominally no risk associated with this activity at least if you are a member of an npc corp and no downtime some empire residents claim the actual figure can be much higher  30mhourlife in 00 is not insanely profitable in and of itself during my three years in eve i made most of my isk through importation of t2 modules to 00 and small scale select production mostly rigs i have earned a substantial amount of isk ratting though and am quite familiar with that activity i havent mined since goonswarm resided in syndicate and buy orders for zydrine were 4800 iskthe problem with 00 is most of the systems in it are worthless the gates and belts wont spawn rats with bounties above 950k if that high they wont get officer spawns and the asteroid belts wont produce the abc ores npc 00 has missions available but unless you are performing missions for a pirate faction there are few good reasons to do level 4 missions the low security rating differential payed in terms of mission rewards does not come close in my opinion to offset the risk either in 00 or lowsecin short if you were advising a player as to the most profitable career they could undertake in the short term youd suggest level 4 combat missions in highsechow we got hereccp made eve a better game they made warp to 0 and got rid of bookmark sets they eliminated the t2 bpo lottery they even eliminated the lottery of what rewards storyline missions offered and made every mission you ran for npc corps count for something by creating the lp store they added rigs to give players more means to fit ships they added half a dozen new regions the drone regions they eliminated the value of holding a handful of specific systems by largely eliminating static complexes there are still a few left believe it or not they significantly improved pos warfare for those who view it as a mind numbing slog today we once had towers with 5 day stront timers that would instapop an interceptor at 350 kmthe net effects of all of these things today is highsec is a more profitable place to live than ever before the drone regions and their resulting mineral yields crashed both high and mid end mineral prices eliminating npc shuttles changing ratmission loot yields and expanding the size of t1 unnamed module drops from 5 m3 to as high as 50 m3 sent tritanium prices through the roof mining veld in highsec in a hulk is reportedly worth 57m iskhour and thats direct to cargo miningdocking not into a jetcanmore relevant to this discussion the value of time spent ratting and mining in 00 has sunk enormously since i began playing in 2006 pirate faction module drops are now subject to price pressures from equivalent often better highsec navy faction lp rewards the contract prices on a shadow serpentis mag field stabilizer seem higher than those for one from the gallente navy lp store but the module stats are identical only deadspace loot has retained its value
the last time i mined in eve was in syndicate you could comfortably make about 20m  hour in an osprey ninja mining crokite assuming a hostile didnt come along and pop you or your jetcan i payed for my first ratting battleship that way running the zydrine up the pipe to empire in a frigate and selling it to 4800 isk buy orders zydrine buy orders are now in the 14001500 range thanks ccp and drone regions megacyte has crashed too but by my guess only about 50 compared to the 70 suffered by zydrine ive never spent much time in lowsec aside from transiting i never understood the appeal of losing sec status in pvp when you could do the same in 00 without recourse that said my view of lowsec is that its the worst of all worlds mid range ore mining crashed along with high ends the only thing lowsec has that highsec doesnt are level 5 missions and perhaps better access to wormholes from what i know level 5 missions arent particular popular but please weigh in if you have knowledge in that regard ccp did improve lowsec with apocrypha by adding some bs rats you could get faction cruisers there even back in the day i feel lowsec still has a long way to go to entice more than pirates and capital ship producers from setting up shop theresome words about explorationthis has been a great boon to those who choose to invest the time skillpoints and effort the days of fighting over static plexes are largely gone even though goons nominally live in delve today partly because of a disagreement over one of the few existing static plexesthat said should a player have to run around different constellations scanning for various sites in order to make a good living in 00 ratting has already been made more difficult by eliminating the ability to see npcs on the directional scanner you can even argue that high belt count systems are much inferior to say 8 belt systems because you cant easily check the belts for faction or officer spawns as a resultexploration while very profitable is best exploited by those who can play for several hours without interruption have taken the time to learn about how to do it efficiently and ideally work with other players or have multiple accounts in order to tank the most difficult encounters although there are many stories about running escalations across several systems that yielded nothing in the end i feel exploration as a whole is a largely well balanced activity today its just not the preferred activity for all
approaches to my solutioni specifically want to avoid nerfing highsec activities i dont have a personal issue with people who dont want to leave highsec they obviously make up the majority of players in this game and i dont believe it would be beneficial to the future of eve to force them into lowsec or 00 to maintain the iskhour they are accustomed to if you nerf mission running by say 50 then someones 6 month goal becomes a 1 year goal thats a good way to get people to quit the game while eve certainly doesnt need 300k more accounts to continue to be viable it wont do well with 50k less therefore my approach is how to make time spent in lowsec and 00 pve more valuable rather than time spent in highsec pve less valuablefeel free to rant about how eve would be a much better game without all those empire pubbies suggest how there should be no highsec at all and everything should be all lowsec00 all the time because eve should be a hard core gamers game and all that ill ignore you since this view ignores reality most eve players live in highsec and they like it that wayrattingratting as a means of income was made more difficult in late 2006  early 2007 when off grid npc ships were removed from the directional scanner prior to then you could enter a system and quickly check for officers faction or hauler spawns or even to just see the value of spawns currently up i suppose ccp felt this was too easy as i dont recall a specific reason for that change i dont have a big problem things as they are although it seems to me that around the same time or later the rate at which rats would warp to different belts seemed to increase this makes locating valuable spawns more difficult in high 15 belt count systems
the thing that makes most 00 worthless is its truesec rating outside of pirate sov npc space truesec determines the maximum value of bs spawns whether or not officers can spawn and to my knowledge the frequency of faction spawns lower truesec is better change how truesec functions and you change the value of lowsec and 00 space when it comes to ratting here is my proposal for that change breaking down the values into 5 categories1 lowsec  increase max bs spawn to triple 11m bounties essentially make all of lowsec roughly equivalent to what you can get in an 04 system today including any related increase in faction and hauler spawns2 all of 00  eliminate all spawns that dont have a battleship pruning cruiser spawns out of even perfect truesec systems takes hours and its completely ridiculous3 poor truesec 00 roughly 00 to 03  increase max value bs spawn to triple 14m4 fair truesec 00 roughly 04 to 06  increase max value bs spawn to triple 185 permit officer spawns basically the same as existing perfect truesec decrease max respawn time of a cleared spawn to 20 minutes i believe it is currently 30 min or higher5 good truesec 00 roughly 07 to 10  as above and eliminate spawns below 950k significantly increase triple or quadruple the rate of hauler and faction spawns decrease max respawn time from a cleared spawn to 15 minutes i suggest increasing the chance of officer spawns as well since ive seen exactly one officer in the 3 years ive ratted its hard for me to say by how much i would need information that isnt currently available specifically how they currently spawn whether or not its true they are more common just after downtime something which should be obviously be changed if accurate how long they stay up whether particular officers favor one region over another what  that spawn are killed etc
this is one part of the solution nominally macro ratters aka ninja farmers would stand to benefit the most from these changes by themselves ideally players should be able to improve the quality of space they hold for that reason i suggest the introduction of two new items1 spacial vortex generator  a pos module anchored at a control tower that effectively improves the truesec of that system by 04 basically one level that ive described above requires sov 2 fitting requirements  750k grid and 4000 cpu same as a jump bridge module requires a large control tower2 spacial vortex outpost upgrade  a permanent outpost upgrade that gives the system perfect truesec cost in npc goods 2 to 5 billion iskin addition to the truesec changes this would give incentive to hold and improve space suddenly worthless regions like fade might see a population increasewhat alliances stand to gain the most if these changes were made pretty much everyone except goonswarm the reason is simple most of delve is broken you can get triple 185m spawns in systems that arent supposed to generate them you can get officer spawns in virtually every system regardless of published truesec we knew this years before we finally conquered the region and its a big part of why we arent currently seeking to conquer other space its why an alliance of  5000 that formerly occupied 5 regions fits comfortably into two its also why you dont often see goon ratters in npc delve despite its perfect truesec as all pirate npc sov systems enjoy if delve were fixed as a result of these changes i would have no opposition to itin my view all of 00 and lowsec needs a big boost to bring it in line with the most stable lucrative pve activity  high sec mission running there are other reasonable ideas to fix what i see as a glaring discrepancy some suggest just increasing rat bounties others suggest they should drop tags which have to be sold at ded stations i like this solution the best as it gives the most benefit to those that hold space and would seek to improve iti have other ideas in mind to fix mining and 00lowsec mission running which i may or may not share in the coming week suffice it to say that 00 mining is much worse today than when i began eve in 2006 as are 00 missions in general
sorry for the alt in the middle
generally support that idea although i think triple bs spawns in every belt will net you too much isk considering loot and salvagepretty sure that this truesec rating needs to be looked at though i noticed this since i live in great wildlands and the ratting there is utter crap i think theres only about 5 systems with a rating of 05 or better like 10 that are better than 02 at all sorry no not in a 00 region it really feels like ccp forgot that gw is not an npc region like venal without chaining mining veldspar in empire would get me more isk for sure
youd have to chain a long while to achieve that i dont suggest making every bs spawn a triple spawn just eliminating cruiser spawns from 00 improving what the best spawns in systems will be and eliminating lower value bs spawns from the best truesec systemsfor those who dont rat  bs spawns can be single most people clear these double and triple
i support itatm anything below 04 isnt of interest to most people not enough profit to risk your ship
oh good god supported over and over and over couldnt agree more  i hate cruiser spawns
i support this even in delve with broken truesec it can take hours and hours of pruning garbage frigcruiser spawns with multiple accounts to get enough battleships in system to compete with high sec mission running then 15 minutes later some battlestars idiot comes through and breaks all your chains looking for faction spawns any 00 region without broken truesec must be completely worthlessi dont see why most of 00 should be less profitable for the average player than nearly risk free highsec space i think these changes could go a long way to fixing that problem with a minimal amount of work from ccp
im gonna support this on the  empire platform
supported 00 particularly poor truesec 00 really needs the buffin regards to a system full of chained triple bs spawns remember that you can still only kill them so fast and youre unlikely to be using a multibillion isk tricked out dps ship in 00 space
a goon with a good idea for balancing dang i thought i just quit drinking ah well have some support
how about a pos modstation upgrade that can give the sythem more belts or just give all 00 sytems a minimum of 10 belts
this is an excellent idea its a very levelheaded approach to acknowledge that many empire dwellers will never leave empire  just quit if pushed too hard
i like it a lot
first of all props on a well cosntructed op certainlly this seems to be the major issue in game balance right now and probably ahs been for a whilebut is a complex issue and for real analysis we lack hard data only tidbits have been released on economic reports and some posts by devs on the forum for example how much weight have the drone regions in high end minerals wasnt well known until a recent post in a md threadthere are a lot of factors on how much money you can make where and how all that is balances isk vs loot etc but the basic premises of the thread are right and things must be looked at as it stands 00 can make you a lot of money but is not very casual friendlly and the average player cant comepte against lvl4 mission running only the mroe hardcore players or those in advanced possitions alliance leadership or with nice regions r64s can have a very high income and then a lot is used on expensive stuff like poses capitals  crappi dont support the details as only ccp can know  balance it for example if you increase a lot the officerdeadspace spawns the items would decrease their value in the marketbut its time for them to takle this issue at once as is the most pressing one hence i support the thread for bringing discussion with ccp and i hope this is tied to the incoming sov changes someway or an other
a bump of supportalso make it so you can expand the eve program window to fit the screen
yes please those dual output on the graphics cards are there for a reason which is not only extending the desktop
i too thought that u would have 3 tiers of rigs with increasing bonusses at increased cost making it actually worthwile to rig t1 frigscruisers with cheap rigs and i even thought that idea was a bit silly but a lot better depending ofcourse on the quality difference between the rigsand yes if the salvage drops dont change drastically bs sized rigs will reach ridiculous levelssupported
not supported your desire for choice does not outweigh the commensurate boost to subbattleship pvp moreover reducing the barriers for entry into pvp for new players and empire carebears is nothing but a plus
new players dont desire frigate and cruiser sized warfare at t1 levels its merely a bridge to getting to better things most new players are in a battlecruiser in 3 weeks and a battleship in 5 i dont consider 35 weeks of gameplay justifiable for a complete change to the system there is and very well should be a graduated learning curve in this game learn the basics then expand you guys seem to want everyting thrown on the new guys at once and thats not a practical choice all it will do is overwhelm them with even more skills that theyll consider necessary and probably give them yet another reason to leave entry to pvp is to use what you can and learn that way the more you add to it later the bigger the bonus to coincide with your training rigs fall under an optional tag atm making them so cheap that theyre mandatory is not a good option for newer players who are already overwhelmed with other task i mean how do you even gauge a draback to a ship if youve never had time to experience the options available in the first place without those drawbacks
pay no attention to the people who deal with the markets on a daily basisassuming drop rates stay the same this will do nothing but bottom prices out of nearly every single salvage part out therehell every mission runniner and industrialist should be screaming for joy cargo expanders cccs and a few of the other carebear heavy rigs are going to be next to nothing here soon

supporting this one as well
this is a better reworkone thing i would like to add is something that could help the gms rather than just criticise themspecifically i am talking about penalties for players abusing the petition system
it seems the first maybe even second gm is actually an faq bothad that same person mysteriously know about issues then not know about them on other occasions
supportin dis also
sound like a good idea how would you go about this though x time between petitionsrework the petition system so the gms can notice an abnormal number of petitions from one person  regarding an issue could be useful if many people are reporting an isk buyer and i doubt a system like that is in place and what about punishments complete x days ban from petitioning warningand also how would you determine if someone is abusing the system what does it mean to abuse it guess if they publish a public rulesregs that would be there
snatch and grab from home topic
awesome stuff moon dogg ill organize it in the op later to condense all the ideas
noperhaps some more hard fast guidelines need to be in place especially with regards to reimbursement which should all be but cut out except in the most extreme cases at this point but for the most part petitions get answered within a timely manner relevant to their importancei realize x issue might be an issue to you now but that is slightly less lower on the service list than say someone who cannot log in because toon is stuck in limbo

im pretty sure that if only 10 of the playerbase would think before posting or writing a petition the load on the customer support would go down by quite a lotim also quite sure that if another 10 of the playerbase would stop writing silly petitions out of a wierd sense of vengeance for refused reimbursements of the past the load on customer support would go down by quite a lotstill im also quite sure that a new gm bible not just based on commonalities but on scenario policies and a few specialisation routing routines would assist quite dearly in providing a flexible but sound foundation for scripting support interactionseither way customer support has grown with eve over the past years and while severe and sometimes intentional screwups have been made ccp has always made the effort to grow with their own game eve is not a product which has had a smooth growth path it has had and always will evolve through sometimes painful growth spurts attending to that on a support level is a continuous game of catching up with a racing train on footpeople only friggin whine about horrible petitions and responses nobody hardly ever says wow cool or thanks on the forums so the picture people see is rather biased to negativity keep that in mind pleaseheck once upon a time long ago an array of mine swallowed a mothership in build months after the petitioned was opened it had still not gotten anywhere and ultimately the case was not resolved to satisfaction does that mean i have to write off the entirety of customer support no i can recall quite a bunch of other cases over the years where ive pretty much lit candles to thank for the effort the gms made
i think that this is a vast improvement good job sironly other thing i could ask for is that maybe the general tone is more of a this is what a part of the community seems to think maybe this is something that could be considered i totally agree with most of it from my experience but its all about approaching it in a way where its not a direct attack on the gm teambut very nice job otherwise
if you have seen idiocracy gm support on eve is similar to when joe bauers luke wilson goes to the hospital and the lady is doing this to figure out what hes complainin about

yup good one thanks for this sadly everytime i started writing this issue i wanted to explode the version i posted is like mk10 there are couple of more constructive ones but they were also more emo so i had to post something to meet the deadlineanyway good job there is couple of more things i could add but u summed it prety wellthank you one more time to you aswell to everyone else who added constructive posts

i didnt see this earlier but i have to disagree with the idea that boosting fixing projectiles makes all turrets the sameprojectiles dont need the dps of blasters the range of lasers or rails or anything like that what projectiles need is a zone of superiority as it stands there is no range except close to 2x falloff where you do pathetic damage where projectile weapons become the best option among all turretsfor instance if you set up a damage chart for the short range weapons you would ideally see three hills blasters should have unmatched damage at close range acs should do more damage than lasers at blasters optimal  falloff and lasers should start outdamaging acs before ac optimal  falloff three weapons three curves three zones of superiority sounds balanced rightinstead currently blasters have the highest damage within their short optimal acs have to be past ac optimal  falloff to outdamage them and lasers outdamage acs at all effective ranges there are issues with blaster tracking that have to be fixed but that isnt the point of this threadthree weapons two zones of superiority and the blaster zone is very very tight that to me is not balance or diversity and that isnt even bringing up beams vs rail vs artillerybut that digresses from the other point of this thread which is that the tempest needs work even if ccp fixed large projectiles the tempest would pale in comparison to the maelstrom or the typhoon a ship with utility slots is a thing of the past when ecm could be good on any ship when nossing was overpowered when ships had less hp those things were all changed for good reasons but the tempest is still a relic it needs a new role and i trust ccp to find one for itedit thumb up
currenty missioning income is pretty high for a empire job highest fixed income u can get from carebearing its not that i want to see that nerfed its that i want to see other things boosted unlucky those things come togheter currently atleast 40 of the high end ore comes from refined mission loot there was a post up saying that a few months ago i wonder why mining veldspar in emp is still more profitable than mining high ends in dangerous 00 removing loot will boost high end ore prices and make 00 mining profitableit would boost 00 ratting aswell meta items would be more worth in price and there would be a clear line vs meta 1 and other meta level items items could also be refined for mineral prices manufacturing would become more populair again industry would get a general boost and traders can profit from the meta price differation there is only 1 downside this would mess up eve as it is now and will make alot of carebears agrydiscuss
remove meta 0 drops entirely replace meta 14 drops with bpcsminerals should come from miners tbh
oh for crying out loudcant you people give it a restno for the 1000th time
expanding on thisi agree with the idea that minerals should come from miners waitaminnit im agreeing with malcanis i would support a well thought out change that removed meta 0 drops seriously what am i going to do with 50 mining laser is dropped bpcs for meta 14 and still dropped where applicable anything with a higher meta level and the faction implants that dropif anything this would see the demand for minerals rise though probably not by much and the supply dwindle some as well which would help rebalance the mineral pricesif someone wanted to write that up as a proposal id give it my thumb
actually at least last week mining plagioclaise was more profitable than veldspar from a strictly refine and sell standpoint the reason you see so many people still mining veldspar is becausetheyre like me and theyll mine anything that sits in one place long enoughthey need the tritanium for something also like me  i burn through it to the tune of 10  15 million units a week and im small timetheyre stockpiling in the hope that tritanium prices go back uptheyre too stupid to realize the market in eve is as fluid as a real economy because it is a real economyedit to add some space in the wall of text
thats an illusionthe economy is setup as gametake reprocessing for example any alt can reprocess stuff near perfectly in empire
you forgot to mention that any alt with skills can reprocess stuff near perfectly provided they have skills and no taxes in empirewith no skills they dont get perfect reprocessing they get a percentage of the whole wasted due to waste and a chunk of it taken out for taxes everyone knows thisthat is not a bloody illusion the market is fluid because its player controlled
it follows the same rules supply and demandthis is a long oustanding issue evidence by the fact that when loot stopped coming into the game in the same volume here in the last few months we saw a massive spike in mex pricesloot is a big part of the eve mineral economy
let me clarifythe eve economy is a close approximation of a real economy given that it actually does run on real life market principles like supply and demand with very little tweaking by ccp yes it is a game economy which is why we have asteroids that respawn and things like skill books seeded into the market because there are limits imposed by the game world but by and large it behaves in much the same manner as a real world economy
ccp emloy thier own market analyst because eves economymarket is that realistic actually not sure if they actually employ the guyhe might have been from a college but he was analysing the data and wat not
there fixed it for you and bolded the parts that needed fixing btw most mission runners that reprocess their loot usually use the materials to manufacture ships for pvp
he hasnt produced hardly anything that someone in the market discussion forum hasnt already known for quite some timeand this is from someone who has access to information beyond the players grasp
nail on the head drake
supported  also any boosters currently active on the podded player too would be nice
you sir are wrong
1 no matter what you change the pattern to it will always be easier to toggle visibility onoff2 i would support the keyboard shortcuts here otherwisenot really if the arrows didnt provide the ability to move a probe on a specific axis itd be impossible what youre explaining is already possible by selecting a side of a probe i dont know about others but its really hard to navigate probes using that method3 more confirmation signs are never a bad thing 
indeed these are goodif not addressed keeping a set distance ratio between the drones when resizing their range would also be great thus reducing their au radius maintains the same overlap in the probe cluster i dont see this being a major change and would reduce tedium for all
alternatively have the scan button be the only one on the right side everything else is clustered on the left
yeah theres a few pesky things i dont like about probing that im having to get around like the black fogspot dictating the zero axis if you call it that
did someone mention the destroy probes button which i dont believe anyone has ever been inclined to press since probes became recoverablehow about using the same amount of code to create that button instead get retyped to become a reconnect to drones button instead
apologies if this is discussed somewhere in here already looked and could not find itproposal use eminent domainstyle policy and exchange all existing t2 bpos for some version of fair market valuethe existance of t2 bpos make invention pretty much worthless except for small ephemeral niches im not going to go on and on with details to convince anyone its really pretty selfevident to anyone whos ever applied a spreadsheet to the issue
perhaps you should check the math on invention its far from worthless
actually invention makes t2 bpos worthless as t2 bpos only yield 2040 mil profit more a week or so due to no invention costs and other fees and t2s take years to regain cost of t2 unless youve held since when t2s were sold on marketbtw this is an alt your using right please say rightbtw is this a response to this thread
i wonder how im getting rich by doing invetion though too much clueless people talking about thisive a better suggestion just ban from the game all the datacores minerals whatever is free crew they are more harmfull than all t2 bpo combined together
the math is simple  there is no way for invented bpc users to successfully compete with t2 bpos researched to 3030 having the lottery for getting t2 bpos and then just ending it is one thing but pretending invention makes up for it and leaving the bpos in circulation is quite another
so if with bpos in circulation it is worthless to invent why not stop invention and invent something which there is not 2 bpos 
i am just getting into invention so i am just asking here  i have read the guides and done the math and it seems when it comes to ships t2 invention just does not pay  if i am wrong here i would like someone to explain but when i figure in the cost of the datacores and the chance of failure it seems t2 bpcs are barely better than breaking even and in some cases a flat out loss where i could make more isk selling the datacores  with almost 2 out of 3 chances failing it seem it could be easy to get burnt by an unlucky string of failures if you are dealing in smaller numbers  am i figuring something wrong here  and yes i am figuring all level 5 skills and a decryptor into the chance calculator  now ammo seems to be a different situation i am only talking ships here 
sure i never said t2 bpos were a great deal to buy else id just go buy one but they remain out there depressing prices independent of how much was paid for them i have no speculation on how many have changed hands vs still remaining in hands of lottery winnersand re datacores etc being free  of course theyre not thats why 4 millish for a t2 frig bpc is about breakevenre being clueless  i dont mind being proven clueless and thus being educated just callin it like i see itand i admit to possibly just being a little bitter about missing the lottery 
datacores are free same as decryptors cores are given out by rd agents and decryptors are found in exploration sites
datacores regardless of how they were obtained have a value  if the value of those materials consumed in the invention process is equal to or greater than the the value of the bpc that you might get figuring in the chance of failure then the invention process its self is not profitable  rd may be profitable and the manufacture of the ship may be profitable but those are separate ventures that need to be calculated separately if we are talking strictly about the profitability of inventing  when considering investing in skills for invention that is how you must calculate it in my opinion  the people here that are claiming to be making large amounts of isk by inventing are you not figuring the value of the invention materials into the equation 
and before the thread has been successfully derailed into an x has value regardless of how you obtained it thread lets go back to the topic at hand
of course they have a value never said they didnt but the fact still remains they are given out free by rd agents
yes thanks lets try to reframe this without worrying about where these things come from in the 1st placeperhaps the thing here is that i am focusing on smallmidsized ships rather than various modules or ammo but building frigs or cruisers from invented bpcs just really seems to be a loser relative to selling off the datacores and building materials required ie if you have all the datacores and materials needed invent and build a t2 cruiser or frig you are better off just selling them than actually inventing and building the item that just seems lame to me
im gettign rich at doing invention but forget about ships mostlly there are some which make money if you know where to market them no im not telling you which and wherewhy ships dont break even cause there are too stupid people who thinks stuff is free and first thing they will invent is ships this is not a derail this is the real issue and you cant hardcore intelligence on people t2 bpos cant cover 005 of market volume in any decent aka used item these are a nonissue if you are so mad about them go buy one yourself lets see when you break evengo remove t2 bpos and tell these who bought one for docens of billiosn to gtfo there is no such thing as fair market value for such things the sceew would be enormous just get over it eventually most t2 bpos will be out of play each time a bitter vet which owns one quits the game one is practically removed from the game a lot have allreadyseriouslly this is mroe trouble than anything else there are plenty of threads in the science  industry and md subforums discussing this go there for more detailed answers if you want
oh please not again dont blame bpo owners for your own failed market research i am getting rich with inventionoh and well not supported
honestly thats about what i was expecting so sorry again if nothing newhm the claim that t2 bpos cannot account for 05 of the volume seems flatly wrong t2 ship volume is not that high however it is true that i did not consider that so many ppl might be clueless enough about opportunity cost to be not accurately accounting their costs when pricing t2 ships functioning market models do require the actors to be semiintelligent i supposei would of course never be so prsumptious as to ask where or what on what ppl are producing but i am curious about an orderofmagnitude of what getting rich on invention means  ballpark isk  weeks just the number of 0s will do 
few bills per month
rich is subjective but you can earn more beat the billion per month mark net profit with a single char with some effort man i know you are angry because you didnt win one of these free t2 bpos been there done that you could be earning more probably but negative retroactive changes are allways a bad idea and have to be avoided if possible which is the casei havent run the numbers but im sure bpos cant cover much of the daily trade volume on any item including t2 ships have you seen the load of ships that are sold daily
first can you show unequivically sp that the existence of t2 bpos have an effect on the economy of eve or that their use in producing t2 stuffs have a significant impact on eves economy personally i dont see how they can so it sounds just like a well if i cant have one nobody should argument failsecond the existence of t2 bpos have zero impact on my invention of the stuff i like inventing and selling so those with the bpo make more isk in profit big deal i dont sell stuff that is already heavily on the market and i dont sell if the profit margins are too low so big freakin deal failthird for the poster who posted the this is an alt posting isnt it crap what do you care every friggin toon is an alt so please kindly stfu

no train learning and get some decent implantslast thing we need is every one thats able to collect the isk for a plex monthly to start using this to get 100 training bonuses and if new players had enough money in rl they could just keep buying plexes from ccp to turn into 100 training bonuses so within 2 months of eve theyd be in a half decent fit bs
one of the main things i love about this game is that mostly everyone is on the same playing feild no matter how much cash you have this is just going to turn it into another game where all the rich basterds get to flash there cash to overtake the genuine hard working playerbasenot supported
not supportedpsexpect a wardec for being a wow head
for the second time today i find myself agreeing with melcanis who has more or less been my archnemesis in the insurance threadbut i do this idea is a bad one dont get me wrong like a lot of the other people here i would love to train skills faster but this isnt the way to go about it
i say if someone managed to steal your unanchored pos and got away with it theyre awesome and you fail lol
or if in hisec get a corpmate or friend to sit there with an insured gank bs to kill anyone who tries to snag your toweryou have friends right
they make it take forever to anchor a tower becouse of pvp which i can understandbut anyone in any old hauler can fly on up to a pos while anchoring and put it in their hold and fly off and if you shoot them concord blows you out of the sky thats just sad
thanks for the well thought out reply there mate you must be a real valued member of your corpanyway the real point is not that it was stolen but that it should be flaggable otherwise you could sit there with a whole fleet of bss but if someone tries to steal it and you shoot them you are the criminal and get concorded that is just plain wrongi understand piracy my main is a pirate and a very successful one so im not an emobear just find the idea that a major crime such as stealing what can potentially be worth over a billion isk is absolutley seen as not a crime
that was already touch and go before ccp introduced t2 indies  i remember scooping up towers and sometimes that got a bit hairy when the owner had a suicider ready but generally speaking it was still easy to get away with it and alivethen t2 indies came and scooping up someones unanchoring pos became a matter of the fastest click really come in stick with it and sometimes have a guy extra in a bumper ship alongsideas much as i enjoy having a go at things like this and as much as i look forward to a resolution on the anchored pos parks in high sec floating away from their moons i have to admit that ultimately a guy who owns a pos has no real chance at allkeep in mind t2 indies are not the only method at our disposal and now that they can nicely use a covert ops cloak its even easier whats the pos owner gonna do bump us suicide us do the math on how many suiciders it would take to cover a medium pos and bumping is no longer what it used to be damn i miss the days of tiki and his bumpageddon so yeah id love to take the stand of the l33t ganker who is so ebil that he griefs just by looking at a post but eve does have an eye for risk versus reward as a pos thief the only risk i face is that of not clicking fast enough the reward is obvious as much as i dislike it i cannot deny that there is a point in the reasoning for criminal flagging without risk theres something not right under eves fundamental principles im not saying it is wrong but it aint right either
nothing to add but my support
many of those things will be added at the same time as the mechanics to support them get added  for example you can find proposals for comet mining floating around occasionally when that gets implemented theyll add comets if you want other astronomical features come up with game mechanics to justify them like they did in wormholes theres a limit on the amount of pure eye candy they can add and they prefer to focus it on things like ships for obvious reasons
ok i have one question for you why do you distinguish between pvpers and carebearscarebearing means to avoid as much risk as possiblepersonlally i think people warping into mission areas to kill the mission runner people suicideganking in highsec due to insurance pirates campig lowsec gates etcare carebears too garbage collectors ie people salvaging the wrecks someone else produced are carebears as wellwhere is the risk in klling a mission runner or killing a hauler if you get 90 of your ship reimbursed by insurance or in camping a gate with a few people and killing everything that comes through or salvaging in another ones mission in high secno risk there either sodont be too strict about pvpers  carebears because that isnt truemost pvpers and pirates are worse carebears who would never want to risk much think twice about concord if you can beat themtank them suicide gankers would have even less risk being able to kill more and afterwards getting back the loss form insurance againthe pvpcarebear vs pvecarebear situation must be assessed carefullyi am all for more risk but then for everyone riskfre pvp is sillymake pvpfits viable for pve and you got some basis on which a mission runner can defend himself against pvpcarebears but until then they are dead meat if catched and their only choice is to escapesarcasmlots of risk for the pvper ofcsarcasm
ccp decided that crime in highsec should be punishable by having the offenders ship explode how to make that happen is just one of two options the ship instantly self destruct or a slightly more rp friendly version of a police force concord showing up and then destroy youand thats all there is to it and hence why trying to do anything against concord is futile including suggesting changes
they dont need titans one of the concord frigates has 5 ddds mounted on it
ccppetitions heck im ready to petition the petitions oh wait did that already to
agree
tbh the best response sarcasm ive ever had from a gm on a petition is that a plex can escalate to only let you beplease visit your user settings to reenable images
right on
they could save themselves a lot of workload by not responding asking for information contained in the original petition aka read the friggen thing traininggame experience should also be stressed much more strongly in the orientationhiring phase because many gms clearly do not grasp basic game mechanicsand ive even had a petition time out due to lack of gm response after they sent me an automated one asking for info contained in original thats like weeks without it being looked attldr supported
gms r pros
do you think this thread might indicate a problembe a good idea to fix this before much else ccp a support crash could well equal a subscription crash
think wow gms will take care of everelated stuffz theyre half competent
they actually have quite a decent training system inplace for gms right remember seeing something about their support on tv

important link nuff said
let us not forget multiple gm not knowing pos sov mechanics when an issue was petitioned by wi another good example of gm lacking basic knowledge there
awhile back we had an obvious glitch in the game where a pos moved from one moon to another moon and was inside another pos neither pos could be targeted should someone have wanted to come along and siege that system we would have been petitioned for an exploitit took them 3 weeks to even respond to my petition about it after about 2 weeks i filed a stuck petition and a gm who was actually competent came in and destroyed the bugged pos for us it only took 5 minutesthe sheer incompetence in most of the gm staff is absolutely astounding only 1 gm has ever been useful helpful and knowledgable and i breathe a huge sigh of relief when they wind up answering my petitionssomething really needs to be done about this this is more important than the sov overhaul or even fixing my mothership
i just read through the previous pages and lamented the lack of constructive suggestions then i saw that lavista vista had the same view so without further ado lets think about what can be done to improve things for the frontline gmfirst let me say that  despite me being a 2006 character  i lack the indepth knowledge of eve mechanics to ever serve as a gm so if i say something stupid here i blame that 1 gm training courses on gamespecific areas for example a pvp b industrymining c pos d sovereignty corporations  alliances e factional warfare f wormholes g missionscomplexes h skills i standings j reimbursement k policies  rules l billing  account m marketsthe idea being that a frontline gm candidate would have to take one or more of courses like the ones listed above maybe they are a week in length maybe less 3 days content is prepared by senior gms and is designed around what a frontliner should know to head off a lot of the common incoming petitions for that subject area to get into that class a person would have to demonstrate appropriate knowledge on that subjectcandidates could take more than one course and  provided they pass a test  would then receive petitions based on what areas they have been deemed competent in ccp would then have a fair idea of how many gms were in each area and could up the number of gms in areas where there are heavier petition loadsone of the things that this doesnt take into account is how the petitions are distributed which i assume is automated2 stress the ingame help channelwe have one of these i had forgotten or wasnt really aware is it staffed by competent ccptrained individuals or is this a place populated by wellmeaning or not pod pilots who may or may not be knowledgeable in the gameregardless if the help channel is meant to be a true first line to head off needless or simpletoresolve petitions then ccp needs to make sure that it is populated by people that can answer questions correctly and that the pilot base is aware of it promo the help channel more in news postings messages above the login area etc3 dont file petitions on minor isues and gameplay questionsfine ccp should provide an outline of what those things are4 submitting the petition  give us a templateyes we all know that ze logs they show notheenk what information will a gm need should there be fields created in the petition that if left unfilled will not allow the petition to be filed will that just result in pilots putting garbage into the field so their narratives gets submitted  possibly probably  but if we know what basic things they need to know many of us will provide them we want our petitions to succeed afterall5 courtesy in the petition processi am talking about the language used by the submitting pilot here not the gm responses i have in my petitions never failed to use polite language to frame my problem and ask for assistance remember it isnt their fault that the issue affecting you occured and you want them to start their interaction with you on a positive note rather than on a negative one resulting from language that attacks or deingrates the gm andor ccpcontinued on next post
continued from my last post6 gm incentivesi am speaking from ignorance here so bear with me is there any type of incentive program in place for gms for example if you clear 80 of the petitons assigned to you in a quarter without bumping up to a more senior gm and with a positive satisfaction rating then that person gets a plex from ccp or a ship model or maybe a snazzy tshirt i have to assume that ccp has mechanisms in place to gather customer satisfaction data related to petitions so develop a metric that if met by gms rewards them for their hard worki used to do work for wizards of the coast and tsr inc before them and when we submitted our project the reward was x dollars in dungeons  dragons product if i look at the amount of time i put into the projects i did for them and compared them to the dollar value of the product i received then my hourly wage was probably in the 2hour range but i can tell you that i was happy as could be in getting that package full of dd stuff7 gm consequencesif you provide incentives for positive results there must be consequences for those that arent getting them that might mean a review of gm responses to see if it is a matter of professionalism a lack of knowledge failure to fully read and understand the petition etc or maybe it is just that the player didnt get their way and didt rate the gm well as punishmentbottom line institute a review process based on data collected from petitioners poor performance is either corrected results in removal from the category of petition where the performance is lacking or results in termination from the gm program8 the dreaded english barrierenglish is how most of the business of eve is conducted although a significant number of pilots dont speak it i realize there are options out there the german support option for example but for many submitting a petition in understandable english is dificult at best i worry that being unable to clearly impart what the issue is on the players behalf might result in petitions that are very difficult to address and close positively on the gms behalfi dont have any suggestion on how to address this but i think it is worth the mentionthese are just some ideas that i had floating around regarding the subject hopefully the csm can take these if they are worthwhile or develop their own suggestions that would help to improve the customer service side of the game
every time i file a petition i get the same gm and it feels like im talking to a robot who doesnt even read my petition but just copies and pastes whatever fits besti fully agree that low level gms need more training
some great points moondog i support the idea of better training gms but im sure theres already some sort of training scheme in place whether its all inclusive enough or effective enough may be whats in question here as that is an internal ccp matter i dont know what kind of effect this would have on them but i think theyd start to get the hint after 12 pages and im sure the posts arent done stacking up
strongly agree with moondog
personaly i dont have a that bad experience with the subject however i hear a lot of friends in huge fleet fight complain about server crashed or lag and then the weird stuff happenssometimes i want to petition a loss but then i think its only a ship ill use a new one and move on smaller ships and not capitalswith more expensive ships in bigger battles things are different and wars are decided on wrong gm careso improvement is always welcome thats why i support this subjecti also have an advice for vuk summarize the problem from time to time and add all the proposed soltutions or ideas this way ccp will get a clear overview of options they have lets help them instead of only complain and whine
signedconflicting definitions of sovereignity mechanics are a nightmare to sort out when you get different answers to differing petitions not confidence building

support this
agree from personal experience i have been given incorrect information numerous times relating to serious game play mechanics and rules effecting not only myself but specifically region wide sov mechanics
just a brief anecdote i recently posted a petition re a new station that i was putting up fairly simple question come to find out but the response i received from a gm was so far off target as to make me think heshe didnt even read the petition the answer had absolutely zero to do with what i asked ive decided not to petition anything anymore when i do get an answer i just cant trust iti support real training for gms and installation of gms that only play the game regularly and have substantial experience in the area they are supporting that includes my support for using real developers as gms and not just support guys
lar doesnt require a second player and the rep effect of a lrar can be removed by jamming
try to solo with rr and see how op it is
by designbalancedexactly how it should be
considering i havent played much if at all in the past two weeks and i despise station games on top of that i could safely say that isnt the case furthermore i could care less what happens to peoples ships when they dont follow the rules of engagementwhat degree am i suggesting i dont recall suggesting anything except there was no reason to use a local rep when rr is involved and im not thinking local rep needs a boost in effectiveness maybe a shorter interval but nothing more but rr does need a nerf how big the nerf would have to be i cannot sayas for jamming i dont think its that much of an issue if the ships arent significantly outnumbered running out of cap or being neuted is far more likely and hits local rep harder than remote rep because of the high activation cost oh and rr doesnt require 2300 powergrid its hard to reap the benefits of a lar when you cant fit onebut it looks like nobody but me sees the validity of my concerns so apparently everyone likes tedious boring predictable bs blobs that or people dont want to lose their security blanket
my mistake i thought you were involved in the priv blob that came after me contrary to what you seem to be arguing i think that rr adds quite a bit of unpredictability to engagements everything in eve has a viable counter and factoring in whether someone will bring rr in their fleet andor how much theyll bring set up in what way cap boosters vs rechargers tanked or max rr etc makes setting up your fleet a lot more exciting for instance my corporation and friends often mess around in jita looking for fights and frequently fight people who use multiple remote reppers to help them kill us on some occasions we bring ecm to jam out the rr on others we fit to gank through their rr occasionally we neut and sometimes we shoot the repper take away rr and you do a lot more than just boost local rep you take away a lot of variety and one of the main tactics that small gangs can use to fight larger blobs
remote reps in large fleets are prevalent simply because you can focus a significant amount of repair on one ship to counter very high incoming damage far more than is possible with a local rep particularly important when working on a gunned pos at close range for examplethe natural counter to this is ewar and consequent breaking of the collective spider tank added to this vulnerablity is the increased complexity of managing broadcasts and general fleet skill required to coordiante the remote reps effectively
not supported imo systems is well balanced today if you want to solo pvp i suggest you look at garmons movies
this is why rrs already have an inherent advantage they dont need ridiculously low fitting requirements to be competitive with local reps
privateers solo pvp i think they love stations too much for that
wait privateers complaining about remote repspot meet kettle
im so glad i recently joined privateers for roaming hisec wars and with the added bonus of nobody taking me seriously my main problem is with the amount of local performance vs remote performance in relation to the power required to utilize such performance in every other system there is a simple rule the more powerful the module the more power must be dedicated to it if rr is to fall into this category one of the following conditions must be met1 if rr is to remain more effective than a local rep it must have higher fitting requirements than a local repor2 if rr is to remain with substantially less fitting requirements it must also be substantially less effective than a local repthats all there is to it the possible drawbacks of rr do not invalidate thisotherwise whats to stop someone from rigging an rr into the internal of his ship and pointing the emitters at his armor plates it would certainly be better than having a lar equipped
i am concerned about 2 issues first of them is the fact that hyperion and maelstorm do not have a spesific purpose that would make them significantly better in any spesific area then a megathron and a tempest acccordingly lets look into spesificsshield resistance bonus is usefull in 4 cases passive tank buffer tank active tank and spider tank in all those cases it is applied in fullshield boost bonus in grater by 50 however it can be used only in one case personal repair and the only place where that is usefull is mission running in pvp you use buffertanks most of the time in sleeper ratting you use remote repairs that means that the bonus is frequently rendered useless i whant to propose changing the bonus so it affects remote repairs as well that makes ships with such bonus usefull for pvp and sleeper ratting as they can be used in remote reps but there bonus is larger then resistance bonus as it cannot be used to umprove buffer tankingit makes sence due to 3 resonslogical armor repair and remote armor repair is same proses subsistem that improves armor repair will improve remote reppers as well its same proses no matter if nanites are repairing armor on this ship or are sprayed on another ship and repair that ships armor gameplay armor resistance is usefull in 3 instances buffer tanking active tanking spider tankingwith proposed changes armor repair bonus will be usefull in 2 instances active tanking and remote repair 3215 that is why bonus is 50 larger additionally currently maelstorm and hyperion lack some love this will seperate there use from that of a tempest and megathron and make them worth there heavy price tag
oh and why only gallente and minmatarcaldariamarr got ships with rep bonus aswell
you lost my support right thereme thumbs down
nothis would defeat the whole random chaos of wspace was intended to be
please tell me this is a troll
big hell no this would be the start of the complete occupation of wspace by alliances we have enough gridlock in old 00 we dont need it in wormholes
nowormholes are about discovery and are in a constant flux this would just make wspace another boring fixed location
you have 00 for that and if you cant access 00 to try it because any intrusion will result in a jumpbridged fleet from two regions away to wipe you out then youre starting to understand why this isnt a good idea 
did it occur to you that wspace is uncharted and location unkown at bestwithout a fixed location and a fixed destination you cant possibly establish a jump gate systemso maybe you should spend a little more time thinking about the mechanics of the game and less about ease of useim sure it would be great to link wspace with other bases but that would make it too easy and bigger alliances would overrun wormhole space not that they couldnt anywaylets not bust the damn up eh

yes just four little things spring to mind1 always count to 10 before going nuts it will save you a lot of trouble and it will prevent people from discarding you as the next caod alt who is not to be taken seriously ever2 the perceived troubles of customer support in eve really is a knife which cuts on both ends if you look at the amount of scream posts from players whining and ing like little uneducated kids one starts to wonder about how petitions are even used by players in other words in a system where one side is battered by an extreme load generated by the other side you cannot just whine and  that one side sucks you cant even say that the system sucks without realising that you the player are an equal contributor to the sucking of the system at the same time nobody is in a position to make any decent judgment or even comment without knowing the ratios of success versus fail support cases and their corresponding timelinesplease keep in mind that seeing the good side of things is rare since we humans only ever say something about the bad side of things3 account managers are always bad they are the bane of customer relations and create some of the worst possible structural problems in customer support not to mention they are often an overly large part of the payroll simply through sheer numbers what ratio to use can you guarantee standards can you vouch for clients to work along equally professional can you afford a payroll with a 30 budget for account managers crap the challenges of management with the obsolete money sink of account managers in client support relations can go on for days on endyou use account management tiers for sales for any post sales process it is only ever worth it in the prospect of growing sales not perpetuating sales one of the rules of enterprise level management a level which ccp is rapidly approaching4 and another simple case really the risk of once again opening the door to social engineering outweights any imaginary benefit of person to person customer support relations but hey since you always scream maybe you are one of those who enjoys building close relations with people so they get to like you and cut you some slack here or there or maybe give you a hint or tip

this thread needs a lock op is simply using the place as a steam valve as opposed to constructively bringing an issue forward arguing the case providing relevant information exploring alternatives  etceterayou know use the assembly hall for what it was intended for not a personal whining platformyes case sucks petition is your support mechanisms since this topic is a simple whine take a pick from a number of existing and properly mapped topics to put attention on the matter for example the thread on customer support in general or the beforementioned topic on the voting issues take a pickjust dont pollute this section as well k tnx this is neither gd nor caod
i brought the issue forward constructively thing is ppl only respond to the loud stuffi suggested that users have account managers instead of faceless gmsi think theyre actually using a chat bot this doesnt seem like a real human and the same person has responded in the past with knowledge of the issue now forgets that they know how the problem works
have you looked at your own posts by any chance lets be honest you just ran into a problem in game ran into a junior gm following his script and instead of being a little professional and courteous with the usual patience skill required you just blow up next you run to the forums start typing wierd word and letter combinations and expect personal assistance because you shout a lotlife will get a lot easier once you realise that people work better through professionalism and not  screaming alrightand now after exploding and making the assembly hall once more look like a personal ing game you try to spin it off as a normal means of handling problemsdid your mother ever teach you to count to 10 before exploding saves a lot of problems in life

sure but if i was losing the station i would dump all the minerals in space around the station so that they would become a hazard for navigation damaging the ships every time you dock or undock and would be almost unrecoverable needing something like a gas harvesting ship and a lot of time detonate all the stuff i cant move away doing it in the most damaging way possible  went all the oxygen and water reserves so that the new owners need to replace them destroy all the computer and heavy machinery i can destroyso that the new owner would get a almost useless wreck and probably would spend less time building a station from scratch than repairing the old station that probably would be full of booby traps too yes after all that the offices would be freely available from the first second could be a nice idea for the walk in station expansion

oldish thread but completely supported most of the arguments against are i dont want to use it well then dont its optional i for one would pay a couple bucks to know that nobody else can access my accountsigned
firstly ill confess to actually not having read all of this thread although the first few posts were very familiar for these mature forumsto the security brigade that dont want the extra level of security and believe that any hacks are purely the users fault this is amied at you guys1 you dont have to use it well done i worship you like the internet gods you show yourself as2 the real point now lots of people i guess play eve on shared family machines its a fact of life not every family can afford multiple machines in the household for every family member so while my son  wife are browsing the web and installing whatever  they can i can safely log into eve using my dongle safe in the knowledge that whatever they did will not affect my login that should be enough reason in itself for an extra level of security
there are ways even described earlier to implement this without putting objects within objects entirely avoiding the db issue alltogetherfirst what does it take to flag a players ship to be unseen invurneable and view locked on the carrier of captain xsecond the status of the carrier is just a matter of returncalls from the carrierobject easily used for the players locked docked on captain xs carriermsa simple barebone docking version could simply be no more advanced than the docked and flagged as mentioned above and easily reflagged back to the carrier xs position when leavingcarrier dcs or being forced out by the captainnothing is impossible
completely support this idea i think that motherships are long due a buff and this would do it just great also carriers being able to carry a couple of bs pilots would not be too badid probably have it so that the pilots were docked as though at a station could see the carriers status ie shieldarmourhullemergency undock would take 30 secondsif any pilot logged off in the carrier they would be ejected and warped off if the carrier pilot logged off all ships inside the carrier would be ejectedif the carrier is destroyed all ships inside would be destroyed and all pilots podded this would add a good bit of risk to the whole endeavour
i support this if only for the hilarious prospect of having a carrier loaded with a billion frigattes protoss style
i am not in support of this as it would remove the value of using a clone bay on a capital ship right now people mostly use them to get their character from one location to another i think 90 of the use would be removed if someone could just dock any ship into a carrier and achieve the same thing without needing to have room of creating another jump clone plus you would get to keep your implants and use them at the destination
theyre not used anyway
i like the idea a lot
agreedbefore delve war iii i ratted many hours in systems like grj8b with truesec just below 05 iirc the spawns were  unsatisfying you were pretty happy about 12 mil double battleship spawns forget about triple 185 or factionbsspawnssupported tho you are one of those who cast me out there
this needs to be done that or take off the timer on clone jumping so it easier to buy a new ship if your unlucky and fail than having to spend at least 1 day in highsec doing lvl 4s if you sec status allows it
i think that nerfing mission payout will not even really work at nerfing mission payout the number of mission runners would be reduced lp value would climb some of the lootsalvage would climb so in the end probably the net change in reward would be small for those capable of running mission fast teh only people to suffer would be those new to level 4 missions while not absolutely positive i think it was changed because of complexes and missionsit was too easy to scan a complex to see if the keyholder ship had spawned and too easy to scan a missioner to see what he was tankingnaturally now you scan the wrecks and again know what a missioner is tanking so probably that was a secondary reason cant recall any dev comment about ratting and directional scanner while i vaguely recall some comment about the above mentioned two points and about lag using the scannergood post by the op and the above comments by slave note that those md information are about a problematic period for meaningful statistics mid august to mid september we would need the same data for other periods of the year i am not totally convinced by the solution the op proposed too few data to really evaluate them but 00 and low sec rewards need some tweakingchange even if i feel it is right that the largest rewards in 00 are at the alliancecorporation level and not for a single pilot so i support this discussion
this is definatly an good ide to improve the iskhr gain in low  null sec without destroying all high sec players game
agree with this very well though out
despite the op being a goon i support this idea
reduce empire isk faucets and the problem sorta fixes itself
i dont rat but i wouldnt mind seeing 00 and lowsec profitability increase for everyone
something really needs to be done about the imbalance highsec level 4 missionrunning represents in contrast to other activities in evemost cogent well though out proposal ive heard
this is the most wellwritten well thoughtout post ive read in this forum or any other forum related to isk balance and it takes into account a lot of the real world issues that people face competing with level 4 high sec missionsvery much supported low sec and low end null sec need a boost rather than simply nerfing level 4s again
i expect ccp will make some fixes to 00 as part of this next expansion but i am worried that they will move too slowly and too incrementally some major shifts are warranted i think alchemy fixed this in part by making there be more potential personal moons that arent filthy lucre enough to be alliance controlled but are still worth enough to pay for a subscription but still there needs to be a rethinking of reasons for people to be in the belts in 00
jawhol commandant
supportedi mostly rat in low sec because high sec gets too boring too quick adding bs spawns to low sec made ratting viable but i know i could make much more isk without risk by missioning in high sec

a better presentation of the issue than vuks your proposed changes sound broadly reasonable and like theyd fix a lot of the problem of course theres limits on how good you can make a customer support centre but there is room for improvement and these changes would likely be serious improvements supported
petitions can be escalated by players why not by gms
this i dont know how many gm answers have been copypaste or have had petitions deleted without any responsethese days i generally just dont petition anything unless its to troll or for sg since i dont expect a serious answer anyway
supporting this more measured thread we the player base dont have enough information about the gm team or their procedures to judge where the problem lies or what needs to be done but i think its clear from the response here on the forums that something needs to be doneoh and to address one specific point raisedtheres nothing wrong with copypaste messages if used appropriately anyone who thinks differently should try responding to a couple of hundred emails containing the same question  and consider how much time you want the gm team to spend on reinventing the wheelof course prewritten responses doesnt remove the need for gms to read the initial message and make a judgement about how to handle it and it sounds as if some of them need to be reminded of that
supportedand by the way locking the other thread with 14 pages of replies in support here
i agree with redsplat and support this issue redsplat is a cool guy
what i really want to see is a gm operation that does more than ctrlv our logs show nothing to petitionsfailing that replace them with trained monkeys to do all the pasting of nonsense answers and spend the savings on more devs
but they need a well deserved spanking they got it coming for em your too nice for my liking 
supportedand it has to be said that moon dogg is top dog
thanks for pulling my posts from the locked thread over i was afraid i was going to have to repost them here and for today that is just too much effort long day at work so farpeople are stating that we dont know enough about that gm and petition system to formulate an educated response and they are probably right my ideas are from the viewpoint of a very barebones approach to customer service
woo
this i have always felt my replies were satisfactory even when they didnt agree with my requests as pointed in other threads it is only logic that some reply is cut and paste if the gm had to write a personal reply with different wording every time he get the same question it will lose a lot of time for nothing adding personal has a cost we are sure we want to bear thatand the op calling that there is is the usual methodology to say i am the representative of all eve players i have lost my faith in the gm so all player have lost faith in them no the op and vuk and some other people have lost faith in the gm but that dont make them all eve
i would love to see an integrated battle recorder similar to what battlefield does but only for your account and not everyone like bfsother than that i dont support or not support the topic informing a company of your dissatisfaction with services is fantastic and the response here shows that many have had less than happy times with the gmshowever i am more concerned about the reason for so many people having constant communications with the gms which is the feeling i get from the other thread is it technical issues that if resolved would be better served fixing the technical issue and stopping the gm contact issue by default is it a time thing having had my share of dealings in this matter patience is a virtue many people simply do not have or is it something else
i support this thread
i agree that we dont know enough about the actual process to make useful comments on how to improve it but that being said i think one of the big problems is gms not reading all the way through some petitions i personally have never had any problems with the way petitions work and have had the majority of petitions i write turn out in my favorive had 34 ships replaced by ccp over the past 2 years and i believe the way their ship reimbursement works relatively well as long as there was an actual problem with the game that being said the only complaint i have on the way the petition program works right now is the time involved i petitioned to get my ship and implants back after losing shippod to the gate jump desynch bug i got the implants and ship backminus dropped modules but it took a month to get this straightened out now i can understand that there were probably thousands of similar petitions but 4 weeks for completion of a simple bug related problem is too long changes need to be made to the petition process to not only have more informed gms responding to petitions but also to decrease the time involved in resolving the petitionswell thats just my 2 cents hope people take the time to read it and sorry for the wall of text
i second this
i have lost most trust in gms i have to escalate everything in order to be dealt with fairly if i get one more answer that states our logs show nothing i am going to screami understand the workload but ccp should understand my subscription fee when game mechanics fail like the do quite frequently in eve there needs to be a dedicated and understanding gm corps to pick up the peices and offer helpi have run into gms that were very professional and i appreciate this i just wish it was the majority instead of the minoritygv
bump agreed
i support this thread still think vuks was best lack of ccp response  nothing in these posts to copy and paste
i fully endorse this product
supporting this but ccp wont change anything
very good
nice work
i think 360 last i counted people even though most were mm and vuk alts and what not saying they are displeased with the gm crew to the point that they dont file petitionsescalate all of their petitions even if i used an hyperbole to accentuate the problem a little my point is still viable also the whole point of this forum is to represent the eve player base  if you got so much support for it i would believe many other less outspoken people are just suffering in silence
this is starting to remind me of old style goon threads on caod
signed the senior gms are on the ball for sure but the first line gms are brutal we should all just use one default prescripted response requesting an escalation until the junior level gms handling petition learn their business everyone appreciates that ccp is trying to reduce the time it takes to handle complaints but getting them resolved properly should be prioritized now
supportedspecifically regarding the problem of abuses in the petition system the number of threads ive read where carebears and some pvpers promote filing false or fraudulent petitions simply to gain an ingame advantage the most notable example of this is mission runners petitioning to get their missions reset after they through their own fault lose or destroy the mission item rather than admitting that it was their fault they claim the item never spawnededit i cant spell
lol agreed  seems like too many thumbs up too little opposition and constructive criticismideas but atleast we got all of mm behind us no

ok  i will post again but im pretty sure ccp will find a way to lock this thread too
and weeks later you got an answer
i agree masha i lost a chimera to a bug in our old alliance and many people agreed i should of got it back and now my recent lost of a heavly tanked ship to a single frigate rat they cant explain and so far they will not esclate to senior gm been 2 days since i asked i 100 supprot this
nothing to add
the animosity of the playerbase towards gms really boils down to copyandpaste  bot replies the myriad of mostly lagrelated issues that lead to our logs dont show that responsesfix the lag and you fix most of the second issue i know this is being worked on and i have enough technical background to fully appreciate the issues in hand since some of the issues are inherently unsolvable without major changes to the codebase it would be nice to see some effort made towards working around the desync issues caused by the lag thus generating petitions or at the very least helping provide feedback for the logs when these conditions occur if you cant fix it make it easier to clean up afterwardson the point of testing gms at hire this may not be possible im sure a number of gms are in the us office by now from what i understand in many states hiring exams are forbidden because as any american knows every test of every form are always racist but thats another flamebait topic what they could do though is test after hire to weed out the incompetent and provide remedial training if they dont make the cut after that then they can be ditched easily if its a workatwill state

worst idea ever and im a big time miner lol1 these can never be in lowsec theyd have to be 00 only2 miners will be in hulks you expect hulks to assume control of these guns within the belt interceptors can fly faster then a pos gun can track them but can definitely kill a defenseless hulk so whats the point even if you didnt have a gang of fast ships your guns couldnt track attacking you hulks have no defense so any even crappy gang will be large enough to quickly pop each hulk trying to assume control of guns before those guns could do much damage to a gang specifically since any decent roaming gang will have logistics3 mechanic wise this is a nightmare youre turning a belt into a pos by the time a miner chugs along over to get in range of a gun to control theyll be long dead so theyre still going to have to safe up and the mining op is disruptedso in conclusion since the idea is idiotic its also pointless and wont accomplish what the op was wanting to do anywaythe sad thing is a csm actually thought this was a good idea and put it on a meeting agenda there goes the last shred of respect i had for csms
interesting idea
the current insurance scheme is significantly flawed it provides an artificial mineral price cap as well as a massive influx of isk it is a very blatant form of wow style handholding and it provides yet another reason for the bigger is better attitude this is what it looks like nowuninsured  40 compensation wtf is this5 premium  50 compensation10 premium  60 compensation15 premium  70 compensation20 premium  80 compensation25 premium  90 compensation30 premium  100 compensationthis yields a 4070 insurance for a ship that will be destroyedso basically you have an insurance policy that pays out 21 isk you provide in addition to an unconditional 40 compensation the compensation doesnt reflect market value but rather mineral base prices market value of ships are far more often than not significantly lower than mineral base prices this can cause the net loss of a hull to be as little as 510 the loss of the hull is less than the loss of the modules most of the time not including rigsi dont know about the rest of you but id like to see ship losses actually mean something by reducing the base compensation amount to 10 and reducing the insurance payout rate to 32 it will hurt significantly more when you lose a hulluninsured  10 compensation5 premium  175 compensation30 premium  55 compensationthis yields a 1025 insurance for lost hulls far more than what is warranted for a vessel that you know will be destroyed within the next 3 months people might be more hesitant to form bs blobs when there is risk of substantial monetary loss and smaller vessels might actually help to defend their bigger brothers
not supported it would just mean more carebearing for people or selling gtc for the mattermost people want to enjoy pvp if you reduce insurance payout privateers would just get more smacktalking and station camping as you got atm alreadywaiting for your next idea 
oh noes people will have to work for their isk oh and it will also mean more small vessels as for selling gtc that will always be a factor but there is a threshold when a person decides it isnt worth it most people want to enjoy pvp but many dont myself included pvp has become nothing more than bring your biggest boat and the majority of camps ive seen are bs blobs that have little or no tactical flexibility napfests blobs focus fire rr pos warfare etc make pvp boring for the umpteenth time please stop comparing me to people who camp 44 mbalm has a high presence in minmatar space far from the 44 camps if youre in minnie space combat is probably your goal so please could you base your response on the merit of the issue and not the alliance tag that someone hasbesides when people who lose their industrial to a camp its not usually the ship hull theyre ed off aboutstealth edit supporting my own idea
not supportedproof of your foolish notion  try insuring a freighter or an orcaregardless of whether the ship is more likely to get into a combat situation sooner or later all ships get blown upinsurance has some problems but what your talking about is wholly so far in left field its laughablein case you forgot insurance covers the basic average i think cost of the shipnot the fittingsammo or rigsparticularly when it comes to tech 2 modsand even then insurance can be completely blown out of the water just by sheer market pricing alone hence the freighterorca situationgood intentions wrong ideanot supported
actually if minerals were closer to their base prices insurance on capitals would work exactly the same as it does on sub capitalsits just that the cost of capital ships is broken up so that 30 is in trit and 30 is in mex which because of depressed prices which is another topic in and of itself of other minerals keeps these two floated lofty despite the massive amount of mex coming in from loot so the cost is inflated over and above what the base price is
not quite that simpleinsurance is a big cause of inflationwithout insurance prices of ships would come downatm prices for t1 ships are held in place by insurancemeaning bad players get to grind less than they would have too otherwise and good players have to grind more than they would have too otherwisepersonaly i would like to see insurance be free at 80 for the first 6 months of a characters lifeafter that no insurance at allthe major reason why eve pvp is a rush compared to single player games is you stand to lose the product of your hard work if you loseinsurance kind of waters that down and provides mechanics to make lame meta gaming tactics like suicide ganging possibleeve would be more intense without insurance
with all due respect and i do sincerely mean that  o  insurance being the cause of inflation is a little hard to stomachkeep in mind insurance is mostly a black hole an isk sinkholeevery time i coughstupidlycough lose my battlecruiser or battleship insurance doesnt help me do jack because of all the fittings and rigs oh sure it takes a good chunk out of it but insurance is not the causemanufacturing costs vs market prices vs player greed isthen your dealing with the argument that i got thrown at me about renewing insurance platinum levels when its due is a waste of time when you honestly cant afford to lose the but cant afford to not use it for the sake of incomenot everyone in eve is rich or well off which really urks me when you get these damned idiots posting saying that removing loot and taking away mission running nuiances is the main source of incomegot news for you morons some of us are not that goodi still make more money mining but it gets boring and i go mission run and in all honesty theres not much to be made in mission running even with salvage unless im doing something wrong i barely make 10 to 20 mil an hour when i get done with a level 3 or 4 at that ratei think inflation is caused by many factors i scarcely believe insurance is one of themi do like the free 6 months of insurance but that could be abused big time by many pvpersagain maybe im rambling here but somethings amiss here when you blame inflation on insurance

i support ccp looking in the mini problemthe last poster brought up my original thought about this topic a while back with having different engagement ranges but with how eve works this just cannot work with 3 gun systems that easilybelow are suggestions on how i think this problem can be helped most suggestions based about solo and sniper fleet work because the phoon is better at gang work and maelstrom fills a few roles quite nicely i think its a mix of a lot of small changes that fixes this issue rather than a few bigger changes or single changes to 1 ship firstly minmatar ideas just dont work great at a bs level just like amarr ideas dont work that great at a cruiser level i think this unbalance is good balance within the game just not at the degree it is currently in comparison to the rupture and hurricane which are the most like it 2 utility slots with 12 guns less than other competing ships it has more shields than armour which is opposite of those two ships swap this around and maybe even bump it up a tad to be inline after the  based hp boosts race that uses falloff doesnt get extra fall off for using a higher tier dont nerf other tiers boost the middle and higher tier the other races higher tier guns get too close to our fall off advantage with their damageoptimal advantage more cap usage for pulses less fall off for both blasterspulses gives the tempest more reason to fit neuts to counter amarr and helps against gallente if you can successfully kite them more drone bay to give it utility drones so it can use what i needs in the situation bandwidth is fine higher cap regen to help sustain the kiting and repping more speed and agility to help bs kite a bit easier does less mass give it more acceleration as this can be the big problem with bss needs a tad more pg allows it to use bigger guns and arty easier allows it to use high pg reppers compared to lower pg plates and use those rigs for extra damage mods or falloff join current tempest bonuses in to 1 bonus and give a small fall off bonus this makes it better at kiting which i feel is the missing role mini have on a bs level i dont really want the tempest to be another tank and gank bs raw ac damage while it does do more types of damage and can change if you know what your attacking it is still lacking in general oomph compared to amarr and gallente didnt compare caldari this is even worse if its a longer fight and you counter in reload times at minimum a 5 increase is really needed here its hard to justify too much but when the idea is for us to fight in fall off we need as much dps as possible so we dont loose so much artillery does need help i will leave this to others as i havent done much with sniper fleetsmost of these ideas could all be done and i feel not overpower the tempest but in reality a few of these together would give the tempest a better role and i think overall balance the guns types a bit more the tempest is still going to be fairly low on hp and because of that would always suffer in a close up slug fest most of these changes affect the tempest the most while the maelstrom gets a bit more falloff using higher tier guns and maybe a tad more dps it doesnt break it at all for the phoon its not very noticeable slightly more dps but normally uses fewer acs than torps and generally the lower tier so wont get any bonus from high tier fall offi dont think fixing acs and the tempest can be done without nerfing amarrgallente slightly amarrs big negative is high cap consumption yet really this only an issue on the abaddon as the geddon gets its cap bonus i feel this negative while decent isnt enough given their huge range and dps advantage numbers wise i have not generally given any as i have written this up fairly quickly with a little bit of eft chucked in would be great if someone could chuck some of these ideas into graphs and how it would affect stuff
continued from abovealso would ccp feel the need to balance all guns types if they did this or would balancing just large be enough i feel only larges need to be changed as i love the current balance we have with frigscruisersbcs against amarr y
all well thought out concerns its been issue identified by ccp just never had any solution supported
the issues identified by matting do give me pause to think if the minmatar ships are supposed to be hit and run why cant they really do either in the bs field i know that the typhoon is supposed to be one of the highest dps ships and once youved trained all the skills it can be pretty good in point blank gank rr outfits because its terrible armor wont let it live long enough to outdamage other ships even if its orbiting closely at speed which can fail badly if your enemy webs you or uses a neut in the same vein the tempest could be the minnie bs hit and runkite ship but at the moment it just is not fast enough nor does it have enough damage to really do that role another one thing the tempest could do well is spidertanking except that rr shield repping is less than optimalminnie bs really need a revision

supportedi wont type a long story except to say1 in the game balance thread where players listed the top 10 minmatar bs  caps  weapon systems were heavily voted upon needing rebalancing2 in the ccp blog of comparing bs they were surprised as to why so few people flew minmatar bssummary minmatar needs a little love whether the fix is to ship hulls or weapon systems or removing the stupid split weapon systems or minmatar always fight in falloff which is 385 dps at falloff lol mechanic or alternative mechanics i dont care but they need something

t2 bpos are fine removing them is worse than keeping them
this idea has been brought up before and never acted upon however id like to say the most reasonable suggestion i ever saw was to replace all t2 bpos with an equivalent bpc having enough runs for a full year of constant production
not supportedbefore invention t2 bpo owners are charging too much waahafter invention t2 bpo owners arent charging enough waahthe truth of the matter is that the ones driving down t2 prices to levels unprofitable for inventors are the inventors themselves and its for exactly the same reason as why t1 manufacturing is unprofitable some idiot comes along mines his own minerals for free collects his own datacores for free gets his bpcs for free uses his poss labs for free writes down his failed invention jobs as free uses manufacturing facilities for free and then puts them on the market for free at a stupid discount to preexisting ordersdone right an inventor can produce many items in the same time a t2 bpo owner can produce only 1 thanks to the fact that invention will yield multiple bpcs to build from in parallel a smart inventor will be able to make say 10 units at 5 million profit in the same time that the supposed gameruining t2 bpo owner makes 10 million on one unittl dr invention sucks because of inventors
they depress prices only for those items where the demand is inferior to the production of the existing bpobut removing the bpo that allow low cost production of those item will not make them competitive people would simply move to low cost namedfaction versions of the same item instead of paying the invention costsnote that t2 module bpc waste dont apply to the t2 material but only to the asteroid ores so production cost isnt so different the only real extra cost is the invention process
i will borrow secnes words about the sale of a hulk bpo
the pricevalue of the datacores is dictated by the most rewarding form of inventioni have recently redone my math for some common t2 module with bpo and i have got as high as 70 gain after evaluating all the components and datacores at the best price between minimum sell price or higher buy price as i checked only what i can already build probably some item give even higher returns1 character with 10 production lines checking sporadically the market and counting as profit only the difference between selling all the components datacore bpc t2 components minerals ram t1 module named module used in invention and using a success percentage slightly lower than the real one about 15 billionsmonthpeople checking constantly the market for the best module of the moment will surely make more as i have occasionally noticed modules that would easily double that value but i am lazyusing all 3 alts from a account you can easily get more than 4 billionsmonth with little workplus what you get from buying the components at low prices and selling them in the from of the module at high price that can double what you get but the extra income is generated by trading not directly by inventing
me reattatches ass which fell off when laughing hysterically
i bolded the wrongest partplease compare margins on hics and hacs to see why
ok so maybe i overgeneralized from a few pointcases ill keep filling out the spreadsheet with more items and see where that takes us yes the spreadsheet precedes any actual building to whoever poopooed me for not doing mkt research thanks for talking the time to comment even those of you who were slightly flameesquesad if the bad prices really are mostly due to inept cost accountingbill to bill12 a month well not bad if thats supplemental but im sure not switching careers  space
for 1 character spending less than 1 hour day doing that and including only the net profit from invention if you include the profit from the trade part buying lows cost component it get at 23 billions doing it in a lazy way use all 3 character on your account and you will make 68 billionsmonth using 2 hoursday it scale well with the number of characters doing it you dont need to put your buy and sell orders more than once and a single inventor can produce enough bpc for all the characters the other characters only need to log in start 10 building jobs and leave
i think this number is far away from the truth lets take the example of the high demand item 1mn afterburner ii a single t2 bpo builds around 650 to 700 items per month sold items in heimatar in july 3287means a single 1mn afterburner ii bpo covers around 20 of the market in heimatar most regions have less throughput than heimatar a few have higher throughput supposed there are still 10 to 15 1mn abii bpos in use noone really knows except ccp i would guess 10 to 20 remains a valid number for the whole of the eve universethis is a considerable factor on the market in my opinion but is it a factor which could dictate the price or even destroy inventionfrom an economic viewpoint no but there might be a serious psychological effect for instance t2 bpo owner places a big pile of items on the market for a price which is profitable for him but not for an inventor who has higher costs inventor isnt cool enough gets nervous and undercuts the price next inventor does the same and so on they better would wait until the bpo owner had sold his stuff which would be the case after less than a week according to the calc above after that the market would be clean of bpo produced items and the inventors could sell for the price they need for the rest of the monthin my opinion only the economic viewpoint should be taken into account if we think about removing t2 bpos from the game not this psychological argument if it exists in reality at all thats a problem of the inventors not of market production supply and demand itself well undercutting to death and not considering the real complete costs is a general problem anyway also for t1 production not only for t2so finally i would still follow your conclusion  well i replace nonissue by not a big issue
the benefit of t2 originals is not in cost profit or even production scaling invention is in most cases quite capable of outperforming blueprint original production through scalingthe benefit of t2 originals is in their higher efficiency in purpose defined production for corporations and alliances less altmanpower required for maintaining production in a process which requires quite a bit less manual interaction t2 originals are a very useful asset for any group of people who focus strictly on a limited set of objectives in game for example fleet pvp as there is much less need for altmanpower and those extra stepsdoes that overpower matters i doubt it remember people scale just as easily as assets in eve and while t2 originals do allow for a much more streamlined supply process invention does provide the same output result the extra work can be mitigated through delegation and teamworkbut do t2 originals still have a place in eve since the days of the lottery are thankfully over in a setting where ultimately they remain isk printers with lower maintenance required as invention and where the majority of t2 originals undergo a centralisation process over the years bottling up in a select few places maybe maybe not the only one who could really make a justifiable statement on distribution ownership purpose and output is ccp more accurately the economist and his data mining team id love to see such data but without that data any player judgement on the good the bad the ugly of t2 originals is like sticking a wet finger in the windi like the eminent domain angle though that would be the perfect angle to take should it ever come to a value exchange  removal but i doubt it ever will
i support this thread because i believe the game as a whole needs a hard or soft reset
t2 bpos are absurdly expensive to buy for anyone so their actual utility is greatly diminished by having to sink that much isk into one in the first place the lotto system was hell for everyone we can all agree but invention still is not as reliable as it probably needs to bei believe that t2 bpos should be able to be seeded as loot from cosmos or explorationarchaeologyhacking as very rare finds as named module bpcs are if that can not be done thenmy proposal is instead of t2 bpcs we are given blueprint templates which in turn can be modifiedme pe runsat great cost mind you but they in turn would be able to produce a bpo with the attributes you have researched in the template the bpo would not be able to be researched though only the template the template would also only be able to create a number of bpos before it is broken apart the bpo would be copyable of course like they can be now but invention needs to be more stable before anyone believes this would lead to spamming of t2 bpos remember that it would not be immediate just like how t3 production is still getting off the ground to stand on its own you dont see everyone flying a t3 ship now do you
yes but take in mind there is an initial investement cost or even if you won it in the lottery a cost of opportunity not selling it attached to the bpo so it works that way tooif the owner does not take in account this investmentcost of opportunity is as fool as the datacoredecryptorcrapp is free crewprobably 05 was an exageration and made up number but yes we dont know how many of each t2 bpos are ingame of them which are active or producing all the time a lot of these are being collected by rich alliances because are good foir internal production as said by someone else in above me etcim not sure and i cant tell but i doubt the impact of bpos is that high funny enough items with bpos around make more profit than others which dont have them
since invention prices have dropped and the resellers have the market cornered and i agree that most large alliances and corps are now using there bpos for restocking there own membersthere is no reason to remove bpos from the game as it would then drive prices up as invention would then be the monopoly
hm its not comparable in my opinion a bpo is an asset its like a share on stock market and the isk you make with producing from this bpo is like dividends you get from this asset you can always sell this asset perhaps with loss perhaps without loss perhaps with profit in case of t2 bpos i believe the latter will be true over time due to the increasing rarity and collectors effect well you could consider datacores and other materials for inventionproduction as an asset too because perhaps you can sell it a month later for a higher price but they have no dividends on their own as soon as you inventproduce your asset is consumed and its value is completely converted into the invented bpcproduced item selling it now for a price less than the costs of the initial asset is a pure lossso actually i would consider the investment costscosts of opportunity of a bpo as zero perhaps even negative and only compare the costs of production materials for the bpo producer with the costs of bpcsdatacoresdecrytorsproduction materials for the inventorproducer the latter are always worse of course the bpo owner has some tied capital which he could use for other maybe better investments but thats not the same like costslets say if you have the iskies and if you dont know what else to do with it it is always a better decision to buy a t2 bpo and produce from it than to invent you only need to be careful not to get ripped off with a bpo price you can never resell it forwell i dont take into account the possible total bankrupt of a t2 bpo asset which is ccp decides to remove them from the game or convert them into bpcs thats the biggest shareholders risk

terrible idea
troll im sure butare you ing insane
well there seem to be two issues then1 large alliances have a monopoly on moon minerals stretching from r64s to r32s and theyre apparently snapping up many r16s as well2 moon scanning is currently  well  tediousaccording to evemaps fountain has 59 r64s and a total of 4849 moons having an r64 run dry and a new one respawn elsewhere makes perfect sense but having to scan 4848 moons to find your next dyspro moon one doesnt even if it took say 30 seconds to warp to each one and scan it before moving onto the next it would take over one and a half days not at all idealthat said moon scanning could easily be revamped to support the despawning and respawning of moon mineralsassume many years ago back when the stargates were first built the pioneers of these new systems ran preliminary scans on all the moons these scans were all logged on a database and offered general information about the moons such as their density mineral makeup etc suddenly you have a way to filter through all the moons in a system constellation region or the universe that could possibly contain a particular moon mineralif for every active r64 sources there were 5 dormant r64 sources that would make for just under 300 potential r64 moons in fountain in the case of your precious dyspro moon youll end up with 60 potential candidates of course it makes things a bit boring and still rather static if you know your next moon will be somewhere in the same region as you if moons respawned within 2 constellations of the original moon that could make things more exciting with possibly less moons to scan but the possibility of a moon popping up in another regionr64s may respawn every 3 months r32s every 6 months r16s ever 9 months and r8s every 12 months atmospheric gasses could remain staticthe 3 month period may not be 100 spot on though the moon may last 3 months UFFFD2 weeks also this would be 3 months of constant mining if a corporation is mining for 2 months and then 2 weeks off itll still have a month of mining remaining before the moon runs out information on how much more mining the moon can take before despawning would be shown in the pos manage screen scanning a moon would merely tell you that a mineral is present not how much time it will lastthis ultimately should help reduce the monopoly on moon minerals that the major alliances currently have if your dyspro moon runs out and you find a new one has popped up in the space of a close ally what happens next do you ask your ally to let you mine it or will the ally want it for himself it could help to break down the epic nappage that has spread like a virus through 00 as friends break ties over r64s that were once under one sides controleven worse if your dyspro moon runs dry and a new one spawns in the territory of your enemy what do you do your enemy might not realise that your moon has run dry and be completely oblivious to the fact that an r64 is sitting in his own sov space if you launch an attack will he let the system go thinking it is worthless or will he get suspicious and start scanning down moons suspecting that you might be after a new r64the whole idea is an unusual case though though it would help to make the eve universe a more dynamic one i can imagine the major power blocs being against it because theyll lose their license to print isk as a result maybe some alliances will look further and accept the idea as a challengeyes its a major change and it may cause t2 items to bump up in price a bit but the economists in eve are always complaining that there is too much isk in eve either you take the isk away from people or you make items more expensive maybe they will support this idea i dont know
moon mining monopoly is badbut the moon itself is not the problem methinks id be more inclined to think its something elsewhat that is dont know but making moons respawn and move and shift would be game breaking at bestnot supported
ive heard people say this but i still have yet to hear an argument from most as to why
try the amount of effort it takes to anchor a pos and take one down never mind the territorial flux that would resultsurely you thought of thathell im not even in 00 business and i see that clear as day
part of the whole idea is to make 00 more dynamic and the territorial flux is an intended side effect with alliances hunkering down putting up outposts in every other system well end up with alliances unable to find contenders to their space yes fights will be had but theyll be bigger blobbier and laggier as the participants reap the rewards of their license to print isk and smaller and newer alliances will be unable to enter 00 without sucking up to the superpowers only making the battles even bigger blobbier and laggier just look at bob where it wasnt until a disgruntled director disbanded the alliance before they were toppled what if it becomes this way for every major power bloc in eveyes the pos mechanic is broken as are titans and outposts so i guess there are a whole string of fixes needed in 00 but spending half a day every 3 months to move a pos isnt really that bad in the grand scheme of things especially if its going to make you billions every week of course if an alliance had 90 r64s hed be moving one every day but thats his punishment for being selfish and not sharing his moons
allrght nice to see an rational response to my troll shotso ill concede to your reasoning and tilt my hat at you sirbut it still stands youll never get this off the ground with the current 00 mechanics along with poss as they areso well just have to sit and wait
im sure theres a fairly lengthy explanation out there but it doesnt really make sense why minmatar who typically get an inherent 10 em resist on tier one ships have it on armor rather than shields on ships explicitly designed for shield tanking see maelstrom cyclone possibly nag nowthis is sort of beyond the versatility argument insofar as these ships are intentionally made to shield tank unless you want a no damage wonder of an armor tank on them with a whack of ewartldr fix the bonus on minmatar shield ships
there are already lots of shield tanked matari ships with really high em resistsnot supportedps if you get that through i want a decent base em resist for caldari t2 ships p
shields operate on a standard 0204050 resistance armor operates on a standard 10253550 resistance plus a 10 racial bonus the problem is not with minmatar its with shields they dont get a 10 racial bonus and have no 10 em resistance i could support the reworking of stock shield resistances to include 10 to em in addition to a 10 racial bonus however what youre asking minnie ships to be the exception to the rule is not the same as what i think needs to be done so i cant support it
this
uh you must be confusing minmatar with amarr or gallentelast i checked minmatar as a majority are shield tanking shipsim surprised no one else caught thisthat or they where busy correcting you on the current mechanics on shield resists  o p

reply and new topic are to close together 
i already know this is going to get flamed horribly simply for the subject matter but wardecs as they are currently are impotentplease note i am using the term corporation in place of alliance in many cases where they will be mechanically the same problemaggressor wardecs fuzzy carebear corporation or alliancefuzzy carebears leave the corporation have their corporation leave an alliance or surrenderaggressor does not get his pew pew pew he does however get slapped in the face with the wardec fee he paidfuzzy carebears laugh and continue raking in isk safe in the knowledge that the game mechanics protect them from any reasonable expectation of unconsensual pvpsolutionwhen the evil griefing aggressor declares a wardec the following happensthe wardec does not go live for 24 hours after corp or alliance mails go out informing all parties of the wardecincluded in the mail is the terms of the wardec specifically a surrender fee decided by the aggressors when they order the wardec paying this surrender fee at any time before the wardec goes active or during the wardec causes the war to be invalidated immediately and informs both parties of such via evemaila surrender fee can never be more than 5 the number of individuals in a corporation in millions eg a 10 man corp couldnt be set a surrender fee of more than 50 millionif an alliance is wardecd the max surrender fee is calculated by the sum total number of characters in every corp that is in the alliancea wardec can continue for at most a period of 7 days after going active after 7 days a wardec invalidates itself the victim corp cannot then be wardecd by the same corporation until 48 hours have passedif the surrender fee is paid the victim corp cannot be wardecd by the same corporation for a period of 2 weeks as part of an agreed concord enforced ceasefireif an individual leaves a corporation that has been wardecd a part of the surrender fee is immediately deducted from their personal wallet this is equal to the total isk in their wallet as a percentage of the sum total isk in all wallets of every member of the corporation applied to the value of the surrender feethe isk thus deducted is placed in the corporation wallet of the aggressor corporationif an individual leave a corporation that has declared war then the same tax is levied on their personal wallet but with the exception that said isk pays off part of the surrender feeif a wardec is made consensual the victim corp can set a surrender fee of their own if a wardec is consensual the tax levied from personal wallets goes to the enemy corporations corp wallet in the case of alliances this is the consequencesvictims of a wardec can either fight stay in corp and avoid fighting or leave corp and have concord protection from violence for a minuscule personal costdeclaring war on small noob corporations isnt profitableit wont be possible to perma dec corporations with the same corporation due to the surrender fee being paid and the 2 week immunityconsensual wardecs become a battle of attrition where there will be a clear winner in terms of isk this is especially true in case of larger corps being beaten by smaller onesan alliance or much larger corporation declaring war on a smaller one will become inadvisable as the victim can make the dec mutual and set a much higher surrender fee or simply wait for enough members to leave the hostile alliancelarger corp until the surrender fee has been paid for them given the differences in size this shouldnt take long
they say supporting your own topic is the thing to do
better than a lot of wardec changes i dont think these solve the fundamental problems but they do clean up some of the annoying side issues im worried about automatically withdrawing money from peoples walletsgoing negative isk sucks but most of it is reasonable enough tentative support
i agree with herschs comments about the auto withdrawing of money from peoples wallets a better solution imo would be to have the wt status follow the individual untila the war dec ends orb 7 dayswhichever period of time is shorterthat said it is a better idea than most for fixing whats wrong with war decs id like to see the idea mature some though before i give it my supportsome things i dont particularly likemax timeframe this should be longer than 7 days i agree there should be a limit but i think 7 is too short especially if your target has for instance multiple high sec poss youd like to take downone other thing i would like to see implemented as part of this change no new members iow neither corporation can swell their ranks with pilots looking for some free pew pew once the war starts no new members can be added to either corporation or alliance until its done
im rather set on the automatic isk withdrawal fleeing a corp that has been wardecd should have consequences and hitting someones wallet is the only consequence everyone in eve can understand and for a lot of highsec dwellers the only measurement of success in this gamenegative isk does indeed suckbut if individuals were not put into negative isk they would simply transfer the entirety of their liquid isk to an alt then move it back after jumping corporationwould the following amendments make for a better proposalthat characters under a month old cannot have their balance reduced below 5 million isk in this manneryounger characters despite the percentile based nature of the deduction may stand to suffer the most from fleeing a corp simply due to the fact they have less isk invested elsewhere that can be liquidated to prevent a shortfallthey also would have problems with negative isk that older characters frankly wont5 million is more than enough for a month old character to start making isk again as a mission runner or margin trading hell i made do with far less when i started playingafter a month its not fair to say people will have problems recovering from negative isk due to the percentile nature of the deduction and the hard limit on surrender fees stick up a thread maybe someone will pick this general issue up for next csm and use an amalgamation of threads on the wiki topic im wary of creating a situation where people might decide to dec corps purely to prevent people from leaving corps without penalty esp if you know an individual is leaving a corp and that he has the lionsshare of a corps profitsim also in favour of lightning war and a week is short enough that ccp wont lose subscriptions from diehard bears a is also long enough that good industrial corps will either hire mercs pay surrender fee or fight a weeks reduced profits makes these alternatives more attractiveif you cant do serious damage to a wartarget corp in a week then your corp has issues that an extended time period wont mitigate muchagreed that would make an nice addition and prevent a number of issues currently but i would favor having a situation where people could join a wardecd corp but only in the 24 hours before the dec goes liveill have a think and will very likely make some changes based on feedback but consider the op a solid proposal

i agree with this unfortunately its just about the only thing in your post i agree withthis is pretty much tripe what youll end up with is that ideas backed by alliances get passed and those that arent dont thats called an oligarchy and it generally disenfranchises the masses that feel like their voices dont countand no to this as well there are times when those responses are perfectly fine if i agree with the ideas and arguments presented in the opening post why shouldnt i just support those ideas instead of wasting everyones time gushing on about what a good idea they are i mean seriously some of us have other things to do than read general buttkissingthis is probably the worst suggestion in this post so if were not in a large corporation or alliance we dont get a say in how the game is changing go look up the definition of the word oligarchythis isnt a scientific debate or a solicitation to legalfinancial advice if the op doesnt know what hes talking about it will be painfully obvious to those of us who do and well be more than happy to point out his errors in our own postsi take back my earlier assertation i also agree with thishaving known players mod other players is asking for trouble and a customer service backlash if the forum needs more moderators let ccp get moreand i also agree with this  but id add that id like to have that thread occasionally responded to by ccp reps in a general sort of way so we can at least keep up with that theyre actually looking into

no supportimo you are trying to invalidate this game mechanic placed in game by ccp by targeting the weak side of the pirates namely their wallet making isk as a pirate isnt as easy as running l4 missions  however as with any game mechanics you always have counters  hiring a merc to defend you paying the pirates to stop aggression disbanding fighting back this is a pvp game you knowalso your suggestions will only make the griefers more zealous in their quest for carebear tears while us legitimate pirates who make isk from wars will have to find another way to make isk how about we remove mission running from the game or make people pay concord a tax to look the other way when you engage poor minmatar rebels while doing amarr missionsto be blunt this seems to be another ill formulated ill thought out thread in the ongoing question to ban any pvppiracysandboxyness to nullsec and making highsec a fairy lala land for carebears to run missions
while i agree that war decs need fixing this is not the way to do it the war dec system exists for a purpose and while it does get misused a lot i cant agree with a proposal that essentially reduces it to she who has the most money wins
you cant be serious right to even consider this the cost to cancel the war must be ridiculously huge and it should go to the people who declared war
contrary to popular opinion people wardec people because they want to shoot them and blow them upnot because they want to get into a bidding warnot supportedwardec system needs a total overhaul this is the worst solution to that problem
i support the ideai mean wardec defeats the purpose of hi sec if ppl want to pvp go to lo or null secleave us in hi sec alone to mine and build ships so others who want pvp do it away from hi sec
i will make the possibly unfounded assumption that you are not a trollwar decs dont defeat the purpose of high sec they are supposed to be what insures that new corporations can take on existing ones for the resources of a given area
im going to assume your new to eve online so listen up kidhigh sec is supposed to be safer not safebut im not stupid enough to assume high sec belongs only to the carebearshigh sec is simply that higher security but not maximum security thats for sure as helland that is why this will never come to pass nor will the extreme polar opposite eitherthere will always be a balance struck or there will be none at all
there is some merit to discussion of revising war dec fees concords interventionetcbut this is definitely not it

this topic really should get closed since there is a new and revised thread with much less emo and far better argumentation supported by the original poster of this thread
locking thread to consolidate threads please continue discussion in this thread
the fact that the game mechanics dont allow it remember realism is only one factor and a secondary one at that you could make the same argument about remote sensor boosters or remote eccm but nobody claims those are too good the reason people like rr is because while you dont need a 50k scan res tanking 50k dps is quite useful people use rr because it scales up by fleet size and is the only form of tanking to do so not because the individual module is more efficient
dont forget that if you fit one or more rr youll have to drop weapons on certain ships cause they use your weapon slots moreover youll lose a mid slot as well cause youll want to fit an eccm module to prevent hostiles from breaking your rep furthermore that rr will be running a long time whilst repping your friendlies thus if were doing a battles that last only 15 min youll be using a lot of cap thatll only go into helping other players
yes they do modules that require people to work together should be far better then modules that do not in addition to that a high slot is worth aloton many ships thats a gun youre not fitting and on others it means not fitting a neut or something similar

well what do you think would be the best if you want to bring a heavy tackling frig instead of a fast oneceptorthe ceptor uses his speed and a low sig to envade damagewhile the higher speed also makes him more likely to pin a target down im not intending to make it as survivealbe as a ceptorfor pure sigspeed tank but a bit stronger in this areas to give the ship a better performance in tackling by making it easier to stay under the guns this wouldnUFFFDt change mutch in the end if you get neuted focused by a droneswarm or webed with multiple webs
i know what your saying but i think the vengeance very strongly needs a second damage bonus i think it should get a rof bonus for rockets to make it into a little sacrilege combine that with actually fixing rockets and it would be a very nice little shipit would be nice if the venge could go about 3kms though but then your trying to muscle the jag and wolf out of there niche

yay thread derailmentignorance is a lack of knowledge im fully aware of whiny waitstaff arguments for tipping1 youre right because i prefer to be paid what im worth not have to rely on the pity of people im hauling food and drinks to2 i can afford to tip and i do tip a minimum of 20 for those who earn it with superior service and you know what if you consistently go to a restaurant and consistently tip great service and blow off bad service people catch on3 they have to admit to the tips first before they can pay taxes on em how many waiters can you name that only claim tips that are paper trailed via credit cards i can name well every waiter friend ive ever had4 insults get you no where in a debate youre ugly obviously youre all about mandatory gratuities and cashing out since pretty waiters get tipped more often and in higher amounts
it would be nice to see at least some activity on this issue from ccp
eve online uses wwise since apochribba but you still have to properly code for it
already in gamethey are called rigsif you pretend there is people in them your wing men may think youre insane but im sure youll feel more confident in your and your crews abilities
not supportedi would love to see more realism in the game but this solution isnt one i support
very coolwould make eve feel more like a scifi mmorpg and less like a space simulator id would love it
since were all agreed that more dps  good and that consideration of game balance is bad i would like to propose a 300 damage increase for sentries for sentries to have their own 25 m3 drone bays and the introduction of doomsday sentries
seeing the highly sarcastic response you got it is apparent your proposal makes sense why the hell are sentries the only t2 racial drones that dont require racial specialisation but you overlooked the effect that applying the specialisation skills to sentries would have so i suggest implementing your proposal as written and additionally nerfing t2 sentry drone damage so that racial drone specialisation iv the requirement will restore it to its current level and rds v will give a small boost cant say fairer than that
supported it would create a reason to train amarr drone spec too
noand supported op
supportedalso i support the idea of doomday sentries
yup t2 sentries are definatively way too easy to train for atmand they also most certainly need to be moar goodersupportninja edit dd sentries are also welcome needs rds lvl5
only if sentry base damage is nerfed by 510
actually dhowever i agree with op ive been looking into buying a character but all the names just make me emo please allow me the ability to change the name of xxamarrpvperxx to something that doesnt make me want to kick a puppyedit forgot to support
but kicking puppies is fun
i agree more pos designs would rock could i suggest 3 ideasone could be where you ahve to create the catacombsbase work of hte ship first sorta like hte atlantis citey ship in stargate or the huge command ship that was hte super stardestroyer from starwars and like then the extra stuff like corporation officces docking arrays and research facilities etc are built around and on top of it appropriately to keep it clean then they could require it to be docked in orbit over a moon for it to function at full power for either production of it or shields to balance it out and this would sorta look cool and clean allowing someone to pilot itthe second idea is sorta better like individual ships can be constructed and devoted to a specific purpose like a research veessel and it either works on its own in flight or you have to dock it to other ships together and have them weilded together by the superstructure while parked thier to function at full power that way it would be easier to have individual bases pop up since the power could be integrated into a single structureor whatever you could just have a huge space station that sorta hovers thier with giant laser beams protecting it like the deathstar whatever loli just like to day dream but yea maybe someone wil lilke those ideas
ok say to beat this further into the ground you have a new type of ship bigger then a titan a base ship its basicly a giant hull like massive sorta like wide and yet also long and spread out and then you could start with that then you could like install generatorstowers of varying portians that would do the fuel processing etc and then you could have other sections which would be sorta standard thier would be like weapons ports sensor arrays support structures docking bays and perhaps even like outer hull areas to accept motherships to land ontop of and bind ontop adding its abilties to the base ship perhaps even allowing titans to join upetc perhaps maintain the huge pos shields though but only allow em to function when synched in a orbit
this is what the titain was ment for but ccp couldnt do it saying that these ideas deserve a topic of there own they cant just be droped on top of this idea and expect them to float well also it might be a good idea to format the text a little better thanks for the ideas though oh and bumped to page one
the csm will bring this item to iceland and discuss with ccp possible options to amend the situation see the csm document on evelopedia
how bout confining this activity to wspace then
so i need a password after i put in my passwordwhat goods a password if you need the passwords password to submit your password for authentication of the passwords passwordheres an idea dont try to make the game companies responsible for customers stupidity if customers cant take the common sense approach to computer security then they deserve to be keylogged hacked cleaned out and banned
i agree with the ops assessment of the situation but not his solution isk is plentiful enough in the game as it is without simply printing more of itben
cant believe im agreeing with a goon
youre not going to believe this but some guy who lives in 00 and rats to earn isk is on the forums saying that ratting in 00 should be buffedcant imagine why hed be saying such a thing though
support for this
no support to this boo to further consolidation and enrichment of existing 00 powerblocs through yet more pos construction but i strongly agree with your analysis and the first part of your solution lowsec and 00 need to become richer the biggest problem with your solution is that it makes mining an even worse choice for a nonmacro player loot would rule the economy but again on balance i support combining the first part of your proposal with a proposal to reduce mission loot while keeping mission income the same by increasing mission rewards and i would enthusiastically support
not supportedenough money have 00risk  home system always blue look local noobswhere is the most valuable minerals where is gas where is commander items wich have billion isk prices  in 00 nowhere else so please stop the cries
heaven forbid that fighting over conquerable space should have some individual benefits for the players involved lets all stay in highsec and run infinite l4s forever instead
supportedi think its telling that despite living 99 of my eve life in 00 i dont make money there i have a neutral l4 mission runner alt that i use to make my money ive done straight comparisons and the money available in l4 missions at no risk to yourself is unreal relative to what is available to the average player out in 00any talk of 00 having tons of money because of moon minerals is stupid the average player doesnt have the money or infrastructure to run a profitable moon mining chainusing officers as an argument is probably the worst counter argument to this yet officers are just a big lottery your chances of finding one are one in a million and if you do there is a very large chance youll get a crap mod nobody wants rarely does someone find a dracliras cap recharger or one of the other multibillion isk mods for that matter with people realizing its really dumb to spend the money on that stuff to put on a titan or mothership that is just going to die if it gets tackled anyway the demand for those crazy expensive mods is dwindlingratting is the best way for the everyday player to go out and spend a few hours making money in 00 the problem is that its simply not as profitable as the risk free l4 mission running available in high sec if you have a well trained raven character and another alt to loot and salvage all the wrecks you can make a crazy amount of isk between salvage loot mission rewards and rat bounties
lets see would i rathera log in run missions for 2 hours and make 50m iskorb log in spend 6 hours clearing trash from belts in my harbingerfighters combo and still not make 50m isk
supported
i wish ratting was more profitable
agreed
absolutely supportedid like to piggyback on this with the idea that faction mods should have random variable values that could make them a little worse or a little better than their lp store equivalents would put potential value on them and make them a bit more interesting
hey look a cogent and well argued idea based on the simple premise that greater risk should bring greater reward lets do that
i am supporting this because it has always been my argument that risk should reflect rewardempire mission runners have no reason to leave highsec newbie corps they can make as much if not more money than any 00 player with absolutely no risk periodmeanwhile my ratting system sees roaming hostile gangs as high as 4070 people roll through it on a daily basis hello triumvirate brick squad and leguina romanaplease fix this

in highsec you never have to stop mining or ratting if someone comes into local in 00 you do in highsec you never have to worry about your mining ship getting blown up or your mission running cnr getting ganked in 00 you do these have drastic affects on isk per hour not to mention if you do get ganked your iskhour plummets to compensate for a new shipafkmining veldspar in highsec is safer and more profitable than ninjamining high ends in 00 gas is worthless because drugs are used by a tiny fraction of people and the logistics to manufacture drugs is obscenethe drop rate for officer spawns is microscopic compared to the number of people living in 00 the average ratter living in nullsec may well never see an officer spawn for the entire time they play eveand yet nullsec players have to constantly live with fighting for their territory while you merrily pilot l4 missions in empire with no fear of safety most nullsec players spend a good portion of their time defending their homeland instead of making money which involves gasp losing ships and therefore money and when they do have time to make money they have to put up with options that are worse than l4 missions in highsec or multiboxing veldspar mining hulks why should nullsec players be forced to endure the stupid pos grind and fleet fights only for mediocre money making opportunitiessupporting this heartily a buff is needed for all nullsec players

you should probably read the op before you try responding to it
yes clearly the merits of an idea depend on who is proposing it
ill support this because id too would like to see true security status fixedid also ask that you add one thing to your change faction complex escalations never escalate to systems outside regions inhabited by that faction ie gurista complexes having this stupid habit of escalating to systems out in drone regions
the only part i disagree with is increasing the chances of faction and officer spawns the main effect of that would be to crash the market for faction items and reduce the reward for finding such a spawn which does nothing to make 00 ratting more attractive as it puts us right back where we startedinstead make the spawns bigger theres a current cap of up to 6 rats per spawn with up to half of those being battleships although very occasionally the rats are bugged and put two spawns in the same belt but theres really no obvious reason why for the higherend truesec this couldnt be increased to 8 or 10 or even more andor with the only half battleships limit removed warping into a belt and being confronted by 10 angel seraphim or blood popes would not only make 00 ratting more lucrative it would liven up the experience significantly
i dont like the spatial vortex generator idea though im not able at the moment to articulate exactly why i feel that way the other measures i would support along with a measure to have the client display truesec without needing to consult a third party application if nothing else it would expose the more broken regions in both directions and increase the likelihood that they get fixedrebalancedyes i am aware that this means delve and yes im aware that this means less money for me
ccp should conduct a more indepth study of profit margins for level 4 missions in high sec and 00 ratting they should examine at least 1000 hours spent doing both activities and see how the revenues compare then they should do same comparison of the losses to calculate net profittheoretically 00 hunting should be more profitable than high sec mission running if the results of study show that to be true then we know with some certainty that no major changes needed to be done but if it is proven that 00 hunting is less than or equal to high sec then some kind of action is definitely neededas it is now without hard numbers we have to rely on stories of other people and while we could calculate approximate income levels for different activities the reality often deviates from theory only ccp can get the hard dataand as concerned player your best option is not to push brand new ideas but to push ccp to get that hard data and share with community so educated suggestions can be made for game balance
do this
i support this
awesome idea
you have my support
i forgot to give the little thumbs up
id disagree that highsec mission running is the most profitable pve activity in the gamewormhole space is definitely where its at folks and thats everywhere the way i see it highsec is space for solo players lowsec is a bit of a mix and 00 is where the alliances play solo activities should not be even comparatively profitable out in 00 because thats not what youre there for in the first placeif you have the player infrastructure set up you should be running exploration sites and class 3 wormholes for your isk its more fun a better lessboring way to spend time and makes you loads of cashyou make good points and have good solutions but there is absolutely no reason you should not be running wormholes any class 3 wh can be cleared with 3 remote rep bs and a salvagerhackeranalyzer ive been on wormhole ops that have brought in over 35billion isk split 10 ways and for only a few hours work
i suggested it as a way to still make good or great truesec still matter in any case understand that there already is no limit on faction items in this game you can receive a limitless number of missions in empire albeit only one at a time per agent and nothing prevents individuals from crashing the market by creating faction items through the lp stores there isnt even a limit on how many items you can buy within a given time period the only limits in place are requiring appropriate faction tags easily obtained by looting them in the missions generating the lp to begin withas i noted when i mentioned officers in my original post there is too much information i dont have to ensure im making a sound suggestion theres also the human behavior to considerone poster mentioned above that while they agreed with my analysis they didnt agree with my solution as it amounted to adding more isk to the game that isnt necessarily true while a macro ratter is going to be on 237 many players who rat in 00 do so to achieve a specific goal  often to fund pvp activities or their dream of flying a capital ship developing a production business you name it if it takes those people 6 hours to 100m isk and the resultant changes mean they can now earn that in 3 hours are all or even many of them going to continue to rat the same amount of time probably notdoubling or tripling spawn rates doesnt mean double or triple will be harvested it only means that is the new potential maximumif this what i propose or another solution is adopted to improve casual isk generation activities in lowsec or 00 ill consider my proposal a success however i hope ccp takes care to avoid simply revamping explorationthe main point of my proposal is to give a solo pilot a means to earn just as much or more in a casual 00 activity as he or she can earn in high sec doing a level 4 mission the moment you have to gang up with someone spend 30 minutes or more finding a suitable location whether pruning belt spawns or scanning and probing for cosmic anomalies youre at a big disadvantage to that npc corp member who never ventures 34 jumps beyond a mission hub
ive spent billions of isk on 00 warfare over the years and i havent ratted seriously since 07 all my 00 activities are financed by my riskfree highsec moneymaking ive invested billions of isk and countless hours into alliance level pvp for no personal gain ive tried every nullsec moneymaking scheme ratting mining faction hunting exploration importexport production and even moon mining nothing compares to the iskeffort ratio of empire space id love to be able to log in shoot stuff for an hour and make some money without spending hours pruning cruiser spawns in 10 trusec
hmmm sounds great and since i fly solo in amamake area and suffer far greater risk than you do with your blobs and intel channels then by your argument i should be making about what tentimes your iskright pathetic little 00 players fighting so hard to extend your epeen and yet always trying to make life easier for yourselves
wormholes may be great but its a seperate point from the issue of isk generation on the individual level in 00 systems life in 00 is hard theres risk theres work there is uncertainty there is more work carving out a life as an individual can be miserable in 00 for all the work and risk there should be a reward current mechanics only incentivize 00 for huge alliances who can defend their moon mining towers on valuable moons with a big ass dread fleet other than a hope that the wealth will trickle down there really isnt much reason for a grunt to live in 00 hes arguably better off running missions in highsec and only going out to 00 when his alliance has to siege or defend some towers this really is a bad policy and isnt leading to anyone having more fun in space
not sure about the specific mechanisms proposed for making lownullsec more profitable but i certainlly have been annoyed lately by how much more isk i can making doing hisec l4s than nullseccingboredom pays is not a great game mechanicsupported
im often impressed by the lack of interest people show about finding out actual facts of the matter even ccp often just dont care enough to bother data mining decisions are mostly made on basis of personal preference for example if we just looked at hard facts nano nerf probably wouldnt happen the way it did
this is the most ridiculous argument ive heard in a while but i understand where your bizarre assumptions are coming from you assume that given a wide swath of choices player will always choose the same best option for their shipso lets say on an interceptor as you said everyone will put speed rigs and so everyone will be the samerightjust to make things clear  im not trolling but saying giving frigates more options makes them the same is pretty stupid i mean just take the interceptor for example what rigs would you likely put on themwarp speed speed  scan res damage tracking resistance agility i could go on but i think you get my point if some idiot just wants an inty to quickly fly between dodixie and jita he might fit it differently than a guy who is gate camping for war targets or a pod popper enthusiast cheaper rigs will allow this type of specialization in cheaper shipswe might actually see t1 frigates become usefulwell that last sentence was kind of a lie unless its a rifter but you get meediti just got on the test sever and examined the rigs myself they will be the biggest isk sink ever you are right  fitting rigs now will be more common then it is now but you have to think that these will be going on paperthin shipsso now every frigate that goes down will cost 25 million without tech two fittings this is a better isk sink then medals and implants combinednot only that but im dumbfounded by the options you have with ships now your ships may have bonus and a role this way but you can lean it any way you want now that rigs are so much cheaper salvaging will actually become a real profession as 25 armor plates is now enough to create a frigate rig the only thing i really worry about is balance issues  this may give too much oomph as you put it to ships that already have a lot of it well see though definitely a welcome development
i dont agree with you yaay but im not entirely sure i like the idea of basically free rigs for frigates obviously they will become mandatory but what is worse instead of them making currently weaker frigates more capable of exerting their niche itll just exaggerate the more popular frigs strong points to imbalance ubertanked passive merlins huge buffered punishers interceptorfast vigils crazygank incursusesand whatever else people conjour upso yeah im just worried freevery cheap rigs will create horribly op cookiecutter builds on the classes of ships that should be having their flexibility emphasised
i dont agree anything that helps make pvp cheaper for new players and lessens the performance gap between new players and old is a good thing rigs should not cost 100x the cost of the hull
this is in no way an isk sink isk sinks mean money is removed from the game this money is not removed it is transfered
how does this make pvp cheaper for younger players 1 they have to train more skills just to rig 2 they have to buy said skills 3 they have to buy even more equipment which everyone else flying the same class ship will be buying now too it wont make pvp cheaper itll make it more difficult for young players
yep it is time to grow with your clientele get support to your customers like a they deserve generic answers are so lame
finally someone speaks up i hope that ccp will not just ignore this like they did in the past for similar issues
strongly disagreeing with this idea i think they need good old fashioned quality over quantity the problem with giving players bull replies is they just reply back often padding out their original petition with more information that isnt really neccesary and adding all kinds of metaarguments to explain why their problem is important then getting into debates with the gms about the petition itself if the original gm who replied to the petition was competent and properly incentivised to just resolve it as quickly as possible and if he cant immediately then spend time learning how to thered be a decrease in the number of petitions that need replies then all the useless gms that mostly just type 30 second replies and take pleasure in watching their victims squirm can be layed offyes more good gms are needed but more gms please no the gm stress im sure is a mirror image of the player stress that comes from dealing with the bad apple gms on a daily basisthe worst effect of bad gms is when they make a bad descion and for whatever reason the more competent ones decide to back them up and present a unified front this seems anecdotally to happen much less than it used to which is perhaps an acknowledgement by the whole department that they are lumbered with so many nonserious gms that its impossible to hide it anymore

the only problem with insurance is the use of base prices make it market price based so that you lose 30 when your ship goes boom and you get rid of a lot of this nonsense he read it on the forums it must be true
there is no proof that inflation in eve economy at all indeed it seems eve economy has been largelly deflationary until recentlly but insurance is a cause of inflation because it adds money to the system while the destruction of a ship removes goods from the system
insurance is a isk faucet not an isk sinkyou get isk for free without doing any work for ityou have produced nothing  yet there is more money in your wallet hence more money in the economymaybe i worded it badly  to be more exact insurance is an inflationary pressure on the economyit also places a floor on the value of ships at  insurance payout  insurance premium 1buy ship2insure ship3undock4self destruct5profitif people had to mine or mission run  loot  salvage to earn there iskiesthe result would be more mineralssalvageloot available per unit currencywith the floor also removed prices of t1 ships would be free to drop and find a new levelyou might not complain so hard if your new mega cost you 20m isk with less money in the economy  wallets  and cheaper t1 ships and cheaper minerals more people would choose t1 ships and gear over t2 and hence with less demand t2 prices would start dropping also
lots of t2 stuff is already sold with no or nearly no profit due to the stuff i can get myself is free and doesnt cost anything folksso you want to push the prices below material costs
insurance is flawed but not to the point of being unmanageableship prices will never go below the payout as has been stated if you can buy a ship insure it and blow it up for a net profit thats called insurance fraudthe solution is to remove instant insurance payments there doesnt need to be an actual insurance adjuster involved just a set of rules that have to be satisfied before payment it rendered1 was the destruction selfinflicted selfdestruct  bomb aoe2 was the destruction concord inflicted3 was the destruction corpalliance inflictedim sure there are some more conditions that could be stated but heres a fewdid you do it to yourself if so you dont get paid did you sucker punch someone so concord would do it for you if so you dont get paid did you have a corpmate do it so you could cash in extra isk for the corp if so you dont get paidsure its still pretty wide open to abuse but these are the primary means available which should no longer bethe same could be applied to bounties which would go far to correct that system as well
the only way they could make insurance work is by copying how car insurance works in real life you would have to pay a monthly premium to insure a ship the higher the premium the more coverage you get currently as it is if you dont insure your ship you get nothing if its destroyed different ship types would have different premiums ratios ie an assault frigate is more likely to see action more often than an industrial so the premium should be higher in proportion to its market value the amount of isk received as coverage should be the average market value of the ship in the region you purchased the ship from and not the base cost of the ship which is a static valuei would also like to see corporation owned insurance for example if a corporation builds ships for its members the isk received from the insurance should go to the corporation wallet and not the members
we already have noninsurable ships in the game and the people not up playing stupid empire games aka not privateer alliance fly them theyre called t2 ships look in to themthe rest of your argument is completely flawed and based on some assessment that people fly battleships because they are insurable this is a fallacy people fly battleships because they bring firepower and survivability to the battle field people throw around noninsurable t2 ships without a care in the world what makes you think messing with the insurance payout on battleships would make them do anything different with those a sniper bs costs about what a well fit hac costs give or take 30m here or thereinsurance exists to keep people in the game and keep them in ships if you think ccp is going to tweak this much and risk losing subs youre crazy when people have enough money that they dont care about losing ships anymore they start flying the noninsurable variety there is a natural selfpaced progression to losing expensive ships with no safety net and it works perfectly fine
insurance in game should be more like rl you pay every 13612 months you have a long ass list of things you cant have done to get paid for your accident rates fluctuate based upon your driving record ship losses and their customer service sucksas long as they dont include illegal modifications or driving while under the influence boosters then yeah why not actually no screw it boosters void your insurance rigs void your insurance t3 voids your insurance what elseyou dont get your isk for another 68 weeks make that days in game after the accidentupon ship loss you have to report it to your insurance agent and wait around 3hrs for the er to show up and take pics of the sceneyour record also determines the cost of insurance for all your shipsoh and the fun part insurance is absolutely mandatory for all t1 ships in high sec passing through a high sec system without insurance will get you pulled over webscrammed at gatestation and cited
i cant support this concept because the above statement doesnt match with the alliance name you hate pvp yet are in the main corp in privateer alliance theres an oxymoron if ever there was one
eve insurance has very little in common with real insurance otherwise it would have been much tougher on the player and after a couple insured ship losses insurance company would simply refuse to give you anyso if its clear that insurance was not meant to make eve more realistic why is it here i suppose it is here to minimize the pain of losing ships but things have changed over the years its true that 4 years ago losing a battleship was a pain  at least as much as a hac now but in this day and age isk has become easy people suiciding their battleships right and left 1 month old noobs flying ravens everywhere even 00the crutch is no longer needed it dilutes the games seriousness at the very least battleship insurance has to go
insurance is almost certainly the second largest source of isk from outside the game note not source of wealth but of liquid isk so it it increase inflation at the same time it keep the prices of minerals up as to many players think that what they mine or get from reprocessed loot is free and are willing to sell at every price without the mineral price floor created by insurance ships would be even cheaper and minerals worth very little so probably insurance will never be removed as it is one of the checks against making mining a dead profession about your return from missions the problem is that the isk you invest in your mission ship have a great impact on your returns and the ship you use too cheap ship with named modules could easily mean a 25 cut in mission gains non missile spewing caldari could mean another 25 or more cut
i propose changing the damage accumulation property of crystals to a shatter chance propertyin use a faction or t2 crystal would not take any damagebut there would instead be a chance that it could shatter and be competelly destroyeda crystal that has 1000 shots normally would have a 11000 chance of shattering insteadprosno more damaged crystals that wont stackno more damaged crystals that cant be put into contractsno more problems selling amarr ships in contracts with dodgy crystalsconneed to carry back up crystalswould this be a worthwhile change started a new thread which doesnt use randomness

i suppose in the long run it would make sensecrystals are about the only things in eve that show wear and tearused ships dont reflect mileage dont require regular maintenance and generally dont age and decay over time the very first frigate ever built would still fly as fast as a frigate fresh off the production lineso it would simplify matters considerably if crystals were more chance based instead
can you help me collect the missiles i have been shooting to reuse them

not supported youll end up with crystals shattering on their very first shot crystal damage is a much better mechanic you know youll get some use out of the damned thing
the difference being missiles are designed to explode a missile that explodes and is thus unrecoverable is working as intended
im not going to support this and ill tell you my logic its rp logic but whateverin the early days of energy based weapons i could see you having crystals that shattered on the first shot  they were simply dodgy crystals they had a minute flaw in it somewhere whateverhowever as the weapon technology advanced i would expect that crystal technology would also have advanced to keep pace and as that technology develops you learn how to better tune crystals or even manufacture them yourself so you can precisely control their characteristics this in turn leads to crystals with a predictable decay rate which is what you have nowtldr no this doesnt need to be changed
nono one would use them as theyd be too unreliablealso paying over 2mcrystal for a chance that it breaks on the first shot no thanksive heard plenty better suggestions for dealing with damaged crystals
to quote someonestop whiningseriously ive been mining with tech 2 deep core strip miners along with the associated mining crystals and ive never had any trouble keeping things straightand they work on the same basic system that laser crystals would all i had to do was make sure i loaded used instead of new when i switched things outif i can do it you can do itthis proposal smells of cheese and crackers not supported
it would be nice because that way you can just resell your old t2 and faction crystals its a real pain to have a ton of them lying around that you cant sell
not supporting because it would make crystals too unreliable in pvp
youll also have crystals that last 5000 shots and are still as good as new can be contracted can be sold on market can be contracted as part of an old amarr ship you no longer have use for etc etclike it says in the cons list  you will have to carry a few spare crystalsisnt that worth it to have crystals that can stack be traded 
on average they would last as long as they do now only issue would be carrying spares
rp wise  faction  t2 are high performance crystals handling vast amounts of energythere made as perfect as possible to the point where no flaws are detectable but undetcctable flaws remains meaning they can go at any momentssuch is the price for ultimate performancea bit like the f1 cars of yesteryear
when the server decides a crystal pops  if there are spares in the hold it takes one of thoseno need to stop lasers firingthere are cons as well as prosif your happy with vast quantities of unstackable damaged crystals cluttering up your hangar you are right to not look for solutions
have wanted this feature soooo many times just show the fitting in the info window like when you are piloting the shipshowing module damage in this screen would also be a neat addition
so supporteda way to strip the fitting of a ship without having to board it would be nice as well tbhand repackage doesnt count i like my rigsedit for checking the gorram box
holy crap make this happenthe amount of times ive looked in my assets window and thought hmm is that battleship i have in station x the halffitted one the ratting fit or the rigged fleet sniper if only there was a way to tell remotely
fix
you get my vote  but i honestly think your just waste your time ive yet to see anything csm do that have changed the game for the better that ccp wouldnt have fixed anyway so if they still ignore old issues players been buggering about for years they will not care about this either
the issue is definitely two fold1 projectiles primarily large projectiles2 the tempest itselflarge projectiles are just wrong autocannons and artillery both have dps issues acs fighting in falloff is lol arty clip size and falloff combo is beyond subparthe tempest has a terrible slot layout for the game that eve has become once upon a time you could fit an ecm here a nos there and have a skimpy active tank to last the battle 1000 nerfs have come and gone and this ship was long left in the dust unable to compete split slots leave half assed tanks in the day of buffer tanksdouble damage bonus that adds up to a ship that deals less damage than its peers a speed nerf that left what was to be the hit and run races flagship stuck in the mud its versatility that is preached about is useless in modern eve where only a specialized ship will stand toe to toe w one of its own class andor fit into a properly organized gang this was a support ship in the days when almost all ships were support ships today it is not only outclassed across the races both long range and short range it is outclassed by its own brothers there isnt one task the the tempest can do that the typhoon or maelstrom cant do better the ship has no role no niche and no use other than nostalgia and yarrr appeal how did this come to be ask ccp what little responses we have received on the topic have been touchy feely iffy crap i think i feel no numbers no explanation no elaboration players across eve have discussed and argued the 100 different ways you can approach both the issue of projectiles and the tempest graphs and calculations fall on deaf ears ccp obviously doesnt know what to do with the ship and they possibly may not even understand the damn thing it reminds me of the naglfer in so many ways we all saw how the naglfer went in the end it got some changes but just a bit of duct tape and chewing gum but hey it was something a proper change for the tempest seems in line but since it takes developers 9000 years to add a turret to a ship model im not holding my breath for any big changes provided ccp even addresses the issuein this post i tried to not rant too much but its hard not too i stopped being able to discuss this ship and its weapons systems rationally and calmly months ago its a bad joke and i post here more out of support of the thread than with any expectation this is going to go anywhere good luck guys
yes  getting to be a joke for large projectile systems

i think the pg needs of artillery should be reduced allowing for the tempest to fit a full rack of 1400s plus tank with no rcu ii although since this is mainly a problem with the tempest perhaps the pg of the tempest could be increasedacs more rangea lot and more dps artillery buff a few of these to fulfill a vision as opposed to just being an inferior weapon system like it is now more range more tracking more dps more alpha larger clip

this was meant to be a positivist constructive thread thats why its missing still you can always put your not supported comment though some reasonings should be welcome
this has got to be in here somewhere because it is such an annoying and ridiculous issue but i looked and looked and searched the csm website  nothingso probably for the millionth timemake bpcs and bpos look different in item display bpos dont even always sort to end or beginning sometimes they are hidden somewhere in the middle of 20 identical icons just put some little t2like tag on them or make them a slightly different colors or whatever but for eves sake make them somehow different
warp to 0km brought back a lot of players who had quitwarp to 15km was a useless timesink that most players saw as just plain rudeness from ccp
eve online the only game where the players complain that there isnt enough souldestroying tedium
ive considered it great fun warping to 15km with hostile fleets in host pursuit not tedious one bit unless your a hauler its pretty much substituted by diction bubbles these days still i miss warp to 15 by default
your definition of great fun just proves you are ed
look post 24 and the secnes quote and think about it
i needed to search for the complete thread to understand what secnes wanted to say i think it is the multiinventionmanufacturing slot argument means an inventor can outperform an owner of a single bpo because he can create many bpcs in multiple invention slots and manufacture parallel in 10 production slots and therefore make more profit in a certain time frame than the bpo owner who can only use one slot due to his single bpo isnt itwell its still a question of available capital if you have 100b and buy a hulk bpo for 100b this would be stupid because you dont have any money anymore to do something in your other 9 manufacturing slots if you have 200b it is still better to buy a hulk bpo for 100b and do inventionmanufacturing with the remaining 100b in your other 9 slots the pure inventor cannot beat you and this is also valid if you only have 110b because you dont need to buy invention materials for 100b at once you can buy for 10b invent produce in 9 slots sell buy again from your revenues and so onbut the question does not exist for most of us because of the missing capitalwe are a bit away from the original question if t2 bpos press the prices and profit down for inventors my opinion is still no but not because buying a bpo and producing from it is less profitable than invention but only because the number of bpos is limited and they cannot cover by far the demand on the market if we had 20 or 30 times as many bpos as today in the game covering the complete demand my answer would be yes since they were all sold enough people with enough isk in game and producing from t2 bpos is simply cheaper than invention
ok im back on this with another thought why are invented bpcs so crappy by default 4 4 that is if invented bpcs were not so sucky in their default me id have no issue with the bpos at all 00 for invented bpcs would be fine with the decryptor mepe mods increased a bit since the difference between me 0 and me 1 is pretty irrelevantyes this would whack the prices of some of the decryptors but i own plenty of them and i dont care if the price got whacked if inventing improveditd likely whack t2 bpo prices a bit as well gee whys that
to compensate the limited parallelism of bposif you want to bring up copying them look at the copy time
saw this mentioned in another thread and thought it deserves its own why is it that invented bpcs need to have the horrible default mepe of 44  00 seems like a much better default44 feels like some sort of outdates holdover from the immediatepostlottery days for many modules it doesnt really make a lot of difference but it would make inventing smaller ships a lot more palatablethe only reason i can see for 44 is to protect t2 bpo owners who are selling on the market and all the arguments seem to have been that there is an insignificant amount of that going on anywhow
simply put the forums are in bad shape in general and caod in particular is completely useless because content is drowned out completely by trolls flamesand flat out noise postsfirst off i propose that the moderators get serious about enforcing the main character only rule and in deletingdealing with people who post there only to generate noisethis could possibly be made easier if ccp in the upgrade to the forums were to implement mechanics that required you to select only your real main character this would happen this way the server would weight your characters by these attributes in this order1 is the character in an alliance2 is the character in a non npc corporation3 which character has the highest number of spto discourage misbehavior the punishment for creating noise on the caod forum needs to be severe and have quick and devastating consequences for repeat offenses to the level of severity as to provide a very strong deterrent to willful misbehavior i propose the punishment scale like this1st offense warning2nd offense 7 day ban from forums3rd offense 30 day ban from forums 7 day game account ban4th offense 180 day ban from forums 30 day game account ban5th offense permanent ban from forums 180 day game account ban6th offense permanent from the gamewith punishments like that people who post on these forums in general and caod in particular for no reason other than to disrupt discussion to troll to generate noise will find themselves removed first from the forums and then from the game if they persisti would appreciate it if someone on the csm would take up this issuethank you for your time
u madanyway caod is dead while the place has always been a remarkable example of human behaviour its continued to go downhill ever sincebut instead of all sorts of wierd authority angles to guide or force human behaviour which is a remarkable failure in real life so why should it work in a virtual setting why should we even bother with trying to control itits much more use to focus on things which can be worthwhile and leave people with mental deficits their own little sandbox ccps recent hints at a battle database but also shcs strict focus on battlereporting spring to mind recently there was another neat initiative for a battle database thing which together with shc seems to be an interesting example for some ccp thinking on the matterlets be honest caod is the toilet of eve leave the toilet to those who enjoy the  but make the effort for a focus on quality information management via other methods if that has to be outside of the eve site so be it
how about requiring all caod posts to come from a new 00 system with special complex you have to warp to it open its interface at 2500 m and type in your threadif anyone shoots you  well defend or die 
that idea is so bad it is actually interesting enough to feel a sense of enthusiasm for
considering the hilarious inconsistency of decisions made by the caod mods allowing them to apply ingame as well as forum bans in anything but the most extreme cases is a spectacularly terrible idea
right now the current system in place is that if there is a need to reinforce a node you have to go to the following page and fill out the form
in spite of being awfully close to launching their own skynet ccp does not have unlimited hardware node reinforcing requires bits and pieces of the good hardware the pink stuffso from what i remember from some devblog the hamsters at world operations handle these node reinforcement requests which is probably where all the confusion comes from regarding the hamsterson a sidenote tbh i would actually make x64 drama excempt from reinforcing nodes make it as bad an experience as possible just for the sake of experiencebut that is probably a very different debatebtw if people forget to fill in a form that is their own fault not ccps besides there are plenty times tbh it is becoming pretty much standard where leaderships fake information to their own members for the sake of roleplaying spygames but quite often and especially in defensive scenarios they claim to file for reinforcing the node but just dont do it why because it is easier to suck up something when you can blame ccp and it is easier to face odds when you can dictate how many players you can pump into an unreinforced node so that any hostile forces really have very little chance of making a dent the current system leaves a degree of responsability with the players while allowing for screwups as well as tactics using the system if that is cool keep it as it is until infiniband or something arrives if those parts arent cool maybe then changes might be needed but you still face inherent limitations
not gonna happenthe only way youll get what you want is if they enforce all nodes throughout the entire gamein a sense total overhual of hardwareand i doubt they will do that in the near future unless they come onto some major profitsauotmating a system as you claim is not as simple as it soundsthere are factors that have to be tested and constantly checkedwhich take time and cpu load to do compounded with it checking any number of hundreds of systems variables conditionsyou could trigger said event just by having a sudden shift of 500 pilots going from point a to point b or someone just for kicks reenforces a pos when there is no battle to be hadalliance wars are not predictable you may forsee something happening but its never going to happen as you plan it to beautomating a system like that is so mind boggleing youd need to make a leap to some sort of super ai poke poke skynet fun to be able to gauge said responsei dont program but i know enough to know that what your asking for is nigh impossible at this current timenow if ccp overhauls all the systems or dedicates a portion of the cluster to 00 space or something then its no questionbut theres just too many things to trackwe humans are not as predictable as machines except for our predictable urge to destroy 
no its not im not asking for the nodes to be reinforced via some programing means well in the sense you were talking about all you would look at is if a sov holding or r64 moon is in reinforced mode if so the form could be automatically generated and the person in charge would go about his work of reinforcing the node thats it all it is is automatically filling out that form and improving the end user experience instead of subjecting them to a frame by frame slideshow where they were actually dead minutes ago
why would the moon goo crowd get automated special treatment just think about it as opposed to faction warfare lowsec wspace groupies heck even jita or rensim sorry but your proposal comes down to a case of we the x64 endgame content kings have more right to a better gaming performance then othersso that argument being shot down i am curious what other arguments you have dont misunderstand me i may seem rude but im actually quite interested in a proper argumentation
regardless as you obviously lack the experience to understand such complicated conceptsthe same thing applies a system would have to be created to watch monitor predictcalculateits not as simple as a if then else statementnot when it comes to things of eve online
i think its more a case of reinforced nodes are needed for big fights and one of the surest ways to cause a big fight is by shooting an alliances r64s plus the fact that the tower is usually stronted far enough ahead that ccp can prepare the node in time and that with a tower you know the location and approximate time that the fight is most likely to happen obviously 2 big fleets bumping into each other in lowsec isnt necessarily something that can be predicted in the same way even if you know the clash is going to happen you cant be sure which system is going to see the heaviest numbers fighting and so an automated prenode reinforcement system wouldnt work there as you mentioned jita i understand jita is on effectively its own permareinforced node 237 anyway
all of your arguments have been pretty well shot down by scatim heliconso would you mind providing your obviously experience resume of mmorpg programing if not you might want to quit backseat programing and let ccp decided on the merit of it or not 
i dont have time to teach you how to read you got thousands of buddies who can howeverfeel free to look them upits your idea you figure it out
good idea
this i notice you very cleverly left out a cons section of your op and this should be at the top of the list for anyone who is defending a pos those precious few seconds you waste targeting a structure you thought you needed to shoot at could make the difference in a fightget a scout ship to pretarget them if you want and act as a spotter but no no and no on this change

here is a thread discussing partly the same subjectmissions and agents  suggestions for improvementpersonally i like the idea of player created missionsa mission editor more than dynamically but still automatically generated content which would nevertheless improve the current situation of course three reasons1 it would create a new for some of us interesting profession to be a mission creator or  to avoid metalanguage  lets call it agentcorporationfaction partnership with maybe a set of new skills2 the potential creativity and phantasy of thousands of players is unbeatable by any automatic mission generating system of course to avoid totally unplayable and stupid missions a framework has to be defined a mission creator can only move within i am sure there are really talented artists out there like in the department of video creators3 it fits well to the basic eve idea to be a universe organized and formed by the playersa note to eriks remarkdue to eula conditions this is already threatened with a player ban from the game basically its the same like using abusive language in a bio corp description contract description in chat channels at the forums or any other publicly accessible text medium you cannot forbid the freedom to talk and to write due to the risk that this freedom is misused nevertheless text descriptions of a player created mission might be an issue if its not abusive language it could be pure nonsense or boring or not in line with the storyline framework of eve today the amarr have formed an alliance with the minmatar to destroy the caldari state gallente federation and goon swarm alliance help themblabla probably something ccp would not like on the other side also the mission descriptions can have the potential to make a mission more interesting if someone has the idea for a nice little story being packaged in a mission but yes here could be the point that a mission must pass some kind of legalization office at ccp before it can be made public to the playersas already linked in the thread above some other old ideas regarding a mission editor can be found in mission editor  should there be one
supportedthe fact that you can write a macro that can run missions should tell everyone that something is painfully wrong with the pve content of eve onlineand for those of you on the pvp bandwagon thats all well and good but if youre going to take the time to add content to the game like missions dont do a halfarsed job of it
ill chime in to say that an initial step in adding to the complexity of a mission would be to encounter npc ships that are closer in setup and operation to player ships real hacs like a ham spewing sacrilege or a sniper zealot or actual recons webbing rapiers neuting curses a stealth bomber in an npc mission would be quit interesting and let it act like a real player and launch bombs which blow up more friendlies than foes ecm that actually follows the rules so that not only is it used but also defended against also allow npcs to actually use drones id love to see an ishtar in a mission actually drop 5 sentries
i support this in principle but missions need more than just randomizationto really solve the mission problem youve got to answer a few questionswhy is a mission fit different from a pvp fit its different because you dont need to stop the target from warping out its different because you care more about mitigating the damage coming at you from lots of ships and whittling them down to a manageable number than you do about taking out the one ship that is going to kill you its different because a mission is nothing like pvp  but it should bewhy is there no pve content for small ships why is bigger always better if im an extremely skilled pilot who just happens to like small ships why is there not a mission i can run that makes use of my betterthanaverage skills and lets me fly what i likewhy do mission runners work individually rather than in groups the reward tends to be the loot and the salvage rather than the bounty and what the agent offers its more difficult to split up the loot and salvage  especially with the lack of trust that exists in eve make the bounty and agents prize the reward for the mission and make loot secondaryto those who say that this game is all about pvp and that pve should always be secondary  think about this in a balanced pvp situation 1 vs 1 half of the players involved are going to lose their ship half the loot from that ship along with the hull itself will be destroyed the guy who just lost his ship is going to need to make money to buy a new ship which he is going to lose again he needs to feel like a hero for a while if he has a difficult time doing either of those things hes probably going to quit the more people who quit the less targets you have the less targets you have the more likely you are to be the one who loses your ship because only the better players remain what are you going to do when you lose all your money cant make any kills and dont feel like a winner anymore somebody just won eve and it wasnt you
if you want to easy the r64 monopoly from big powerblocks you could add some havestable clouds in some deadspace ladar that would helpa bit and give isk to others than alliance leaders but making moon income despawn  respawn is not a good idea at all from an economic pov
absolutely 110 supported i still have moon maps for impass and feythabolis from my ascn days that are still current how ridiculous is thatof course such a change will inevitably mean that t2 gear will become more expensive again but that can be countered to a degree by ccp adding a few more highend moons at the same time to compensate for the likelihood that some resources could go unmined for a period of time or alternatively it could provide a good opportunity to reassess the alchemy issue as wellthis along with a nerf to capitalscale logistics in general is what 00 sorely needs to make it interesting againben
you mean after we got jump freighter not long ago you want to remove them againjust because the moon map from the old times is still valid doesnt mean the same people get rich from it
i have a betteri think idea  keep current infinite moons but also add add respawning finite minerals to moonsmaybe even only r64infinite moons will still be worth fighting for and keep some moon mineral supply going at all timesfinite veins will increase mineral supply and allow ppl not in few super wealthy alliances get some moon gold with luck and scanning effortone vein can have about 50000100000 units of mineral and respawn elsewhere when depleted
the problem isnt with the moonsforcing people to rescan the entire regions regularly is even worse than the current situation which is that rarity doesnt really mean valuefor example cloud ring has 1788 moonsgiven the least time it takes currently to scan one is 5min lots of skill points in that it will take about 6 days to scan them all to find the one that got depletedadd that during the time you are scanning even more moons will deplete which you have to go hunting for and probably recheck all the moons you had scanned since they might have changedno thanks making several full time jobs to scan moons isnt going to be a working sollutionif you want a way to lessen the grasp the big alliances have on dysp and prom then a better sollution is to change the demand make all r64s worth about the same  some  and worth lets say twice that of r32 and so on and if you want to go even further make alchemy use gases to make whatever at a much better ratio than today which should be possible to balance and lessen the hold on promdysp
thered need to be a better way to scan moons planet wide scans system wide scans before this is implemented but the core of the issue isnt bad i personally think any isk printing mechanics the old t2 bpo system  which got fixed and the current moon mining mechanics are bad mechanics and encourage a static game statemaking moon minerals run out or make moon mining poses more vulnerable may be options  but other changes would be needed to avoid a total collapse of the t2 market
what about just fixing the issue of the lesser moon minerals being worth less than the dirt under my fingernails instead
one of the few driving forces behind territorial warfare is gaining control of r64s which provide the vast income required to maintain regionwide pos networks and supercap production if im a smallmedium alliance who lives in crappy region a with no r64s and my neighbouring smallmedium alliance lives in awesome region b with 10 dysprosium moons i might attack them to gain those moons for myselfif theres a clock ticking and i know that in a couple of months and even in the best case scenarios it generally takes several weeks to secure a region those dyspro moons are going to despawn whats the point of me busting my ass to go take over the other region just for the big prize to vanish from under me i may as well sit in my crappy region and wait for the day of despawn and see if some of those dyspro moons land in my lap next time around perhaps more damaging for the game as a whole if im a huge superpower 00 alliance im going to hold as much space as possible for myself and stamp out all my smaller neighbours so that when the moons get shuffled ive a better chance of owning the new r64s for myself the situation we had at the start of this year where the sovereignty map got turned on its head because goonswarm abandoned the southeast to take delve and querious since the r64 income from those two regions matched or surpassed what we were earning in the 4 regions of our old space would never have happened because in all probability wed have been halving our alliance income once the next reshuffle came aroundid say that was a smarter way to go the fact that 2 out of the 4 r64 moons are massively profitable and the other 2 barely cover the cost of the pos fuel is pretty silly and tweaking the moon mineral requirements for some of the reactions would be a simple way to go dont equalise the values across the board there should still be some r64s better than others but reduce the massive disparity some
you could allow moons in wh space to have finite resources and allow them to be mined since they are not open to mining presently it would make altering the presence of rare moon minerals in a given system not a change to anything we have presentlyyou could alter the moon scanning mechanic by allowing a new general moon scan to take place either by visiting the individual moons or system wide this scan could tell you the tier of the minerals and skills could alter the time and accuracy of the scan such a method could be fit to only work in wh or notwh moon rares could be weighted to appear slightly more frequently in more dangerous wh space or notjust some thoughts
nah not necessary in my opinion to add game mechanics to pure eye candy we have suns background clouds and different sky colours only as visible objects without any game mechanical purpose why not more of those things to give the many solar systems a more varied looki support this proposal
its not strictly necessary no i just dont think ccp is going to spend the manhours necessary unless theres mechanics involved as well as eye candy
nephilim youre arguing rather well and i appreciate the effort youre putting in but you really dont understand the dynamics of eve well enough yet eve is an mmo like no other its a game of total freedom where you are allowed to do anything you can get away with as long as it doesnt constitute an exploit hacking someones account and stealing all his isk is obviously not allowed but swindling him out of his isk with a wellrun scam is perfectly within the bounds of the lawconcord are there to ensure you cant get away with unrestricted killing everywhere in the game you might think the idea runs directly contrary to the aforementioned total freedom but you have to realise just how vicious the game gets out in 00 space or even lowsec since losing a ship or clone in eve carries genuine consequences where most mmos only hit you with a small exp penalty or possibly some equipment damage when you respawn everyone fights to the death at every opportunity if concord were anything other than an absolute force itd be the same as them being totally ineffectual because at least some players would eventually beat them and be completely free of any consequences this would be very badyou see there is a group of players in the game called goonswarm eves goons are the biggest mmo community in the world and play games for the purpose of ruining them for everyone involved at least until they found eve a game perfectly suited to them where virtually anything is allowed in the boundaries of 00 space however if they were allowed to rampage across empire space fighting off concord on the way and crushing everyone they see they would because they could they wouldnt need a reason you couldnt negotiate with them and although it might be possible for someone to stop them the damage they would do to the game in the meantime yes damage it would render the game totally unplayable for many many players would be devastatingconcord are not harsh for being invincible in fact theyre a very generous way of defining what would be in any other game a nopvp zone eve has no nopvp zones but concordcontrolled empire space is as close as youre going to get you can still be randomly killed by a ganking jerk for absolutely no reason but at least the addition of concord means its going to be a suicide gank you should be thankful not complaining without concord it would be completely impossible for new players to join the game no im not exaggerating
now that its been brought to my attention i had a look at the resists of tech1 shipsyour right its screwy i dont understand it at all it neither makes sense in game design or in rp fluffi will say one thing however this is not a minmatar only problem its caldari alsowhy would a shield tanking race like the caldari enhance their armor resist vs their enemies preferred damage typethey wouldnt they would strengthen their shields not their armor as for minmatar well keeping with the do anythingphilosophy why would minmatar buff their shield tanking ships with armor resistsi propose we create a new thread that demands the 10 em resist on minmatar shield specific ships to be moved from armor to shield and move all the caldari ships 10 thermal resist from armor to shields

i have a lot of friends all mmo players who would start playing eve in a second if they could more identify with their avatar wis would allow them to do that if ccp waits till another round of ground breaking mmos are released then they are missing a prime opportunity to recruit more people
hey bring the old lightning vortex back thanksalso bump
though i agree with the op i always suggest to players to train into a destroyer as soon as possible strictly for the amazing usefulness of one fit with nothing but salvagers and tractors 
i like this but i think that crew need some type of payment they are not working for free
isnt there something similar in pirates of the burning sea about pirates in the 17th century caribbean
current situation the average eve player may not be aware that they have to save their settings folder periodically or they risk losing overview settings and bookmark folder organization in the event of a hard drive crashwipe the task a repopulating your bookmark folders when theyve all been dumped into main space within people  places is a frustrating one proposed solution save bookmark folders serverside bookmarks are already preserved that way so maintaining folder structure is the next logical step towards making eve more user friendly pros new players and veterans alike wont be quite so frustrated by the loss of settings folder files cons it will no doubt require some additional database load on ccps servers
certainly worth asking for supported
going by the search function this suggestion has popped up in the test server feedback forum but ive yet to see a thread about it in this subforum so thats why im posting this herea lot of people dislike the new sensor booster effect introduced with the graphics upgrade the problem isnt so much on the individual ship level but when you form big fleets or take capital fleets out for a spin this effect becomes too invasive and creates a big pulsing blurthingy that makes it hard to tell whats going on its enough to make you turn effects off and thus miss some graphical pew pew and whatever else ccps graphics team has put togetheris it really necessary that we need an effect for sensor boosters why dont we have one for damage controls then my proposal would be to preferably remove the effect or redesign it to be more subtle and less of an annoyance the old pulsing rings werent much better but they also werent the eyesore the new effect is
its probably a disincentive to  for killmails at a gate camp
agreedon my stiletto it looks terribly bad the center point of the effect is not even inside my ship due to the nature of the hull type so it makes a bad feature look even worse and dont even ask me about the terrible sound effect of it
even the old one was better then the current one
the oldstyle ripple effect was much coolerhowever this issue pales into insignificance next to bringing back the cyno jumping animation
this pita has to go but less about me op supported
is it just me that thinks one of the most important corp security measures is that the bpos are locked down and hence cant be stolen without all the shareholders allowing ithere is a counter proposal you propose one vote 1 for a batch of bpos at the same time the vote therefore goes unlock the following bpos capital drone bay capital armor plates capital antimatter reactor unit blah de blah de blahpros less rsi and time wasting as the op wanted but still keeps the accountability of votes for unlocking valuable assetscomments invited 
agreed more control over actionable items roles titles wallet etcshareholders being able to action on items via voting would be a positive step towards real replaceable ceo corporations where a board of directors can more or less run the company by hiring in folks but have no worry about the assets being given for that job
the op included suggestions that would improve the value of lowsec and if you dont think they go far enough you should feel free to make suggestions on improving it further however its not really our fault that you dont have the intel channels and support that the better organised eve players manage to make use of
the weak will always cry that their game should be made easier they avoid challenge like a spoiled child avoids choresbut an easier path breeds weakness whether ingame or not and i like seeing you weaken yourselves its rare that someone knows their place in this or any other worldsupported the current 00 game is just too hard for you poor souls
00 needs something to balance the endless grind to actually hold space
i like this and would love to see this happen
do it
this
i like the crux of gramtars argument and will repost what i posted elsewhere
dawg what means a dawg gets more mad ices means a dawg be down dig i be down if a dawg bust more an maybe leave morealso dawgs vote kuzim presdent of eve in 20010
good proposal
i approve of this cruiser spawns in 00 is pointless
i support this
as long as faction cruiser spawns still spawn with battleship escortsimproving ratting to incentivize people to leave highsec and populate lowsec and 00 and a way to improve space for ratting which this proposal has is long overdue
you have a good point and i will certainly agree having lived it myself that there is no reward to trying to be selfsufficient in 00 while i do certainly think there should be a way to make money in 00 i feel very strongly about eve being a team game the level 4 missioning game is very solidly a solopve carebear thing to do in eve there is probably a large section of the player base who this is their main focus in eve and a significant source of money for ccp to a player who plays the team game that kind of stuff is like mining its excruciating and quite boring most effective pilots i know have 2 accounts at least a lot of them 3 anybody can run 3 accounts doing rrbs and clear a class 3 wormhole in an evenings work and pull in prolly half a bil if youre in marauders you can dualbox it no problem and there seems to be some potential there for solo though its bloody difficult even a class 1 or 2 will net you 100200 million isk no problem though theyre more in highsec basically ccp has already solved this moneymaking problem by giving you the potential to make great money from anywhere in spacei guess what im really trying to say here is that there are other ways to make money in eve the least traveled path really and just focusing on buffing one specific isk generating activity isnt going to help anyone because youre just going to push more of those solo pilots out of highlow sec out to fight over an already limited resource its a tricky thing to balance because different players have different styles of play and ccp has to cater to all of them i just think if youre in a corp or alliance you have to figure out how to make your money togetherotherwise why are you even out there in the first placeim really challenging the whole idea of grunt players that just play as cannonfodder to make a few people lots of money playing with the right group of people has as much to do with your ability to make isk as what rats are spawning in systemrealistically much much more

higher sovereignty and so higher control giving more rats seem bad it would seem a better option to recruit agents for the player stations as often suggested
the problem is the value of the lootsalvageif ccp use mineral content it is skewed one direction if they use local market values it is skewed in another if they use jita values probably in another direction againthen a lot of ratters dont lootsalvage even if it could give a great profit between x2 and x3 the mineral content of equivalent mission ships loot more salvage than mission ships so that value should be disregarded how ccp can know what is really recovered from the wrecks and what was already in the ship taht would require a level of data tracking that i doubt is feasible without serious risks of lag and so changing the results as the rattingmissioning would give less iskhour thanks to changed conditions
why dont you try that1 most faction items in the lp store are the equivalent of the worse faction drops from rats2 the missions barring maybe level 5 dont drop the tags you need for the lp offers in the right proportions and quantity so you generally end with the wrong kind of tags3 practically all the lp offers have a isk cost and all have a lp cost both dont come free and in limitless quantities so no normal users cant crash the faction market through the lp store macro haulers can be another story but then macro ratter would do the same if the spawns were changed
ccp have already improved the quality of spawns in lowsec0401 i believe they should do something similar to 00
ccp have access to all player wallets  they routinely check that data when they investigate isk sellersthey can see the where the isk comes from they can add it up and average it out 1000 hours from 100s of different players would give fairly good estimate
i dont necessarily disagree with what youre saying but to play devils advocatei you say you specifically want to avoid nerfing highsec activities but the game has a single economy a boost to one method of iskmaking is necessarily an indirect nerf to the others simply because it increases the money supply trying to dance around and say you dont want to reduce highsec income is rather disingenuousii youre comparing highsec mission running to nullsec ratting why not compare like for like anyone trying to make a living by ratting in highlowsec would be a spacepauper anyone who can run missions in 00 has an infinite isk printer that would make a highsec mission runner blush not only do nullsec missions pay better and give more lpmission the lp are worth vastly more than those of most highsec factions im not trying to pretend that there are no problems with missioning for nullsec factions particularly if youve been ratting in the area they live in but again its rather disingenuous to compare wholly different activities
i wish people would only respond if they actaly have a bit of knowlage of the subject 00 missions are only avaleble in the 4 npc sov regions curse gw syndicate venal and npc delve only a small portion of 00 players live there and its usualy very hostile territory that u cant farm like regular high sec l4 missions  yes this involves risk and yes u need to hide often in stations and no it wont go as fast as l4 cause u cant use faction pimped ships for it
lets look my wallet and trade when i was in 00  60 sell order opens included all the good stuff and minerals from looting missions in high sec plenty of sell orders in 00 for items made there with recycled loot ammunitions probes meta 0 modules not dropped by the local rats ships  some sell order for the good metaitems dropped by the rats rigs made with local and empire components empire sell order for zydrine and megacyte from the 00 loot and some meta 4 sell order with modules coming from 00edit just to clarify it those orders were put on the open market only some month only after i left the 00 alliance i was in before they were offered to corpmates through the alliance forumwhat wasnt there the faction items i did gets some i used some i moved in empire in a single voyage and later sold some are still in my cans in empire or 00 the tower bpc was given to my corp  the t2 salvage from rats that is still in my salvage canso how ccp will differentiate if my sell order of meta 4 laser was made using 00 rat loot lasers or high sec mission lasers what value have the minerals i used to build ships that i used and lost and ccp can identify where that mineral came loot or mining what value for the minerals i sold or gave to the corp as a gift 00 local or empire  if 00 local how we will consider that some alliance enforce limited buy orders for 00 so that they will be the only people buying and at reduced prices if i sell something got in 00 after months of using it or simply keeping it in a can they will add his value to the money i made in 00 ecc eccraw data mining mean very little if you need to do something valid you need to evaluate what you get and identify what problems there can be with you data gathering system
supportedanother point is that true 00 systems have less belts than other systems in 00 increase the number of belts to 12 and you can chain even better with much more profit right now you can only chain in a true sys with only one person in vale of the silent while this systems have about 58 belts in it
butterfly effect nerfs are inevitable and occur all the time whenever anything is rebalanced in this game  even for example a statline change to a pvp ship will have knock on effects in empire for the people who manufacture and sell that ship so yes there would potentially be consequences for highsecbut one hopeful side effect of a 00 buff would be that if more of the space is attractive enough for people to compete for then it would get more people out there blowing each other up which would mean more demand for the ships and modules which are still mostly obtained in highsec and so higher buy orders for the tritanium mined in highsec and used to construct them and exported to 00hes comparing best option with best option not like for like to turn your point around you may as well compare running l4s in the forge apparently 20m per hour with running l4s in querious zero isk per hour  there arent any l4 agents or any agents at all in queriouswhilst people can run l4s in npc 00 regions like stain or syndicate and theoretically make as much or more money as in highsec in reality these regions are gankfests full of roaming nbsi gangs who are potentially probing out your mission site or camping the stations so at best youll spend half the time making no money at all because youre camped in or hiding in a pos or safespot and at worst youll have your expensive bs blown up and not only have to spend isk but precious missionrunning time flying around putting together fittings as well npc 00 markets tend to be patchy  theres rarely a jita or rens equivalent system with everything you need at low prices in a single locationwhether ratting or missioning the difference in 00 is that your theoretical maximum income is only possible under perfect conditions that rarely are present in reality ie a ratting system with above average truesec all the crappy cruiser spawns already cleared out for you a dozen or so belts no hostiles or neutrals in system and no other ratters in system that you have to split the spawns with or a l4 agent with no hostiles or neutrals in the agents system or any other system that the mission sends you to whilst in highsec those perfect missioning conditions apply all the time so your theoretical maximum income is your actual income where the only limitation is the amount of time you want to spend playing
as i had a clean standing alt with less than 6 month of training i did mission running in delve with himeven if it was full of non blue i had no problem running them beside the alliance not liking the time lost to mission running and had no problem doing the missions never lost a ship mission running in 00 ratting was more dangerous sure only four regions have npc stations but that can be changed change for change in theory that adding npc agents will give 00 the infinite supply of easy money that high sec already has but the point is not that true the point is that it should be a big wealth source with as little time required to get the money as possible it should not move people away from the true activity of 00 fighting other players that is a choice of the alliancesdont sell in station enemies can buy the stuff only sell through inter alliance channels
low sec needs a fix asap currently the more danger youre exposed to in low sec the lower the rewards
pretty much everyone with some sense of perspective would agree that higher risk should equate to higher reward that concept is one of the appeals of eve but currently it doesnt appear to be playing out that way at the individual level that said the devil is in the detail when it comes to ways to improve the situationive found that for the mostly solo play i currently engage in level 4 hisec mission running is just too good to ignore on a single account 20m iskhour is pretty easy to achieve even if you dont factor in the profits from lp conversion  and the lps net me more gain than the bountieslootsalvagemission isk reward combined per unit time every other solo money making scheme ive looked at has come up short of this with the exception of exploration  and that has more risks and really requires multiple accountsto address the devils advocate post above i dont consider the suggested approach disingenuous given that the stated objective is to move the balance of reward towards the higher risk environments im also not sure on what youre basing the belief that 00 mission running is massively more lucritive than hisec the numbers ive run for lp conversions and earning rates on a couple of the pirate factions were not impressive and failed to justify the increased riskback to suggestions for rectification we need to consider macroeconomic consequences the nature of the different ways a player is rewarded is important mainly the difference between isk rewards primarily bounty and material rewards modules minerals ill leave psuedo currency like lps out of the equation for simplicity sakethe basic principle is anything that you inject more of into the economy loses relative value and that includes isk itself whacking rats for bounty injects isk directly into the economy increasing the ease of this has an inflationary effect lowering the value of isk compared to the goods it is used to purchase ie the price of everything goes up for another example look at the theory of drones and high end minerals the issue there is that a new source of high end minerals was introduced such that they became relatively more plentiful compared to everything else especially low end minerals as a result the relative value of everything else increases ie the price of tritanium goes up the price of high end minerals goes downi figure lets try to kill 2 birds with one stone by injecting the right stuff into 00 solo play rather than just isk after all any change you make to the game has trickle down effects we might as well aim for those things to be desireable as well insofar as its possible to predict them increasing the availability of low end minerals in deep nullsec isnt very appealing so thats out more bounties means inflation and nobody likes inflation i wouldnt say its out but you want to be careful with itlets look at some overpriced items which are linked to mostly lowsec and 00 playt2 rigst2 shipsin both cases the problem is supply though for slightly different reasonst2 rigs suffer from limited supply opportunities across the board so why not improve the value of all npc ships outside hisec by giving them a gradually increasing chance to salvage t2 rig parts the lower the sec of the system they are int2 ships suffer from the moon mining and reactions industry being owned by alliances not individuals it is a great big oligopoly which happliy keeps prices high how about it be made possible to get some t2 materials through individual effort in any system where moon mining is possible in this way individuals who live in 00 can improve their personal wealth creation and it would create an individual incentive for people to raid those systems either venturing out from hisec or from neighboring sov granted balancing this with passive extraction via poss is tricky but some clever design could solve this
thats not how it works in goonswarm even in the npc delve constellations and for the solo player needing to make money it doesnt really matter why the npc 00 markets are patchy scattered and inflated it still means he might have to fly 15 jumps to get his next set of overpriced missile launchers another 15 jumps to pick up his overpriced ballistic control systems and then 30 jumps to get back to his agent all of which is time he could have spent making more money doing more missions not to mention the risk of him getting blown up on the way the realities of npc 00 make missioning a far less attractive proposition than heading back to a highsec hub and running them all day long in neartotal safety even with the slightly higher agent rewards

there are no players to fight in 00 because nobody has any reason to be in 00 if people could actually feasibly live out in 00 instead of going back to highsec to run missions its a win for 00 dwellers both carebear and pirate alike
i dont like the op suggestion but i do agree that some balance needs to be struckimho the best fix would be to tone down the reward ladder in empire namely by changing the current mineral faucets to lp faucets in addition to loot revisions for drones this would drive mid range minerals up zydrine up trit down and more or less make low security look appealing for mining again scale the lp rewards so that the highest ones are given at null npc ensure that lp stores only give out the best conversions there as wellwith that and zyd and mega up to higher levels it should make null look vastly more appealing for both pirate and carebear alikeshould make everyone happy
this is convoluted solution just boost 00 bounties problem solved
it would only seem that simple but raising bounties would actually make it worse
i said it before and ill say it again  because it is the truththe biggest injustice of 00 hunting is that people who log in immediately after downtime have 3050 better chance of finding valuable faction spawns including officer spawnsi have done it for at least 2 years  i hunted right after downtime and i hunted 12 hours after downtime i know the difference i understand the game mechanics that make it possible i explained how it works alreadyyou want to improve 00 for general population without any big game changers simply fix the broken system that fix may not be enough but it is a step in right direction
im not much for investing but i would say a few mil in a t1 frig is a highly risky investment especially since if you die you will never see that isk again and your opponent cant loot it so that isk disappears foreversounds like an isk sink to me
but you buy that rig off a rig builder like me and then i spend that isk on more componentswaste the profit if ive made any on exotic dancers the isk is not sunk as it continues to flow about the economy  skillbooks are isk sinks as the isk is technically destroyedthe only real isk sinks in the chain are npc station slot fees and sales taxes and whatnot
salvage doesnt work on the same model that minerals do so yes it is an item sink when rigged ships get poppedhowever as noted before because well be seeing a price plummet because usage amounts are lower i really dont think its going to be that significant of an impactassuming drop rates are equal
got to support this as well
ccp  think  how does it look if you attempt to supress people speaking about the way you handle stuff  seriously  think
such wisdom from someone who only has 14 hours to save the earth d
because  if we dont say no ccp will assume we mean yes
surprise surprise here i was thinking this thread and the one before this was stupid emo ragenothing but a waste of timeive never had a problem until recentlyabout 2 weeks ago i had a strange skill queue glitch on me i didnt notice because i was just pew pew pewing and then i saw it frozen on completing a skill for an hourso i report it and they say i lost 58 to 59 minutes of training big wup rightso i go ok uh thats not good can i have it backthey say yes i say sure put it there points to skill queuenope wont work therei say put it there then points at skill listoh we cant do that has to be in a skill with exactly same amount of time you lost and must not be training and most not be in the queuei just lost it there and said frak it told them they can keep it and flunked the ratingwhats happened to the stellar gm service people seriouslysorry but my pitchfork is gonna get added to this stackhere hereps seriously its just a measily 59 minutes and they couldnt shove it into a skill at random or nudge along my queue wth
all ive ever had to petition are isk spammers and theyve all been cp replies though i agree we need some transparency here if theyre worried about privacy dont release the char names but the gms gm whatever should be available with their start date so we can have an idea of how much experience they have maybe even the month and year of their oldest normal characterno name just that it was made in january 2005 for example
the level of consistency and competence i would expect from a far more disreputable cheap and uncaring company the fact that this is this service is provided by ccp is nothing less than appalling when compared to the commitment they have shown their gameit is time for a changefully supported
indeed
i think this thread is mostly just a list of people who shall not be getting any petition requests granted any time soon p3 ccp
totally supported
supporting this lower level or first port of call gms generally seem to lack any idea or just do not read the petitions often replies have nothing to do with what youre petitioning about or are so vague and general you can almost envisage them going with a cut and paste reply
been an issue for a very long time something really needs to be done about it
while some arguments in this thread are valid my alliance name is not one of them but the point is insurance is still too much of an isk faucet on the individual level however i do acknowledge that insurance is something this game needs not what reality would call for after reexamining the issue perhaps a 1025 recovery was too harshuninsured  10 compensation5 premium  20 compensation30 premium  70 compensationthis still reduces the 40 unconditional loss return to 10 but it still operates with the same 21 premium return as currently present the net compensation based on mineral prices will be 1040 i believe a 40 insurance return is more than fair the current 70 value is far too highedit perhaps insurance of miningindustrial vessels could have a 31 investment ratio they are after all not combat ships that are designed for frontline engagementsuninsured  105 premium  2530 premium  100this would give noncombat ships a 1070 return
your original proposal was as broken as the current ingame insurance this though this is much more reasonable a 40 payback is high enough for insurance to work but not so high to cause tech 1 ships to be risked with little concernsupported
if we cant get contracting of damaged goods this is the second best solution
omg yes yes
there was a csmccp meeting report last year where the minutes mentioned some ccp dev saying we like the minnies the way they are  nudge nudge wink wink i thought for a while that there must be some trick to flying minnie bs that would make them double plus awesome compared to other ships because the icelanders at ccp would have soft spot for ships and a race whose names featured so many icelandic and nordic namesin the meantime i think the minnie ships have just been forgotten no one brought the clueless ccp statistician up to speed on why so few people actually fly minnie bs or why the one minnie hac with good resistances the munnin has a bonus for arties which no one uses anyway sadly i think ccp just doesnt and wont care i would love to be proven wrong about ccp just once instead of feeling laughed at by ccp marketing getting more money out of me because i still let them string me a line of hope
the various changes to the game over the last 2 years or so especially have left minmatar ships in a terrible spot they have the worst weapons the worst defenses are terribly skill intensive and have no real focus anymore for the love of all things fair ccp at least fix projectile weapons so that the larger minmatar ships stand a chance i can at least compensate for the missile overnerfing you did by training more support skills and relying on drones but the poor matari pilots dont have that option signed
dont forget that before the great nano nerf patch minmatar had very powerful vagabonds typhoons rapiers huginnsnow all of those ships have lost an edge and gained nothing thus underlining the existing weaknesses
edit when showing previews the forum forgets the support this topic statusat the very least this i mean sure its annoying that people can shoot your stuff and extend the count down but that fact it doesnt tell you just makes ccp look like ubisoftby the way you should take that as a horrible insult because i once found a function in ubisofts code called blabla

i support this motion
interesting idea maybe have it be like a yellow light on the contacts listthumbs up
current situation the use of a jump bridge in 00 space while piloting a pod requires 1 unit of liquid ozone this wasnt always the case the change to require any liquid ozone for pods is a newer requirement this is a problem because a pod is unable to carry liquid ozone it is unable to use an empty bridgeproposed solution return the liquid ozone use for pods back to being 0 unitspros pilots who have lost their ships can move about easier for finding a replacement shipcons pods wont be required to pay a toll to the pos gods
really dont get why this was ever done away with
considering that a pod has no cargo room this was a stupid change to begin withway to go random game mechanic change guy hes a super hero for the masses you knowsupported
supported
supported
sensible
not supported the cost is negligible for 1 unit of ozone however to be able to use the jump bridge the owners need ensure it is kept supplied with fuel failure to do so should not allow free use for pods as it would only facilitate a safer way to travel from one location to another for operations or replacementsits simple just keep them filled with fuel so they work as intended
supported random mechanic change that had no positive effect and added an annoyance
jump bridges are already horribly overpowered they are safer than high sec empire gate travel they ruin small scale pvpif anything jump bridges should be made much harder to use and much more expensive so people use them only when it is really important and not for day to day traveling
not correct they have the same power as portals wormholes and stargates means of travel each with distinct characteristics advantages and disadvantagescompletely incorrect try making a little effortsilly most small scale pvp is ruined by people not willing to make effort not willing to think outside the box unable to do much of anything without moon goo being involved unwilling to do anything without moon goo being involved no x64 getting shot no reason to defend against intrusionsand ah yes small scale pew pew in 00 died when everybody switched to making isk in empire as it was more rewarding for less risk no targets no fungo try run a decent bridge network youll do a 180 on opinions quite quickly bridges are deathtraps worse then stargates since they encourage afk behaviour like in the good old days when people had to use bookmarks to travel 80 jumps through 00 besides that the maintenance both in cost and manhours is horrificseriously man it is not too much to ask to comment constructively on something if you have the topic specific experience and expertise as for the issue itself id love to support it but i think there is some benefit in raising the bar a little bit on the logistical processes involved in ship replacements which is the most frequent scenario where you see pods running for bridges by the dozen at 0 cost that is nice but a bit too easy at a tiny cost it seems reasonable imo
that should have been done intitially at least they could overlay something special in one of the corners like they do for tech 2 items
theres no indication of bpobpc for performance reasons from what i understand its been brought up before and the devs have sadly shook their heads and gently told us not quite yetmy lack of support tick is not because i think its a bad idea its because all hope has been abandoned and ticking the checkbox would be pointless
yeah its about the millionth time ccps position on this has been constant for a long time  theyd have to rewrite the database to do it without causing unacceptable lag and while itd be a nice feature it doesnt justify the manhours i want it but im not going to hold my breath
current situationthe ui has jump to located right next to open jump bridge on titans having the possibility of accidentally jumping your 80b isk ship onto a hostile fleet because of a 10 pixel mouse slipup is terribleproposed solution separate the two options further from each other in the uipros 80 billion isk assets wont be put at jeopardy due to a ui missclick cons the opportunity to catch titans who accidently clicked the wrong thing will decline
while watching samhandwich jump into a hostile system when he meant to jump bridge us in is hilarious its poor ui design
even when this sounds funnysupported
why dont we lump all of these into one ui redesign thread instead of having the front page of the assembly hall peppered with these one offswe already know that ccp is addressing the context menus from one of your other threads so lets let them work on that problem and focus on something new that they arent already working on mmkay
given that theres only a couple hundred people who have ever seen this interface im fine with them making a special point of raising it
i dont mind them raising the point but do we really need a separate thread for every single this option is too close to that one discussions
the reason is due to how the csm votes if you have a list of 5 items having a delegate not like one could mean he votes no when we talk about it with ccp it is very likely theyll be grouped together
thats a legitmate reason i retract my previous concern in that case carry on my good manoh and supported
im taking this request from something i wrote in the ships  modules forumive seen a lot a very lot of threads devoted to nerfing or buffing specific weapon systems every poster has their pet idea for what specifically will fix a weapon system and theres almost no consensus on what it will take i think we can all agree that while turrets at any size have some issues it is large turret weapon systems that need to be balanced the most weve seen a lot of changes come  nanonerf hp buff laser buff etc  that have left some weapons in the dust instead of an idea like give projectiles 25 more alpha i would like ccp to rebalance the large turret systems according to the following principlesclose rangea battleship with large autocannons that is moving and not webbed should significantly outdamage a battleship with large pulse lasers at close around 10km not 1km rangea battleship with large blasters should unconditionally obliterate anything inside its optimal rangea battleship with large autocannons should significantly outdamage a battleship with large blasters at blaster optimal  falloffa battleship with large pulse lasers should significantly outdamage any other battleship at pulse laser optimal rangelong rangea battleship with large artillery should significantly outdamage other long range turret ships within its relatively short optimal artillery should have a long gradual falloff rangea battleship with large beam lasers should outdamage other turret ships at its optimal rangea battleship with rail guns should have unmatched range and do the best damage at its maximum optimalwhether it takes rebalancing weapon stats ship bonuses or ammo stats all of the above things should be true of a standard ship fitting for each race it isnt true currently do the math do the modeling do whatever it takes to make sure that each weapons has an ideal range that makes it the most superior option available at that range
this looks good supported
unfortunately that idea is worthless for practical useit can create some interesting philosophical discussions thoalso people should stop confusing assembly hall forum with features and ideas discussionstop spamming crap
right so what makes it worthless for practical use you have nothing to back that statement upand i dont see how this thread is any different from any other on page one of this forum
stop trolling crapthat saidopyour a bit off the wall here so i think you should focus on the crux of the matterany gun no matter what kind youd think that at point blank range right in front of the line of site of any large barreledlaser gun youd get some sort of dps back but you dont due to the mechanicsthere needs to be a shotgun affectno bonuses no funny funny stuff just thatcall it a skill if you will broadside combat or somethingnow of course as our troll so balanently and ignorantly put it will never happen because it would require a near total rewrite of the systemso what i just suggested is at best a close compromise without rewriting the laws of physics n the gameso yes good point not so good idea good intention but good luck not gonna get very far im afraid
thanks for the support and though my hopes arent immensely high ccp said theyre taking a look at balancing for the winter expansion and i can only hope its a holistic approachas for being off the wall yeah it may sounds nuts but heres the thing everything i listed is how ccp intended these weapons to work from the getgohybrids were supposed to be great at very close and very long ranges lasers were supposed to have the longest range close weapons and big hurting beams from mediumish to long ranges projectiles were supposed to move around to fight one or the other and use falloff against large damage or higher damage against someone with better rangeits just that so many massive changes have been made theyve fallen out of wack large projectiles are currently bad in about every situation and large blasters lost a lot of hurt with the web nerftracking nerfi think they just need to look at how they perform today and tweak each of them so they all have their own niche again
current situation the main ui for looking at market buysell orders doesnt give any insight into which ones belong to you therefore you cant easily rightclick the order and modify it from that screen you instead have to flip back and forth between two proposed solution highlight buy and sell orders which belong to you in another color and add the ability to change the orders from the main screen where list is generatedpros itll save the user and the database the pain of loading both windows constantly as they cross reference their buy and sell orders
nothin quite like buying something only to realize you bought it from yourself

this was already suggested too
im glad youre being so helpful as to link where it was already suggestedoh wait you arent
when what was ccps answer
im still not here to hold your hand you are on the csm now sir you should be able to look up the previous issues pretty easily and realize it was already asked forlet me quote
i still cant fathom how this would cause any lag whatsoever i have my wallets orders tab open i have the market screen open my computer checks which orders of mine are of the appropriate item type and in the appropriate region and highlights those on the display this never needs to hit the server at all and any sane implementation should be almost physically incapable of causing server lag
it could introduce lag into the database calls depending on how the database is set up ive seen it happen beforefunctional issues aside  if youre a manufacturer why are you buying things youre obviouly making for sale it seems to me it would be a better financial practice to make them and keep some for yourself since you can presumably make them for less than you can buy themif youre a trader i have no sympathy since you obviously dont know what youre selling things for
there are work arounds label your orders with a unique ending identifierie7229265 isk
this is a useful feature the fact that it doesnt exist yet is one of the main reasons why i hate trading if it would cause heavy lag dont implement it if not please yesa small additionit would be also nice to have the complete list of mycorporation sellbuy orders in a very short description in an additional tab on the left side of the market window where the item browser and search function is clicking on an order on the left side activates the buysell order overview on the right side for the respective item with the order highlighted or marked which has been clicked on the left at the moment these tabs are at the right side on the left side they would be more useful and avoid permanent jumping between two tabs
whereas the number of settings that must be adjusted and readjusted for every bpc research or manufactured is a profound burden on my time allowed to play eve and whereas time spent clicking buttons is time poorly spent i propose the following1 implement a template system that allows inventorsmanufacturers the ability to load a previously defined job setting 2 this would function very much the same the new feature that allows pilots to save and load their ship fittings3 players would have job loadout templates that would define which posfacility would be utilized how many runs were being manufactured or what type of item was attempting to be invented4 inventorsmanufacturers would be able to select x bpcs to run then load the saved job template and the script would automatically assign said jobs to the open researchmanufacturing slots5 the inventormanufactuer would only need to highlight the desired bpcs rightclick select inventmanufactur then load the template and click ok the normal job summary screen would then load and they could click ok to execute the jobim not asking for any t2 bpos to be torched im not asking for a higher return on investment i just dont want to have to spend 15 to 30 minutes setting up a run of 200 ogre iis anymore ccp helped out the combat pilots with the option to save fittings please carry that love over to the inventor and manufacturersthanks
if it takes you longer than about 2 minutes to set up a manufacturing job youre doing it wrong
not true when you have 20 bpcs to run or to invent it takes an unreasonably long time to go throught the itterative process 20 times
a manufacturing job might take 2 minutes 10 manufacturing jobs  10 invention jobs take more like 10 to 20 minuteshow long does it take to fit a ship they added functionality to streamline ship fits
something needs to be done even having the dialogs remember the last hanger used would be nicescienceindustry need to have its ui revisited
im not arguing the time necessary for multiple runs the ops comment was specifically that it took him 2030 minutes to set up one 1 job of ogre iisof course multiple jobs take longer  thats the nature of any repetitive task if one execution takes y time then 20 should take 20y
no i said 200 ogre iis that is 20 jobs as they can only be manufactured 10 at a time not to mention the 40 or so invention jobs required to invent that many ogre 2 bpcsits just too much clickingagain if they we willing to save the combat pilots 60 seconds with the ability to save and load ship fittings why not save the manufacturers some time with their niche
quantum rise was supposed to do that if my memory serves me rightcsm2 also requested for batchjobs however im not sure its very high on ccps list to do
it was promised for qr but then they threw out all the industry stuff except the orca and made it a lag patch im a fan of fixing lag of course but this was a tragic loss put it back on the priority list please
then i sit corrected
whether 5 or 10 or 20 or 30 minutes in any case this is trueand please also templates for t1 production from bpos and copying blueprints
its fine as it is invention should be worse than bpos
why
invention is an indepth and critical analysis of existing t1modified modules and prints the result is a working product but its not as efficient as the license holder it requires more resources and manufacturing time to come up with the generic form of the official tech 2 module in short look at trade secrets thats why
this
i have a feeling everyone that say it is fine as it is either have t2 bpos or are part of an alliance with r64 moons
and youd be wrong
my corp is not in an alliance we own no x64 moons and we own no t2 bpos in fact i am myself a pretty serious inventor  i have three characters dedicated fulltime to an invention business and will be starting up a fourth next week and i still oppose this change it doesnt make sense furthermore why would i assume it would help me if stuff becomes cheaper to make itll just drop the selling price and make it easier for new people to get into my markets besides the buyer will see the gains from this change not the inventor
require anchored pos to be online to remain anchored if a pos sets offline for a fixed number of days then it unanchors or is destroyed as hits the moons surface
id say 30  45 days of it being offline it despawns like they did with cans and whatnot awhile back just get rid of em on the dt
cans and poses are entirely different beasts if you want to clear out dead poses wardec their owner
while i really like the idea the only version of it i could see ccp doing would be pos is destroyedpersonally the idea of looking long abandoned poses sounds fun but poses represent a significant isk sink and i doubt ccp wants those resources back in the economy
agreed if it aint online either make it go away at downtime or let someone claim it as their own no squatting on moons without firing up the pos
allow the hacking skill and subsequent training schemes to take down offlined pos after a war dec have it require an inordinate amount of time and quite possibly a isk sink in the form of npc goods requiredin this regard someone could setup a business of repo man for the starsnot all of us enjoy logging in 10 friends to plink at a pos all night

i love you so much kuzim
i agree
im down
im starting to agree with the idea of rules for posting in the assembly hall with immediate permanent forum bans for anyone who violates themthere is already a set of ships that can ignore bubbles theyre called strategic cruisers get one learn to fly it and enjoy laughing at the nontargeted warp interdiction fields as you calmly zoom away from them
if ingame bans are what it takes to clean up these forums then i gladly support it trolls have an entire restoftheinternet for their crapben
i try to avoid caod but from what ive seen the biggest problem is some combination of epeen waggling and rampant alliance fanboyism people act like idiots because they want to be hardline xenophobic nationalists for their internet spaceship countries oddly we dont do this for real countries any more but for fake countries its still funpresumably because all the blood shed in the resultant wars is virtual really i dont know how harsher penalties for bans would make people less likely to act like smacktards when theyre in caod bashing other smacktards
i got forum banned for 6 months for participating in a z0r chain in some worthless caos thread that was going to get locked anyways then i had to run for csm in a brand new alt created specifically for that reason hth
supportedthough i expect this thread will simply be alt trolled out of existence
clearly you havent been reading the same forums as i have d
yes only one char per account should be able to post and main banned  all accounts bannedingame bans for forum misbehaviour should be enforced as wellimo people under forum bans shouldnt be able to run for csm nothing personal though reason for this is that i believe a csm should display exemplary behaviour and at least interact with the community in a reasonably polite manner if you did something that warrants a forum ban you do not meet those criteria i think

german diplomat 1918 its fine we didnt want alsacelorraine anywaysfrench diplomat 1940 losing our country in six weeks has only freed us from the shackles of largescale warfare were going to head to npc spacealgeria and have fun out thereno i think its safe to say that even in the era when nationalism was cool people werent nearly as pigheaded about it as they are with alliances really it resembles sports teams more than nations  most people at least try to justify their patriotism as being the result of their country being better than others but sports fandom is gleefully irrational im a leafs fan because i cheer for the leafs and no better explanation is really possible most of caod seems to have the same attitude  amateurish propaganda to back up an opinion that they hold for no particular reason except that theyre going to root root root for the home team
hah nopelosi is that you
are you really saying that posting in a caod z0r chain or some similarly trivial offence warrants an ingame ban and csm exclusion the inconsistency of the mods as they veer between see no evil read no evil and their occasional bouts of rabid banfesting is the reason why they shouldnt be trusted with issuing ingame bans or doing anything else remotely important
current situationwhen rightclicking on modules in your hangar trash it is right above fit to active shipplease visit your user settings to reenable imageswhen rightclicking on an assembled ship in your hangar trash it is right above to make activeplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesproposed solution separate the above options further in the rightclick uipros reduce people accidently trashing their ships and modules because they turned off the popup to confirm trashing things cons it wont idiotproof the ui but it will cut down on accidents
already raised
yes but this is a much more specific proposal versus overhauling the whole menu
the answer is going to be the exact same
arent you just a font of unhelpful information
and what was the answer from ccpdid they give a timeframe when it is fixed
so you knew it was raisedthen youd know this i might add that its a fairly complex piece of code which ccp is afraid of touching its going to be a complete overhaul of the context menu if anything
lavista is right we dont need this againissueresolution4  the ui team had numerous meetings on this they have not come up with a good scheme yet they are afraid of an incremental approach to fix all the menus people would be confused with menus changing with every patch issler noted that the whole ui requires a complete revamp ccp should make sure that the solution to this problem should be part of the revamp tldr ccp agreed that some of the context menu layout is unintuitive and is working on this as part of ui revisions no timeframe specified
you actually use fit to active shipi never use that  o pthus never had the problem of dealing with the trash it commandmaybe you should stick to just dragging and dropping to the fitting service window like most people i know
i confirm that this particular strawman argument will totally blindside people from the more relevant second issue of it being next to make active and the reflexive action of clicking ok as you assume that the confirmation window is actually the you cant do that yet as your session change hasnt finishedcsm from the past should realise that ccp saying yea we know isnt enough to make issues go away unfortunately it seems to have been enough in the past to make the csms go away
i was wonderingdoes ccp benefit from plex sales now that they are deliberately putting the market into a downward spiral by nerfing lvl 4 missions making it so that higher quality ores arent readily availiable in most 00low sec systems and ratting in most belts is lame
what
ich habe 17 mio isk kann ich helfen
hug or tissue i cant decide
you see im not the only one who sees everything broken
im just looking for reasons why ccp is allowing these things to remain broken and then breaking it more im wondering if it is money driven
do i smell a carebear
do i smell a dumbass
no that putrid stench that makes one ready to throw up that nasty little lunch or thing they thought was so horrid it was something out of a garbage can is a troll
contreversial yes inflammatory yes this does have some relevance and is not off topic im sure if you guys think hard you might actually understand where im coming from this sort of thing happens when mmos start to sell certain things in game for real cash in this case ccp is selling isk for money and is it too heinous of a thought that they would actually rig the game to promote buying these
fixed
stop posting forever
fixednow go away
you guys must be on ccps payrolltraitors
i wish ccp would put me on the payroll for mocking idiots
i do that all day long for free
this coming from a goon
agreed i like very much d amoranis gives thumbs up
whats the point
what you are suggesting is impossible world resource allocation can only be assigned during downtime
what im suggesting is everything thats already happening minus a person having to fill out a form you could have something run before downtime if theres a r64 or sov holding pos in reinforced mode in a system that process would fill out the form and the person that currently receives them would do what they do right now and reinforce the node there would be no change other then a person from the alliance not having to fill out the form
i shall be supporting this
what you are asking is add program routine that at dt scan all the systems at least low sec and 00 for reinforced towers after finding the reinforced towers check the moon for r64 moon minerals then flag those systems to the devs for reinforcementproblems how many thousand towers it would check every dt why the node of my system with several r32 moons in reinforcement should not be reinforced but the system with 1 single r64 moon should be reinforced instead how many systems we will see that will not the attacked but will get reinforced reducing server resources for the rest of eve players how long will be the procedure and how costly in term of manpower at dtno thanksediti hadnt noticed thisbetter and better how many hundred reinforced node every day for youso we should now add another request to oru little program flag every sov holding pos in reinforcementand our poor dev should look some tens of systems requesting automatic reinforcements and decide who will get it and who will not as he cant reinforce them all and then get the blame of helping alliance a or b if he choose wrong
i fixed it for you
you missed this partso you nice fellow goon is asking for a scan of all the pos in 00  all the pos of r64 moons in low seccare to retract
you arent making a whole lot of sense with your arguments unfortunately
what part ofto fulfil this request ccp need a routine to scan all the pos in 00 to see if they are in reinforcement dont make sensethat list r64 moon or sov holding pos include all the 00 pos and several low sec posevery day severals of them are put in reinforcementccp has not the server resource to put teens of system in reinforcement every day without damaging all the other playersthere will be a lot of false positive where the pos is put in reinforcement but no big battle followsome dev would need to decide what system should be reinforced and what system should not based on the resources available and other requests for reinforcementsevery time some nonreinforced system see a big battle ccp would be blamed with accusations of favouritismso a big use of resources because someone dont want to make a request for reinforcement not a good idea clearer now
0checking if the moon is an r64 or hold sov or whatever conditions you want to addremove could be made part of the reinforcing process when the tower hit 25 shield the check is run and if its possitive the form is filled
severals im loving your argument heresince you seem to have such and extensive experience working with the systems and programs used to run eve mind if you post your resume here so we can begin deferring to your obvious expertise otherwise if this is just more of your backseat programing of evemaybe you should leave what can and cant be done up to the actual people who make the game
supported
that being true you still have the issue that quite often there will be more autogenerated forms than nodes available to do the reinforcing with and hence still have to be dev decisions being made and subsequently fingerpointing about dev interference on one side or another when they did or didnt reinforce a particular nodein the current situation the lack of available reinforcement is handled by the fact that people dont bother to fill in the form and then the blame can be laid squarely at their feetneither situation is great ill admit but you have to realise you are forcing decisions off players and onto the devs to the point that they can be interfering with the outcomei would have thought you guys of all people wouldnt want thatedit  fat finger syndrome 
i think that this probably will prove to be an unworkable suggestion but id favour raising it to ccp to see what they think of it theyd have a much better idea of its feasibility than we would
i fully support this idea let ccp decided the if its doable or not
current situation when looking up a solar system in the people and places screen you arent informed how far away anything is nor which region it is in this causes extra confusion when looking for two similarlynamed systems the top one the bottom one which is it the only way to figure it out is to either pull up the map or set destination to each one and see where it leadsproposed solution provide the region name of solar system andor the number of jumps in the search results windowpros this fix will save extra steps in figuring out which system is the one you want
this would be quite handy
is it possible to change the background colors of blueprint copies so that they are not the same as blueprint orginals this would aid in sorting blueprints in hangers improving the quality of game play by not having to sort through dozens of copies looking for one orginal
impossible
i am amazed some people would defend a horrible ui just to avoid agreeing with some goons i cant see how anybody with half a brain could think that showing information already available in a more readable format could be a bad thing

bampcmon guys need more support i know wed all love to see this fixed
contact me in game i will reimburse you for the first week

that made me laugh and yet is sooooo trueisaac
i would like to sign this postthe font is ridiculous to read i literaly have to limit my play time because it gives me headaches if i play too longgrovel please
supportbump
i agree destroyers need some love and some pretty elaborate loving at thatthey should probably be split off into two categories similar to intereptors one glass cannon and one more tankable as a whole they should probably be brought more inline with other ships as mentioned the current implementation gets stuck with neither the right slotsstats to fit a useable glass cannon nor to fit a decent tank a split in two would be more in line with other shiptypes i cant think of any subcap ship category of which each race only has one if i am mistaken feel free to correct me
bump again sad to see so little support for this compared to other issues
you see so few support because most of eve has already given up using rockets moving to something else and getting happy there  therefore not caring about rockets anymore
current situation the jump clone timer is 24 hours this restriction can create quite a lot of problems for players who have limited play time and want to utilize this time to the best of their ability case in point you normally log in at 8pm and play until midnight on monday you log in with a fresh timer seeking something to do at 10pm in another region a battle calls for your participation you have a jump clone stored there and make the jump and have a merry good time until midnight when you log off tuesday you log in at 8pm and discover there is action taking place in your home region unfortunately you still have two hours to wait out the timer and have to miss out proposed solution i propose that a new skill be added that reduces the jump clone timer by at least hourly two max per level in skill increments it can even be a rank 10 or higher skill the purpose here is to give players a little more flexibility if theyre willing to train for it pros it will create an isk sink as players will buy the skill to gain more flexibilitypvp participation will benefit from the change since players can jump inout of implants more easily or to a far away region more frequently cons increasing fun isnt a con
i think a good solution might be to be able to jump twice within a 48 hour period this allows people to conduct business and come back while still limiting clone jumping to the same number of overall jumps takers
is it just me or are goons actually making sensible wellthoughtout forums posts now me faints
no
this idea is excellent please implement it
i support the general principle although i think this is a better solution than a skill to reduce the cooldown
i raised this during csm1 but was rejected by the csmid like to see it
i especially like the twice in 48h principle it feels right for some reason the skill to reduce time might be an interesting alternativei could even see both being implemented if there is anything gamebreaking about it please feel free to post it but i cant think of it
actually probably 80 of goon threads in assembly hall have been serious and 100 of avallocs even the jesters of eve have problems with parts of the game that theyd like to see fixed
24 hours is too damn restrictive you have to make the decision if your going to spend your entire day in 1 clone or another i think 612 hours would be much more reasonablea lot of people hate having to clone jump out for a 23 hour corp op and then get stuck there for the next 21 hours
no jump clones do not need a buff isaac
sorry but whats that timer for again ah less pvp well we want this game to become carebearland noremove that lame timer already no need for a skill just get rid of it alreadysupport
me too 3supportin ma goonie brosef
i can see 3060 minutes per level but more than that is ridiculous
so why not unfair trading advantage for market manipulation people can very easily get as many free alts as they want to sit in varios regions to check market pricesquick travel from region to region so someone can pop from empire out to the middle of no where at a moments notice ya cause a 6 or twelve hour timer is going to be soo much less effective at this then a 24 hour timer
this  
yes
support
id support the original but i like the quoted idea better
wwise why that explains a lot
current situation to switch between characters on the same account the user must restart the game or exit out to the login screen there is no way to esc out to the character selection screen proposed solution i propose that ccp add a button in the esc menu for backing out to character selection screen pros it will save time for players who wish to switch between alts without having to relogin completely cons there may be some coding challenges for ccp to make this request a reality
supporting the hell out of this
i think this was requested a month or so ago but yes i support it fully also id prefer options to back out to either login and to character selection  both would be timesavers in different circumstances
i support this as long as you cant switch chars when you have an aggression timer or otherwise use it as a replacement for logoffski tactics this is a nice touch that will make dealing with alts just a little bit less tedious
yes please
yes
hell yeah
this
all my thumbs goon sir

i was looking through my interface today thinking to myself it would be great if they had personal wallet divisions everyone is for it no one will be against one extra way to organize their things
the new cosmos system will provide outofgame access to ingame mail contacts and chat functions as detailed in this post i believe ccp should not make up their own api to access these functions but rather should use smtpimap for mail access and xmpp jabber for contacts and chatreusing smtpimapxmpp means that community developers do not need to waste development time writing new mail and chat programs to access this everelated content every platform that can run eve already has access to clients for these protocols many phones and other internet devices also have compatible clients either preinstalled or readily available for download this is much better than having n eve players write n clients for n platformssmtpimap means we can use the outofgame mail tools that are vastly superior to what we currently have isk spammers could be prevented from abusing this system by ratelimiting access from trial accounts or by only allowing mail that would not attract a cspa charge via the smtp service clientside filters and spam blockers may make isk spam via mail even less attractive than it is now securityconsciousparanoid players may even choose to use the openpgp or smime support in their mail clients if they feel it is necessary xmpp would not only allow outofgame chat and contact list functions but could also be bridged to ingame chat with the use of a transport naturally this transport would not allow access to the three locationdependent system chat channels since an outofgame client has no location in the eve universe it would open many new possibilities from allowing small groups of friends to talk to each other even if they arent all playing at the same time to large alliances announcing emergency ops to their members who may be available but just not logged into eve at the timeboth of these systems can be implemented as a walled garden which prevents interaction with outofgame implementations of these same systems this means that outofgame spam both incoming and outgoing would not be an issue
very much supportedaltho the google wave federation protocol would be better
yeah wave looks like it will be pretty nice and someone suggested it in the same dev blog comments thread but i didnt suggest it because i dont think it has been releaseddeclared production ready yet then again it might be by the time cosmos gets released
the protocol itself is fully documented and only needs to be implementededitactually
1 it breaks immersion2 email clients are stupidly overcomplex for this purpose3 they would have to implement the smtp stack on top of tq either way and smtp isnt a simple protocolthe chatsystem already uses an irclike protocol so nay
1 which whatever ccp is implementing with cosmos already does so thats a moot point2 an email client is only complex if coded to be complex obviously ccp would provide its own evemail client with cosmos so thats also a moot point3 not to argue semantics but smtp itself is by definition simple the only thing complex about smtp are its various extensions most used to prevent spam since this would be a closed system not directly linked to the internet with authentication those extensions neednt be implemented making this also a moot point especially with the existance of multiple bsd licensed smtp librarieshow do you come to that conclusion link to a documentationsource for thisfurthermore just because its irclike doesnt mean it can easily extended to out of the game without reinventing the wheel or missing functionality
1 any outofgame access to ingame data will be immersion breaking whether it be by cosmos webmail a real email client or by a halfarsed evemail client written for a proprietary api at least allowing real clients results in less effort on the part of the community and lets the player access their data exactly the way they want to2 nobody is saying you have to use the most expensive overdeveloped synergyenhanced enterprise groupware mail client im sure you will be able to find an email client that is as simple as you want it to be3 most of the leastsimple parts of smtp deal with servertoserver communication which doesnt apply to a walled garden and the idea is that the developers could find a way to use an existing smtpd or library to use the ingame client wouldnt have to use this smtp server anyway it could just bypass it and inject mail straight into the mail store the point of smtp would be for the use of outofgame clientsthe cosmos chat system that hasnt actually been implemented yet
supporting this
1maybe offer openid based on the eve accounts aswelledit forgot the checkbox
from what i know it is a direct effect of chaining unbroken chains dont spawn faction ships if the player that had farmed the chain leave and a new player take his belt he will usually continue to farm the big bs spawns and so not getting the faction spawns as hearsay systems heavily chained get a temporary drop in the chance of good spawns so if you break the chain after hours of chaining the chances of a faction spawns are lowerdt reset all that so the chance of a faction spawn reset it is all based on the players behaviour if you can convince people that a better chance to a faction spawn is better than chaining the triple bs spawns you will get your wish and have the same chance at all the hours if they prefer to keep the sure income of the big triple bs spawns the chances stay low
about time
good ideas
also agreeing here  dont like the mystic hoohar generators that magically make higher level rats spawn because of falcon but the rest of the post is do this do this now
good one
iskh and riskisk ratios in 00 are less than lvl4s from what i understand yeshowever im not sure that looking solely at ratting and improving that is the answerfirstly the truesec thing does it actually work that way in that case most of fountain is also broken ive gotten plenty of 185m triple spawns and just a few days ago one of my corpmates had a officer spawn in what i think is a 009 system z30sa in fountain which if i understand the argument is not enough to get that kind of spawnssecondly removing the crap spawns and replacing them with battleships only might have other consequences as it will probably result in a large increase in minerals from reprocessing which in turn makes mining less good in 00 as wellso while i agree that 00 needs to be more profitable on the individual level and possibly also change the sop for running alliances from the hold promdysp to something more interesting this mainly to allow more people to live in the space without it being crowded im highly skeptical about boosting ratting is the way to go
were keeping track of faction and officer spawns on our forums and they do pop up in chained systems it does seem that theres a disproportionate number appearing after downtime before any chaining can take place but it doesnt seem that chaining in itself prevents the spawns from appearing
maybe my wording isnt clear as i am not native english speaker but1 if you have a chain in a belt that chain in my experience dont change to a faction spawn when the bs respawn2 every belt you lock with a chain is one less belt that cant spawn a factionis something wrong in my statements i acknowledge it is possible that they are wrong i dont like chaining so i have done it rarely
do this nowim even supporting the pos mods to change truesec although the amount of truesec change is what i would argue against it would make holding even bad 00 for extended periods of time good but a maximum benefit of 04 or even 03 would suffice to fix the issue without destroying a good reason for people to want to invade better space none of this make it 1 module crap
supported
supported for the same reason
ive had both faction and hauler spawns appear in belts while i was shooting a regular spawn it doesnt happen often but ive seen it on at least a dozen occasionsedit thats part of the reason i chain worthwhile value 3m spawns in the end its a matter of personal preference if cruiser spawns are eliminated from 00 and possibly the respawn time reduced there could be less reason to chain than there is currently for those who believe as you do
a further question those spwans spawned or warped from another beltin my experience hauler spawns have the habit to warp between belts after spawning i had even regular spawns warp between belts occasionally i recognized them from the damage i already had done and the spawn being short of the ship i had destroyed no idea about faction
the amount used rig will decrease but more rigs will be used the price may go down but it could also stay the same or go up
1005025 is a good compromise imo
the initial high demand and speculation will make prices go up for sure but over time as ship after ship that were rigged continue to sit in the hanger and market demand normalizes it will likely fall below current prices
hits the issue perfectly derhund
ive had reasonably positive experiences with the gms so far but when i speak in alliance chat and find out that different gms cannot even agree on a single issuesomething has to be donefor instance a reasonably wellknown example is the capships in hisec issue even though several legal ones are flying about chribbas veldnaught for example different gms will tell you different things on the issue in any support system the same question should always receive the same answer telling someone no once and yes the next time will create a spoiled child effect where players will keep petitioning until they find a gm that will grant their requestgive them the answer they want they then have a screenshot proof and create a precedentso yeah improvements are a good idea

to be honest i personally would like to see insurance removed from the game but i know perfectly well that would be detrimental to the game
setting the uninsured payout to 10 would not protect the newbie who doesnt know about insurance the one demographic we want to protecti would instead suggest some gradual phasing out of insurance where the ability of players to take out insurance at platinum is removed first then gold insurance etcand once we see the effects of that we can start looking at removing base insurance gradually of course there would be alternatives looked at for allowing newbies to recover after losing that bs they put all their isk into
i swear some of the threads in the market discussion forums should be mandatory reading before the word inflation or deflation is ever mentionedeve has experienced inflation over the last 23 years but for the last 34 months weve actually experienced a deflationary period i wont hash the details here but prices outside t1 have been on a slow decline since apocinsurance is not a sink it is a faucet always was always will be even the devs have gone on record as saying as such
supported frankly remove the ability to insure anything from all characters over 6 months in age
the flip side of the insurance makes ship loss affordable so we have to carebear less argument is that insurance is also a massive isk faucet that is probably driving a good portion of price inflation in the game
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
insurance should be removed or changednot because of inflation or suicide ganking but because it doesnt work in reasonably way at all as it is now
all this would do is hurt the little guy the people that cant afford to loose all the ships instead of making people use smaller ship as you hoped it will just make less people pvp the people that blob bss will keep on doing that becaseu they probably have so much isk that it dosnt matterstupid idea

no

competent font editors could take the outlines from the original font and add the extra unicode glyphs required heck there may even be a unicode version of the original font out there by nowsupported but realistically changes to the client that dont deal with gamebreaking issues have a very very low priority with ccp so i dont expect it to change at all
currently local operates in real time or instant mode and constellation chat operates in delayed mode where players show up only if they speak in the channeli propose that this is reversed with local being in delayed mode and constellation being real timeadvantages of this1 socializing more people in the same chat channel constellation achieves greater interaction between players that might not otherwise meet2 this provides players with a broader source of information with respect to the proximity of their friends and enemies while removing the precision that local chat currently provides3 reduces the effectiveness of macro ratting bots that depend on local chat to operate4 allows the use of nonstandard tactics small unit tactics guerilla tactics instead of the generic blobs we currently see smaller forces can more easily skirt large blobs and attack targets of opportunity5 great compromise between the current situation and the complete removal of local as an intel tool
supporting my own thread and first
i like this one perhaps it would get constellation to see more use then it doesand as much as i like local chat as an intel source a delayed mode will probably improve the situation overall
this is something thats needed a fix for far too long now supporting this suggestion
i agree as well signedas much as id hate to see local disappear as another weapon in our arsenal this switch would be advantageous in each of the ways bellum has described and moregenerally when a new character is started about the 2nd or 3rd thing i do in the game is close out of constellation chat since this chat is given to characters at a very early stage it can act as a second or third help channel as well as the above stated socializing channel as there will be plenty more people the only problem i can foresee is the sheer amount of people that would be in the channel in certain regions forge sinq and whether or not this would cause lagserver side issues trying to cramp well over 1000 people into a channel together ccp take a look at your numbers please i was unaware as to the ratbot issue with local but there ya go another point bell also provides another point on tactics where now we just see massive blobbage when there are known to be piratesenemy players in any one system this will provide an opportunity to lend its hand to the cautious if they are watching gates and maintaining good recon and as it should be realistically be a disadvantage to the unwary as it is if you see someone that rubs you wrong in local uhh say a 10 red you can just get out knowing he will be looking for you most likely with this change you may be unawares as to who inhabits the system even if intel got through the const channel that there were piratesunfavorables in the area that system or otherwise prompting one to stay on their toes and watch the proper channels for further intel on a second note of relative realism the idea could be that everyone is on a universal broadcom constellation but the gate people either 1 have no way of relaying who is jumping here and there or 2 just dont make that part of their routine monitoring who goes in and out and only the customs guys and concord alert you when you have jumped into the wrong system  thats for piratesdisadvantages intel spreading too quickly if the channel is switched it may very well become the community intel channel which is advantageous to the general public but not to those who may want to keep their movements concealed when one person seeing them can just throw out in const hey this corpthese people are moving to this place now the entire region knows whos going where as opposed to knowing only when they show up in local or if youre doing good recon a few jumps beforeedit no i take the whole second paragraph back i didnt realize that duh constellation channel is not region channel meaning the populace would not be too extreme and what i was saying about the intel would be null and void since it would limit the range of that intel anyway being that its not the huge regions so yeah the only foreseeable disadvantage is the ability to watch for local changes p
i support this idea
i support this proposal and bellum
this would fix many of the problems with eve pvp at the momenti cant sign this enough tbh
now when i afk cloak in local i would shut down farmers in 35 systems instead of just onebut on the down side i will only have a chance of catching somebody when i enter new constellation cause all the other farmers will get safe in advance
what theres a constellation chat
totally agree with partition existing freighter holds to accommodate a ship hangar it would be great to be able to select the conversion rate between cargo and hangar space but a fixed amount would be cool tooalso support a completely separate ship to haul rigged ships withwould be nice to be able to transport 5 rigged battleships 10 would be even better
couldnt we just make a set of containers that provide ship hangar space like a freight container that provides 10x the m3 in sma space that you cant modify in space while were doing this i would also like auditlog station containers with the same thing so that we can organize our corp hangars
regardless of how it is implemented as long as its not some orca variation i agreewhy a hauling career character has to grab mining skills to get into an orca is beyond me the only people who say it is fine are the people using the orca anyhow for mining who do hauling on the side

best would be if one could toggle it per channel i wouldnt want to show it in local as wartargets shouldnt really know when im afk cloaking  on a totally unrelated topic afk cloaking should be dealt with but not by afk icon shown in local
oh look i agree with tortugan for once the wonder
adding a requirement of liquid ozone but keeping it at just 1 unit strikes me as a deliberate move by ccp it would be interesting to get some feedback to confirmas for the proposal itself sorry not supported a little death penalty never hurt anyone ben
supported random change is random
no one minds the cost the objection is that the pod is incapable of paying said costsupported
sorry cant support this onemake sure your clone is set to wake up in the right station and suicide back to your ships i agree that the 1 ozone requirement is annoying but im also of the opinion that a jump bridge with 0 fuel shouldnt be allowed to jump anything through regardless of size quite honestly if your in a battle with jump bridges nearby your logistics team should have fueled that jb and have spare fuel waiting in case its needed in case of small gang pvp everyone in the gang should be carrying some liquid ozone enough to at least jump their own ship through 2 bridges and surely not everyone in your gang died
supported
its hard to overlook the humor factor though
game needs more titan losses
im all for stupid people doing stupid things but losing something to poor design is infuriating for anyone supported
this is like system scanners analyze and recover probes buttons that are side by sidebut so much worse
i agree with the sentiment but im not sure if your principles are the right ones put simply i want different weapons to feel different the laser cap use bonus on amarr ships should be thrown overboard and replaced with something useful  give lasers a good overall set of stats but make them cost cap like whoa reallocating that bonus will make them still be plenty worthwhile i expect then give amarr ships the cap to use them properly after that sort everything by rangedamage  blasters autocannons pulses artillery beams railguns in that order blasters should do far more dps than any other weapon and have bugger all range  boost their dps probably 20 over current autocannons should track far faster than any otherto go along with the minmatar speed focus maybe give ac a smaller sig resolution than other weapon classes for a free tracking bonus and their current falloffcentric range is fine actually if it wouldnt confuse people id be tempted to give autocannons a negative range so that they start in falloff and give them better raw dps to compensate pulses should be similar to current maybe with a small nerf longrange should be the same but in a different order  arty will do awesome dps over shortish rangesthough with good falloff and it should win on tracking beams should do middling dps and have middling range rails should have extreme range and mediocre dps in practice fits will probably serve to synch these up because they all have to fly in fleet together  rail fits will use more damage mods arty fits will use more tracking computers thats fine as long as theyre balanced so that a mael a rokh and an apoc are all usable in the same fleet at the same time without anyone getting mocked for bringing the wrong one that said theorycrafting aside i like the principles behind this proposal you approach it from a different angle than i do but its a reasonable method of looking at it supported
i hate to say it but your entire post smacks of lack of understanding of gunnery mechanics as a result youve got a series of statements here which are mutually exclusive ignoring other factors like tracking and sig radius optimal range simply means up to this range your guns do 100 of their damage it isnt the range at which they do their best damage likewise falloff is simply a linear dropoff in your damage out to 50 damage at one falloff past your optimal range taking that into account it should be easy to see how you cant have for example a blaster ship that outdamages everything in its optimal very short optimal yet also a pulse laser ship also outdamaging everythingwhile large weapons certainly need to considered ignoring existing game mechanics or drastically reworking them as would be required for your suggestions to actually work probably is not the best way to do it
actually i understand the gunnery mechanics fairly well at optimal  falloff you arent doing 50 of your damageaccording to the current system youre actually doing 38 because your hit quality is reduced as well something that also works against projectiles i used statements instead of specific recommendations to leave the specifics up to ccpit is possible to have weapons that do the best damage at their ranges if blasters have unmatched damage and the tracking to back it up they dont currently and if pulse lasers and acs had the same damage but acs has such an advantage on tracking that at 10km they were doing more of their damage than lasers are that would be balanced in any case it seems like people arent understanding my original proposal very well how about i use graphs instead the follow is all three races tier 3 ships with close range guns with no damage mods or enhancements each is using their highest damage t1 ammo the target is moving at max bs speed a paltry 130ms or you could consider it having its mwd onplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesas you can see two weapons have zones of superiority and projectiles just suck compared to everything these are on ships that each have 8 turrets each have one bonus to the weaponsthe following image is what i would considered balanced i increased blaster tracking dramatically increased projectile damage a good amount and optimal slightly and didnt touch lasers if you notice everything i said in my original proposal is true about this graphplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesblasters now absolutely murder anything in their short range lasers have unmatched damage at range and projectiles now have to outrange blasters to kill them or rush in on lasers to kill them please keep in mind these are just supposed to be examples i really dont want to tell ccp how to do this i just ask that the damage curves give each ship a fighting chance at a given range what i have above is only one set of changes that would make something balanced theres a dozen ways ccp could do it edit oh and herschel i think were arguing the exact same point with different words  i dont want each turret system to be the same and want them to keep their respective feel but if you follow the logic in my first post it ends up going damagerange blasters acs pulses artillery beams rails
so the slowest races battleships all get wtfbbqd if any of the other battleships close with them
currently ac ships get wtfbbqd at all ranges in comparison to lasers currently if a blaster ship gets the drop on a laser ship it can beat iti dont think youre taking into account how small the difference in speed between battleships isthe slowest battleship is the apocalypse it goes 94msthe fastest battleship is the typhoon it goes 130msthats 36ms difference 180ms difference if you both use mwds if you both use mwd to stay in your best range youd have a full minute of superior damage before it caught up to you and due to mwd sig radius youll have better quality hits at any moment the projectile ship isnt at 100 transversal to you if youre both tanked youll have more effective hitpointsa typhoon is also never going to be able to orbit an apocalypse since the nano nerf at least which means if youre fighting it will never have 100 transversal either and youll have better hits web the phoon and youll be doing better damagetldrno an amarr ship wont get owned constantly because other ships are faster but there should be a good chance that other ships can kill it if they can close the distance in time thats balanceusing the new curve above an amarr ship isnt going to get killed by projectiles any more often and it definitely wouldnt be killed faster than it currently will if it fights blasters
you know even if the dps graphs were laid out just like you want it looking at the ranges on it the amarr ships would still make the best rr battleships simply because once you start getting 8 battleships on each side all of the amarr ships will be able to hit the primary where as the range on the blasters and even the acs leaves them lacking however the amarr principle of war is designing ships for fleet work its pretty obvious there battleships are not designed to be flown soloi think blaster boats need a acceleration boost not necessarily a top speed boost but if you boost there agility too much there align times might be a unfair advantage
the duct tape is strong with this onesomething has to be done supported
current situation a fleet commander has no quick and easy way to know the composition of the fleet he is leading in fact the popular way of taking stock is to say in gang everyone in a battleship x up which is a low tech as it gets counting ships via the overview or short scan isnt perfect either because pilots that arent in system wont be counted proposed solution that a new tab be created in the fleet window ui or elsewhere that is only visible to fleet commander andor gang boss this list would show a breakdown of all pilots grouped into sections based on the ship theyre currently piloting if they arent in system their ship type wouldnt be counted to save on server load this list would be created as a person joins the fleet and would only need to be updated when a ship is destroyed or the pilot undocks from a station examplebattleships 20apocalypse 10pilot name pilot namemegathron 10pilot namebattlecruisers 3etcand updates each pilot to capsule section as soon their ship is destroyedpros the fleet commander can focus more on strategy and the battle than wasting time counting ships and figuring out how many are being lost cons it could potentially create more lag depending on how much the database calls affects server
supported but dont most large fleets organise themselves into supportbscap wings anyway
even with a 50 man fleet of subcaps you will still have a wide variety of ships in your fleet
itd probably be ugly trying to find a way to present this data usefully but itd be less ugly than the mechanisms fcs can use currently supported at least in theory
its a good idea on the list of suggestions to uihopefully ccp will put some dev time into this soon and bring our antiquated ui into 2009 also kind of offtopic but related to ui my suggestions
great idea
i use my wallet for this purpose since you cant adjust corp orders someone else has setfor some stupid reason your wallet lists every order you can modify which is 98 of the ones you need to care about it sits in its own window so no tabhopping
every market order has an orderid which is sent to the client with the market data presumably the orderid is sent for each order in your personal and corp order lists your client also gets notified each time a personal or corp order is changed the obvious solution would be to keep a cache of both of those lists on the client side and correlate them with the market data there no extra serverside processing required
actually i do the same in most cases but it requires adjusting both windows to a size that they do not overlap much to avoid windowhopping well we are talking only about a few mouse clicks less and improving the overview a bit so maybe peanuts but perhaps also peanuts to program this feature
man someones upset about not being on the csm anymore
maybe the op would consider mass momentum warp lag ei the bigger the ships mass the longer it takes to get full speed during warp just a thought
yeah that would be a good idea to make eve bigger again on shorter warps eg interceptors cant take advantage of their warp speed because the acceleration takes too long
no shoot iti really dont see what ppl are on about with this issue its like seeing pos is an affornt to their religion or somethingmaking pos have to be online at all times breaks the profitability of many areas of the gametake for example a rorqual used for compression the compression costs fuel for the rorqual while the rorqual needs a pos to sit at for the duration now lets say its a monthly job the pos just got made to cost 10000x more in fuel by having to be online for no reason at all while you were already losing a lil isk by compressing meaning you scrap that profession meaning others cant find minerals as cheaply meaning your ship costs go up and you cant afford to buy a bs to shoot at an offline pos p
it requires only one t1 hauler to get pos up to take down even offline pos takes more people and lots of time while alerting owner and placing themselves to be shotoffline pos should unanchor blow up or just disappear or be otherwise completely free to take it would be only reasonable it isnt so difficult to keep them fueled if you really want
just shoot it or pay someone else to shoot ityou guys are complaining about offlined poss its offline just shoot itwith it being offline you dont have to worry about stront timers and with recent changes all mod currently anchored around the pos become yours once the tower is taken down so suck it up spend some isk get some bss and go take that tower down instead of begging the developers to do it for you cause your too lazy to do it yourself empire poss generally have labs worth 90 mil each low sec poss will have assembly arrays or reactor arrays if there is a sma you may just get free ships as well eve is a game of risk if your not willing to take the risk you should not have the rewards

they couldnt afford us
so you think that because they created a method for letting players trade game time they now have an incentive to ruin their own game thats moronic its not like selling plex gives them extra money  ccp just sees it as people paying for game time ingame transactions to separate the payor from the recipient are irrelevant to their bottom line i think they could afford me but apparently rewriting the game code to make it all work properly is too expensive bunch of whiners imo

no way to know if they came from others or just spawned but i think the latterin my experience all spawns normal hauler faction and on up to officers will warp off randomly gate spawns seem to only warp to other gates and belt spawns seem they only warp to other belts thoughit seemed to me sometime after they removed npcs from the directional scanner early 2007 warping off increased in frequency that may or may not have increased again with apocrypha 10 this year this is only personal observation and highly subjective it may be true that nothing has changed at all although i tend to doubt it

not supported youre suggesting introducing random chance to the game and in a game with pvp as hardcore as eve the more random chance factors involved the worse it gets a crystal could theoretically last years without shattering or it could shatter on the first shot depending on your luck
look the post aboveseem more a nerf than a boon to crystal usersa option to eject damaged crystals remotely or when in a unfriendly station would be much more useful
introducing random chance isnt this the game with a module that has a random chance of shutting down enemy targeting for 20 seconds

id go for it provided the afk indicator actually does what it says to do  showing an afk status when idle not when a pilot says he is but is in fact ratting like mad during a cta
yeah just wait til that one guy in the pod in front of you jumps though and your carrier gets stuck by 1 ozone i mean its a stretch but knowing this game its happened at least once
the problemcurrently you can setup a contract to a single pilot a corporation an alliance or everyone when using contracts internally within a corporation single pilot is too limited a contract to the entire corporation is too broad we may not want just anyone in the corporation to move that 50 million tritium yes we would be able to tell who ripped us off but i would rather limit who has the option to do so from the beginningthe solution corporation divisional contractsthere are two ways i can see this being implemented both being acceptable solutions it could also be taken a step further and both solutions could be addedoption 1 contracts to titlescontract issuer would get an option to setup contract to one of the corporation titles limiting it to a group of preset members this option would provide the most flexible solution in terms of what a corporation could do directors and ceos would be considered having all titles accepting pilot would still get the option between accepting it so items go into his hanger or accepting for corp so items go into deliveriesoption 2 contract to divisionthis option is a little bit more limited as contracts to the corporation would only have seven options for groups name of group would be set by the hanger division names there would need to be a new role added for each division can accept contract for divisionconclusionboth of these options would allow corporations to fine tune logistics making it easier to distribute materials and task it would also help improve corporation security basically giving a key to the filing cabinet to only a selected group of pilots
this i like for the idea of letting corporations run likewell like corporationssupported
seems very similar to further expanding the use of corporation contracts as a sort of internal mission generator in a limited fashion obviously supported
very good idea supported
supporting because its so bloody obvious make them bpcs red or greentinted instead thatd be niceand if ccp going to keep ignoring nobrainer proposals were should keep repeating them until they listen no matter how long it takes its not like were in danger of running out of internets
this repeating the request will not make it happenccp is working to a major databse overhaul but it is a thing of years not minutes as it impact a lot of other things if it is done it will be in one of the extra large patches something like the one that made premium mandatory and probably the sum of the changes in a patch like that would make a number of old pc incapable of running eve
not to mention likely to open a can of wormsrewriting the db to that degree will open up other stupid bugs and glitchesi really wish people would stop making this stupid requestnot that the request is stupid requesting it for the billionth freaking time is stupid

its hard to deny that the raven state issue apocalypse imperial issue megathron federate issue and tempest tribal issue are possibly the most valuable ships in the entire game worth more than a titan due to their ridiculous rarity however this makes them simultaneously effectively worthless nothing more than something to brag about because theyre so valuable that theyre effectively impossible to use for anything because of the risk of losing them and the people who own the few that exist will probably never part with them at least not for a price 9999999 of the players in this game could ever afford so my very simple suggestion is begin ultrarestricted production of the ships againnot by players of course but by the original makers the ships arent unique the same way that say the gold magnate was their descriptions describe them as simply being the highest honours awarded by their respective empires a valuable reward not some legendary item of which only a handful were ever made so why dont we just let them be issued by the empires again what im proposing is that one of each ship is issued each year to a single pilot how this pilot is determined is something i havent quite worked out im open to suggestions but it might be a good idea to award them as ultimate rewards for contributions to factional warfaretheres really no reason not to support this proposal the way things are the empire faction bss might as well not exist this suggestion wont destroy the value of them their current value is effectively nil since their owners wont part with them but cant really use them either but does create at least a small chance that you might some day actually see one
supporting my own topic of course
need more info as to how this ultrarestricted production would take place
10mil lp maybe or maybe only available via factional warfare for completing something extraordinary i dunno but i agree there should be more of em around
they got for around 80100bn atm see recent auctionslotteriesassuming the usual 1000 lp  1m isk you would need 80100m lp to reach similar valuesbut i think those ships shouldnt be handed out againif you really want one ask the current owner
i have an idea how about linking them to faction warfare as you said they are the highest award given by the empires how about the person that earns the most lp from faction warfare in a year gets one of those ships depending on which faction they are working for
as amusing as it would be to crash the value of previously priceless ships and watch the owners of the existing models scream in horror im not convinced that it is really necessary to implement a system that has no effect on 9999 of the playerbase and drops ships that would still be worth tens of billions of isk into the lap of a handful of lucky winnersif theres a need to see more rare ships flying around in eve a better start would be to boost some of the terrible faction ships that already exist so that theyre actually worth flying
this although id wager that the guy who owns the majority of them really doesnt care about how much theyre worth still this is the wrong approach
according to my friends that used to be in foff hurley actually did this they were only moving 20 jumps though their own space though so it wasnt too bad one minute 100 or so bs were sitting waiting for the bridge to open and the titan disappears then they get a message about how they can either wait for his cap to recharge or just start using the stargatesoh and while we are at it can we do the same with the towers manage and offline are right next to eachother
seriously
pos mods at moons without towers were changed so you could unanchor them some time before apoc 10 i believe this was in late 2008 if a module is incapacitated you need to repair the armor and structure damage first
thanks for the information with the amount of time im afk and with what a t1 fitted bs insurance cost i think i could make quite a profit off this charge like 100 million or whatever  i get to keep the mods and ill roll the tower sounds like the geddon would take forever but it would be on a separate account that can just sit afk for all i care ive heard that anchored towers dont rep shields but they get some back at dt is this true and if so how much
really name a single other area of the game it would breakalso how do you propose shooting a pos in highsec where the corp who owns it no longer exists
ive never seen a pos owned by a dead corp if they exist then yes i prefer killing them but if it applies to live corps no
oh no think of children of dawgs too many people just want to keep a brotha down
the titles which one is attributed by the corporation management are not shown anywhere for the own character they are listed under the pilot name of another pilots info but not in the extended own character info
is that really important
of course  not
rightclick your own ship  show info  click on the pilot icon tadaathough its a bit elaborate an info button on your character sheet may be better as your character sheet doesnt show everything bounties titles etc
maybe corp roles instead in a subgroup in the character sheet
a small but reasonable thing to support
werent you telling me in the other thread that minor issues could already be dealt with quickly if so it wouldnt seem like it should be a problem to raise one supported  other people being able to see more info on you than you can is silly
my point being that theres other small things which would be better to fix than this
supported for the last 7 months to the year ive had untitled mysteriously stuck in my damn title space on top of anything else or something to that affecta more direct approach should be allowed for titlesminor yes but its nice to see the hello my name is badge on various peopleoh and not everyone sees this glitch but its annoying as hell when you have to answer the friggen question for the 100th time
drop the requirement to cynosural field theory 4pros black ops will be used morecons too many cloaked fleets and more cyno altsdiscuss
agreed
i prefer making underused difficult things better not easier not supported
no if you want to be able to use this particularly powerful and specialised tool you should put some effort into it
lets discuss the fact you dont like having to train something to level v for the privilege of using a moda cyno when popped can be seen by pretty much everyonea covert cyno however is stealthed and will not openly broadcast to everyonesomehow i think making this skill available earlier is a bad ideanot supportedas the previous poster said put some effort to it
you know that covert cynos can only be used by black ops ships right more people capable of using covert cynos does not mean therell be caps appearing out of nowhere to gank people
thank you captain obviousi was assuming the said op wasnt that brain dead
not supported black ops cynos should require high skills to implement given the strategic advantage black ops fleets offer
well cov ops cynos should definetly have high skill reqs but a bit over the top atm imo maybe a new skill rank 1 or 2 that need to be taken to level 5 which has cyno 4 as a pre req only cyno 4 is not enough but cyno 5 is a bit over the top but we cant have it take cyno 4 and a half so the new skill would be a way to get around that
no get over it and invest the time or dont use the bloody things
not supported effort is a requirement of eve
and how does this improve anythingall your doing is making a simple situation more complicated
two things 1 bump 2 proper wikitype formatcurrent situationall issues raised by the csm go through the same process whether they are minor ui tweaks or massive overhauls of sovereignty and pos mechanics proposed solutionallow issues to be tagged by users as minor and put through a simpler process requiring less effort on the part of the csm and ccp specifically do not requitre explicit ccp answers and have minimal time for debate csm or ccp may upgrade an issue to normal status if they feel the minor tag is in error prosallows more issues to be raised without clogging up the agenda and pushing important issues offconsplayers might abuse it to get their issue in without enough scrutiny
yes get this done im tired of seeing no responses or feedback for ideas brought forth to the csmfailure to communicate anyone
even if i dont think it will keep people from asking again and again for the same supposedly minor thing to be brought at the attention of ccp for the nth time it can helpso supported
yup make it happen
i considered supporting this but changed my mind this would no doubt create a unnecessary load on the server as calculations are constantly run to track distance and adjust speed to prevent a hard collision
i dont see how it can require more calculations then it is now right now ship stops after hitting 0m distance just adjust the distance to say 150m and the ship will kill its engines at that point and will continue to slow boat until it reaches all stop no extra calculations and no bumps the bumbpage is caused by ship going too close to the target its not because it is programmed that way at worst you can add a set of stop at this point when approaching value to each individual ship according to their mass and speed and thats it theres no need for complex calculationsits a minor issue but i support it additionally having a ram option would be niceedit numbers are there as an example only
changing this will have an impact on ship bumping aswell so before you support this topic consider also the pvp side bumping is used to prevent ships from reaching docking  jumping range and docking games are considered an issue afaik im not saying that bumping ships is a good feature just saying that it is used as a counter to docking games therefore those 2 issues should be combinedand i should read a thread before replying
you mustve read my mind if not for that i would support
in game bans is bad in my opinion unless you have engaged in real bad behaviour like a racist posti dont think that people should necessarily be confined to use their main only but getting gagged on 1 character should gag all characters owned by that person on all his accounts when it comes to forums i believe that who ever runs this forum should have 2 main sections one being freespeech lowmoderation and one being heavily moderated there are two things that you want to do when you go to any forum 1 you want to get your opinion out no matter how serious or trivial the subject2 you want to inform yourself without having to read through the same type of unhelpful posts over and over again having to read yet another drake passive setup ninja salvaging is theft 1111 or eve is dead  topic  post is just a waste of time the same goes for meaningless topic titles such as i had a brilliant idea  or damn you ccp  a little less common is the how do i use mining crystals posted in crime and punishment but it happens so i support heavy moderation and more consistent and severe forum bans ingame bans should only be applied to the most extreme cases at the same time some places on the forum need to remain free speach areas where the wordfilter does most of the moderation and of course one character ban binds all your characters

could you guys please make it so that we can tractor the wreckscans of other people in our alliance without having to gang them thanks
you need to create a thread in the assembly hall before the issue can be raised
i want to point out that these issues have already been raised so theres really no point in raising these again given the fact that they are just going to take time from other important issuesandthat is already possible under the current system
most of the individual pieces are in place yes a process for actually seeing that they get used when appropriate doesnt seem to be
reraising issues that previous csms have decided not to take to ccp is politics at work reraising issues that ccp has dismissed in the past or given a low priority is lobbying for reconsideration both are worthwhile
after discussing it with avaaloc i removed avallocs trash it issue since that was discussed in csm1the other issues raised by avalloc do seem to be unique after a search of evelopedia and anks wiki
any chance well get the meeting notes of the previous meeting before this next one 
yes yes yes
yes

more alts amiright i dont know how you all see this as something good less and less teamplay and more and more altplay horrible sorry avalloc wont support this one all the rest are nice 
supportedmight also solve issue of being told you are in a line waiting to login you only wanted to change character but since you had to logout you are boned

it should already be that way
can we get the buddy list to do the same thing as whats proposed here too
1 any oog client has already given up on immersion and this isnt a particularly immersive game to begin with 2 the complexity of email clients is irrelevant because they already exist and have been written by someone other than ccp3 were talking about longstanding ietf standards track protocols here there are an assortment of existing implementations foss and otherwise ccp can pick the one that best suits their needs
supported this is a basic risk vs reward issue that is the heart of eve
supported not only ratting is boring but the rewards dont cover my pvp lossess
and is it just me or did the last patch change something in ratting i have been a ratter in providence for months and my income has been cut in half in recent weeks did they change something to make the systems perform better i honestly havent seen a good chain in a long time this is making risking tech 2 cruisers substantial since i have to work for a long time to cover the 200 mill it can take to buy and fit one whats going on
agree maybe the second screen is just black or you can choose a background for it and you can place all your windows there
the cheaper rigs give smaller ships more versatility making fights last longer and have a better chance at killing your opponent and survivingif we do as the op states then the bonus will be almost useless and their wont be a point to even using the smaller rigs on the ships because it wont be in the correct ratiosthumbs down from me
if the sproblem is really riskbenefit then the fix is not a mobile mining gun the fix is to change loot tables refine to increase the value of highend minerals and change the distribution of said minerals however  if this idea goes ahead then i would propose that the gun must be tied to a ship if that ship warps off or is destroyed than tht gun goes offline that ship should have to target the enemy ship and order the gun to attack like a drone and all guns should be too large for a hulkexhumer to carry without expanders fitmining is pretty fail right now and needs help but the last thing we need is to empower macro miners more as they are part of the reason mining is so damaged
tbh this is an awesome idea which i 100 support except for one part  shouldnt you just be required to have corp roles to access corp orbiting hubs not alliance ie corp with most towers in system  only corp able to useaccessanchoronline these substations and colonies  only requires sov 23 for these not 4dont support the idea of a new ship class for destroying the stuff though that should be left 100 with dreads

and gun damage is random so is overheating so is pos targeting so are combat boosters in fact production of about 95 of all t2 and every single named good are based on random chance too  no really scary thing is i agree with you on this one i just dislike ecm whining
you know thats a good point and i wish id thought of it sooner doesnt mean im wrong about random chance being a bad thing
id prefer the ability to combine damaged crystals into fixed crystals rp wise it could be explained by taking parts of one crystal and reinforcing an another with them or something i dont really care how its explained in the rp aspect im sure a good and satisfying explanation can be found but it wouldnt ruin the reliability of the crystals if they could shatter at any second youd have to bring extras of each type with you so instead of being forced to carry 12k rounds of ammo for each gun like now which is bad enough youd have to carry 24k rounds of ammo for each gun since youd need a spare set just in case the first break being able to fix the crystals would solve the issue with selling unused ammo while still not making it impossible to know if you currently have ammo for a lifetime or just 1 shot with you
lol wait a 11000 chance in breakingi would train amarr cause theres almost no way in hell youll hit that 11000 chance in a looong time
approving messageservice
disagree all you are doing is moving the problem not solving itif you make constellation real time and local delayed then all people will do is close local window and open constellation then use that for intel
just constellation real time is a lot more inaccurate than local think its a good idea at least its better than the current local chat and this will make macros life a lot harderi pretty much like that how its currently used in wormholes
i was totally against any change to the way local chat works until i read that your proposal is awesome it would nerf local but boost our view of remote systems and make gatecamps more predictable oh and blasters forever one day they will be fixed bellum
would be nice for corp alliance and those in my buddy list
eve is a bit crowded right now it feels like 00 is just an extension of empire with extra camping in npcspace and a iskdominated posspam war in sov truth be told 00 warfare doesnt feel like warfare it feels like a glorified blowupathon where whoever can buy and field the most useless towers owns the space and gets resource wasting rightssimply put 00 feels too small 00 warfare is what eve seems to boil down to for a lot of us and there is very little free room to roam and explore there is a subtle romanticism about 00 that makes it feel open and uncontrollable until you try to live in it then the first alliance that happens to fly by see a high local and scan you gets to have fun making your life a living hell if you are in npcspace i hope you like station games if you are in sovspace i hope you like endless pos bashingthe 00 experience needs to be revamped and i have a few proposals please tag on posts with what you want to see as well cause god knows im not the only person here who plays eve and knows what they want from 00 here are a few points i find are problems or potential changes1somehow you can jump 10 systems without seeing another soul but anyone passing by or even looking at the map can spot an out of the way corp or alliance setting up and go beat the snot out of them it takes almost no effort changing the way local and map statistics work is a step in the right direction admittedly making eve bigger shouldnt be the highest priority making changes to sovereignty and to general 00 pvp should but eves population is expanding and the space is not2when it becomes officially necessary to start expanding eve it should be done via periodic additions of new sov regions this would add a great warfare component where alliances vie for new space that would be a massive component of pvp and gameplay massive and gamechanging3new regions farther out from empire would require a level of logistical finesse this would majorly stimulate capital and regular production while theoretically one could eventually produce everything they need to hold out in their own region controlling that region would be much more difficult than it normally would multistop supply jumping would become essential keen logistics would become a necessity warfare and space control would require many levels of competance and cooperation between alliances moreso than now at least4the game could really use the addition of advanced poss this is my answer to the pos spamming aspect of sovspace right now winning sov space is as simple as shoving a pos on every moon filling it with stront and amassing the proper defense when they come out of reinforced what sov space needs is a nuance of strategy beyond what currently exists poss should have an important role to play in the defense of a region i think the regular sml poss should still be around for nonsov and small corpalliance use just not sov there is a strong notion going around that ccp might make poss work off planets instead of moons with a single reaction type per system i like that idea and somewhat incorporate it here after all getting essential reactions from a single system is too easy each pos type is an essential yet customizable component of sov control herelogistics pos storage of supplies maintenance of ships bridgingcynos effects increased pos resistance 1 for moon pos 3 for planet pos cant power indie structures or cyno jammingindustrial pos industrial functions ie utilizing reactions manufacturing and refining effects increase gun rof 0075 for moon 02 for planetsecurity pos one per system cynojams jump bridge only pos that provides sov control effects increased shields increased indie production speed 025 moon 1 planetadd what you will and debunk what you dont like

this needs to stopjust because you activate your missiletorpedo launcher doesnt mean you should  every mail please make it so you actually have to do something to get on a mail
unsuccessful troll is unsuccessful
tissue
define the phrase actually do something is a wholly objective fashion and you have an actual proposal as it stands now what you have is a whine
i can fit a civilian autocanon to my ship and  onto mails toojust because the target pops before the missiles get there doesnt mean the firer hasnt contributed to the fight dawg
if you have pilots fighting for the killmail instead of for the kill thats your problem not ccps
i rarely agree with herschel but he is totally right oh and a jammer doesnt do damage either and gets you on the mail was it useful oh yeah
remove killmails from the game completely
i lold
instead just allow clickdragmove operations from the si interface also expand the si interface to see into blueprint containers that will fix most of the problems
this if ccp really want to fix it they should do this i cant really see any reason it wouldnt work also they can do the same for the assets window while theyre at it
maybe as an alliance tournament price
i fully support the idea to inject those legendary ships into the game on a regular basis with full respect to their ultrararity one every year five every year thats stll ridiculously rare but at least they would be back out there currently theyre nothing more than archeological curios which  as the op points out  inconsistent with their descriptioni wont ever own any of those and im at peace with that  but i dislike the idea of those ships being so rare that nobody will ever undock them or part with them
once per year isnt going to get people undocking in them either as long as theyre superduperrare 95 of them wont see the outside of a station
there is a feature for broadcast location to fleet but you dont seem to be able to warp to it unless it is a static object gate station moon etc or it seems the fleet is still there i only did some minimal testing but it didnt do what i neededi was looking for a way to make a list of wreck locations left by my mission runner to leave for my salvager account so broadcast each room rather than having to meet up and drop bookmarksim sure that this fleet feature could be extended so that you can drag bookmarks out of it or right click save bookmark as
supported
supportedyes its true a spy could easily use this to move his fleet to your position without himself ever risk becoming exposed but then thats the game i agree that there should be ways of communicating a set of coordinates to corpfleetalliancelocalif this is implemented it should not be restricted as always with all information you should be careful what you say around people if your worried about a spy then dont use that option of sharing your location just keep in mind a good spy knows where you are anyways
a ui error should never be the cause of a titan kill
great idea
in terms of the new bombs entering eve it makes the sb a primary target when trying to take it down true that the torps are slow and slower the introduction of a bomb which im not sure if it actually moves because i havent found any instructions on how to use it plus the fact that it finally can warp cloaked which it couldnt before apocrypha give the little guy some very good tactical capabilities and gets far into his own but only in 00 space
fyp old bombers were death traps vs experienced pilots if you want to solo frigs then buy an af or a taranis like everyone else new stealth bombers givevaluable dps for frig gangs vs larger ships at stand off rangeexcellent lulz in the form of bombsability to warp cloaked
all they need is bomb use in lowsec and empire
supported if someone doesnt care about their tower enough to keep em unfueled for months remove it
i believe in this instance you can petition to have it removed
supported they should either unanchor or degrade over time so that they can be killed by smaller and smaller forces the longer they sit there
dont get lazy if you want something you have to work for it work hard i mean

im missing a t2 rokh kind of ship in last month ive decided to do some missions ive found out i would like to have a marauder because of salvagerssalvage thieves as a trained rokh pilot my options are kronos  because of hybrid weapons but have to train armour tanking dont like that and galente bsvargur  because of shield tank have to train projectile weapons and minmatar bsgolem  have shield tank and bs skills but ive found out i hate missileswhat i like to see is t2 rokh pretty same like it is but with marauder bonusses 100 dmg to hybrids 100 to tractor beam rangeive never tried other factions battleships in combat but i think other factions pilots would like to have t2 abaddon hyperion maelstrom or whatever ships are missingthanks for reading
who says a t2 rokh would be a marauderand you want to give the golem a chance with decent missile skills it just obliterates the rats even with cruise missiles
4 marauders is plenty new t2 bs should be new classes not old onesedit on second thought that should say 5 marauders is plenty cant forget the nightmare

actually dawg id use a golem personally
nobody says it im saying im missing decent shield tankhybrid marauder rokh is a dead end for me and  ive tried raven because everyone use ravens and everyone recommend ravens definetly a no go for me and i dont think im going to love golem much morewell thank for the idea i was thinking about something like that it look like a bad joke for me but ok somebody extremly in my eyes rich can have decent shieldhybrid marauder im missing target painter andor ab im guessing you would not be able to stretch this ship more to find a place for this 
qqwhere is the drone marauder for gallente where is the armour tanking missile marauder for minmatar where is the nope nevermind amarr only do lazorsfact of the matter is the marauders are there for each races primary niche if that doesnt happen to fit in with your playstyle then well toughif tech 2 tier 3 bs are released i do hope they are something more exciting than another bunch of marauders
goodie
tbh tier3 tech1 bs need to be redone at least the hyperion  tier3 bs already punch out the same amount of dps roughly of marauders just no easy carebear mode p
that might be the case but the beauty of small issues is that it doesnt take a whole lot of work to fix them we can probably get both without too much effort

it might be interesting to have my avatar be something other than a bit of useless decoration that sits in the corner of my screen that other player have the option of looking athaving this feature would make the game a little more realistic because for all intents and purposes my character is my ship at the moment

shouldnt there be a fourth page on this topic soon
i like this idea even if it is changed to the twice in 48 hours if you have to jump somewhere real fast you can jump back right away and not waste 24 hours doing almost nothing in your other clone the 48 hour times is there so you cant do this constantlyeither way works
i support this
no support jump clones shouldnt be logistic clones
in your original post you provided nothing but a generic no its much more valuable to the discussion at hand when you actually type out a reason behind your votethink about it if people are holding a vote and its split 5050 but everyone who supports it gives a reason and everyone who doesnt just says no which votes do you think are going to carry more weight
maybe if you spent more time researching why the majority say no and less time lecturing me you wouldnt come across as a total foolthis proposal has been brought up hundreds if not thousands of times and it has been shot down each timeim not going to repeat myself just for the pleasure of your foolish attempt at reasoningand that goes for everyone here who seems keen on getting there oh so very easy instatravel around new eden
not supported
i like both ideasyou got my support
no gospace is supposed to be big
drake first off learn to count this is being supported almost 2 to 1 seondly your trying to get ed at me because i asked people to back up there side of the arguement with a little reasoning because thats so much to ask that people explain there point of view rather then just paroting it
would like to see the timer reduced and then maybe even more clones per character
this makes hauling with an alt on same account sooooooooo much easier right now its too hard
would like
supporting this topic since 2007
supported  i love the idea prehaps post up concept art for the other races
i agree that the locking and unlocking system needs reworked but this system has some issues i would rather just have bulk votesreasons i do not like this idea1 shareholders own the assets technically the blueprints belong to them2 no time delay in unlocking bpos in your idea if a thief works his way up high enough or someone just gets tempted he just has to pick a good time to do it3 no log of actions wouldnt be able to tell who is unlocking said bpos
supporting but sadly ccp probably wont do anything with this
supporting this why not
they will if we get enough support here and when they finaly open their eyes
signed 00 needs to be more inviting
well written post the aftermath supports the rebalance
i support this change as well ratting can get really tedious due to the reasons covered in the original post
i left 00 because of how poor the return over time invested is when compared to high sec mission running not to mention security supported would love to come back to 00 if the money were there
stealing this from another topic cloaker fuelscale the amount per unit of time to fit the different level of cloakers and give ships that use cloaks to get their primary mission bonuses per level to fuel usagesprosmacros with cloaks to run and hide in 00 ratting will die cause they run out of gas eventually and become visibleno 247 having wardeced corps hiding in a dead end constellation with someone in a cov ops or even just a frigate sitting within range of a gate giving 237 intel would make wars more funcons possible market inflatation due to less macro miners in 00 or lowsecloss of subs of people who like to just buy their iskies and dont want to bother working for their iskies
forgot to press the thumb button
cloaks are fine deal with it
a cloaked ship doesnt do anything deal with it
i would support this idea if local channel was also removedno more 237 intel
cloaked ships make it so people can not find them to remove the macros and as to the local they cant check it round the clock if you can find them and kill them when they try instead of them being permainvisible
support
cloaks are limited enough without making it worse this has been raised millions of times and the vast majority are against modifying cloaks and their mechanicsno cloaks are fine
thisintel from local is the underlying problem here
not supportedjust because you wardecced them doesnt mean they cant be smart and avoid being killed
this and this and no support
afk cloakers have close to zero risk of loosing their ship everyone undocking their ship should potentially put their ship at risk especially when away from keyboard1 single cloaker can hide in a deep safe and no matter how many people and ships you throw at it you can do nothing to find him and kill himif this proposal can put a stop to this ill support it
ditto
tissue
so because you can not deal with a person who poses no immediate or direct threat to you you want to nerf itcloaks are fine as is
to a miner sitting in a hulk a sb is a potential threatthen people say you just need combat support in belt only problem is the people saying this is the same people who wont do combat support for their alliance mates sitting hours in belts watching out for an afk cloacker that might do a bomb runalso with combat support there still is a good chance to kill a hulk with a sb and then the isk damage vs cost of sb is met
whats your point
qft
that is only partially correct cloaking ships provide great benefits when involved in a bit of teamworkid hate having to take fuel along tbh especially in wspace but since ccp stated they can now add fuel bays to any ship class who knows what they come up with
greatyet an another cloaking whine threadnot supported for the billionth friggen time
correct me if im wrong but an afk cloaker cant possibly collect intel mainly because theyre afk
he also cant kill you
afk cloaker is the commonly described syndrome not the mechanism  the beef most people have with the whole thing is that there is first of all no way to distinguish an afk cloaker from an active cloaker which makes sense doh secondly that there is no way they can do anything about them scanning probing and thirdly that there is no risk element involved in cloaking activities when used to hamper operations in someones territories only when cloaking activity is used as a prelude to engagements ganks ftw also beef black ops more ktnx but thats not this afk  cloaker syndrome really it may  people off such tactics but this is something which does involve taking risk to achieve reward  it involves stuff going boomwhen im screwing around in someones backyard the poor sods have no way to do anything against my activity or lack of activity i like this they hate it most of the time i really am afk but plenty of times im not and i track names  ships peak times and lowtimes work through screenshots of towers andsoforthsucks for them tbh but i have to admit that there is zero risk or effort involved for me which does kinda go against the spirit of eve again id hate to have to use fuel to cloak but i could understand such a change it would require me to do my afk harassing as well as scouting or target mapping with teamwork involved instead of a solo zero risk activity on the side in wspace i have to say that cloaks using fuel would really make stuff prone to running into issues unless you have a pos and actually live in a hole but for some playstyles where you move around from pocket to pocket and surface only rarely it would require some adaptations the lazy part in me would hate itas i said im not supporting it but i can understand it if changes were made to subtly guide people away from the syndrome to more consistent use
hes not the one with that job thats for others most of the time remember the job of the afk cloaker is to make people paranoid fearful of ganks suspicious of moving ships etcetera wonderful job tbh especially when they start to whine in local but it is zero risk
supporting its too easy to just cloak in a system and be able to give intel with no risk at all
if hes giving intel then hes not afk
reading these threads ive a good mind to stick alts in eccmd up inties in safespots in major 00 systems and troll your probers with unprobable ships because if you nerf cloaking thats what people will move to00 carebears biggest carebears
thats the point you dont know and theres absolutely nothing you can do about itat least this proposal includes risks you can stay in a system all day but youll need to coordinate logistics for the fuel which means theres more points in which for a group to stop you being a afk cloakerat the moment its just completely riskless for a lot of gainedityou can do that if you want but youll never become unprobable in a ceptor and you wont stop anyone rattingbut yeah those cloakers definitely arent the carebears in this scenario because theyre definitely risking alot while cloaked really
not supported
supported there should be a costrisk involved for extended use of regular cloaking devices however covert ops cloaks should not have use fuel to use covert ops cloaks you need a much larger array of skills and even then only specific ships can fit them this is enough of a drawback to warrant free use
remove local u dont know if he is in the system so u can relax by not knowing if a cloaker is or is not in system since u seem to be scared by the fact that you know that he is in system
the aftermath does not support this idea
not supported a cloaked ship poses no direct threat get some medicine to battle stress if its making you nervous
im assuming that all the people who want cloaks to have fuel are 00 carebears who dock up as soon as an afk cloaker comes into your system first youre in 00 its not safe dont pretend it is and dont try to make it safe just because you cant take your hulk out and afk mine all day cause theres a neutral in your system doesnt mean something is broken it means youre not trying hard enough to keep them outnot supported
not sure if i agree with this but the claim that cloakers do nothing is just wrongaside from the intel they provide if nothing else they are an excellent souce of warp ins
it is less corruption than it appears to be incompetence and lack of consistency atleast to my eyes
i have had very mixed perfomance with the gmpetition system sometimes wits been quick and helpful other times its been 34 weeks response time and usually to say nothing in the logs and petition closed
thumbs up from me
good idea im surprised noone suggested it before supported
signed and supported keeping track on stuff like this will definitely improve the way corps supply their members and also track misuse
oh so if you remove insurance people will bring less and smaller ships to fightswrong people will just bring even more ships and will not engage unless their side has at least a clearly large margin of vistory and as you can see that means no engagement cause one side is always going to be outnumberedfirst of all i have never made isk off of insurance which fully proves it isnt an isk faucet however i understand that you must fly your ships without any fittings or cargo to make such isk off your insurance if you fit any modules especially t2 you lose enough isk easily my t2 fitted t1 hull cruisers cost me at least 10 million after getting blown up cause of the guns and plates and drones and such in no way am i gaining iskif youre looking for a world where ship losses mean significant losses you forgot to look at t2 ships the insurance covers maybe a third of the price actually i have no idea since i own few t2 ships and havent insured any of themnot supportedif you think getting rid of isk will make pvp more fun think again people will either fly crap ships which dont do anything or they will bring tons of ships and blob up not something that needs to be done
11000 per shot compared to crystals lasting for 1000 shots the average lifespan is identical
hmm looks like it got over looked by the csm yet again
a worthy cause that i fully support
once from what ive heard artillery was useful for its massive alpha strike then after ccp tripled the base hp of everything that alpha became less useful perhaps one thing that could be done to help artillery would be to give artillery a third of its current rof and triple its current damage modifier this could help with the terrible clip size of artillery too various other tweaks could help such as improving its trackingautocannons desperately need a boost too but i cant say i know exactly what that should be also change the rof bonus on minmatar ships that only have one projectile bonus to a damage bonus artillery would appreciate it
great idea supported as long as ccp increases rattingmissioningmining profits in lower sec systems to make up for the increased risk
personally i would prefer that local intel was achieved 2 methods1 exposed alliance scanners linked to pos broadcasting to all members in system through the scanner interface allow their use with 0 sov with possible additional benefits with high sov2 core probes with limited ranges which a pilot could send where ever they wished and would report real time ship types and standingssec states detected through the scanner interface
good idea pretty sure the forges constallation channel would fall over tho
yhiui
as a temporary fix i would support this
i dont know about this looks like it favors pvp and pirate corps over noobi and carebear corpswont be able to scan local if there are hostiles aroundi would say just show all players in both local and constellation
wierd proposal a solution is not a solution if all it does is move matters to a different bottleneck thats just staving off mattersbesides that youre not touching on any other elements involved with local other then omg ratters thats not just a rather limited view its a rather unbalanced view for an ah proposal it really should provide much more structure and angles
the above says nothingthe proposal doesnt replace one problem with another it doesnt move it to a different bottleneck it fundamentally changes the absolute accuracy with which players can tell which players are located within which systemsi touch on many different aspects of how local affects the game and how the changes will improve the game the proposal is very structured but the post isnt long and detailed because the concept is simple straight forward and elegant
i had similar idea  have anchorable devices like medium warp bubble that you could anchor near gates and it would add act as a secondary overview as if you were therethere would be some important limitations1 limit maximum deployed number to 52 cost of the unit no less than 5 mil3 destructible  similar to medium warp bubblethat would strike a better balance
so basically giving someone five scout alts seriously
the absolute worst thing possible would be to allow alliances intel tools while denying that same functionality to everyone else
so instead of just every hub being spammed by isk sellers every constellation will too
at a price and destructible  that is seriousif 5 mil is too cheap raise it to 10 mil maybe even 20 mil anyone passing thru the gate could destroy it its a fair trade off not to mention the hassle it would be to hail those modules in cargo an anchor them
ah so if you have to personally anchor them then pirates would get screwed because they wouldnt be able to anchor a sensor in high sec but nonpirates could anchor sensors in lowsec as well as high right or would it even be allowed in lowhighsec
you obviously failed to read the 2nd part of my post then

detailed remote intel gathering is exactly what keeps fights from happening in the first place lately ive been considering the idea of removing what type of ship it is hyperion maelstrom and just having the scanner display what class of ship battleship cruiser so that players will have a general idea of whats out there but would need to get eyes on the targets to make sure
such a device should not be anchorable in high sec  because one of its key points in destructibility and high sec prevents thati dont see a problem with low sec thoif pirates camp a certain system they can keep it clean of any such devicesbasically such a device would be a good compromise solution to removing local as intel tool you gotta admit that no local does favor attackers a little more than defender this module would restore some sense of security but at a price  so defender would actually need to put some effort into intel gathering

i wish the contracts interface was revamped to where you could look up things like on market and sort them by standard faction deadspace officer in order to scale down what you are looking for
since every man and his dog decided that contract scams are a good idea ive dreaded every single time i have to search contracts not that ive ever been scammed but recently theres more scam attempts then legit contracts which makes searching a paini think the contracts system needs some work chose sell or buy orders only on search for a start but that being said ive never quite understood the point of having certain items which can not be sold on the market just because you can sell something on the market does not mean that it cant be sold on contractslook at marauders for instance theyre available in both places and people buysell them in both places theres loads of stuff thats sold in both places i cant be assed to make a list but if you look for them youll see that this idea wont change mucheither way i support this idea
the quantum rising expansion the orcas initial production lead to so many market changes they can be still felt even to this day i like to introduce anyone who is reading to a simple small change to the orca to better reflect its role as a minifreighterbridge to freighterwhy did ccp decide to not make it possible to fit a battleship 500000 m3 inside an orcas ship maintenance bay of 400000m3 one possible solution is to enlarge the ship maintenance bay up to 600000 m3 for 6 skiffs or 3x hulks or 4x mackinaws or maybe allow at least one battleship minimum or more cruisers and frigatesright now you cant haul a rigged battleship in freighter via courier contract or even in highsec unless you plan to allow carriermothership into highsec which is even more unlikely due to combat potential i am sure they had a reason to limit courier contracts but that limitation as far i understand doesnt extend to orcas i would like more information as this is not a thread for speculationi would be happy to make a compromise with ccp but this proposal isnt about what the the terms of compromise may be but rather what changes i think should happen a compromise may be necessary as i dont know to what extent how ccp plans to make changes speaking of changes please do not mention that the orca will never be a carrier because carriers have so much more especially as it can protect itself to a degree and has jump drive capability whereas the orca has nothing that equals the potential of a carrierthis will make the orca an even more juicy target for gankers and as far i can see have no positive side effect other than make it less painful to haul many battleships with rigs i know people who have more than that in highsecone of the fewest reasons i havent fully trained battleship hull only cruiser and smaller hulls is that i love to collect and have one of each etc which would make it painful to haul so many battleships to just move i also dont like to be tied down to one place at all even having two or three sets of battleships wouldnt appeal to me as a solution for clarity ive only trained fully for one battleship edit now training for at least 4 more battleshipsexampleorca picks up a rokh which is 486000 m3 unpackaged then it can fill up the remaining 114000 m3 with a destroyer or whatever that fitanother benefit side effect would be a rise to a courier services for rigged battleships in highsec i mean who dont love some slaves to pull around your stuff kidding you still have to pay of courseorcas can still function as a minifreighter even without this small change yet it could have a bigger role eve online if the change went live

leave cloaks alone
not supported at all i also do not support the fuel idea
not supported if youre too paranoidinept to rat with a single cloaked afk hostile in system then thats your problem
i logged all the way in cause i had to say no to this
no support delay local if you dont want macros
covert ops cloaks should not be able to be scanned down the ships which fit them have their specific roles and the drawback in defensehowever i support a difficult method of probing down the other types of cloak it should not be easy but it should be possible the strategic value of having intel and causing fear in system by just being present and cloaked is quite valuable however the drawbacks of the noncovert ops cloaking devices are not severe enough for the additional combat gain you can have by fielding an invisible gang this is especially enforced on ships which do not need to actually target like hics or interdictors normal defense would allow for use of choke points like stations or gates to spot or tackle noncovert ops ships this defense is nullified if a player can just stage themselves cloaked in a systemincrease the risk of detection to balance out the benefits afforded
not fussed about highskills probing of basic cloakershowever you should not be able to probe down someone using a covert ops cloak end of story
not supported power creep isnt needed
not supported this completely destroys the point of being cloaked
absolutely not
ships using covert ops cloak should be able to remain hidden for as long as they please since scouting is their intended role other ships using different cloaks  not sure other cloaks already have huge battle drawbacks i dont think they need to be further nerfed
lol no
i think one of the main things missing from eve is the feeling of being in control of a ship with actual crew inside themthis could be solved by having crew cabins on each ship possibly none on small ships like frigates etc going up to say 3 or 4 on battleships there would then be an option to hire certain crew chiefs you would have to pay them each week and they could possibly decide to leave you if you dont play to their style so a pirate gunner crew would leave you if you decide to be a carebear etc or vice versathere could be several types of crew available such as gunners shield or armour experts engine experts etc all giving a slight boost to the relevant skills such as a gunner would improve your guns damage as he could aim better a shield expert could give a boost to shield regen etc and so onyou would then have to decide which types of crew you would like to fill the cabins so you could maybe not have all areas of expertise covered at oncethere could be different levels of competency of the crew available with say lvl 1 crew only giving a 1 boost of their area of expertise while a lvl 5 expert could boost their area of expertise up to 5the crew could also be selective with who they accepted work with possibly linked to a pilots sec status by this i mean a pilot with sec status of 00 ie rookie would only be able to hire a fairly low level crew member while a sec status of 50 could hire a far better crew member but for a far higher weekly pay after all the experts would want to fly with a decent pilot in rl id guess this principal coud also work for negative sec status as well but would have to be amended to reflect the possibility of up to 100 sec status so maybe a 1 improvement for every 2 points a pilots sec status was atthe crew could also give suggestions to you in the local channel like some of the chat on the missions with advice on which targets to aim at next etc if you had a gunnery chief on board as an examplethe crew members wouldnt actually do the work for you as in firing the guns but would help to immerse you into the idea of being a ship captain with people under your controli think this could work really well and add a new area to eve
youre not the first to propose this  there was a thread on this topic a couple weeks ago ill say the same thing to you i did to him id probably enjoy it but im a freak its too complex to be added to eve no support
nice idea  id be interested in seeing this worked up guess it sounds a bit complex at first reading but essentially it sounds like itd be like having rigs or implants that depend on your security status and so on and have a regular cost rather than a oneoff purchase costwhat would happen to the crew if your ship got blown up i wonder press gangs real ransoms freethecrew rescue missions good fun
unfortunately i have to agree with hersch i think it would be amazingly interesting and id love to see it done  if it were done right and not some cobbled together halfarsed attemptthe problem is that once added pretty much everyone would have to sign on for it even the people that dont want it because if they dont their ships will be outperformed at every turn 5 can make a huge difference in most thingsmy biggest concern is that eve has enough of a learning curve without having to figure out ship crews as well
you need a npc to tell you what rat to shoot what
would love to have these right now
agreeing with thisbut its always funny to see people camped into station all day that think theyre winning because of their kd ratio
it takes a major database rewrite to change an image from one picture to another ififbpc  1 setimage agif else setimage bgifwhere image a is the bpc picture and image b is the bpo pictureand at henry potter i have two alts making 20 copies 9 times that works out to 360 copies with 10 bpos i know how you feel and before someone says well dont turn in all the jobs at once i dont but my ceo does sometimes since they install as corp jobs
this should be solved easy and without rewriting the whole dbthere should be atleast one smart guy at ccp to make a workaround this and make it work proper
this after all what are we paying these guys for
this was an issue at the first csmits a technical infeasibility at this point and would likely require a ground up rewrite of the entire gamethe way the tables are made in the db it matters not if its a bpo or bpc they all call the same information so to make another two instances of those would more or less double or triple the current overheadi dont feel like paying 30 a month just so they can install a secondary server farm just to differentiate between originals and copies
yes please
that is fine assuming each item in the game has a reference to an image included if you consider the possibility that bpcs and bpos are the same general item type blueprints and that maybe the image is tied to the type rather than the individual item it becomes a lot harder to solve please feel free to apply for a job at ccp with your obviously superior programming skills though
your problem is in getting the ifbpc value ccp has stated that because of optimizations in how the game deals with showing your inventory the only way to get the ifbpc value at the time when icons are generated is to poll it for every single item in your hangar blueprint or not even if you have no blueprints itd still have to ask for every single item that would cause unacceptable lag so they dont do it im not a crazy programmer but thats pretty much my understanding of the situation
introduce factiondeadspaceofficer remote reps
introduce factiondeadspaceofficer remote reps
as your op includes no pressing reason to do so im going to have to say no change for the sake of change isnt always goodoffer some real reasons why theyre needed and i may change my mind
why im not necessarily opposed but id like to hear an actual argument first
and its got to be a bit more argumentative then cause i say so or cause i want it or cause my epeen desires it 
doesnt need an explanation lol would just be a cool thing to haveand afaik there is small and medium deadspace ones just no large i think
theres plenty of things you can add that would be cool that isnt the question though  the question is would it be good for the game
interesting idea chelms large remote repsupported
rr is already strong enough faction isnt needed

yeah however theyre currently worse then t2 and worthless
if anyone gets word of them undocking they would be mostlikely suicide ganked
whats worth more superfactions as the op put it or high sec caps i know you cant really do anything with the cap other then mine and fly around or they bump you to low sec but it would still be awesome
well actually my original concept was 5 of each per year but i figured such a radical and reckless proposal would have the conservatives jumping on me screaming obscenities and bashing me with sticks if you do think more than 1 per year would be more effective feel free to support on those lines i just needed to get the basic idea out there we can work on the details later
maybe a bpc can be give out if you have completed every cosmos mission for a specific empire and have 10 standing with it
while im all for more of them im a bit hesitant to support this because i cant see how to increase their numbers to the point where they dont get suicided the second they undock without making them almost as common as the maraudersfaction bsesjust as a thought maybe some sort of standing requirement
theres no question this should be fixed as soon as possiblesupported
and im actually okay with this amarr can keep their advantage in fleet work i just want the other races to close the gap
pretty much what sums up what it should be imho
supporting like crazy
confirming that this is a welcome and useful feature
this would be quite a useful tool
good idea
actually you can only select use active overview settings in the scannerthis is a bit boring when i want to have an overview settings but still scan for other thingsso my proposal is add a selection menu in the scanner where you can select the overview settings to use
if you mean select from your predefined overview settings id be ok with that just put a drop down on the scannersupported
could be handy minor issue though
yes that is what i mean
supportedscanner should get a major overhaul still though and not just for those horrible meshes and colors might even make sense to integrate all but the system view elements directly with the overview over time
 because we all know how awesome smartbombs are in empire do you really think bombs will be much more useful
you cant smartbomb the undock or gate but you can bomb it  bombs are more useful then smarites id love to see them allowed in lowsec in highsec it would be problematic because of concord

yeah really feels like the wrong place for this neverthelessim sure everyone who does stuff in 00 appreciates jump bridges and portals be it using the jb to the low sec system to get to empire and get some isk there be it three 100man fleets rallyingive been flying in both situations facing jump bridges using them in my own territory and have them used by hostiles in their territoryliking it in the beginning it has gotten very annoying an alliance holding some constellations can pretty much instantly reinforce any engaged gatecampoutmaneuver a running fleet which really ruins pvp and that usually means 10v5 becomes 25v5 its adding a good tactic to an fcs potential leading to a huge disadvantage for the engaging people though theres no way a casual roaming gang knows that there is a fleet 7 jumps out waiting for them having to know where the hostiles jump bridges are having to have 3 or more scouts out is not what i call pvp this is something for warfare not roamingand a thing that ive read quite a couple times in the last few days is jump bridgesportals allow any alliance to move too quickly between regions which might not be possible at all without these its no problem to rally up a fleet at some titan in an alliancescoalitions homesystem but its a nightmare to have people go in their sniping battleships for 30 jumps and this is what it should be like a 2000 man alliance that barely musters 80 people into a fleet shouldnt be able to defend two fronts at the same time im not into that jump portal stuff too much but i think its not that wrong if i say a bridged fleet needs around 30 minutes to move including rallying all the people somewhere but a fleet that does 30 jumps needs about an hour or longer to move same applies to jump bridgesi generally dont like the idea of people having an advantage to jump more systems at once than someone else i just dont see a reason
i fully support this idea
it is good idea
you want this to increase profits yesokay so lets say it costs you with invention 15000 isk to make module x which you then sell for 20000 iskt2 bpo makes the same item for 8000 isk which then sells for 20000 isktake note it also costs other inventors that same amount of isk to make module x and that is their baseline for determining their sell priceyour profit 5000 iskt2 bpo profit 12000 iskccp boosts bpcs to 00module x now costs you 13000 isk to make you sell for 20000 iskt2 competitor inventor 1 comes in and undercuts you to 19000 iskt2 competitor inventor 2 comes in and undercuts both of you to 18000 iskmarket stablizes at 5000 isk profit per unitnet result you make just as much isk as before and it costs less for people to enter your market buyers win everyone else losesremember the profit margins with invention when t2 first came out were awesomesauce for a while you were able to make more isk than god however as more inventors got into the market they started undercutting each other and brought down the profit marginswith that said if ccp made t2 invention bpcs with zero material costs so that they were free and only required a slot to produce pretty soon you would see people paying other players to take their produced wares off their hands wts module x 10000 iskheres a quick examplei produce t2 items r64 moon situation drastically increases my costs but they increase the costs for everybody else too if r64 moons were more plentiful it would reduce my production costs significantlyand everybody elses too so the profitability would stay the same pretty much

the message was inflammatory but battlesmith does have a point as the csm you do posses certain obligations which you are expected to fulfill during your tenure
secretary and vicesecretaryrecord minutes of all csm meetings record all csm votes and results publish an agenda for each csm meeting publish meeting minutes within three days of the meeting publishing technical means will be provided by ccpsource what is the csmat the risk of people thinking im trying to slag people off or something like that i am noticing a pattern with the meeting minutes its as if they are unimportant and without bearing on the continuation of the csmwhen real life hits other people take over on their own initiative when the secretary is unable to perform his duties the vice secretary does not have to get told what to do and when or anything at all he or she should step up to the plate since the deadlines are knownso what is the current situation on the meeting minutes the status of the secretarial jobs and is anything being done to get things back on the road
i think we were spoiled by how well omber zombie handled task last term mazzilliu got off to a decent start but this is the second time the minutes have been very late if nothing else it would be helpful to have some clarity about when the vicesecretary steps in
the vice secretary should step in on his own accord when the deadline approaches within a reasonable timeframe imo it is not hard to see right two days i better check in and if i dont get a response ill take care of it according to my job description so we stay within the terms of the csmedit mazz is neither secretary nor vice btw for an overview have a look heretheres still some things missing from the previous csm as well but i cant recall the exact circumstances of that anymore im afraid its just that this csm there appears to be a trend developing real life always goes over eve speaks for itself but csm has a structure to compensate for that without having to ring peoples bellsfrankly a third deadline missed will just reinforce the impression that this csm round is not very interested in the functioning of the csm concept in line with its inability to tackle the challenge of the minor issues to alleviate workload and streamline processes and in line with common expectations that for a big part its just interested in information subject to the nda i dont subscribe to this last opinion i must say but i can understand why this keeps popping up but at the same time it would not surprise me either this is still eve so please tackle the challenges folks its not that hard to work the structure and take initiatives as per job descriptions
i have to agree with ipodthough you should post with your main makes it far more creditable
probably inconceiveable but i am my main 
instead of whining search the forumcsmUFFFD meeting minutesthe only one missing is csm 3 meeting n 4 awaiting for some extra materialthe n 6 august 2 will wait for ccp approval before being published as normal for all the csm minute meetings as during the discussion they could speak of some information that is not meant to be divulged for now
it would have been quite nice to see some sort of information on awaiting verdict on meeting number 4 perhaps you found this out via other means then the wiki or the thread you linked im a bit curious where you found the details on meeting number 4 perhaps you can provide a link this would be greatly appreciated the same obviously applies to number 6 after all a simple post stating to be waiting for ccp would have generated a lot of dohmeeting notes on number 5 were late granted a few days and this can happen but trends are set quite easily especially in the light of missing or overlooking an informatory post on the status of meeting number 4 meeting notes on number 6 are still missing more then a week after the meeting not surprising people ask questions in the light of absence of these details you mention  judging by the tone you chose to use i am guessing you were somehow offended you can spend that energy elsewhere im not trying to offend anyone it just gets a bit worrysome when information is lagging behind the schedule when things run late then keep running late it is no surprise to see people ask what if anything is happening
if the goal is to be scifi and that spaciships were just the first step then this walking in stations thing is really making me curious cause in that case it sounds like it would be way more than just an enhanced social platform i mean will the be instation missions and pvp or what do they plan to do with it
what annoys me is that it seems sovereignty changes have taken priority over wis and i have no idea why ccp even bother changing that systemthe sad truth is no matter what ccp implements in regard to sovereignty you will always see tonnes of whining about it it will not take a whole day before the first serious post about how the previous system was better will pop up
ive always considered the internet spaceships to be the meat  potatoes of eve in every other mmo i expect to have a virtual representation of my character but i play eve for other reasons i go into the eve world knowing that i am piloting a ship im not piloting a personim not absolutely opposed to wis but im not exactly gungho about it either i just hope it isnt a required mode of play as i think that would detract from the aforementioned meat  potatoes
i second the tthread starter

33 posts and 19 supportsseems like your math is offas i said before less time lecturing more time reading
it would seem that way until you realise that some people posted multiple times if you dont support a proposal but 150 people do and you alone make 151 posts in that topic saying you dont support does that mean its not supported
supported you can only have a max of 5 jump clone and the skills not going to erase the timer ether its just going to lower it 24 hours time wait to something maybe at level 5 to 12 hours you can balence it by making it a a high rank skill
i did count there were multiple posts by some people also it was supported 16 to 9 ish might of been 15 to 8 when i posted thats why i said almost 2 to 1 now you done being jackass or shall i pwn you some more
supported but no lower than 1216 hourssomething that at least forces you to wait a day since people still have to sleep at least some of you dont anyway but doesnt prevent you from say making a strategic jump the night before and then being forced to make the long haul if you happen to log in the afternoon for some reason or another
i would love to see it lowered to about 18 hours for the exact reason listed in the op
i support the idea to reduce the cooldown not the 2 jumps within 48hrs the cleaning staff must take their time to wash the cloning machine op idea supported
i support raising the time from 24 to 48 hours for a single jump and having the jump clone skill reduce it by 10 per level
this is a bad ideathe ops hypothetical situation is exactly what should happen an alliance should not be able to ramble across the galaxy with no consequences unfortunately with the advent of jumpclones and jumpbridges this is exactly what happens the current situation is such that an alliance can assault a distant region with little consequences for examplealliance as home region is period basis one day they decide to assault alliance b in tribute upstart alliance c sees that alliance a has left their region undefended and make a grab for it alliance a simply jumpclones everyone back to period basis and fights off alliance c alliance b barely gets breathing space before alliance a has clonejumped back up alliance a barely needed to consider the consequences of galloping across the map jumpclones allow giant empires map spanning coalitions and the ability to attack distant regions at a whim if anything the timer needs to be lengthened or jumpclones need to be eliminated entirely shortening the timer will just exacerbate the current issues
currently if alliance c attacks alliance a might be able to jumpclone back and if they do they cannot start attacking alliance b again for 24 hoursif this timer was shortened to say 12 hours hell if alliance b cant put a attack together in 12 hours they fail because even without a jumpclone in that amount of time alliance a could of traveled back normally anyways
24 hours is a pitifully short amount of time if alliance a is on the ball with stronting they arent even going to lose a tower before they can show up to defend if an alliance actually had to manually travel it would be much more of a pita if they were trying to come home in the ships they took out there theyd have to deal with other hostile alliances roaming gangs and opportunistic people like pl or cry havoc coming for them if whoever was attacking them was on the ball they might have to deal with empire mercs to get back even if you stick everyone in ceptors you still have to make around 50 jumps instead of clicking a button that allows you to bypass all potential threats more risk means less map spanning adventures means less map spanning coalitions means less huge empires means more chance for somebody new to break onto the scene shortening the jumpclone timer just makes space even smaller and exacerbates all of the above issues
everyone has the same advantage whats the problem
jump clone use should come with the risk of skill loss like losing a pod with your clone not updated

for those of you using the afk cloak idea thats not relevant to what i meant this thread to be about cause you are right an afk one does nothing but you get one person who has 3 paid accounts or whatever all he has to do is  around with his other two while his third one sits there watching stuff for his corp to always know what you and your friends are in when you are trying to get to him this would fix 00 macro ratters since as far as i can tell a macro raven cant fit a cov ops cloak this should make you 00 guys happy that people arent stealing your iskies a cloaked frigate makes a sweet warpin point like someone else mentioned would it have been better to say not to nerf cov ops cloaks but then we would have all these people complaining about how why bother people will just train for it and scout in a br i guess thats the case but it still requires them to but the better part of what 80 million on the line instead of a million isk cloak with a million isk frigate or crusier

during my university years i have worked for aols internal collection dept training and management directives called for us to scam lie cheat lie some more and cash the customers credit cards for the entire outstanding balanceeven with this knowledge and experience i believe that ccps customer service is way worse than aolsat least we took the time to listen to those poor guys on the other end of the phonei can say that the best way to go around this is lodging some complaints with the better business bureau or even starting talks with players who feel they have been unlawfully treated by this service provider with the final goal of filing a class action lawsuit against themmost large companies and especially service providers do not give a rats ass about the customers paying for their cars mortgages food and whatnot individually we pay a small amount but collectively we make up for their entire profit marginthe only inconvenience here is that a lot of people dont have the time or simply think the legal approach to this is not worth it my advice is never let a company get away with bullying you your money fills their pockets maybe its time for their money to fill yours as moral damagesseek legal counsel today and sue them for everything theyve got
thats all good and fineand good sense no lessbut you got a couple of problems1 no ones going to sue over a damn video game2 ccp is based out of iceland not the usa while they may conduct business here they are internationally based somehow turning them into the bbb is childish at bestthe only way your going to get results is 1 of 2 waysyou quit the game taking away there money or you complain about it until they cant take it anymore or they do something about itnow if this was a different situation such as a service like power or water or foodsomething a little more critical it would be different
actually the bbb would redirect you to
rights to what to play a video game in a fictional environmentim paying for a service much like a magazine its nothing more than thatoh sure ive put a lot of time into it but i seriously doubt anyone is going to cry over thatagain theres a problem but suggesting these courses of action is utterly ridiculousi stand by my reasoning you want to get there attention complain or leave asking a lawyer to sue them for losing your ship is a bit far fetched dont ya thinkccp let alone the eula did not guarantee certain things such as same day tech support the whole basis of your said opinion hinges on rights that you assume to be present to begin with hate to break it to you pal but you dont have any rightsas far as anyone is concerned ccp can do whatever the  the want when they see fit to do sothey could be ignoring us right now and it wont change a damn thingso either you have faith in the csm that will do there job or you walk awayif you want to sue them for a video game be my guest let me know how that works out for yah
i for one wont be doing anything of the sort i dont have to deal with petitions as often as some peoplebut seeing grown men act like women and going nerdyemo crying out to the csm to solve their problems simply made me offer an idea so maybe people could open their eyeslegally speaking the service you are paying for guaranteed by the contract you have with ccp is not provided within the stipulated paramaters to which ccp has obliged itself it may not be that harsh but still the least you could do is file a complaint with econsumergov to have them listed in their multinational databasei hope other paying customers will eventually heed my call and do what they should to protect their rights within the appropriate channelsmy good drake draconis the csm is nothing more than an outlet which major alliances and major players use to influence the development of the game this is because most of them represent the interests of large entities making up for the majority of eves playerbaseits both in the interest of ccp and the csm to see the game going in the direction they want it to but unfortunately the eternally poor customer support is seen as a major money sink by most large companies this is why this particular branch of a lot of companies is outsourced to external companies paying less for customer support in countries like india romania etc amounts to more profit reeled in by the companythe game will change at csms initiative only on such subjects that involve the gameplay the development of the game as a wholethey will never and i stress never allow outside people much less customers run their business for themyou look like you require a bit of researching or better yet more life experience before taking on issues such as the quality of customer service which has always been somewhere between poor and mediocreyou wanna do something sue themyou feel like its not worth it shut up because eventually this is what most of the people will do and as soon as a better product emerges on the market theyll be migrating in flocksregards
ummmif these guys worked in my department theyd all be part of the growing number of people on unemploymentone or two mistakes every now and then is fine we are not that jesus guy and are expected to make mistakes but the sheer number of failures by the gms leads me to only one conclusion incompetence
yeah i choose to shake my head and worry about more important matters like real lifenot internet ships
and in other news we have this fine threadgrab a snickers bar because this apparently will take a whilenice response time i mean im a bit easy to please in the gm department i played enb after all and petitions in enb were frequently responded to by gms saying thanks for playing sims online for gods sake but come on also theres quite deep suspicion that low level gms are possibly bots since they always respond with canned messages and never  and i mean never  really fix anything sort of like trying to get an answer out of audix when you call a company for customer support same thing also while youre at it have a look at your customer support tools as you can see here from the same thread linked to above anyone can respond to a feedback message not just the person who sent the petition the result can be seen by clicking on the message while vuk im sure digs the gay  in the responses its very 4s im not sure if everyone else wants this sort of stuff on display in eve
the irony in this is fantastic not to mention that for someone who doesnt worry about internet space ships you certainly troll the forums with the best of the bestdrake has been on a tear all day someone must have peed in his cheerioson another notesupportedbecause the i just had to file a petition gave what i consider all the pertinent information before hand because i looked it up prior to filing the petition then i got a response asking me for the dmned information i just sent them in the original petitionnow i asked to have the petition canceled and its been days and its still open
i honestly would love an answer to these questionswhy are so many people so adamant about forcing people to loose money all the timethis is after all a game is it not why do you want to make it all the more difficult to have isk are you that pathetic in rl that you use this game as a substitute for validation of your abilities lets keep the game fun as opposed to making it a job i have one of those to make money in rl dont need another one thanks

yes also make constellation madatory like local is
i guess it would be ok particularly if they were obvious and only worked while on grid i have to say however that local in delayed mode favors the defenders just as much as the attackers as nobody is stopping anyone from laying in wait with a huge force either cloaked or stuffed in a deep safe
yus
i do support delayed local however i can not support this implementationinstant mode constellation chat only solves the macro ratting bot problem while creating other much more game breaking issuestrivializing the scouts job even more is the smallest of those issues providing early warning to anyone in a constellation screws up a great number of strategies for anything from solo roam to fleet ops avoiding fights with instant constellation chat will be a breezenot much of a compromise im afraid

at present the blockade runners bonuses are as followsracial industrial skill 5 extra cargo capacitylevel and 5 extra velocityleveltransport ships skill 5 active tanking bonuslevel and reduced covops cloak cpu needsthe transport ships skill bonuses are not very attractive with transport ships i blockade runners have ample cpu to fit a covops cloak mwd and a few shield tanking mods theres little incentive to train the skill any further for fitting reasons the active tanking bonus is even more useless if you find yourself in a situation where activating your tank seems like it might be useful theni youre doing it wrongii youre going to die anywayi propose a simple change swap the transport ships active tanking bonus to either a second 5level cargo capacity boost or a 5level agility bonus either of these bonuses would give br pilots a strong incentive to train the skill above i and enhance the utility of the ship class as a wholetldr blockade runners active tanking bonus is rubbish and should be swapped for something useful cd
i wholeheartedly endorse this product andor service
not a supercritical issue but i agree in a vague sort of way
supported but weak reasoning as to whyi trained up tss to iv if not iii for more room when it came to making room for various thingsim not contesting the weak bonuses but i seriously doubt people stop at just transport ships i
i never stop at level 1 for anything since level 2 or 3 generally takes less than a day to acquire at least for the skills i have trained so far for a days worth of time its worth the extra 5 or 10 to whateverthat said ccps role for the blockade runner seems to be based on their stats and ability to fit cov ops cloak a stealthynimble cargo ship capable of avoiding a fight while delivering cargobased on that assumption and yes i know im trying to read the devs minds here id say it makes sense to give them an agility bonus and leave the tank bonuses for the other racial transports the noncovops cloaked onessupported
i agree that the bonus is crapwhy active tank your just gonna get nueted and your tank is crap then either that your gonna get dpsed so fast that it will break the tank before the reps have a chance to do there jobnow broadsword style tank bonus is better either 5 or 75 to resist across the board would be nice but to shields is what im pionting atso somthing10mn mwd ii lse ii lse ii invul sheild ii would be nicei suspect i will be more like 1mn mwd but i supose it is a transport

1 for agility
agreed
that would be a great idea

while its pretty clear to everyone that tanking bonus on blockade runner is rubbish the ships are already way overpowered  specifically because of cov ops cloakhow about we take away the cov ops then we can replace tanking bonus with something usefulas it is now boosting blockade runners is completely unacceptable even those in ccp who are responsible for nano nerf would probably agree
after playing 01 isk wars with other traders fine by me we regional resellers are faced with 50 deliveries and potentially hundreds of items that need to be individually moved to member hangers and then sold this proposal is simple  add an interface screen for viewing all items stacked with quantities in all remote deliveries for a selected region this screen should be as clean as viewing your own hangeroptions available ability to move items in bulk to a selected membercorporate hanger  remote sell order placement should be as simple as selecting a stack and selling as usual even if items are located in 20 different stations of course all broker fees will remain unchanged and orders will appear separate per location on the marketthere are many other interesting options that can be added however just these two options if implemented would remove 99 of the unfun that us regional resellers experience
remote inventory management would be an excellent feature supported
nopedeliveries and remote management are two distinctly different things if you are not moving the merchandise around properly when you make the delivery thats your fault but nothing stops you from contracting it to the person eitherall this would do is allow bot networks to take over entire regional markets with only a few commands rather than the nightmarish task of trying to program in all the current variables with transport mission running bots already in existence its not like a completely automated empire is unfathomable and this makes it about a billion times easier to manage even if a regional bot network already existed this would take a ton of its work load in placing buy and sell orders away and let it focus on 01 isk wars so now instead of hub isk wars we get them across the entire galaxy this would also pump a huge amount of lag into the system every time you tried to sell across the entire region because the server would have to calculate the tax and broker fees on each individual location of the goods by your standing with the station owner load is bad enough without giant spikes every 30 seconds from trying to execute a sell order in 25 systems at oncesorry but eventually it would just degrade into lemonade stand online where you dont even undock you just have everything automated for you people can have entire alt armies for all i care so long as its people actually running them the mechanics work just fine with the tools at your disposal it just requires effort and not much of it at that its just as monotonous as the other professions and a hell of a lot safer and more profitablewhy dont we just ask for an i win button

ccp need to be pestered about things they after all said titans would be added soon after retail
problemcurrently the close and minimize buttons are too small and too close to each other it is very easy to unintentionally close a convo or other channelsolutionthrough a right click menu on the channel name where blink onoff ans settings are located add an option that locks the channel open when activated the channel would behave like local corp and alliance channels to close the channel you would need to unlock the channel going through the same context menu and unlock the channel maybe even add an option that says unlock and close to accomplish both in one stepprosno more closing important channels in the middle of a conversationconsyou actually have to go through the ui prior to accidentally closing the channel
this idea makes a fair amount of sense
this is a pretty simple and very useful idea i cant tell you how many times i have closed a channel or convo by mistake
yes please
sure why not
yup
dun have to tear into my code im not sure how it works just saying it didnt seem like it should be that hard to do seems like ccp likes to program themselves into holes
look they are using mssql they do use stored procedures to do their lookupsit is not always very simple to change things at this level as it potentially impacts on a lot of the items system while it may not impact performance if done properly altering item lookup procedures if not done exactly right could s up the game to them it is probably viewed as something that ought to be done when they are upgrading the function of that part of the database some time in the future but too risky to do just to fix a minor issue with bposbpcsso my guess is that it is in the failed the risk vs benefit test basket
youre not sure how it works and yet you can do it better than the company who does know with four lines of pseudocode look i find this kind of sketchy myself it seems rather odd that theyre querying what the item is but cant effectively look for any information on it unless that information is a ship name or similar but im a guy who took a couple coding classes years ago who is looking at this from a distance ccp are the people who wrote the code and who have been getting ed out for six years to fix this issue ill trust their statements over my intuition
maybe we will see this option in eve2 since it is a ground up complete recoding of the entire game
faction remote sensor boosters please
i would like to raise two points about what happens if a player changes their mind1 if you did allow the skill to turn back into a book if the player changes their mind then that means people can safely transport expensive skill books to 00 from empire without risk of loss they can pickup the book in jita add it to their queue clone jumpe back out to 00 change their mind sell it to a mate for a nice safe profit2 use it or lose it approach the idea that a player would lose the skill if they changed their mind is not a good one there are enough little traps in the user interface that can and do affect players already these little things really do spoil the player experience and ccp should be getting rid of traps even if they have pop up warnings i would suggest rather than a player can inject any skill book regardless if they have the prereqs to use it the check should be placed on actually training a skill if the character does not have the prereqs the skill cannot be trained this kind of check would work well with players losing skill points when they have forgotten to update their medical clones as well it would mean that a player never loses a skill entirely just lose levels in the skillhope this makes sense
at that point skill books are nothing more then simple isk sink and a frustrating one at thatif you go as far as to let any character inject any skill you might as well give everyone all skills from the beginning just only allow them to train a skill if the prereqs are meti do support the ops proposal though its really annoying if i have to leave a skill for the next day just because if i wait for the prereq to train i wont be able to sleep pone single time it does not matter but over the course of an eve career this can result in large wastes of time in a training plan that runs for over 100 days several of these choke points can prolong the training by even more it takes enough time to train for stuff as it is
hm the last time someone proposed this i didnt vote because im not sure about this i agree it would be conveinient but i have no idea if there could be complications with it never the less as no one came up with any real reasons to stop this the last time and no one has come up with anything this time around eitheri guess ill support

thats not a bad thought that although the details could be a bit hard to work outthe way i see it doing anything is better than doing nothing at the moment as i pointed out the ships might as well not exist even if the market ends up flooded with them massively devalued its still arguably better than current circumstances at least we get new ships and even if we dont go that far im absolutely not suggesting we should even a few more of the ships injected into the game is an improvement over the sparse handful which are currently sitting in hangars accumulating dust

you find the meeting minutes on the evelopedia and a raw log as well as always they are filed in the csm meeting minutes category
all this time ive been waiting and watching patiently here
first post in the threadreduct of the meeting minutes of csm 5 published 20090724 123000 meeting held 20090719wow a whole 5 days from the meeting to the minutesall the csm meeting minutes are subject to ccp review i am fully convinced that you are either a troll or heavily lacking in the capacity of searching the forum making that thread a sticky would be a good thing but it is still easy to find as it is in the second page of this section
just to clear this up the only minutes that require ccp review are the ones where they are involved in the meeting the time taken for the last few meetings minutes is due to rl issues of the secretary and some bad communication between csm members partially caused by our csm emails not working properlycsm3 is different to csm2 a lot more issues however minor are being raised by csm3 in an attempt to get a large list of things to raise with ccp in our meeting in iceland its taking longer to do these minutes and i have no doubt if it was me doing them this time around you wouldnt be seeing them as punctually as csm2 eitheras for the rest  while i appreciate the nice comment on my csm2 minutes efforts please keep in mind that english is not the primary language of the current secretary so a little leeway on time to make the minutes readable and understandable is not too much to ask imho especially considering the length these meetings have been taking
then i should apologize for giving a wrong information as a fact knowing a bit what it mean to condensate a discussion even one where all the text is already in written form 5 days for a unpaid work is not bad at all
so you prefer useless decoration that can walknope its just eyecandy with a few very tiny features added in to make it appear like its actually somethingthere are so many people that couldnt care less about wis that the idea is nothing in station will have any impact on any aspect of the game outside stations you cant stab that alliance leader with a spoon just because you have spoon to lvl5 while about the only thing you can do that adds value is run a storefront which i guess is a simple list of your current contractsits nothing really just hype and candy to attract wow kids it has very little to do with existing users much more about recruiting new ones who dont like spaceship gamesedit oh and the added isk sink of buying office decorations
yep
i too find this idea to be good tm
im thinking something along the lines of a cap ship suddenly being enveloped in the white cocoon of light like ships do when they go through stargates then shooting off into the distance where a miniature wormhole opens up and accepts their ship in closing behind themand the cap pilot gets to watch their ship take off into the wormholeand the effect gets reversed for coming out of a cynoyes it is big and would look strange for large cap fleets yes it is totally awesome

most people will say hey if you kill someone irl all their stuff wouldnt go to you it would go to his family which a corp is as close as podpilots come to familieshowever this isnt rl this is internet spaceships yes the current mechanic is dumbyes this idea is a great improvement
the problem is that mechanics like these encourage larger and larger space holding alliances to exist you get alliances holding entire regions without living in them despite this a smaller alliance cant move in because jump clones jumpbridges and the like mean that the larger alliance can be on them before the first tower comes out of reinforced they can do this even when they are currently fighting someone else on the other side of the map its also easier to have distant allies theres no reason to not travel across the whole map when you can jumpclone back if any trouble comes up this allows giant coalitions to intervene at will with little dangerjump bridges jumpfreighters and jumpclones were all made to make fighting and holding space less tedious which is great but they have had side effects i personally dont want to see it get any easier to move across space due to this
isk isnt a drawback anymoremake them lose sp when they jc for a second time in 24 hours equivalent to 05 m sp per 4 hours earlier than the timer they jcsp lost is lost in the same fashion and according to same priorities as losing a cloen that isnt up to dateif its really that important to jc multiple times in 24 hours suck it up carebears
hell ill agree with this even if it only takes 30 mins off per level so have i just been trolled
no the universe is already too small ccp should be focusing on making everything feel bigger and more useful not making it easier for people to teleport from one end of space to the other
your counterpoints would be much more valid if titans didnt exist as it stands an entire fleet can be jumpbridged to a battle in minutes

it should be a really subtle effect it gets tiresome even when flying solo and have sensor booster on

didnt projs used to use capacitor and hence benifit from controlled bursts if so its an easy fix to get controlled bursts to work with projectiles againmake them use cap and undo the buff they gotcomplaining that cb no longer helps projs cause they dont use cap any more  a boost  is rather lame
i dont fly minmatar but i support it
true it is a boost however you have forgotten the change that was made to vamps and neuts a while back making this boost moot point and since you have played eve for quite a while you are no doubt well aware that minmatar battleships have the lowest cap and thus the lowest recharge rate so really the capless gun argument really just balanced an inferior weapon system back prior to the amarr boost the hp boost the speed nerf the vampneut nerf etc all of those indirectly harmed minmatar combat tactics and ships especially the battleship sized weapon systems

i support this idea
definitely has my vote
yeah this should have been done long agosupported
a good compromise in my opinion
yeah theres absolutely no reason to remove the ability to contract them just lie you can contract any item on the market currently for some rare items it would probably still be the prefered method together with the market forumanyone who has ever had to shift a pile of low end faction or complex stuff knows the pain of managing it all though i have idk must be going on 100 random mods sitting in amarr because the amount of time and effort it would take for me to actually sell them is ridiculous
the current setup means that based at cant be used for most things although it is the most logical and if more then one station could be set as the users base then it would work very wellinstead corps are forced to use other which includes much more the intended access

yes there needs to be a lot of changes but this would be a good start

obviously addons are a major pro to any gamethere are a lot of things that could look better and use screen space more efficiently including the overview chat windows the basic hud along with the way modules are displayed and the list could go oni noticed that a lot of people are confusing hacks with addons i dont see how addons that make it easier for people to use the interface could harm anyonethe ability to modify these aspects is an important improvement for any mmo and its a sign of progress in my opinion games that cannot be tweaked visually or functions that cannot be enhanced by way of volunteer scripting are a thing of the pastif you check out all the emerging mmos one would notice that all of them are designed with this possibility in mind the addon perspective also increases originality and the average lifetime of a game why because being able to customize your ui is like being able to pimp out your car it makes you like it more it provides stuff that you need and others may not need and it would allow for more people to get into eve which  more subs for ccp and more people to shootbe shot by for ustwo thumbs up

when browsing kills either in corp or personal killloss logif a kill is clicked open it up in an instance of the fitting screen keep the text on double click for posting mail purposes
you already have that feature on all decent killboardsimplementing in game would take ccp staff at least 1 week time that would have been better spent on things not already availablepeople should tone it down on new idea generation in assembly hall

proposalany player that enters a system via blackops mediated travel does not appear in locallocal is treated as delayed as in whs for this specific individualif they speak in local they appear in local just like the current system in whssaid player will not appear in local of that system unlessthey dock and undock from an npc stationthey use a stargate to jump out of the system then reenter it via a stargateany player that enters a system via a wormhole benefits form the same mechanic outlined above
ye
not supported the wh delay swings both ways your proposal only benefits one side additionally there is no way to counter the method i could easily see someone throwing a covert cyno in a system bring in the blackops fleet and then logoff themselves local would appear to be empty offensive would be able to monitor for anyone else coming and going they could also use it as a scout which coupled with the afk cloak method you could have eyes in a system and no one would ever knowit all i dont see this as enhancing game play in a balanced point  counterpoint method
logoff games are boringquickly becoming a fan of the remove local altogether club
especially thisscifi backgroundthere is no concord information about people going from w to kspace because there is no gate usage balancing backgroundwormholes are unpredictable and seldom in right place thus nobody could abuse iti think a 3060sec local delay for wkspace travelers could indeed help all guerilleros in eveno delay for cov op cyno this would end in ridiculous ganking
interesting idea but ill say the same thing i have to every other local nerf if you cant use alternate methods of intelgathering to find people you need local until those methods are implemented local needs to stay omniscient
local should go entirely to delayed mode not just for covert operations in 00 space directional scanner and other shipbased intell tools should be improved however i would support the change to local even beforewithout improved scanning tools
idea either deserves support or not leave judgment if its to complex to be implemented to eve developers
super capitals i could see being a team efforthuge ships flown by multiple pilots each one accessing a different area and when all are in together its gets better bonuses etc
this and supported
i thought i was rather clear on which side of that line i thought it was on this would hurt the game through excess complexity more than it would help it through new strategy and no thats not a decision i feel i have to leave to ccp  its not an implementation issue its fundamental to the proposal as such i dont support it
yep i cant see why it would be very complicated to sort out tbh thats exactly the sort of way i was thinking it could worki remember there were hirable crew in a space game back in the 90s cant remember which one tho
my idea is to create a corporation role that allows  disallows combat between other corp members this would prevent people joining a corp for the purpose of killing unsuspecting corp members and property yet still allowing corp combat for ship testing frig fights etcideas comments or random outbursts
dont recruit people you cant trust and even after recruiting them dont trust them too much move around with a defense method ready
i think we should make this game more like wow
this is a terrible ideahth
yes i want more ways to prevent pvp in my pvpcentric spaceships gamedont do this allowing corp to corp combat is a major way to penalize ceosdirectors who do a bad job of recruiting making someone a member should involve giving that person some trust the current implementation does a good job doing so
random outburstthe hellrandom outburst
i disagree with everything you stand for
give the guy a break he just waiting for walking in stations so he never has to undock again
bad idea imo just be more selective in your recruitment plus the absence of this role on a pilot could easily lead to other griefing tactics remote rep  pew pew to cause concord to kill the harmless remote repper comes to mind
theres this ship its called an interdictor
im waiting for the part how a cov ops cloak makes it overpowered
came in expecting this to be a whine that the bonus wasnt high enough left disappointed that i couldnt say your doing it wrong oh and i voted for it cos well yeah if your taking fire in a blockade runner your pretty much dead no matter how its tanked

yes weve met there reputation is quite pandemic
its a pity the who doesnt have a cure for them yet
remote stacking was brought up in an earlier csm i think and was agreed that it could be a possibility and if the resources to make it happen werent great we could expect it added to the development pipeline no set time date was given obviouslyin fact i think lvv brought it up in the first csm
um how you get it delivered isnt my problem and has nothing to do with remote stacking and mass sell offs across a region with the click of a button using deliverys to supplement an argument that has nothing to do with making deliveries faster is like arguing for a turret bonus on a drakeyour idea makes it vastly easier to operate a bot network not a single mission running bot big difference between fixing the market prices in an entire region to farm isk on an unparalleled scale in a way that ccp has yet to figure out how to stop and a simple macro mission runnerwhat about boting the crap out of the market dont you understand apparently for a trader you dont pay much attention to how bots can update market orders every xx number of seconds on the dot every time you under bid by your 01 isk and they are not getting banned left and right because the 01 iskers are to ocd to not expect the other 01 iskers to not do the same thing maybe if you were not adjusting your market order by 01 isk every few minutes you would have time to manage your operation with the current methods provided to you lol me thinks you dont know what your talking aboutif you dont leave the station what do deliveries have to do with your argument i do not trade full time anymore no but i do participate in a market war to suppress prices when people like you are pushing over market value for items so if people like me leave you stuck with an inventory full of implants that you are going to lose money on then good implants are volatile because of the bubbles traders artificially inflate around them sorry if i burst your bubble you are not talking about remotely stacking goods in a hanger 5 jumps away you are talking about remotely moving goods from your hanger to other player hangers and being able to sell off all the goods you have in a region with one click rather than selecting the item in its hanger and selling it from there per your original post that isnt remote management that is useful for a simple trader setting in a station that is reducing the steps necessary for operating a region wide bot network much more efficientlyif remote stacking is such an issue why not include remote repackaging so that all players can benefit region wide sell offs and between hanger moves is just a disaster waiting to happen
sorry to be bearer of bad news but ccp already have something in the pipeline apparentlyalso my idea here orca boost to ferry battleship rigged
translating my proposals into language understandable by devs that doesnt make carebears develop lockjaw

bringing the thread back where it belongs
lets not jump to conclusions here
i find it fascinating that a member of privateer alliance has started this  i am actually supporting this because they relentlessly use this tactic i agree with everyone who has expressed that people who involve themselves in a pvp fight on any level should become valid targets for all involved partiesthankskuan
i think the effect sucks the worst part is the sound of it that messes up everything else a nice quiet halo  that would be cool change the color of the halo depending on the type of sensor booster the way lasers change for type ecm module icons for type etcmaybe a black halo and a redshifting of the ship color and light
the scale of the effect that is to say its visible strength is quite disproportional to its importance that is to say you can see from 100km away even without zooming in that a fleet of ships are fitted with and using sensor boosters by the same token you can barely discern the visual effect of remote sensor dampeners tracking disruptors warp disruptors or sensor jammersid say that visual effects of modules that are selfonly produce a subtle visual cue effects from targeted modules like those listed above should have a clear concise and easily identifiable cue much like a beam laser shooting 200km where you can clearly identify not only the source but also the target so should targeted effects produce such an easily identifiable cue
tone the fing thing down its much too prominent for what its showingthe old effect was a lot better and nice to look at almost hypnotic

if you triple the spawns of factionofficer loot wont that in effect reduce thier valuesfor that matter wont flooding the game with more isk faucets just create inflationand i dont really get the point of a pos mod to boost rattng potential if i conquer serpentis space why would they come by more ofteni think if loot tables for adjusted and the mining ratios changed in both empire and 00 there would be a more appropriate balance for individual players empire is for solo wealth growing 00 is about alliance riches can an empire corp seriously match up against a 00 corp for fundinga more appropriate way to spread people out and use every system in 00 is to have npcs build up in systems without ratters threatening them i think for every hour and every day a ratter isnt present in a system the npcs should go and build up more and better forces when a ratter comes in and knocks them down they start over officers should be like raids on a system when officers come by it creates an event where they attack either you or some complex in the system as a means of regaining control officers would be another good way to threaten sov of space imagine if you didnt defend against an officer raid losing sov in a system and having to start anew it would definitely force your alliance to defend its home
as far as faction goes the only thing that needs to be done is fix it so 4060 of all officer spawns dont happen within 2 hours after dt it is unjust to everyone who cannot get online in that time period fixing that problem would simply crease the appearance of more spawns as distribution evens outthat alone would not be enough to make 00 that much more attractive something else should happen i believe the main problem is in the high sec level 4 missions they are simply unreasonable making 00 more attractive than that will either flood the market with officer loot or create big inflation with isk
no more spending 5 hours straight clearing endless bc  cruiser spawns from a 20 belt ratting system in 00 yes please supported 100
this is a great idea and well though out hopefully it leads to more ratters to shoot as well
better rats  more attractive 00  more people in 00  moar targets
not a bad idea i like it 
as someone who lives in providence supported best spawns we see is dual 11m and those are rare i just run lvl 4 missions nowadays ratting isnt simply worth it
same here in immensea made an honest attempt at ratting then went back to missionwhoring for 2x the resulthurrah for untouchable unlimited noncompeting income sources
you are right it is the miners that have the problem with thisyou are also right that most hulk pilots safe up as a mining barge isnt that great a combat shipyou are also right about 00 isnt safe and never should be what we want however is the ability to remove a threat to us by docking up changing to a combat ship move out and engage the enemy im not saying it should be easy to kill cov ops cloak or other cloackers just want a very tiny small chance of actually dealing with the problem

this has been a problem for far too long ccp really needs to invest in a community relations force to take back their game and finally start showing that theyre here to serve their customers and not the other way around forcing players to endure harsh consequences is one thing not caring and employing overworked under qualified slackers is another
a great idea would be to outsource it this is where i used to work

although this thread is a great idea it doesnt seem to have been updated in a while like a year is there any chance we can get an updated version or do we need to restart and desticky this one

i would have to say that nerfing 1 weaponlasersscorch is not the way to go projectiles need a buff somewhere in the 510 regionalso the pest defiantly needs a minor reworking and the phoon should get 2 more launcher  turret hardpoints also so its not forced to use split weapons
i dont see what any of the above has to do with the merits of one gun system over anothercb used to get applied to mini guns when they used capi suspect they still get the bonus from cb but as 0 x 075  0 you just dont see itmini are always complaining about how much they have to traini could be wrong but i dont think mini need to train cb for t2 projsso galcalamarr have to train cb to stop there guns emptying there cap and your complaining because mini dont need to train it at allreally i think your glass is half empty
admittedly it is nice to not to have to train another skillbut that being said with the various boosts likethe hp boost  made the alpha strike considerably less effective as well as exposes the weakness of the minmatar active tank which now requires more cap to maintain and the minmatar passive tank which in general has less mid and low slots and thus less tank in comparision to other racesthe vampneut nerf  while this effected everyone minmatar ships generally most notably the tempest relied on the vamp ability to drain an enemy cap while also being able to refill their ownamarr weapon boost  certainly a needed boost for the previously anemic amarr weapon systems now close range acs using short range ammo are forced to attack at the pulses optimal using short range ammo as their optimal is greater than the acs optimal  falloff artillery cannot produce the range or damage that railguns and beam weapons can field especially with the problems of damage quality after going into falloffthe speed nerf  personally i think while this wasnt a buff per se it hurt minmatar the least however it did hurt them as it removed our bs ability to lock targets down enough that its weapons could be a factor for example clearing out cruisers and bc class shipsnow while it is true that hybrids and lasers use cap they have some inherit logistical advantages over projectiles hybrids while they do use cap have large clips thus less reloads and more time fighting lasers get even a better bonus their ammo changes instantlyoverall the problem because that when you take a weapon system that does less damage than its counterparts and put it on a ship that cant tank as well as its counterparts and dont give it any outstanding advantages over said counterparts then you will lose or leave usually losenot sure about you but spending 30mil sp points to lose to a ship where the pilot only has 6mil sp points doesnt sit well with me
remove local would require a replacement thats almost as useful but not quite otherwise people will just leave 00 as they have zero ability to protect themselves or find targetsive enumerated my proposal in other identical threads ship sensorspassive always on not very informative takes time to get any info about a signature but you know something is out there immediatelyonline passive the one we use nowonline active whenever you hit the scan button it pings local space objects are a lot easier to identifypinpoint but so are you
both your arguments conflict with each other you cant protect yourself when youre not found
hehe nice logic fail i imagine pirates flying in circles unable to find anything to attack and hopeless victims selfdestructing in terror
posting in a bellum whioh rightsupported
speak for yourself id do just fine in 00 even if local was removed without any other improvements to scan mechanicszero ability to protect themselves  that automatically discredits any point you are trying to make
support this if you think the only thing between a pod kill and not is the implants arent on the kill mail you are delusional

erm orca is intend to be a minifreighter to bridge the gap between freighter and industrial as for mining skill just training mining barge as it is frigatecruiser equal to racial capital ship for the 4 empiresi already have a simpler idea and it even have less programming overhead as you only adjust one number in the database i would like at least to avoid all possibility of introducing new bugs or even featuresorcas expand to subrorqual capability only one battleship can fit
another reason is from the dev blog my rifter is equipped with the following rigs ccp is looking at different methods
exactly i hate having to contract each of the caldari caracals and ravens rather than being able to slop down the entire bunch in the market and be done with it
i fail to see how this would hurt contractsright now if i say want a t2 barge i can pull them from the local market or from contract sellers decide if they want easy to browse local or difficult to browse global and thus have flexibilitycontracts as they are currently implement make finding classes of items very frustrating esp when some items might have a dozen or more different meta levels for some sellers making your item harder to find is not an advantage

id have to agree with this fix low sec before 00 sec
yeah its getting a pretty common topic nowadays not the first thread regarding the size of 00aside from that fix low sec before its still worth a discussionccp is gonna revamp 00 with their next expansion but aside from that theres not much known about it i thinktheres a simple problem which cant be simply fixed alliances control too much of the space without any possibility to take it from them its not important which space youre looking for get 2000 people achieve nothing without being blue to either the south or the north youre going nowhereso it comes down to just a few points1 its too hard to take sov from alliances you shoot someones tower come back after x hours with your 10 dread mighty alliance fleet and there you have the 50 dreads of the opposing alliance the stront timers make it possible to lose in your own time zone just because the hostile alliance times their towers this is one of the things that make space too small a dread fleet shouldnt be able to respond too fast if the attacking fleet does the strike the stront timers make it kind of impossible to deal severe damage by hit and run tactics against superior numbers alliances tldr if an alliance cant respond to attackers fast enough it doesnt deserve its space the moment you notice youre under siege is the moment to get your people togetheralso its a difference if you try to take the space of an alliance controlling 5 systems including people in it of altogether 100 or more or of an alliance controlling 50 systems with 300 people spread out a good tactic can make it impossible for those 300 people to defend some deadend somewhere this is the way it should be in my opinion not that timed blobbing  we have right now2 space is too small yeah theres a lot and a lot more of empty systems but still its too easy to hunt lonely people down especially when regions are covered by a single intel channel and again its too easy to respond to attackers example once a roaming gang comes in its usually 5 jumps out and taking a predicted route shout at titan pilot warp bait with cyno gen to gate get aggressed cyno hotdrop this gang is either ed or runs offit should be more like where the hell are theyalso important are the logistics the further your space is the harder it should be controllable especially the supply if you cant manage to seed shipsmods to your alliance members because you are unable to get stuff to some place 50 jumps from empire then you dont deserve your space i remember how it was in zafs old space down in tenerifis if you wanted to avoid aaa space to go through blue space that meant about 50 jumps nothing you really wanna do without fast ship or cloak so an alliance would have to care for jump freighters and their routes to supply its own membersand another thing jump clones i think theyd already nerf themselves if you increase 00 profitabilitynerf level 4 missions but i dont like the fact of being able to safely do 50 plus implants saved in a few seconds if you want to control space keep your members in place otherwise stay in high secsame goes for titan bridges nice thing indeed dont want to say too much about it but they also make it too easy to move whole fleets and especially rallying them moving 200 people in the same moment is easy but having 200 people come from different systems to a destination is a nightmare3 pos stuff which i already mentioned before it all comes down to reinforcing a pos and coming backdefending at the time the tower or the alliance says well see how that is gonna be fixed but thats another whole topicwell those are the points that i personally dont like
wall hacks lolthere are two kinds of multiplayer environments one such as in the xna game engine and directx systems like used for fps games where you can run your own server do put collision detection and other rulekeeping routines in the clients making hacked clients the thing of course yes if you shut down collision detection in your client you can pass through walls more common are those head hunter or head shot bots seen in fps games where whether clientserver or peer to peer if the collision detection is on the client it can be hacked mmos typically do not keep rules on the client level if it were up to every eve client to determine if their ship was hit or not that would have been hacked years ago and we would still be talking about that raid on empire space where even concord got popped the eve client like the wow client is quite dumb in that it only interfaces the user and the game construct but does not keep track or enforce the rules ever notice how the screen lags when the network lags or how the ship does not respond if the connection temporarily goes into a high ping state thats because you only issue commands to the server but your client does not update your view of the environment until the server sends that information wow does this as well with the only exception i have noticed being the map height collision and collision with large objects such as trees and structures this is mostly irrelevant because you can shootcast through them and if you beat the map height the server knows you busted the altitude rule once i fell off the world in that game into nothing and died at a certain point of the drop customization of the eve client would not give anybody any advantage over anybody else as far as rules are concerned nobody gets an i win button the server keeps the same rules and the client can only send user input and update user perception back as for programmers having an advantage over everybody else there is no history of that nobody is going to spend a month on a good client mod just to keep it a dark secret programmers need work and making a popular script or interface mod is a great resume builder and client mods only give end users the ability to put buttons and views where they want a fully customized ui only makes the client fit the brain of the user but the user still has to know how to play and have the right skills if i move the locked targets from the uppper right to the left or along the bottom that does not make them locked up easier or easier to hit and i dont assume that people with weak necks who cant look up would get and advantage over me when those ships are no longer displayed along the top i suggest that the detractors here look at other systems and see how their client uis were modded and see that this is not as harmful as it appears
oh god yes can we have this done last year please
herzog wolfhammer nailed it addons are a sign of progress and they should be implemented asap
i would be in favor of some kind of plugin systembut instead of it being an easily modified interface where you can exchange version freely i would rather see a market like solution players develop mods package them up upload them to the ingame markets and other players pay for and download them mods stay with the account or even toon after that
i can think of some mods that could enhance things where some players who have it got an advantage but therein also sits a solutiontake for example the case with scan probes when you reduce the au scanning radii you have to move each probe of the cluster closer to each other to regain the lost overlap now imagine if it were possible that this was done automatically in the client that the distance of the probes in the cluster would remain constant with the variable of the au search radius why the player who has that would scan things down faster than those who dont emoragequit emoragequitsuch a mo would have to be incorporated into the eve client look at the wow client and see how its extremely easy to find some great mods that help game play if such mods were written and then incorporated into the stock client by ccp by their own standards that would be the holy grail of client customization the person who wrote it would be famous in a way and this would be a feature that explorers are already begging for and ccp would have invested very little time and money on development i would even hope the ccp offers some plex or isk for such accomplishments maybe a faction ship as a reward or something rare a stock setting of the client will no affect mining bots either and those who dont want to have to put in a module because they simply dont want to being that lazy in a simulation game is as close to being an inanimate object as i could imagine simply dont have to to say that things should stay the same because some people just dont care to and therefore we all have to remain at their level is a kind of socialism in game content that keeps mmos from expanding i have witnessed it myself there are people who wont play a game if they cannot customize their interface i have seen people get completely turned off by such client programs that they could not rearrange
no supportthis and the fuel idea are bad ideas
not everyone uses kbs ingame flat text is meh compared to 3rd party apps  this is not a good state of afaresi dont prentend to understand how easyhard it would be to implement  i would just like the csm to request it from the devs and let them decideluckily for the rest of us  you are not in charge of the hall oh yes and supporting my own proposal at last
either way this isnt going to happen since the idea did not receive significant public supportthere are many posts like this on the forum all they do is distract csm from really important issues with large player support and give devs more excuses not to act i thought you were smart enough to understand that the only way csm can succeed is being very focused and determined on several key issues with public keeping attention on the goal without distractions
this hasnt proven to be the case at all plenty of minor issues have been raised and some implemented without obviously changing the status of the big ones they have tools to prevent this sort of thing from happening  priority lists discussion scheduling and the like your concern seems unwarranted
remember when they added view market details to the right click menu on items in the build list of a bpo this was a very small change that made a big  industry related  improvement to the gamelots of small improvements can add up to extra uberness not everything has to be a huge topic of concern to thousands
that wasnt a csm issueyou are still confusing the purpose of this forum and organization with the features and ideas forum  which has been established since the game began exactly for this purpose
remove local everywhere in eve not just 00 it would make both positive and negtive sec status operations more interesting
crew  failwill never happen and shouldnt
this has been discussed since beta however there is by no means consensus internally in ccp the argument against it is that capsuleers are demigods they dont need crew

well ccp already wasis outsorcing gms and it didnt went well as we can see but then again as my ppl would say the fish stinks from the head i am prety much sure that outsourcing is not the essence of the problem if there are proper procedures when recruiting gms testing their ingame knowledge and monitoring their work it would limit the ammount of issues we are having nowalso branching the type of petitions is extremely bad and it needs to be reworked aswell eve is a complex world and even i and i think that i am allrounded player with vast knowledge of mechanics in many cases dunno how something realy works in evethe problem starts when certain or all cant say gms are covering all kind of petitions i had cases when same gm who was working on fe unstucking from jita is answering sov related petitions where he doesnt have a clue either of what i am petitioning nor what he is answering to me for certain type of petitions like billing issues unstucking chars and further cant check right now all they types char transfer and similar issues you really dont need eve einsteins to handle them cause tbh u need really narrow and shallow eve knowledge to do that and we still have 24 time response on some of themfor a long time i was pursuing that gms need to actively play the game and not just gms but all ccp employers i know that many ccp guys are playing as carebears but i think i can be wrong ofc but its rare cases of me being wrong d  that there is not much ccp guys doing 00 serious warfare i know that after t20 incident ccp got much more strict and afaik now if u r employed by ccp your accounts got on ice and you can play only with new anonymous new accountssomehow i think its not solving any problems because i personaly think that t20 was ccp fault only in hiring hmm lets be nice and say  bad person who was ed enought to spawn t2 bpos lets be perfectly honest even now with much more improved and tightened internal procedured in ccp you can theoreticaly i am prety much sure there are not any cases of this atm leak certain info to your favorite ingame entity hell i am sure i could work for ccp not play eve at all and lead my alliance also theoreticaly speaking only thing stoping me and i think only thing which can stop at all ccp employes of not doing stupid stuff is their conscience same goes for gms  let them play cause thats the only way for them to realy know what is going ingame its realy not enough for them just to spawn when node starts colapsing and to write in blue color in local chati am completely aware that ccp has limited resources which can allocate to gm department but i am 100 positive ofc i can be wrong d but as said above its not a common thing to happen that gm dept can be wastly improved  where theres a will theres a wayi hope lavista will not find this post whiny or unproffesional

the whole thing is tldr by now but so muchi totally agree with the initial post i have at this point very little trust in ccp to the point where i dont bother anymore with petitions or bug reports eg because i am just being told to recreate a situation on the server thats evidently hard or impossible for me to recreate or reporting posts like the phishing ones because the perincident reaction is a joke or reporting rmt because they also only respond per incident without any visible intent to be improving anything without locking out a rmter for more than 5 minutes maxadd to that the general suckage of the web tools once you have written the same bug report thrice it just aint that important anymore motivation especially for helping a company for free is a b i understand they are working on improving the web stuff but then again was there actually a time when they were notitd take a long time to regain some trust in any case even if they had any intentalso i think its been said lack of interdepartmental comms wtli would add my own examples of glaring inconsistencies but itll just get modded anyway so why botherultimately however what he said a couple of pages above involving that dead horse and the beating

the dscanner needs a complete overhaul before even thinking about removing local as it stands and with the presence of even one neutral in low sec pveers are in the need to constantly read every 5 seconds spam the scanner in order for it to be remotely effective removing local means spamming the scanner every 5 seconds all the time probes  dscanner have tilted the balance of power too far in the side of the predator i had created a thread discussing this issue in detail before it was trolled to hell by a couple of respectable pirates that deemed it perfectly fair for their target to repeatedly spam buttons to protect themselves against the predator

unfortunately without statistics on how many mission runners feed minerals into the market vs the number of miners the 40 number is meaninglessex if you have 100 mission runners to 1 miner then i would hardly find it shocking that a significant number of resources are coming from the mission runners
its not that hard to extrapolate from the numbers given by looking at the daily traded volume for a single item knowing which npc drops it and then doing a rough estimationpeople can only shoot so many ships at any given time
id say that would still involve too many unverifiable assumptions to be considered valid what if a significant portion reprocessed it themselves ccp would know where the minerals came from but the playerbase never couldthey also stated those statistics came from one month worth of reprocessing depending on their methodology loot saved up from the previous year and then reprocessed during that month might count toward the number the same could also be asked about wherewhen the ore attributed to miners originatedrelying on assumptions that are as likely to be false as they are true doesnt really prove anythingedit  bolded item for emphasis
i never claimed it to be the bold truth but you can get a decent enough estimation to see a trend when less people running missions you know in advance which minerals are going to be hit hardest and the more or less line up exactly with the chart postedknowing where the modules come from where and in what volumes you can then match that up against events like the recent macro mass ban and more or less get a rough and i will stress very rough idea of how many compare vs miningalso note i didnt say who outnumbers who and by how much im not even going to try and lay claim that what i have in my mind is even close to being accuratebut i will say that only a scant handful of mission runners can actually outpace a single miner by leaps and bounds in specific mineral categories

wow messing up eve has it is now thats a big downside i got to go with a no on this one
supported there have been enough threads asking for a mission rebalance just do it already
if that is your only meter of evaluation if something must be changed dont ever dare to protest for the nano nerf and the speed changes or fro 90 of the changes in eve as there are always lot of threads pro and against something by that logic suicide ganking should at the same time be a bannable offense and have no sec status hitconcord should be removed and extended to 01 systems and so onsome rebalance done gradually as ccp is doing good removing all meta 0 loot as a abrupt change as the op suggest almost certainly very bad
i would be in favor of seeing a change in the raw item drops from npc ships the concept of a bpc or design is a good one as it would bring more people into the processing loopit would be nice once again to see mining as the main focus for mineral production though i would rather see it focused in lowsec or 00 high security mining can be automated so actual players would have a tough time competing with programs
if there are 100 mission runners to 1 miner then that right there might just be an indication that something needs rebalancing
do not want more orcas or variants of orcas
didnt you read either rigmodule or adjust not a necessary a secondary or even variant version of orca while i do detest the 3x number of rig bpo i do see why you would hate to have another orca version beside this dev blog is at least july 06 2009 which is a good 6 week of development time assuming that they begin it way back then it is often not very productive to switch development time right in the middle of the process to just trash it all and start something else which is why i suggest adjusting only the ship maintenance bay to 600000 m3 which is a static database entry which has the advantage of less programming overhead but given sisi lack of any changes to orca beyond ore hangar i would have strong reasons to be wary of the change they plan for this why you ask the more featureprogramming something take often beget even more bugsfeatures no offensive meant to ccp programmers

proposal warning upon account creation  if you wish to pvp do not repeat do not go minmatar  ive been playing this game for awhile now and have made the mistake of being minmatar our ships for pvp are well terrible compared to gallente and amarr i have seen thread after thread trying to get this issue addressed and resolved honestly nothing has ever happened it does however makes me ask myself do ccp gms devs actually play eve anymore and if so i guess their not minmatar im guessing if i raised this issue with them id be told train another race if you dont like it well i just spent 6 months training ships skills and large t2 gun specialization will you give me that time back obviously not
would you like some cheese to go with your whine there are plenty of minmatar pvpers around if you wanted something easy go play a different game
i loldseriously dont drink and post
ummminmatar ships are awesome for pvpyou are tremendously stupid
confirming that the rifter and the rupture and the hurricane are terrible
where have you been we worked that out ages ago and the only way pilots of these ships get kills is because people dont pay attention due to laughing too muchanyhow minmatar ships are mostly fine except for the battleships at least in my view
agreed at least they didnt stick destroy probes there i saw another suggestion somewhere about leaving that button on the left but right aligning all the others
anyone ever thoought of the reason why rr i not used on anything smaller battleships in most cases  ofcource it is used rairly but that is nothing compaired to frequency it appears on bs fleet for a fleeet of more then 3 bs rr is almost mandatory no matter what it is doingreason being imbalance of fitting requirments it is just insane small remote repper need 15 power grid that is more then is needed for any small weapon most small guns require 912 powergrid the largest caliber the powergrid demand is 3 times larger then that of a small armor reppermedium rr need about 160 powergrid that is about same as the fitting reqirment for ion blasters thats much better but still alot about same demand for powergrid as that of medium repper large rr needs 600 powergrid 27  times less then any large weapon in existance it needs 4 times less powergrid then large armor repper in my opinion the situation above does not make sence solutions make all reppers need about the same amout of powergrid up to developers to decide what it sould be
while i do agree that it does seem imbalanced based on your numbers having them all use the same amount of power is definately not the answer that will either make them unfittable on frigates or make them so easy to fit on cruisers and larger ships that everyone will have one as a matter of course potentiallynot supported

maybe for nonspecific ships yes but for those ships who are created to operate behing enemy lines  such as black ops recons covert ops and stealth bombers  i dont think it should work these could have a special hull to absorb the waves of your scanning device to render them unscannable whilst their cloack is activated for other ships sure why not
because those other ships are already incurring massive penalties from the cloak its already balanced
it already happens on killboards i dont understand why this shouldnt be implemented ingamei give it a week to actually happen if the devs were to take a look at thiswe already have that awesome new ability to linksave fits so there shouldnt be much difficulties in dynamically creating fits based on fits of destroyed ships the info is already in the apikillboardsi mean if the information wasnt already available without more work into researching someones fit id agree but its already shown in killboardsthis would just be one more thing towards making ccps stuff used more than thirdparty im not against thirdparty im just for firstparty doing things right with readily available information

the idea of colonies is a good one but this implementation is not going to add much for the average player or bring more people out to 00 space the first problem with this idea as it is now is that only alliances can put up these colonies after they gain constellation sovereignty the reason this fact is not good is because it makes the content inaccessible to anyone who is not top brass is a larger alliance secondly if the only ships capable of attacking a colony are capital ships then there really wont be much difference between a pos and a colony they really would just become an extension of the other without adding anything truly different to the game after reading the csms meeting minutes on the subject it looks like ccp is looking to revamp the way sovereignty works and colonies are a possibly solution with that being said colonies should not become the next step after sovereignty for an alliance but an alternative to gaining sovereignty if colonies are meant to bring more players to 00 then they should be accessible to the individual or at least to smaller groups of individuals players that arent out in 00 having fun with poss right now arent going to jump in with colonies if colonies function on the same level what i think eve needs is more content that must be managed by smaller groups that will benefit the alliance as i said before i like the idea of colonies but lets not make this another version of the pos lets get some 00 content that more individuals can enjoy
no it doesnt the directional scanner works perfectly fine even in wspace swapping the mode types between constellation and local will allow defensive players to be even more aware of their surroundings at a longer range than before while limiting the precision of the intelyour thread was just a whiny rant dont bring that same crap into this thread
constellation chat isnt regional it wont be that large of a change as for having to deal with spam simply turn off blink and minimize the window if you dont want to read it nobody is forcing you
relax i was just sharing my opinion on a public forumby the way the irony of you bellum eternus accusing others of posting whiny rants is simply priceless
yes it would but do you improve mining or nerf mission running do you work with real numbers or speculationsomebody further up cautioned against making decisions based on unverifiable assumption
maybe cause the skills needed for mission running also translate to pvp and that mission running has more variety than mining
as someone who just started lvl 4 missions on an alt i do not support this because i use the loot to melt down into cruise missiles which in turn i use to destroy things
just put a falloff on all tractor beams far from us slowest
i have a better idea how about ccp but just puts all the salvage and loot in our hangars for us so we dont need to salvage great idea huh
you know theres this ship yes a ship that gets a bonus to tractor beam range and velocity its allowed in high sec its called an orca use its 70km tractor at 1000ms and get a dessy alt with salvagers to salvage or use a marauderedit using an orca you can loot and then get your dessy alt to put the salvage in your corp hangar there you go no need for stuff to make missioning even easier
imo 001ing is done mostly to annoy ppl its not so much market pvp as it is legal market pvp greifing before anyone flames that i know some people see it different but everyone is entitled to an opinion

the whole keylogger posting is getting annoying and while i appreciate the effort the ccp folks do devs who act as forum mod in their spare time its obviously not enough and isnt a 24 hour coverage apart from all the passivedefensive options like increasing security and changing the rules to posting we simply need more moderatorsgiven the fact that ccp kicked out all actual moderators in favour of the devs have enough time where theyre twiddling their thumbs lets add it to their workload idea which i dont support asking outright for more moderators isnt going to work so if ccp doesnt have the manpower or is unwilling to hire them that can only mean its up to us the playerbasegiving light mod powers to random people in the community is ofcourse asking for trouble even though we could probably come up with a list of trusted persons who should be capable of not abusing their powers but i think i have a better idea give csm members some mod powers they already have their own members group csm rep so adding options to that would be easy they could still abuse their powers ofcourse but at least they would be held accountable somewhat as their rl identity is known due to the whole identification thing and they have something to lose in the form of their csm membership any moderation to nonkeylogger threads would result in a beatinglight mod powers would include able to empty a post able to give out a temporary 48 hour ban to give ccp time to reactthis way they can remove the keylogger crap and prevent that poster from spamming for a good while giving ccp the time they need to close the account lets hear your thoughts
if the csms are getting mod powers it should be for two forumsah jpsc and it should be for the purposes of allowing better management of topics mostly in the form of modding links and status updates into ops and even then it should probably just be the secretary and maybe the vicesecreary andor chair making them all demimods on the whole forum to address the keylogger thing doesnt seem to be a great idea  its not something that theyd be suited to given that most of them arent huge forum s and given that csms seem to get forum bans themselves a lot of the time

the directional scanner has a maximum range of around 14 au this is easily achieved by typing a lot of 9s in the range field since it is measured in km a common tactic to pinpoint objects with the directional scanner is to first narrow down the angle and then decrease the range successively this by subtracting a lot of km1 au  150000000kmi propose that range on the scanner should be determined by a slider graded if you like or at least be able to toggle input between km and au i dont mind scanning being complicated but entering values up to 14 au in km is bad ui
id rather just have the range input box be in au tbh
not supported i would rather have an input box for the angle
yes range in au would be nice
why not have both a slider and a manual range entry
though switching the scanner input to au from km could be a more productive thread
yes please slider and input box for both options

not supportedtbqh the main reason you dont see small ships using rr is because its a pain in the arse to stay in range of eachother when youre mwding around its very possible to fit rr on non bs class ships but it requires a much greater degree of organization and teamwork to make it effective
ok while writing this topick i made an assumtion i assumed it would bee obvious that i dont whant to make all rrs require 600 powergrid including frigate ones i whant rrs to be equally easy to fit on all ship classes there fitting requirments need adjustment currently fitting them on bs costs nothing fitting them on cruiser is hard and fitting them on frigates is nearly impossible that needs fixing now i would like to know how exactly that is a bad idea
supportetdit would bring more versatility and frigs wouldnt be instapoped by warrior t2 drones in seconds or by destroyers
you might want to change the title to remote repairers for different ship classes when i read the title i thought it was about giving different yields depending on which ship class you targeted
i plan to ask ccp to increase the limit on courier contracts this should allow rigged ships to be courierd in freighters im not sure if increasing the sma on an orca is the best way to solve the rigged ships transport issue as an increase in the ships abilities may lead to other problemsimbalances
not supportedthe orca is not the solution to rigged battleship transport it is an industrial command ship and not a carrier i was kind of confused considering the mining requirements as to why its ship maintenance bay was not limited to industrial ships as the rorqualif there is going to be highsec transport of rigged ships it should be utilizing the current freighters or a new type of ship specifically designed to haul other ships
i just dont see the point in doing this why would u want to fit just one bs in the ship array surly u could just fly the ship if your just moving one ok ok u might not have the skills for that ship but i see this as very limited use even if they increased the couriour contract size to allow u to fit bs into freighters whats the point u can only fit 1 and a few other small ships again its too limited use personally id very much like to see a teir 2 freighter with say 10 ships slots and a small corp hanger ships slots not limited to size much more useful
you know what they should completely do this o and dont complain when an orca drops a smartbombing bs next to your hulk and you wake up in a station
was already asked and told that it will be added to the docket just no timeline on whenalthough i do support you pressing the matter more vehemently
hopefully they have one of their teams working on corp management
anything that lets us get more granular with roles and security for corporation management is a thumbs up from me
precisely this proposal is a small step in the right direction
totally not something that csm can get done but i sure as hell agree with the sentiment1

i bought my battlecruiser for roughly 34 million isk i insured it for roughly 11 million isk lets say that all in all it cost me 46 million heres the catch now my battlecruiser is insured for about 38 million isk which means ill loose out about 8 million because of insurance okay thats better than with no insurance but to top it all of my equipment is not insuredsurely should there not also be insurance for modules yeah sure some of your modules survive destruction but if you dont have a ship with a proper cargohold nearby you can kiss that stuff goodbyethe costs for fitting a battlecruiser or even a cruiser usually exceed the costs of a simple frigate by a large margin so should we not be able to insure such precious items
im not sure if this is parody or just missing the point insurance exists to let players survive losing ships not to make losses irrelevant
its not a parodyyou can insure your home you can insure whats in your home so why cant i insure whats in my ship
and what would you base that insurance value on the price it is sellable for at the time of insuring how about current market price which market should the scc use what if you lose the ship in lowsec00 you put the ship in a risky placethe insurance debate is not a simple one using any of the above as a way of figuring out the insurance value is exploitable if you check the market discussion forums youll see a few discussions about player implemented insurance schemes covering most of this
what other chatroom to communicate dissatisfaction then i think the gm team is tough skinned enough by now to handle the fact that some number of csm members arent happy with the situationthe proposal could be better worded though because it really should be above the level of common conversation and chat room rage but i do think its an issue that needs to be talked about in iceland and i expect everyone will be perfectly civil speaking about it in real life at least

ccp its called quality assurance look into italso why dont you publically release your internal performance index for the customer service deptoh wait that wouldnt make a difference since you guys arent taking customer satisfaction into account with that index is itbecause honestly if you guys took customer appreciation into account with that index youd prolly have to fire 34 of the dept
a cp we are looking into the issue response would be very nice for noninstant things would make me a lot happier at least
i support this as a minmatar player
yes please
be care careful what you wish for you might get itthat means with size comes fitting requirement coul you fit another 2000 powergrid50 cpu module on your rattingmissionship i normally couldnUFFFDt and i donUFFFDt want my dedicated salvager be a bsi donUFFFDt see how a small module could keep the 20km range they would be more like 102040 since bonused they still double the range they wonUFFFDt let you to be able to pull wrecks from sniperrangemarauders and t3 ships already got 40km range which means you can pull things in 80km diameter which is sufficient most of the time and when it doesnUFFFDt it requires not much movement to get in rangeso small tractors are fine decent range for almost no fitting requirementnot supported
now stop and think very carefully about what you said there you said theres no need to make changes to looting and salvaging because people should just get an orca for tractoring think carefully about that statement finished thinking good do you feel like you said something really stupid yet yes i thought you would
signed
i dont feel stupid we dont need bigger salvagers when we have 3 non cap ships with tractor beam bonuses use them or continue using a dessy an orca just helps since it can pull 3 wrecks at a time from 70km  while a dessy alt with 8 salvagers salvages as they come then all loot and salvage goes into the orca to be brought to a station to sell or we
so you are claiming that the 50 or so people i heard from is wrong they claim the best usage for orca they claim is tractor in wreck then use another boat to salvage much quicker especially if they blitz most setup from what i heard consider of 3 alts one running the mission and one alt for getting mission and one in orca for salvaging clean up after the mission runner leave the area
no supporting this use ships with bonus marauders orca rorqual etc
given that we will discuss with ccp a change to wreck ownership and seeing how much discussion we had about that during the csm assembly i would pick this up as a suggestion for a rebalance of the suggested ownership change
if you get this flagging than you can get the tractor beam proposal they must be connected
tractor wreck get flagged all for it
certain maladjusted people in this community petition everything the subjects of their ire say a stalk them on the forums it can rack up rather a lot of bansalso giving the csm mod powers is a terrible idea no offense intended but i wouldnt trust any of you to be impartial
oh god no do you actually realise what youre suggesting
just give somebody the ability to unstick and stick threads in jita speakers forum nobody needs more mod powers then that having an old meeting thread stickied after weeks is dumb
for about 3 months i have a fundamental problem and dont have a clue where it originatesi have 7 payed accounts some with timecards my mains are creditcard ones around these i center my gameplay in eve long term planlately one main account is upgraded to 12 months and another is upgraded for shorter term all done by creditcardhowever for the last three months my cards gets not accepted twice in a row now and at randomi am forced to fill the gap with more expensive timecardsi cant face my creditcard company with the story that my card gets both accepted and not accepted by ccp especially at random this they will notice too as i do myself nowquestions1 according to your knowledge and that within the community are more players facing this problem2 based upon ccps financial records how often does it happen that credit cards owned by multipleaccount players gets accepted at random3 based on a not so strange assumption if this happens more often are players forced into buying more expensive time cards we know time card selling can be a profitable business i did petion my creditcard request earlier got the answer all should be fine now however the problem resurfaced again today i just repetitioned it with the character i use for this issue but please dont throw the petition route back into my face my request to you staysplease no wise crack remarks on my financial situation that is more than average my creditcard gets accepted elsewhere and on occasion even by ccp also i play this game 2 years in a row with pleasure hence the 7 accounts and will visit the fanfest a second time in a row what more can you expect from an eve playersincerelyandre ukoppie
contact your credit card company and ask them why its being declined when ccp tries to authorize it they should be able to look up the attempted transaction and tell you exactly why they declined to accept it if they cant change credit card companies
its all you buddy not ccpoh and heres our complimentary tinfoil hatcontact your cc company and tell them to figure out wth is upive never had a problem and i rarely hear about them as well
mmos are the subject of a lot of credit card fraud so the credit card companies get paranoid about them ive mine freeze my account twice over eve the second time i had to call to get it unfrozen i got through to a human and had her put a note on my account that it was a verified and recurring charge no trouble since
if u r from former yugoslavia then welcome to the club similar problem have dozens of my corpmates while i must say we dont have any problems paying with creditcards anywhere else whatever is it online or traveling abroad it is still unknown mystery why your cc will be accepted or not from account to account despite all account details are the samei know that there are gms focusing on this problem and petitions are in most cases being solved in day or two so try your luck there there is nothing wrong with your cc
i will keep this simple the stasis webifier tech ii has very little advantage over the tech i variant they both have the same optimal range but the tech ii version has a slighter bonus with 60 velocity over 50 velocity they also both have the same overload at 30 optimal range bonusesmy proposal here is to increase the optimal range overload bonus on the tech ii stasis webifier from 30 to 40 then leaving the tech i module the same at 30you need energy management v before you can overload modules thats a level 4 skill thats not easy to train for combat pilots
except almost every combat pilot trains that as soon as they cannot supported its fine how it is
to level 5 i dont know if youre a combat pilot then there is much more needed skills like gunnery ballistics electronic warfare ship command target locking speeds and so on before i would actually train that to 5 its good to have up but its very heavy for combat focus pilots that dont have their bonuses to intmem
unfortunately yes the benefits it gives greatly outweighs the training time your dps goes up tank goes up range and some strength on ewar goes up all for just 25 days of training or so most good combat pilots i know have trained it
supportedits pretty obvious its not meant to work this way
tldrtheres faction drones on sisi atm i can quite clearly remember seeing gallente navy garde ogre hammerhead and hobgoblin i assume its the same for th restedit theyre t1 drones with double hp and a bit faster i think
double hp faster tracking and 10 less damage only weapon where the faction version get drawbacks
iUFFFDm not sure about more dedicated droneships because exsisting ones are okbut i agree with the point about dronemodulesrigsimps there should be more especially damage enhancers and their t2 counterpartsfurthermore i would love to see a rework of the droneui the current window is not very comfortable to work with i want proper buttons stats all integrated into the hud where it belongs
yes please some love for dronesstart with the interface and make dronedamage visible in bayand some hotbuttonseasy work
yes
double whammy support bump combo
sure this would certainly help in fleets
as long as it can be on some channels and not others ie on fleet but not local
oh god this

with the rash of keylogging dumbasses pervading our forums i would like for the csm to seriously discuss the idea of turning off autolinks on the forums for any site that doesnt begin wwweveonlinecomive reported at least a half a dozen of these stupid threads today and its frankly annoying i have in the past argued that we are all responsible for our own net security and i still believe that 100 however it is obvious to me that there is a significant portion of the population that needs extra help so what i propose is the followingany link that does not return back to the official eve online website will not be displayed as an automatically clickable link meaning that the url will be displayed but if you want to visit it you have to copy the link into your browser address bar and press enterits inconvenient yes for those sites that are legitimate but i think we can capitalize on the natural human tendency to avoid work where possible and make the keyloggers lives as miserable as possible
i also realize this wont cure the problem im simply trying to offer up suggestions to assist our newer players until ccp comes up with something more long termill admit the eve comic one almost got me until i realized that the issue numbers didnt match
10
the idea isnt a terrible one but the csm process is far too slow for it post it on eve general id say
this all goes back to my idea of denying people the ability to post but that didnt go over so welli have to agree with hersch this idea is better served going straight to the topbut i suspect ccp wont do much eitherthe spamming is pandemic and they are hardly doing much about itoh sure they clean it up but im glad they want to spend extra work time to clean up useless crap
thats unfair dont you think that they would prevent it preemptively if they could nobody can block spam especially well  if microsoft google and yahoo combined cant come up with a way to keep my inboxes spamfree im not going to expect ccp to do better
do these still exist and can you find them with probes
yes and yes
still not supported this is a bad idea because its perfectly possible to fit rr on frigscruisers yes proportionally it takes more grid but its not significant enough to matter if you need some help fitting your ships theres a whole forum dedicated to it 
erm rigged ships transport are not even going to be useful beyond transport rigged ships but my way would reduce art department work and keep the change to an absolutely minimum which let devs have more time spent somewhere else instead of doing works that only a minority of eve online player might use or not why you think there only has been 5 pirate faction set of ships also some of the pirate ships are copied hull with different color look at bhaalgornarmageddon to start withalso if i remember right the courier contract limit was imposted following the doll within a doll within a doll in carrier feel free to correct me if i am wrongincrease to orca sma size that is slow than a battleship both align time and warp speed where would that introduce problemimbalances my experience whenever introducing a new ship alway face problems look at naglfar when it had dual bonus missileturret and when vexor could deploy 15 drones and black op useless prenerf stat this is why i am very against a new ship unless it is going to face lot of testing even the fairly new tech 3 strategic cruiser still have some bugsplease feel free to critic my ideas but you havent offer any real hard facts beyond what you feel
didnt you read 600000m3 is a far cry from a ship that can jump use fighter remote repair and do dozens other things that an orca cant do a carrier sma is at 1000000 m3 go look for yourself if you dont pilot one one of the reason why i am saying something now is because they are already modifying orca to have extra 50000 m3 of ore bay similar to fuel bay only for ore if you are going to use the freighter it will force ccp to spend dev time creating either modulerig which has effect creating sma or even other effectthings that will take longer time than a simple adjust to orcas sma dev have said that art content take the longest time to create entirely from scratch repeatably orca is intend as a highsec ship courier to bridge the gap between a freighter and an industrial even the rorqual can ferry so much much much more than a carrier at cost of offensive capabilities but cant enter highsec
refer to my comment on art contents and dev times
exactly how are you going to enter the battleship oh wait that right it might be fun to give up 450 million isk because the said hulk pilot had a friendlies in the belt
how about basing it on the mineral value of the items in question eve already has something like this integrated into contracts would be a simple thing to adapt code that already works well to provide that output to a new area
the current contract system uses the items baseprice value which is an arbitrary number decided by ccp when they add the shipmod to the database and the numbers used are the original npc baseprice of minerals the current insurance system is already using that value for ships adding it in for modules would do very little since every variation of that module the meta value is identical or very close to a t1 gun is then worth the same amount as an officercommanderfactionwhatever gun for insurance purposes
the idea of a man walking into an insurance brokers office and trying to purchase cover for a ship of war sounds like the setup for a monty python sketch
i wasnt able to be an alt in this meeting although i had planned to be the morning of the meeting my cat had a medical emergency that eventually resulted in her being put to sleepi do however agree totally with lvissler
im so sorry to hear about this issler
kuan got it in one i support this motion simply because privateers rage so much about it and have become its biggest user in eve
uh you should prob talk to your corpmates about this as well there the pitboss i like fighting against you dudes last time we got decced but i was in the dix aka dodixie today and ur member mirrabela was getting rred exploiting the same mechanic u are complaining about and i might be going out on a limb here but i guess it was an alt cuz the toons name was mirrabella note the epix difrence in namez lolz who was chillin in a guardian during the entire engagement just dont want you to look like a hypocrite thats all get back to me on it if you want
your tears are delicious  thankyouuh  i might be going out on a limb but i would guess you havent read any of the thread and just blind post as for being a hypocrite  ive never used the tactic and havent called for an end to remote repping  suggestion wipe the tears from your eyes  and actually read the original post  get back to me on it then  if you want  i will have a box of kleenex if need be
i still think that using remote repair should cause a 60 second aggression timer and if done in a way that flags you to someone who is otherwise neutral should result in 30 days of killrights to the people you acted against
pit rather than insult people who bring up valid points why dont you actually consider responding to them with a legitimate argument for someone whos calling for a nerf to neutral rr it would seem that the logical first step might be to purge your alliance of it noill be impressed if when you quote me you actually include what ive said rather than editing out valid ideas to make yourself look cooler
if youd stop trolling the thread and actually read it  you will find my stance throughout the whole thing  as for purging my alliance of it  well if it can be used against us  and is a valid tactic for now  why should i even attempt to purge it  would it make ccp act any different towards the issue  you dont have to be a genius to come to the conclusion noas for insulting people  i only take shots back when they shoot firstas for looking cooler  reality check  its an internet space ship game
but really what do mudkipz have to do with remote rep dwell now that youre actually responding to arguments i have a couple of questions which i dont think have been answered though its quite possible that theyve been lost in the walls of text1 i dont believe it was ever specified by you whether this will be a change to neutral remote rep or all remote rep in other words if i rr a corp mate alliance mate blue do i get this same countdown if so you may want to change the title and fp as theyre slightly misleading2 how can you justify a labeling a defensive action as an aggressive one this would be the equivalent of saying that local reps should give an aggro timer as well as far as involving yourself in the fight sure but if im fighting you and a friend of mine rrs me as i do so once i deagress why should it take longer for him to dock up than me a change that i could respect would be that as long as your rring someone whos shootingaggressing youd get the countdown but when they stop you get the same 1 minute countdown that they do starting then3 why the hostility as you said its an internets spaceship game be happy edit for those wondering why i misquoted pb check his an my last 2 posts and youll understand 
honestly im done being trolled by you so wont be responding anymore to you or your alts talking to you is like talking to a wall  you just dont get it because youre too lazy to read the entire thread and get the answer for yourself because all this has been brought up and discussed already just know this  the csm have already voted unanimously to bring this issue to ccp  unanimously  showing their support and acknowledgement that this is an issue that needs to be looked into  your displeasure for the change has been noted  especially since its a major part of your gamingenjoy the nerf in the future see you in the next thread i create
pit ive read the thread hell i think ive posted more in it than you have im not even saying that your ideas are wrong im saying that id like clarification on them please stop avoiding legitimate questions1 i dont believe it was ever specified by you whether this will be a change to neutral remote rep or all remote rep in other words if i rr a corp mate alliance mate blue do i get this same countdown if so you may want to change the title and fp as theyre slightly misleading2 how can you justify a labeling a defensive action as an aggressive one this would be the equivalent of saying that local reps should give an aggro timer as well as far as involving yourself in the fight sure but if im fighting you and a friend of mine rrs me as i do so once i deagress why should it take longer for him to dock up than me a change that i could respect would be that as long as your rring someone whos shootingaggressing youd get the countdown but when they stop you get the same 1 minute countdown that they do starting theneither answer those or link me to the post here where you have
think whats really needed is a person with the mindset and some understanding of the hid market who can activitly seek out accessability issues that the csm or ccp would otherwise likely not hear about as you can imagine for some just typing out a long sentence could be a chore for people in that situation a liason is needed who can take their issues further if the issues can be identified then between ccp and the coders that play eve im sure solutions can be found to make eve a joy to use with limited hids an area of responsibility being defined in the csm could likely be a nice start
instantly supported beautiful idea o7
maybe a little change not so drastickeep timer to 24 hours as it is now to any destinationallow jump within same region after 1218 hours lets say
i support this thread however it must not be a skill as this will then again become a mandatory for every alliance a 18 hour delay is finealso i noticed that there are a lot of flawed arguments against this proposal1 it will make alliance way to easy to move from one space to anotherthis is false have you ever thought about the fact that you need to jump ships equipment posses ammo and what not to your next location this is going to have to be done by capital ship as the last time i checked jump clones didnt take your stuff along with you also titans are a way better method to get your army across space be it at a shorter range yes more players will now be able to participate because they had some business elsewhere but that is not a bad thingfor those saying that it will aid the alliances in defending they are also wrong as it doesnt matter if its a 18 or 24 hour delay that pos wont be coming out of reinforced in that time the jump clone issue is not the problem here but the sovereignty issue is which is going to be fixed2 space will become smallerno it will not as i stated in my last argument your stuff is not taken with you along the ride so what would be better getting your character without anything but a rookie ship at a new location or getting your toon and your stuff by flyingjumping to the new location and not being restricted by a timer delay i know which one i would pick the space in eve is already huge and travelling is not a fun thing to do in eve as its a repetitive act of clicking buttons
i personally believe that when ccp created jump clones and set it to a 24 hour cooldown they wernt thinking honestly if you only want people to use jump clones once a day it has to be less than 24 hours otherwise if you use it each day after a week or so you will find the cooldown will happen outside your playtime and instead of waiting 24 hours it will be almost 48 it should be 2330 hours so as to allow the user to jump once a day without failtrollfor those who just say no i cry a little inside every time i think that one day your stupid genes will be passed onto the next generationtroll

i support this but its only the tip of the icebergthere are additional settings which id like to be saved serversideagreed i have hundreds of players in my buddies list and i run eve on different operating systems and different machines recently my local eve user settings became corrupt due to excessive fiddling i wiped them out and launched the eve client to rebuild everything now i dont have folders in my buddy list just hundreds of names in one list other candidates for serverside saving might include the followingship fittingsfrom the esc screen menu general settings layout theme selectioncharacter screen remember the last page viewedand etcits a great start avalloc thank you
lots of crap needs to be fixed with fw
my knowledge of poss isnt the best but as i recal they are corporation owned so i would suggest something like this if the corporation that owns the tower disapears then the tower should switch to a neutral state and be free to shoot at and if it remains unowned for a long enough period then have it automatically deleted like achorable cans shuttles etc that were abandoned

what is the point of having a 077 trusec system with 9 belts when in 2 hours of ratting biggest spawn i get is 2 x blood harbinger 125mil20 of time i go through all belts just to find no spawns anywhere in beltsfrigs cruisers battlecruisers spawn 80 of timei cant even make money ratting im making money by trading in empireand no i cant spend 10 hours ratting in order to get more valuable spawns then chain them eve should not be a damn job
while in principle i would agree with the ops sentiment i do however wish to point out another aspect of his proposal that will need to be addressed that is inflationif your going to introduce higher bounty earning potential through a mass pruning of cruiser and bad spawns from 00 space as well as increasing spawn rate then you also need more ways of getting that money back out of the game or youll end up with prices skyrocketingalso if your going to improve rating of a system then there must also be an equivalent mechanic of destroying sec rating either through a natural entropy process or player actions other wise in a few months youll find every system has a true sec status of 10finally while i see this as an improvement to 00 ratting as an incentive to reconsider lvl4 missions i dont see this is an improvement to mining which use to be a major benefit to holding some 00 spacemining as a profession has never really recovered from the introduction of the drone regions which imho was the biggest blunder of ccp to dateideally what i would like to see would be another 00 predominant consumable group that would be gained in 00 space plexingmining which would be required by the player base
correct that wspace operations are more profitable than even highsec missionrunning incorrect that this fact derails the essential point of the op any activity in eve when done with an organized group becomes both faster and more productive however for 00 organizing those operations becomes a luxury inbetween the necessary defense ops wars and whatnot the fact that much of 00 space is lackluster in quality and for ratting or mining each system will support only a few players at once drives pilots apart during short playperiodsif 00 did not come with the burden of defending what you own then perhaps the premise of it being the group playground which wspace is could be reasonableto the ops ideas kudos to a reasonably cognizant set of suggestions supported since they fall in line with some similar thoughts i posted beforeparticularly regarding the core idea of playerbuilt items improving the profitability of a systemi feel that area however could and should be incorporated into a more diverse set of structures probably in with other measures for investing in the defense and value of systemsregardless of the specifics 00 needs some hard thinking by nowkrum
i had an idea of how to improve 00 without raising inflation of flooding the markets with faction gearcreate new cruiser sized officer spawns that can happen in any 00 region they would work very similar to current officers but they would drop only cruiser sized modules  modules that are not currently in the loot tables of current officers and complexes this mostly focuses on new officer medium gunsmissile launchers and also xtype cruiser sized mods that currently dont drop we could also create new faction mods out of eccm racial ecm shield extenders plates  there are actually quite a bit of modules that have no high meta variantthis would create a new type of good that does not increase supply of already existing modules and does not inject massive isk amounts into the game its main effect would be to shift profitability from high sec empire to 00 spacethe spawn rates for these things would need to remain at same levels at current officer spawns not more not less
supportedthe good thing about ratting as an isk earning activity is that it spreads people out providing a basis for small scale conflict
a good idea in general but this would increase the price from other officer mods because there is a limited time a player rat and a infinite chance on spawning officers u should not complain delve is very very good broken u can get a officer spawn in every system there so delve should not get any improvements or it shoul be fixed properlylooool im gallente and i need to work 11 hours for a fitted pvp deimos 20220m t2 fit  rigs its allready broken they only need to fix it now now the question raises how fast can i lose a deimos i think i dont have to answere that the nickname diemost saiz enough it became broken ever since the high increase in mission runners a year or 2 ago mission income raised 00 rat income said the same now u tell me where that inflation came from carebears dont spend isk  well maybe they do but they dont brake it no lose no isk sink 00 ratters buy ships and blow them up how much is insurance these days on a t2 hac 7 mil
i am not ratting in delve you mongoloid i am ratting in queriousgod damn so many dumb people around
just want to point out that the t2 fighters idea for mothership is a pretty ridicilous fix their damage potential today isnt an issue the rr damage etc works fine as it is today fighters in fleet fights is a problem already when i flew carrier i recalled my 10 fighters when the first got shot at all was dead before they even initiated warp some 510mins later sometimes they refuse to come back and you have to scream at them over and over not to mention a single doomsday will kill them before they return wheres the ewarpout button cost efficiency in situations like above mentioned you lose 20x15 300mil for something that delivers nothing am pretty sure t2 fighters would up that cost in comparison a t2 fitted fully insured carrier with 10 fighters would cost you as much to lose as one momload of fightersthese things would be priority on my list atm survivability dreads melt your face while you try to fend off the hics it goes way too fast tad overlapping the survivability buff local armor rr modules are way too weak repping 96k on a regular slaved armor tank mom with what 600k raw armor hp before fleet bonuses every 225 sec thats below 15 total armor repped per minute still a necessary module on moms survival wise you want this if you get tackled while waiting for your support fleet to come in this module functions as a burst repper and the stats should reflect it more rep faster cycle itll suck more cap which is negating the higher rep already make the clone vat bay useful most useless module in the game atm on paper its great move your mom with ships have pals clonejump to you woot but wait now i get immobile and what happens if my friends die argh this is just  needs work sorry i have no suggestions theres probably alot more that could be discusssed but in essence this is some starters no t2 fighters please no sort clone bay and survivability take it from there

gavens and drakes proposals are both satisfactory
i like gavens better than drakes because i really dont need to see undamaged objects in the repair screen when i have a dozen other ways of seeing them that are more efficientto add to that what would be handy about drakes idea is if you saw an indicator for the damage outside of the repair screen

not supported if anything reduce duration of insurance to a month and no payout for concord kills
supported havent been in matari ships long and i can easily see the shortcomings
i might be going out on a limb here but ifyou set all ammo to have the same damage outputyou balanced all ship classes to have the same or equally powerful slot layouts and pgcpuyou make sure that no one race has a single disadvantage over anotherwouldnt that make for a pretty boring game youre complaining about small differences in dps not quite minute but small small enough that were 2 fighting characters not completely maxed out in all gun and tank skills youd be hard pressed to see whos at a disadvantageadmittedly i dont have experience flying minmatar however as far as im concerned they have plenty of advantages that balance out whatever disadvantages you seem to perceive
what you have just decided is how you balance systems is just the same as so many others its a conceptual problem that most cant get past hence why so few people have the ability to balance things effectivelyyou see to have things balanced does not require them to be the same or similar in their attributes balance can be gained by having pros and cons that when taken into consideration you find that each different system is found to be equal yet still quite differentoriginally though some zealots would disagree the three main turret weapons types were reasonably balancedprojectile weapons in comparison to hybrids and lasers are no longer in balance a good while ago before so many changes to eve buffs to hitpoints the proliferation of passive tanks and rr gangs plus many many more changes good or bad have had for the most part a negative impact on projectile weaponsif we take into consideration what pros projectiles have you will find they are few and mixedno cap use  no longer relevant in the age of ehp tanks active tanking needs a buff bonuses to active tanking need an increasehigh aplha  the hp buffs reduced the effectiveness of alpha strikes with ehp tanking dps outweighs alphahigh falloff  merely a way to fight at range heavy negatives in dps hit change and hit quality no module increases it but tds reduce itmixedvariable damage types  often spread three ways and t2 ammo is only explosive  kinetic ammo has lowest base damageeasy fitting of autocannons  the only benefit however with almost no increase in dps with higher tiers may aswell use the smallest anywaythen look at the conslowest dps  acceptable but not when the falloff is taken into accountworst optimal range  nearly impossible to build a decent sniper  autocannons all but have to fight in falloff reducing the lowest dps far lowever than eft warriors realisesmall clip size  artillery spends nearly 10 of its time just reloading the clip size just doesnt cut itno tech1 ammo with falloff  tech1 autocannons are effectively worthless in pvp as there is no way except for rigs to increase fallofflets be honest here the pros are actually for the most part cons and the cons are not minor but big issuesnow its fine to have low optimal ranges even the lowest dps however falloff clip size ammunition bonuses and base damage shouldnt be as they are
if you really wanted to fix acs and arty at the same time you have to give them a reason to actually care if they have variable ammo types the range restrictions determine what you fire just as much as what your firing at to make it worse the short range ammo is virtually worthless in large arty while the long falloff is crushed by a combination of lower damage and a short targeting range inherent to minmatar ships there needs to be two ranges for each of two types of ammo rather than 8 or 10 ranges make a short middle short rangefusion range and a middle long range ammonuclear range and give the short range all the same damage total just different damage types and the same for the long rangethis would help negate some of the optimal and dps problems on acs while giving arty a huge boost to short range making it win the dps war somewhere in between lasers and railguns and increasing its long range damage output to offset the fact that minmatar ship designers dont give a crap about range at all anywayswe are all forgetting that another nerf to projectiles came in the form of kinetic shield and armor penetration not only was it nerfed to hell and back years ago but then they added a skill to further nerf the crap out of what was supposed to be a tactical weapon option which explains why the caldari missile boats and the minmatar weapons that rely heavily on kinetic damage often come up short compared to their contemporaries on the battlefielddont get me started on base shield and armor damages of ammo types because that shouldnt even be in the game and certainly doesnt seem to hamper the damage output of the amarr in the slightest
all reasonable arguments though i think you may have missed my point yes i agree that projectiles are inherently at a small disadvantage to other weapons systems though not really enough to outweigh differences in skills of two fighting characters my argument is not that they are on par with other weapons systems but that they are weaker and minmatar have advantages in other areas for instance the maelstrom has one of the best active tanks in the game not to mention the overall speed advantage in all minnie shipsin the end i really dont think the change is needed as its perfectly possible to fly minnie ships as is
wow you didnt even read any of the arguments on this forum or any of the linked forums that totally blow that viewpoint out of water im happy you wanna keep this thread going but that is the best your post does every argument you have brought up has already been addressed multiple times and subsequently smashed into little bity bits in the ship and modules forums which were linked and going on 21 pagesbut to summarizeyes at one time it had advantages to counteract the low dps however they were all nerfed or buffed to the detriment of minnie bses and large projectiles the following changes put minmatar battleships and large projectiles in the back of the pack1 hp buff  removed the minmatar alpha strike from being more effective than dps for sniper fleets it also caused active tanks to be less effective meaning that active tanking required more cap than before removing the benefits of capless weapons and passive tanking dinged minmatar ships because they have less base shield and armor a raven can armor tank better than a tempest for example this applies to the maelstrom in that while it is great for small quick fights it does not hold up well in longer combat engagements2 amarr weapons boost  a much needed boost for the amarr it caused amarr pulse lasers to have greater optimal than autocannons optimalfalloff combined this plus having instantly changeable ammo allows the amarr to always have a minmatar ship at optimal range whereas minmatar ships have no choice but to fight at their optimal with a worse tank and worse dps3 vampneuts  this was one of the major nerfs to minmatar as using vamps and active tanks was a major fit used for pvp while it affected plenty of ships the tempest with two utility fittings lost the most a major advantage is gone as there is no reason to fit vamps over neuts4 ewar nerf  against another common tactic to improve minmatar battleship effectiveness was removed with the advent of the ecm nerf another nice advantage gone5 nano nerf  this rebalanced the battleships so that they all went slower though minmatar battleships are still relatively fast the tempest for example now has the most mass which means it has less agility now then before and so it accelerates slower and decelerates slower it essentially removes a minor advantagesome other points which you seem to have not read in your review of the forum1 for an amarr battleship pilot to be effective in pvp they need roughly 6mil sp for a minmatar pilot that number is closer to 20mil30mil sp2 we are the only race that is required to learn multiple weapon systems just to equal other races3 actual combat tests factoring falloff range and hit quality indicates that our fighting style gets 385 of calculated dps this is a tactic that minmatar are supposed to accel in but when our base dps is less than everyone elses and everyones range either equals ours or is better than ours thats just bunk4 current gaming mechanics put passive tanks as more effective in combat than active tanks even by ccps account active shield tanking another supposed minmatar advantage is the least efficent tanking type
this is still the worst idea in all of eveit is nothing more than a wet dream for all griefers and fleets of less than sizable forceessentially you are asking ccp to in fact buff raiding partieseverybody who suggests this has little to no interest in the overall aspect of the game and is just concerned with their own killboardyoud essentially kill 00 mining or industrynobody could even undock without having some one on the outside to check to see if the coast was clearyou think gate camping for a gank is boring imagine having to camp a gate only to keep a head countvent would be filled with pilots asking who was in systemno thank you this is truly the worst kind of whinning in the world of eve at least carebears dont know any better any one calling themselves a pvpers who support this is just a carebear who grew up and didnt leave their mommys couch or their teet sorry your hac gang got hot dropped and pewnd but get over it making local vanish in 00 would wreck the economy of eve as well as making living in 00 even more of a job and to do this just so you and your noob buddies can weekend warrior in 00 and smack how you got a goon killmail i fing thing notaxwwwflyrecklesscom
atraxerxes that kind of blind rage posting isnt going to help support your case 1 bithow about you calm down take minute to think about things seriously and then post some valid arguments im also curious to know what the carebear side of the population thinks about my scouting beacon idea  it is definitely a compromise for the defender side
lol
one of the only ideas ive ever read that actually nerf the blob and boost the smaller group of players love it
how about some sort of listing page listing players bannednegative walleted thats not a word i realise and the amount of isk confiscated from them to deter some of the idiots selling isk and maybe some corporations from recruiting isk sellers i mean they violate the eula they may as well get shamed a little for it read as laughed at for itjust a thought
did you even read the eulabecause if you had youd be the top of the list for making such a ridiculous idea
no
i have no problem with such a pagei dont see why anyone other than those who committed those crimes would be against it the isk sellers declared war on eve online community and the best ccp and you people can do is pretend theres nothing wrong just dont click just ignore them  thats not going to make them go awaywe need to go on the offensive or we will never rid of this problem and it will keep getting worse as long as you keep ignoring it
ok obviously my first response was too brief let me expandspecifically the part of this that is loaded with failsauce is the idea that it will in any way deter the isk sellers do you honestly believe they care if your account gets emptied of cash and you get banned for purchasing said iskposting the names of the isk sellers will be next to useless since theyre not really concerned about that particular account in most cases  its going to get recycled anyway  hell they can do what they do without ever training a single skill so its not like theres a huge investment in time thereposting the names of the isk buyers is also pretty much useless because aside from laughing at them for being morons no one cares human nature is one of those things that really doesnt change much people that want to skirt the rules will try regardless of the supposed consequencesill offer you a perfect real life corollary in some cities in the united states they post the names and pictures of people caught soliciting prostitutes in an attempt to do exactly what youre trying to do here guess what people still solicit prostitutes in those cities why because of the im too smart to get caught syndrome if you think a webpage is going alter that fundamental aspect of human nature  well then frankly youre an idiot
did you
well in regards to the isk sellers names being posted i was more interested in the amount of isk that was removed from their account when it was done offering more visibility of how nany isk sellers were being banned a dayweekmonth rather than taking it on good faith that ccp are doing anythingyes i realise isk sellers wont give a  about their name coming up on some webpage
supportedif someone was cheating why to hide it is not like his real name is publishedand eula can be modified many mmos have public banlist and they use it to warn people so its a prevention mechanism
im opposed to this idea for a few reasons for one a public false positive is a lot more pernicious than a private false positive  if a prominent player got hit for a legitimate transaction by an overzealous gm it could be an utter fiasco doubly so if theyre in a trustbased industry like a lot of the md folks are and yes false positives do happen for two i dont expect it to be effective at all as devel said most people think they wont get caughtor else theyd avoid doing it in the first place given the consequences of getting caught and its not like its going to discourage the sellers and for three i dont trust ccp to keep the list updated well enough for it to work even if it would otherwise theyre too busy to bother with this sort of junk on top of that most people caught soliciting prostitutes dont consider doing so to be wrong in the first place and neither do most isk buyers nameandshame only works if the person is actually ashamed
yes tears would be awesome
please do it

how do these threads get started is it by people who hate fun logically this type of thread should be started by one of two people a mission runner who hates isk or someone who wants everything in game to be expensive due to reduced mineral and meta mods coming in from missions either way i can only assume the op hates his isk and am suggesting he donate it to me
your missing the most obvious option a macro miner who wants a bigger pay day almost everyone in eve either runs missions or pvps the vast majority of accounts that dont participate in these actions are alts of people that do and then your left with a minuscule portion of the population that dont pew pew in some form because of how boring the other options areif your just have to set in your hulk and mine because maybe the rhythmic pulsing of your lasers reminds you of being in the womb or something then thats your choice if your not making enough money its because you havent diversified the way mission runners have done while your setting there watching the universe age maybe you should be getting research points from an rd agent copying and researching bps manufacturing goods and trading considering how long it takes to max out a hulk compared to maxing out a marauder you have plenty of time to venture into these fields that a mission runner wont have before they reach optimal performance and can branch into themmission runners make the crazy isk by branching nothing is stopping you except effort which by the number of supports for this topic both here and historically is accurately reflected
the ranges could be reduced a bit but i dont see why these havent been in game for a long time now
some days it just doesnt feel worth it to gnaw through the leather strapsi could explain at length why what you said is just as stupid as your first statement but i wont bother you wouldnt listen to me anyway
would train rorq for my alt to loot battlefields
this not supported
im against this purely for the reason that it will make the life of loot thieves too easy
dunno if this has been suggested or not but here goescurrently the only way to expand the lp store window is via the lower right corner can we change it to work for all sides and corners thx a bunch
frankly im more concerned with how to screen out all those bloody hardwires but hey why not fix this
i imagine this has been suggested a few times i cant find it so i apologize if i step on anyone elses previous ideaheres my thoughts there are three neutral corps inside eve not counting concord they are the sisters of eve interbus and the society of conscious thought since really the industrial folks dont have any faction ships i propose that each of these corporations have a faction cruiser class or thereabouts available for those who run missions for them nothing overpowering but still something useful for what they plansociety of conscience thought  i figure a research cruiser would be a great thing for those who prefer to do astrometrics and archeology it would have only two high slots one being a launcherturret and or a small drone bay max 50m3 it would get bonuses for probing and strength and have a battlecruiser class tankinterbus  faction industrial ship for carrying goods not sure if it should be double the capacity of say a mammoth or similar or if it should just have a large capacity and tiny signature it should also give you a minor positive boost to faction stating for all not sure if there is anyway to do that in the system but i think that would be kinda cool for moving stuff around between various faction spacesisters of eve  in line with their mission for assisting the downtrodden sisters should get faction logistics cruiser again this ship would be well tanked battle cruiser equivlent but have few hislots i figure this ship would have two maybe three at most with only one being a turretmissile launcher and a small drone bay bonuses would be for either remote rep range or reduction in cap usei think this would be some nice additions to the game though i guess that would mean that interbus and society of conscience thought would have to give missions in the first place
no just no indys can already get over 30k m3 cov ops can scan down a 1010 in 2 minutes logistics are strong enough as is
what i would like and this is just a basic idea is a checklist in the options screen for all the ranges you want to orbit atcould look something like this  500m 1mk 15km 2km 25km 5km 75km 10km 125km or whatever whatever whatever list can be huge or not all that big simply checkmark the ones you want on your right click menu and its therethat way you can have all the orbit at ranges you want available without all the extra ones you never use this would also allow them to have more options available for us like i would kill for a option to set a orbit at 12km in my crusader
select the ship or item youd like to orbit in your overview in the selected item box rightclick orbit and click set default orbit distance and type in what range youd like to orbit at the same thing works for keep at rangehowever i like your idea too we should be able to save preset orbit distances so in the heat of battle it isnt necessary to go through all those steps to setup an orbit supported
how about a happy medium we allow cloaks to stay cloaked but they pop up on the dscan and are probable within current game mechanicsthis does allow people to be afk cloakyish and also will not make them easy to find however the whole im here but not really thing will be a little sketchy as there is always the possibility to be found as always eve should not be entirely safe but afk cloakers seem to defy that basic ruleas an outside party who doesnt care so much one way or another here is an idea i had no one is forcing me to post this nor do i have any monetary gain or loss at stake this has not been funded by any political or fornonprofit organization dont yell at me
nothing is broken nothing needs to be fixed no support
the whole point of cloaking is to be hiddenbeing detected on the dscan is contradictory of that fact
there is no issue with afk cloaking peopleso nothing here to support lets move to the next topic
afk cloakers are also incapable of doing anythingbut be afkand sit there cloaked i dont really see an issue
actualy afk cloaking doesnt work as in old timesif someone is afk cloaked he gets disconnected after some period of time but client doesnt refresh itself so either its a bug or intentional to prevent people from loitering on 7 accounts when other people try to login and play normalyso actualy afk cloaker needs to check his account from time to time and he needs to pay for it either with plex card or money so he pays extra money only ot access extra local chat its very efficient isk sinkthe ammount of investmnets to keep that account livecover losses is bigger then the cloaker can do dmg the cloaker would need ot blow each day full combat fleet ot cover the expenses which doesnt work thats why people who afk cloak do it for their alliance as service couse they are in loss
i feel i have to point out that afk cloaking is very seriously broken due to the current 100 infaliability of cloaking devices however im not sure if this is the right solution or even if there is a right solution its a thorny issue however i do take issue with people simply denying it exists
this is a dumb solution to a nonexistent problem
true true true
stop posting ideasyours are all bad
allow damaged products to be inserted into a contract but if they do in fact have damage list it in the area where bluprint copy information is listed this allows the contract viewer to see if there is damage and thus allow them to make their decision on accepting or not
whyi mean not to be dense but why would you want to contract damaged goods and not just fix them before you contract it
because i am 84 systems away and do not feel like traveling that far to repair 75mm railgun ii before contracting it to someone
no too much scam potential
unless the contract clearly and i mean stupidly obvious contained text stating that a specific object was damaged and how much it was damagedand then even before accepting the contract a nice dialog box should appear reminding the buyer they are purchasing damaged goods only after all that would i support contracts for damaged items hell id go so far as to include a possible nostandings empire npc station repair cost so that someone doesnt try to sell a battleship with 0 shield 0 armor and 1 hull remaining to someone
the typhoon claymore cyclone sleipnir vagabond all look awful in the new graphics imho vagabond especially it looks just rediculous from 2006 to 2008 it was almost an iconic looking ship it looked like a killer and it flew like one these days it is neitherthe vagabonds ears need to be brought back sleeker against the hull and their angles redone like the old classic clientthe typhoon needs its hollowed out part at the front from classic put back in this half a ship with a spike on the front looks dumb imhothe cyclone hull and its derivatives need its frontal fins heightened and made broader at the top like it was in old classic clientofc this will probably never happen but ive wanted to say this since the day they brought premium graphics in for the most part premium looks great but minmatar got so shafted
allow all repackageable items to be repackaged as opposed to stopping the repacking process at the first unpackageable item
whatwhat are you talking about
currently say you want to repackage a 10mn mwd a damaged magnetic field stabilizer and a small tractor beam if you were to select all or shift click the 3 mods to try repackaging them all at once the mwd will become repackaged but you will get an error notification that the mag stab is damaged and cannot be packaged this ends the repacking process before it gets to the small tractor beam which also does not get repackagedi am merely suggesting it not stop repackaging at the single damaged mod and continue the process on the next undamaged mod
then it might help if you said that in the first placedont be lazy when it comes to making proposalsyoull live longer
yeah this is silly fix it furthermore youll ensure drake lives longer since you wont be making his bloodpressure spike by writing a proposal he doesnt follow
supported this is both annoying and unnecessary
while i appreciate your support drake my origional post was fine if brief no need for the negativity or this stupid live longer stuff
and let me contract busted stuff too
it wouldnt be the end of the world if someone on eve forums didnt understand something that was blatantly obvious to everyone else
i would like to see the scan button moved 10 pixels away from the other scanning buttons long before thisso i would make it lowest priority on my list but support fixing all the little annoying quirks in eve
another nobrainer these are the types of things i wish ccp would devote 1 hour of programming to before spending all their time on new patches with even more silly bugs and things like this
basically a separate area from the main cargo bay where we can keep our mining crystals in mining barges say 450m3 for a couple sets of crystalsi know this isnt a big deal its merely an idea
id support this tbh makes so much sence its unrealonly on deadicated mining ships tho
the devs have already discussed doing something similar to this starting with fuel bays for covert ops ships
well eve is a team game i dont see why this needs to be done on the mining bargesexhumers orca got a nice corp hangar for them
i would like to see a separate bay for ammo on battleshipsoh and a really big one for cap boostersnooptimise and divide your cargo space to the best of your abilitiesuse t1 miners if you dont want to worry about crystalssome ships need to carry large stuff fuel and theyre cargo just isnt big enough with a bigger cargo the blackops would be superhaulers thats why they get a special fuel bay
this isnt even a serious proposal i mean come on a warning when you create your character to not play 1 of the 4 races in the game obvious troll is way too obvious or simply way too stupidit is pretty fair to say minmatar bs suck though but frankly what else is new fix large projectiles but that has nothing to do with this thread
reiterating what has been said time and time again it takes a ton of sp to fly the assortment of minny ships but they fill a gap no other race can in pvp versatility i dont hve to explain it all here but if you arent having a good time in s minny pvp ship you arent fitting it like it should be fitted
fixed it for you
dont forget the sleipnir its just a horrible waste of a command ship
no
he csm cant even they cant even do what they are supposed to properly and you want them to have mod powers
vukdunno what part of ex yu youre all from but i pay for 6 accs for me and my friends with a depit card and it was rejected only when there was no money on it to charge for the subscription never any problems at all for yearsim from croatia and pa
its a good support skill that helps almost all setups if not all setups out there that has nothing to due with the proposal though the problem is that tech ii webs have no benefit besides extra 10 web strengthno increased optimalno reduced cpuno reduced capno increased durationno reduced heat damagei get all of this for having to train level 4 of propulsion jamming when there is bore usefulness out of warp disruptor ii that only requires level 2 of propulsion jamming because it increases the range rather than the affect of the module unlike the webifier i dont understand how giving webs a bonus to optimal is that much of a bonus when they did it to warp disruptors the proposal to do the same requires a high level skill that topples over the disruptors training to get the best bonus on top of thateither counter the reason on why increased optimal is a bad thing or dont disagree at all arguments welcomed
minus the word unfortunately thisid have loved to be given all lvl 5 skills but alas i have to delegate my training time to suit my needs
no benefit besides the extra 10 web strengthwhat an absurd justification youve made an exception to a core principle of what is being discussed you could use the same justification to say the vaga is a poor hac because it has no advantage besides speed or that the falcon is underpowered because it gains no benefit except jam strengththe 20 increase in effect is an important and powerful part of the modulenot supported
if speed was a useless bonus for the vaga you must read before posting
also calling a troll on op
that was his point
i guess i can see the point there if the bonus was useful to most but i dont see much benefit in it only because of the experience in using it i dont mean to sound uptight about it just that the bonus doesnt seem as useful as i think it could be we have webbers with that much range in game and every web can reach at least 13km already
supported i think what the majority of the people who are disagreeing with the op fail to understand is that the concord equivalent of faction police in the other systems are incurring a concord level criminal flag instead of the regular yellow aggression flag commonly associated with being aggroed by faction navies
ive petitioned and got ships back from when this happened twice
in this sense concord systems should behave like any other 10 system
not supported if youre sec status is not up to par and you wanna test concord on their turf its your chance with the law despite the game mechanics however they need to beat you is how they need to do it weird mechanic or not you want a changed mechanic you should be instalocked and killed on the gatesseriously eve already begs its players to get low sec status we dont need more incentives that let people just waltz where they want with no repercussions keep your sec status up or stay away from concord
supported but i would prefer that there be no police or concord response at all unless the pilot is currently gcc and is in high security space imo an outlaw should be able to travel freely but would be fair game for any player that wishes to attack him
not supported in its current formthe system is bugged yes but you need to clarify exactly what you want to happen does concord respond the same as the faction police would in that case i definitely would not support this imo remove the gcc but continue to have concord warp scram  engage people faster than faction police just as they would irl that way you dont automatically get stuck in system and left out to dry but it certainly makes things a bit more challenging
wut you dont like space potatoes
this post is to bring to light a game mechanic that can be used as an exploit for what it was meant forhisec pos unable to shoot any player unless its a war targetwhile some may have many dissmissive posts because it has no effect what so ever toward them good for them the fact remains this can be used against its unintended purposereason why hisec pos cant shoot anyone but war targetto protect it from concord responseto protect noob players within a corp from aggressing it and getting blown upreason this is an issuethis leaves a smallmed and even large tower very vulnerable to infiltrating corp members with the intention of reinforceing the posincapacitating the defenses at no risk to themthere are of course many responses that others may have but it comes down to one thing the pos has no ability to defend itself due to it being blocked from doing so even when manually controlledthis ability is available in lownull sec and should also be available to it in hisecmy proposal is to remove the ability of any corp member to shoot their corp pos in hisec with no reprecussion this can be fixed 2 waysset corp members to the same mechanic the pos is set to not able to shoot hisec posset hisec pos to same mechanic it has in lownull sec the ability to shoot any corp member that aggresses itof course a warning message could appear for the second option should someone be noob enough to shoot their own corp posand proper settings need to be in place for reppingshield transfering of courseif the mechanic is changed to shoot members also has to be looked at that a member cannot leave a corp while in space of their own requesti know there are many possible responses to this and i assure you for every valid response there is a valid counter responsewhat it all boils down to no matter what your stance the fact remains its still a broken mechanicif the pos mechanic is set so it cant shoot corp members to protect them from being ganked should said corp member be ejected from the corp this is not a neccessary mechanic as you cant eject a corp member while they are in space
i supportendorse this proposal
you know that if you ask for something sensible then ccp will screw it up somehowi propose in stead something ridiculous in steadmultiple warning screens for badly place buttons hell make it for ever button and module on the ui should be 3 at least just to be sure1 are you sure you wish to do this action2 mistakes do happen are you absolutely sure you wish to do this action3 obviously by now you are 100 certain youve selected the correct button and ccp will not be held accountable for any negative result from proceeding which this action
yes please ive only misclicked a couple of times myself but come close to it many times moreben
i support but only if you have the afk party show up on a list indicating their shiptype how long they have been afk and their exact location they also must appear on overview and be a warpable object they cannot use this function in station and concord wont help themtldr mostly useless
yeah this the slider scale would have to be logarithmic though

i dont think you need two topics on the same subject locked

while i do support a change not sure if a separate docking timer is appropriatei would like to see any aggression including docking timers transfered to the rr this means if you want your rr to dock up you either stop rr your target or you get your target to stop aggressing so both of you can dockthis would allow say a few rr bs to all keep rr each other on a gate or station and use this as a tactic else you will require a logistics ship 50km off the battle to help every one to dock and encouraging the use of more altooc remote reps of course if you have someone silly in your gang and is still aggressed while everyone is rr them when they were supposed to deagress it could cause more losses it makes team work and communication a more critical part of the fight

i cant realy understand this the sheer number of fights ive been in and i have never had a neutral remote repper in the fleet with mbalm or even privs weve had rsbs but never nuet rrhmmmmmm
what youre supporting is a completely reasonable solution however its not what pitboss had in mind when he created this thread unless he did and hes just refusing to clarify because apparently im trolling
also having the popping sounds funny thing is even if i turn the master level to 0 in eve i still hear the poppsusing realtek ac97 onboard soundcardnot going to test it on my maudio soundcard since the bug seems to destroy soundcards s
yes support this

i agree with the philosophy behind this thread but having once worked in the mmo customer service field i am perhaps more pessimistic about possible changesi have a few devils advocate points that ive run into in the past which may be food for thoughtccp is going to resist doing anything that costs more money hiring more gms costs money training the gms better also costs money a gm will only work for x amount of hours a day and training time is not time spent workingthe people who are gms are usually people who make so little money that they couldnt afford to play the game they are gming for they are stuck to a desk and every aspect of their performance is monitored via the computer they are no doubt required to answer a quota number of petitions per day which their managers then use to determine if the amount of work they do is worth the amount they are being paid gms and other customer service people are caught in the middle the players beat on them for sucking and their management rides them like taskmasters it is truly a thankless jobwhen you first start as a gm you may have visions of being the beacon that the players have been looking for but you soon find out that your hands are tied to actually make any change that means anything and since your hands are tied anyway there are no qualms about the management and the players beating the idealism out of youyou become a cog in a machine you learn what your managers expect of you and you provide exactly that and not an inch more since your company likely prefers to run its current employees on 14 hour days instead of hiring more employees you get to be a cog for most of your life when you get home and collapse the very last thing you want to do is play the game that you work for youre lucky if you can muster up the willpower to even look at a computer screenits not just the management thats the problem you and i both know that eve is chock full of scammers who would like nothing more to pull a fast one on a gm the last thing a gm wants is to draw attention to himself by being scammed and the management likely has draconian limits on exactly what gms can and cant do in many situations for this simple reasonon top of that ill wager that there are a ton of gm petitions that are complete garbage and arent worth a gms time anyway in fact id wager that most petitions are something that the player could have solved themselves thats not to say that legitimate game problems happen its just that when it happens 2 out of every 500 petitions they are easy to gloss over seeing as how youre not much more than a zombie powered by caffiene at this pointthe bottom line here is that ccp doesnt give customer service a very high priority they dont give it a high priority because real working customer service is very very expensive for the company and the company doesnt make hardly any money from the gm department its a giant sink in their budget that doesnt give anything backlets face it everyone on this thread is irked enough to post something but few of them are actually willing to quit over it and so long as youre not quitting then what does it matter how your game experience is ccp still gets their moneydo you want ccp to give customer service more priority theyll have to pull it out of some other departments budget which department should get the cuts first what priority does customer service hold in the grand scheme of ccpif youre going to talk straight to ccp themselves it would be wise to have answers to these questions
im gonna call bull klaituheres why any company that wishes to make money is going to have to spend it the question is how much do you spend for how much gain in the case of the support staff i would venture that ccp could make more than they spend if they would un the supportthat means  better training  better oversight not micromanagement but consequences for blowing off valid petitions  more and more competent gms  a real commitment to excellence in customer supportas i note in our most recent podcast blatant plug i have spoken personally with many people who have heard about eve and the horror stories of the support like it or not ccp has dug their own hole on this one and their support is worse than other mmos of their caliber i have played quite a few and while clueless gms are pretty common the kind of stuff we see and have gotten so used to with eve would have made any number of lesser mmos auger in by nowfact is eve only survives its abysmal support and the frankly playerhostile perception that most people have of their gm team by dint of the fact that it is such a great game but that hole has a bottomccp would do far worse than to spend some time and money repairing their reputation closing valid petitions in 3 seconds is not a good way to do it
seriously ive had better customer service at walmart
as a proof that there is a bit of hope for gm dept is something like this awesome blog by gm grimmi
that is proof that they are willing to go after people messing up their profits not actually provide descent customer service
i agree with you im just saying that ccp would have to invest money in improving their gm support an investment which does not return very much profitfrom ccps perspective eve is a successful fastgrowing game improving their gm support will not make eve that much more successful and it wont cause eve to grow that much faster thats why its not high on their priority list nowi hope that the petitions and the csm are able to make some changes here i just think that its an uphill battle

this should easily be possible just a small fix supported b
another one of those easy ui tweaks
as a ship manufacturer i support the no insurance
lol as it certainly helps your customers to buy more ships if they have less money for it dont you think you cut your own meat here i suspect the only thing it would change is more people buying plex as they certainly dont want to carebear more or even feed rmt although their rates are higher than plex atmall the people who cant afford more plex will just sit in station until they can afford it again or scam the crap out of everyoneimho the current insurance payout is fine it balances the game out between people with indirect income moons industrial alts to some degree and people mainly playing for pvp
insurance sets an artificial base line for ship prices its removal would actually boost ship prices in the long run
i agree with orakkusif the advantages didnt outweigh the disadvantages then people wouldnt have been complaining about them more and more over the years since the alpha nerf to boot it has only gotten worse sense then
i made a thread on this topic a year ago but since it didnt get raised im bringing it up again current situation amarr combat drones are awful they do the lowest dps against any believable resistances and theyre nothing special in hp or speed proposed change give amarr dronesacolyteinfiltratorpraetor only  curator and templar are fine significantly more hp than any other races by increasing their hp by a factor of 46 benefits gives amarr drones some marginally useful roles  attacking an enemy with smartbombs surviving sleeper aggro longer and other similar circumstances where hp matters more than dps  without screwing up the current balance of drone types for most tasks drawbacks none
i normally dont question your findings hersch but you surebecause ive found them to be quite strong but then im not attacking sleepers eitherbut even then they could use a bit more hpsupported
yeah amarr drones need some love to make them a viable choice
the raw numbers simply arent there gallente drones have significantly more hp arent too much slower and do 39 more dps amarr drones work but every other races work much better
depend on targetso pvp or pvei have a good level of skills in drones and i find them useful but then i am not running a caldari ship that already can select hid damage changing missilesmaybe you should try it using some of the hybrid guns ships on the caldari lineup or gallente ships and you will see how you want to use those useless drones at least in pve pvp you go for the faster or those doing more damage as you stat with the hypothesis that you enemy has an omintank
but even when fighting npcs msot enemies weakest to em are also quite weak to thermal and the base damage boost offered by gallente drones totaly blows the minor resistance bonus out of the wateri agree with the ops changes making them the high hp drones would be good though 46x may be a tiddle too much around 3x would be plenty i thinkcaldari drones also need some loving they arent as bad but they still have very little niche at all except the sentries but all sentries are good
i definitely like the idea but a 46x increase is a bit too much 3x is reasonablenow what can we do to make caldari drones viable for pvp p
so theyll survive 2 more smartbomb cycles ok thats great
the are usable now about making them worthwhile to use well thats a different storyim not sure that i agree with your idea but the whole matter definetly does need some looking into
it doesnt matter what my weapons are doing damage shifting or no im going to pick the best drones and amarr drones are never best gallente are best against blood drones and sanshas caldari vs guristas and serpentis and minmatar against angels amarr dont come close to being best against any npc type  it varies by individual rat but even on the ones where amarr drones arent totally awfulblooddronesansha youre generally taking at least a 10 hit to dps if you try to use them if amarr were near the top then id probably say 3x theyre fairly low on hp asis  well below gallente as for caldari theyre mostly fine but they tend to be used as jackofalltrades drones so you can double their hp and call it even so youre hitting a carrier that has a large proton smartbomb ii and you have a choice of a standard ogre ii or a 4x hp praetor isince youre not crazy enough to train amarr drone spec 4 the ogre survives until the 12th smartbomb activationassuming drone durability 5 and does 2765 damage before skills in that period of time the praetor survives until the 27th smartbomb activation and does 3726 damage before skills if youre crazy and have the skills to use a praetor ii you get 33 cycles and 5465 damage before skills thats twice as much as the ogre ii and on a maxskill domi thats almost 56k damage of difference that enough for you
in the future please refer to amaar drones by their proper namesleeper baitsupported
just make the usefull for atleast 1 thing currently they arent worth it at allsupported b
on what are you basing that statementi use practical game evidence my acolytes kill sansha blood raiders and drones faster than my hobgoblins maybe eft say differently but that is my experience in game 30 less shield same armor for 20 more speed and you see it as balanced  they are faster so harder to hit with no aoe weapons start doing damage before the the ogre fasterget to the target faster and in your scenario survive longerbut yes you are balancing ogre ii with t1 praetorsorry you havent convinced me
i am a big time miner so you would say i would support thishowever i run missions as well lvl2 solo and lvl4 with corp buddies mostly as a salvager or taking on the smaller ships and i wouldnt like to lose the loot that is dropped and generates a nice side incomei have a hulk pretty much maxed out which makes me decent isk but it could be more the price of especially trit has dropped so much it is insaneit would be better to have ccp set a bottom price for specific goods like trit because if this continues soon we will be selling trit for under 2 isk a unit
thats sorta the point here sparkywith the macros gone though weve seen a huge mineral recovery in the market with many minerals approaching their 3 year averages againexcept zydrine which outta tell someone at ccp the drone regions need retooled
i want to make some points clear to all the nay sayers please just read this with an open mindif meta0 modules were removed from npc rat drop tables you would find several things happen most of them positivefirstly you will find that for the short term there is a shortage of lownull sec minerals this will drive mineral prices upthis is by and large a good thing with minerals costing more you will find less capitals less battleships more of the mixed smallerclasses in pvp if cost isnt an issue for the massive alliances then it will not affect them but truth be told if they dont get theirmeta0 modules from ratting then often they too will need to rely on miners this means that there will be more guard duties and activitiestanking place not just roaming gangs looking for kills but i stray from the point mixed hull sizes in pvp is a good thingnext you may not like this but the truth is missions give far too much reward for the time it takes bounties loot salvage lp and reward its out of balance with the rest of the game and even if its only by a fraction should be reduced removing meta0 will do that and boost another profession greater than the loss to the mission goerswith a deficit of lownull sec minerals and only mining and drones been the source you will find that more industrialists will be looking at mining in low sec if they go to low sec they will bring others in their corps protection and haulers mining ops will become common place in low sec and so because of that pirates will have more targets low sec will cease to be an empty wasteland and more alivea new avenue for buddying industrialists will emerge the tech1 meta0 module producers who currently would produce a miner i noone in their right mind would but to make a miner ii you need one if the meta0 modules are removed then to make a tech2 module you will need to make the tech1 or buy them from someone who makes them thats a very good thingso when you say no think for a second are you saying no through personal greed and selfishness or do you believe that no is the best way for the betterment of evei cant think of any valid reason beyond selfish greed that would reject this suggestion
how about you not look at eve with an orwellian point of view and realize that true balance in a game as complex as eve is impossible and following that logic one profession has to make more money than the otherswill it impact mineral supply yes will eve be better off now that only a select few players can afford a battleship much less anything else hell no about half the player base will unsub because of the grind you would have to endure just to build buy or kit a freaking bs if you want to know why minerals cost so little then figure out why hundreds of mining barges are sold per week in jita but there isnt a similar demand for exhumers despite it being only slightly more difficult to train intoloot and salvage are a part of eve not just missions to take full advantage of them you need to branch into sub professions and nothing is stopping you from doing that in miningi hate to burst your bubble but when times were better low sec was still a barren waste landso remove meta 0 loot from all drops not just missions this will  off lots of folks and significantly impact the income of beginning players as they wont get any loot just crap bountiesi am saying no because your wanting to significantly impact gameplay due to the popular style of play effecting another play style without considering how economy of scale impacts the situation this has been proposed a billion times and failed every time because your not looking at the big picturei run missions but i dont loot or salvage does that screw up your preconception
id rather have loot jsut drop damaged 020 hp and needing to be repaired station repair services should eat minerals instead of iskbut nontheless i support the general idea
waaaaaah dont nerf my isk faucetman the tears in these threads today frickin awesomeits amazing to see the turn out when ever certain things are threatened with proposed changes and oddly enough its almost always dealing with mission runners
fify
its a small annoyance but still an annoyance fix please
please and while were at it could it not reset to the top of the list every time you buy something sometimes i want to buy the same thing twice or more usually in fact since i mostly spend my lp on ammo and implants
the bandwagon  im on it
no let the topic die alreadyinventors actually have an advantage on bpo holders since they can effectively produce more by an exponential amount and also dump stock and switch into a different model at the drop of a hatremember a bpo holder can only produce off a single print at any given time a good invention account can literally produce hundreds more of the same item
especialy that bpo is 2x quicker per single slot and owner can invent also 
solution 1 change to a different marketsolution 2 stop making interceptors and make something elsesolution 3 accept that your interceptor sales may be slower than a bpo owner and adjust production accordinglyin eve as in the real business world you dont ask the market to change to meet your needs you change to meet the needs of the marketor you go out of businessedit i so fail at spelling some days
fail logic is failbpo holder has all advantages due to no need for invention datacores copies failure rate simply stick it on the line and press go
thisthread
as a t2 producer using both bpos and invention i argue that this entire complaint holds no water whatsoeverwith one of my bpos i can build at most 1127 units of a particular item a month using 1 manufacturing slotinventing that same module allows me to use the entire available manufacturing capacity of my local station with several accounts granted the waste is a little steep at 50 and it takes me twice as long to build each unit but at the end of the same month i can produce 15000 units of that item again using several charactersusing just 1 account i can produce 1127 with one build slot and 4300 with my other nine build slotsthe net return is that my invention far far outpaces my bpo production and returns me more profit over time than that bpo
if this was a real market there wouldnt be a finite amount of t2 bpos corporations would be inventing themi have no problem with t2 bpos existing i do however have an issue with the fact that there are no new t2 bpos been releasedbring back the t2 lotteriesif that isnt acceptable then increase the invented t2 bpcs material efficiency to a decent positive such as me25 also increase the maximum possible runs for the t2 bpcsif people want t2 bpos to stay then invention needs a hefty buff thats all there is to itbtw i will be quite honest anyone who disagrees with t2 producion bpos and bpcs needing a rebalance are not thinking of the betterment of eve but in their own selfish self interest for those people i care not what happens to you and your self interest you can be damned all i care
this is the same reason i hate political debate a lot of the time the assumption that people who disagree with you are not misguided dont have different priorities but are simply evil is one of the most poisonous aspects of political debate and it disgusts me how many people adhere to that simplistic a worldview do us all a favour  operate on the assumption that most people who disagree with you do so with noble intentions not all  jackasses exist  but most in this case i genuinely do feel that this change would utterly defeat the purpose of the inventionbpo split and genuinely would make the game worse t2 lotteries in the first place were a mistake but were stuck with them lets not screw it up further please
wtfdo you really fail at the search functionwe just had that topic like 2 weeks agonot supported in any formand yes i am heavily doing invention
t2 bpo at 10x  100x t1 bpo cost  freely available on the marketinvented t2 bpc inherit t1 bpc mepe div 10 or there aboutscurrent situation is lol rp breaking apart from anything elseim sure lai dai would give away there cerberus bpo for example and then never bother selling any for profit
then youre a fracking idiot no company is going to just give away anything that might earn them a profit  and if they think it gives them a competitive advantage they wont sell it either unless they think selling it offers them a larger advantagein your logical failspew above lai dai would not only have not given away a cerebus bpo they would routinely sue the crap out of anyone that even so much as tried to invent a new onedumbass
that would be one way to move more production to lownull secthat being said i really would like to see some path even if it is long and breaking even takes years to obtain new t2 bpos for me at least i would see it as something to work towards if not for the isk generated but for the fun of building up a good solid collection
man i love these threads the t2 bpo holders come out of the woodwork frothing at the mouth at the slightest mention of their precious bpos leaving the game
did you notice that even non bpo owner tell those people that their logic is flawedtry to sustain the supply for a decent sized alliance just from t2 bpos
seriouslyi am complaining that my rig bpo collection is almost worthless now and i have to buy and research and 2 more entire sets but heaven forbid you touch a t2 bpo
yes move to that 20 t2 items that make profit inventing and competition is high good luck
there are more ways do adapt and earn moneyafter reading the numbers from the qen i should wonder why we make so much isk with that see you on the battlefield err market d
ive never even seen a t2 bpo let alone owned one my primary income source is invention and im telling you that this is a terrible idea
are you really this stupid or are you just trolling us im going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume the latter
before whining at least inform yourself look the time needed to get a t2 bpo to me 25 ans the advantages of doing thatfor modules it modify only the asteroid minerals requirement and the same for the negative me so a negligible part of the costfor ships it is a bit more important but anything above me 510 is mostly a waste of time
why you dont cite the other data89 of all the hulks come from bpc75 of all the hac88 of cap rechargers ii92 of all the cov ops cloakeasy to argument using only a selected section for the datayou see my friend it work in the reverse it is not that inventors dont invent interceptors because the evil bpo owners push them away inventors avoid inventing interceptors because they can use their resources for better things like inventing hacsso bpo owner are those left to cover most of the demand as they cant change production remove the bpo and you will still have very few people inventing interceptors as the hac still pay more for the time and resources used edit spelling
soulution tree would be goodmake it so every one has a chance to get a t2bpo form invention000001 chance or so
just make it so 1 character per paid account that way you get rid of some of the clutter in jita nail some of the forum warriors alts and actually make it so that those ebil piwates that are so proud of their 10 status cannot hop on another toon and go shopping for new gear in hihgsecnow if you really want those 514 alts you can pay for that 514 accounts and not just 172
you do know you can only have 3 toons per account rightso you do realize that your little exaggeration makes you look just a wee bit foolish rightyou did think about this before you started down this road righti thought sonot supportedps im in favor of blocking alts from posting on the forums in many areas but removing them all together is not a good idea
ok whom of the 3 toons on my account is the main how do you decide which one i can use to postand for the opand in your next thread you will ask to allow only 1 account per playeranyone who wants to do decent stuff with alts will have them on extra accounts anyway so they dont loose training time so the only thing you would do is forcing pirates to use an alt on a different account for their haulingand for the jita scam people even pay accounts to post scam links for keyloggers and stuff on the forums which is illegal so you dont think they would get another paid account for scamming which is legal
i can do math apparently you cant grab a calculator punch in 5133
thats fine you want to pay an extra 15month to have a spammer alt or a scammer alt or a jita shopping alt or a cyno alt or a mining alt or a missioning alt etc etc etc
yes
there is no issue hereso no
this is an awful idea  the only reason i can think of for it would be to try to get more money out of the players which im obviously not a fan of you seem to be basing your whole argument on envying people who are using a mechanic as intended to do something that you can also do i really dont get it
i myself have few accounts but yeah why not this could be funny no more cyno alts
present a legitimate problem with the current system before asking for a change the only wouldbe viable argument you gave is that it causes more server lag because of spam alts in trade hubs but thats completely unfounded since you can only log on to one character per account at a time so no additional lag is created as for cynohauling alts whats wrong with that if you want to spend a month or so to get an alt into a decent hauler while diverting the training of your main so be it theres nothing broken here
1 indys can already get over 30k m3 sure but what about the other option or now with dust 514 coming out maybe something more specific to transporting troops i certainly dont want something that will step on the duties of t2 transports either2 yes cov ops can scan down a 1010 in 2 minutes but a cov ops cant tank any of the rats at various archelogy sites having a ship like that would reduce that need while not being especially useful in pvp combat3 yes current t2 logistic ships are strong enough but the t1 versions are anemic and too easily removed from the battlefield having a faction logisitc cruiser could bridge the gap without making it a pvp powerhouseive seen no other additional support so unless that changes im just going to drop this
id like orbit and range information stored per ship type
i would like to set the whole list and save it for every singe of my ships
this sounds like a great idea  easy and customizable
supported
thisbut more importantly moar ranges for keep at range3 whole ranges to select from doesnt cut it especally when the furthest you can select is 500m how is this useful

just for fun guys no need to cry about it p
supportedmaybe cap should be taken for the cloak modules when non cloaker ships are move in cloak
supportedneed to fix  afk cloakingmake it cry the 00 coward cloakers
nodamn nullsec carebears getting knickers in a twist 00 isnt meant to be safe cloakers are one of the few ways people can make life dangerous for you in your home systemsthey cry that the cloaker is always afkwhat they are really crying about is the threat of being ganked while ratting
cloaks are also one of the only modules that enable small corps to fly in deep 00 without begging for alliance permissionpet status we need to leave wiggle room for the little guys in this sandbox
so let me get this straight you agree eve should never be safe but you are adamantly against afk cloakers hving any natural enemyfor all intents and purposes this is basically macro fear mongering if you are in space you should have no way of being 100 safei dont mind not having this be the end all be all change but it seems like you are not holding everyone to the same standard
no issue let this poor topic die
the proper solution is to remove local chat as intelligence toolit would make afk cloakers completely irrelevant
this is a really interesting ideaas for people who say afk cloaking is fine and no counter is needed ive always been a proponent of actually playing the game im playing no i feel the same way about this as i do about amarr afk pos bashing its just std
this not supported
bring mines back in form of decloakers asp mine ii ftw
or not whats so horrible about people being cloaked
just not needed no support here
im sorry but this just doesnt make sense dont get me wrong i think that there should be some way to keep people from cloaking and going afk but this isnt it if youre cloaked and afk presumably youre not moving and wouldnt be affected by your lattices if youre cloaked and at your keyboard you should be safe
supported and item should be noted as damaged in the contract
yup contracts should tell allif its clearly indicated in the fine print scam away not that youll get my isksupported
thats a fair reasonas long as the contract is crystal clear id support this
supported if contacts do clearly state the damage as mentioned by the ophate not being able to contract fitted amarr ships crystal damage or not being able to contract over a ship because i overloaded a module and forgot to repair it straight away
not supportedeven with damage information displayed it would just be another annoying thing to check with each contract to make sure some isnt trying to scam someone else i do realize there may be the notion if someone doesnt check and gets screwed over it is their own fault however i am not in favor of adding changes which increases such odds for buyers considering a change like this would only benefit a small percentage of individuals who have damaged goodsrepair an item if it can be repaired if not then dont look to contracts or the market for exchange
fully supported and needed feature crystals and drones are the biggest problemscontraband should be also included in this as it has the very same problem ever got a boostertags in cargohold of a ship you want to contract over afaik you cant even contract contraband in 00 where theres no concord behind your backi dont see the problem with scamming as most of the time youll be able to repair the stuff either at station costs some or by remote repairs in space free most of the time its more important to get the stuff handed over than worrying about repairs
yeah the status quo on this is stupid list the damage but allow it
id like to offer you a 4000 dollar deal please sign hereoh whats that your suspicious you want to read the paperworkgee golly whiz you just used something called common sense drat foiled againall it takes is a few seconds to find out if your being scammed or notlaziness is not an excuse or an argumentscamming is a perfectly legitimate yet hated industry if you can call it that in this gamewhile i dont condone it i honestly cant find a reason to shut it down either except to point and laugh at the victims when they miss something so obvious
you are not familiar with the plight of amarrian gun users or t2 miners this is a pain and if you cant read you should be spending less time playing eve and more time learning your language
a better solution to the problem
yes for the love of all things holyi hate forgetting to unloaded the crystals before contracting a hulk
well the scammer doesnt get anything from you buying stuff thats deliberatly damaged he gets the same isk that he would have got if it was in perfect condition so other than a few griefers using it i doubt it would become a major problemthe contract system needs a good ui overhaul anyway and its really frustrating trying to sell factiont2 crystals damaged ships ships with damaged drones inside etc so yeah as long as the damage on each item in the contract is visible and maybe a nag window it would be greatsupported
as long as the contract states that it is damaged dont wanna buy a capital ship at 1 structure b would be a dreadful scamsupported b
this its kinda like the cops cop a is having a bad mood and your 11 over the limit lands you a ticket cop b is having a good day and he over looks your 13 over the limitgm a is tired at the end of his shift the logs show nothinggm b is back after a weekend of partying and strippers hey man well look into that problem and get your ship back to you
i could give a  about what he did over the weekendwhat the cop should do is ask themselves was he speeding or notand for those of you who get pulled over for speeding and and think its not fair ask yourself where you speeding or not
i know there have been many suggestions and outcries about afk cloakers i have not agreed with many of them as they are either to complex to implement and force the cloaker to work against a system like having to hit random keys to stay cloaked or too simple such as them showing up on dscan and normal probing them downa cloaked ship should have some sort of player driven counter something which another player can work against the cloak itself i also believe the only totally safe place should be offline or in a station otherwise the players should have to be aware of the game and react do dangersto this i would like to see a battleship sized high slot module which could be used to deactivate any cloaked player in the system as if something had passed within 2500 meters the module should have a long activation time of like 5 minutes with the drawback of being unable to move dock or cloak similar to cyno gens additionally only after the 5 minute cycle has completed would a single pulse be sent out to deactivate all cloaks in a system as of the ship has come in close proximity of another object it would be an instant effect the cloaker could just reactive their cloak and remain hiddenthis would allow for a tiny chance during the decloak and recloak activation time for someone to be seen or targeted at the same time because of the long duration until activation it would require planning to use and could be easily seen comingas for those who choose to cloak and go away from their keyboards for long durations they would be put on the same field as all of the other pilots where there is always a danger to be in space and not pay attentionin all i think this would allow for cloaked intel gathering with almost no risk however for the tenacious players it would give them the possibility of running out a permanently cloaked foe
cloaking devices deactivate automatically if your within 2500 meters of any objects including the infamous beacon bugthere is a cool down period of   i dont know because i only use covert ops it changed since apoc feel free to fill in the blank cloak buffsif you cant target the ship in that time period you got serious issuesblockade runners have a 5 second cool down afaik this applies to others as well who use cov opsnot supportedlearn to play the game before you come up with suggestionsnot this epic fail tripe you wrote up
my apologies for having mistyped the deactivation distance i wasnt aware such a typographical mistake constituted as not knowing how to play it has been corrected and i also clarified the sentence as it seems it might have confused some players this is meant to have a solar system wide effect not close range
im not to shure but last time i took my trusted helios out on a flight 1 week ago i could cloak up withing 2500m but outside 2000 meters not to shure how this allpies to normal not covert ops cloaks thoughon topic naytheres no real reason to decloak other players unless theyre at a gate and with current eve economics its imo easier to just dd the hell out of a gate to see how many kills you have
another try to solve a non existing problem
to be honest this is the best idea of nerf cloak whine to date but cloaks still dont need to be nerfed
the problem with this is when you are scanning out stuff while cloaked youre not going to be paying too much attention to your cloak if the pulse deactivates it it might take a while for the scanner to realise this also if someone is scouting hes all of a sudden going to get noticed even though his cloak will be deactivated for only a short while that is if i understand what youre saying correctlynot supported
again nothing is broken nothing needs to be fixed no support
i like the idea the best nerf cloaks idea ive seenhow about that module from op can only be fitted to blackops that would make sensethose ships need a bit of love as i see thingsit would make those modules rare and expensive to carry around so most of the nonbroken cloaking mechanic would stay as is but there would still be something you can do about cloakersno support until my blackops addendum to the idea is proposed
supportedmaybe cap should be taken for the cloak modules when ships are move in cloak
i would support a fuel requirement for cloaking be it cap or something else but not thisthere is nothing in game that currently affects an entire system at one time  not even a ddd does that to my knowledge  drake will correct me if im wrong im sure
the only thing that affects systems on a major scale is a cynosuarial field being broadcasted if you wana call it thatas for the ops snide statement nice ninja edit that was not a typo that is a feeble attempt to fix something yet again for the billionth time that will never come to passstop fixing something that is meant to work the way it was intended
nerf local that will fix the cloaking problemmake all local like wh local
unfortunately the macros would immediately be coded to counter this the macro would merely look for the activation state of the cloak and reenable it when it gets pulsedthe only possible counters are few that will not break the ability entirelya  limited classes of ships that can fit a cloak of any sortthis is the most logical and most easily coded but would cause far too much uproar from well everyoneb  cloaks only reduce sig rad they dont make you invisible except to overviewie noncovert ops cloaks only reduce your signature radius substantially by 8599 depending on metatech but you can still be scanned out this will put a massive crimp in macroratters more than anything else your afk annoyancespy is in a covops ship frig recon or strat and those would be totally undetectable stillblackops would have to be recoded to be likewise invisible while fitting a noncovert ops cloak after all no one wants these things to be able to warp while cloaked nooo no they dont
hm arent you wondering why there are so many trying to fix it if there is really not a problem and proposal not supported i think it is a horrible idea there are lots of better ideas for the cloaking problem
yes they want to carebear risk free in 00
arent you wondering why there are more threads on this topic than there is support for any of the threads vocal minority is still the minority
i too have a long term solution for solving the afk cloaker problemremove local youll have no idea hes even there will you
this is just willfully obtuse 001 is done because any other choice of a bump is just worse it loses me more money and it takes longer since i have to change the middle digits not just the last couple ive never seen an argument against it that didnt just devolve into baseless tears i dont 001 to hurt other people i do it to get back on top of the market who cares about everyone else as long as they get in line behind me they can do whatever they want
not supportedi dont want to sort through dozens of low volume faction deadspace and officer items jsut to find what i want some market categories are cluttered enough as is just imagine searching through a list of around 50 shield hardeners
redonethey were never finished
yep they are fine they just need touchup if such a thing is possible with minmatar hides duct tapethere are numerous broken shells on the ships places where the ship has a hole grapicaly speaking that shouldnt be theretake gander at the tail end of the maelstrom right side then the left side youll see a graphical defect there
perfectionist much
hey the maelstrom is a thing of beauty and to see an hole in its uhmerrits a bit distracting
was more so talking to the op

current situation players are limited in which actions they can take on items located in a station they are not currently in  trashing contracting repackaging and nothing else proposed changes allow any action that can normally be taken instation to be taken remotely so long as it doesnt involve moving items specifically mergesplit stacks repair reprocess moving items between different corp hangars or into and out of containerscargo holds and possibly insurance benefits better remote asset management you wont have to go 80 jumps to repair an item for contracting you wont have to fly 20 jumps to split a stack of 50 rigs so that you can sell 3 to a buddy and you wont have to fly around reprocessing items you bought cheap on widerange buy orders drawbacks possible issues with database load for remote container use for other remote actions none i can think of
supported emphatically
supported 
1a better solution to the i cant contract stuff with damage
yes pleasethis should be rolled into a fix pack for the absolutely horrible assets window that includes being able to open a freaking container and see whats inside it
yeah the container fix is probably the next one im going to propose
there is a work around for the containers you can just try to contract them and it will give you a warning about non empty containers which will tell you everything that is inside its still annoying and needs fixed though
just dont cross into the realm of one click regional sell orders and the ability to remotely move items from personal hangers to corp or other persons hangers and i am all for it
change the damage control from active to passivepros ham sammiches would be easier to makecons ghandi would be out of buisiness
just remember to turn it on next time cheesecake
you know sometimes stupid is funnyunfortunately this is not one of those times
and dont forget the fruit toppings
thanks for the free bumps flamers no seriously didnt ccp say that when the damage control was introduced they wanted it to be passive but for some reason due to bugs or something they had to make it activecant they fix that now
this would be useful as your op it probably would have limited the flaming
locked spamspam sandvich  ham sandvich
supported would be even nicer to build a repair step into the process if necessary and the station supports it
supportedalso this is similar to moving items to a cargo container that arent allowed stop at that item instead of just leaving them and moving the rest and letting the user know this while even a smaller nuisance than repackaging would be nice to have fixed
incredibly annoying

as the title explains i request the ability for two or more alliances to form a coalition which will allow for more advanced politics and territory battles i believe this will make the eve universe an even more diverse and complex world but also allowing it easier for alliances to work together to accomplish goals as the blue setting system is far from perfect in addition to coalitions i believe allowing pvp pilots to recover implants from the corpses of their fallen victims as killing a ship is one thing but also getting the pod is another and such achievements should be rewarded  skitt
first off youll do better if you put unrelated ideas in separate threads as for your ideas cant say im a fan alliances exist game mechanically mostly to hold sovereignty why would coalitions exist its not like youd have coalition wallets coalition sovereignty or anything else of that nature this is the role of the standings system not a new mechanic re implants from corpses  why would computer chips come from dead bodies im not a huge fan of the game mechanics around itlp stores need to produce valuable things in quantity in order to avoid turning into a joke implants are as good as any but it doesnt even make rp sense that i can see
agreed with hersch you have 2 completely different proposals that are unrelated they need to be in separate threads1 coalitions already exist eve is not the only form of communication they dont need to be formalized in all honesty the standings system needs to be overhauled no more than that as far as that subject is concerned2 implant recovery no there was an idea some time back about harvesting bodies for biomasswell they have to get that crap from somewhere i guess notnot supported on both counts
nah whole point of fuel bays is to make ships able to do what they need to without being superhaulers barges are supposed to be good haulers and have cargo space to match i like the proposed changes to crystals in other threads to make them less of a pain to use but they dont need their own storage space
no i dont want unused space to be taken up by the possibility if not bringing a set of crystals
you know you could make the whole insurance thing easier and fairer if you just allowed people to set a value and then charge a premium based on the requested amount modified by sec status and number of ships lost in say last month or somethingso i can insure my ibis with a cargo of a covert ops cloak for 250000000 isk if i want to but it will cost me xyz isk per month until i cancel it or get blown upship losses will result in a x increase in premiums which stay in place for say a month after the last lossinsurance only pays out if there was a kill right assigned so no concord payoutsthe only issue i cant solve is the cheating opportunity of getting a mate to blow up your 1 billion issued ibisany ideas cj
i want to salvage implants from corpses and have the ability for alliances to make offical coalitions another step up from alliance do it
1 why 2 why 3 no 4 this is not the forum you are looking for
1 fair enough2 ahahahhwhat so an even larger group of players can claim and even more disproportional part of the game map and effectively block more of the rest of us from your spacei say remove the alliance feature all together and ban any players that claim to control more than one constallationthat should allow some of the rest of us to actually see the other 50 of the gamecj
1 thatd be fun2 ack coalitions ftw make alliances and corps able to join a coaltion and add the means to share standings and configure pos to not aggress coalition members3  4 huh
lots of new effects on other things still no news on this
i feel that it would be good to start a discussion about this in an area where it might actually make a difference since ccp has given the community a voice through the council i would like to say to the council that i am strongly against console exclusivity for dustit is important to note i do play console games i own both a ps3 and xbox 360 yet given the option i would always choose to play an fps on the pc over any console a mouse an keyboard is simply better suited to that style of gameplay than a controllerk what we have been asked by our readers is why only make the game available for console and not for pcccp shooter on a console are different as shooters on the pc we want to concentrate on developing a good console shooterthey say that the issue is the need to focus on creating a good console experience to counter this i point to call of duty 4 this game is available for both the pc and consoles and functions superbly on both i own the game for pc but some time ago had access to it strictly for xbox 360 it certainly played great and i put my time in but still given the choice i vastly prefer the game on my computerbeyond this excluding dust players from alliance chat via ventrilo and teamspeak is a definite detrimentof course no reason to exclude console gamers i know a lot of people prefer that medium so let them play expanding the player base is not a bad thing restricting it isi hope this thread can be used to discuss the issue and maybe hopefully get my way
i agree i would love to play this game but am completely unwilling to buy a console for only one game i dont need to know about console games i dont like most of them so there is no point to argue that consoles have good games as im not saying that they dont
agreed console exclusivity for this type of game that has such a big impact on our gaming experience shouldnt be left just to the consolesin fact i believe the reserve should be said imho the game should be a pc exclusive so that we pc gamers have control over our own fate in eve instead of having to worry about a lot of little kids playing the gamenot saying that all console players are little kids but a lot of them are eliteists so why should a console eliteist help a pc gamer
consoleonly is pure bull and a stab in the back to the loyal pc gamers who have made eve so great the lack of a keyboard and mouse sucks the need to buy an expensive console just for one game sucks and the inevitable death of the game once the next console comes out sucks either release a pc version and a good pc version not just a lowquality port or scrap the entire projectand if you absolutely must ignore the wishes of your customers and make it consoleonly do not make it have any influence on the main eve game the only thing more bull than a game we arent able to play is a game we arent able to play that can take away everything weve worked for in eve
ive never used a ps3 or xbox 360 but dont they have usb ports and cant they support keyboards and mice im fully in favour of them supporting that input scheme in dust because a controller is the mouses ed nephew for fps work but as long as they do the choice of systems to be played on is sort of secondary to me id prefer not to have to buy a console to play it but from a point of view of game design im cool with them doing whatever as long as the players can use miceedit i also dont understand the hate for console players being allowed to play alongside us did you rip on ccp for letting the tofueaters play with us when they released a mac client or the agoraphobes play on linux and dont give me the we cant play it nonsense  i cant play a 100man fleet hell i cant even fly a punisher does that mean that amarr is evil and should be removed from the game does that mean that gang sizes should be limited to what one person can multibox you build your alliances out of corps now go build them out of corps and guilds you cant play it find someone who can and get them on board
you would need a mouse and keyboard that require no drivers what so ever for them to function on either system there is a controller for the ps3 called the fragfx that kind of mimics a keyboard and mouse but its compatibility and usability are really low according to a few users ive talked to about it
the chance of them adding mouse support on a console is slim to none if metal gear solid 4 didnt have the clout as a company to make it happen something they claimed the game would have from the start i seriously doubt ccp willi honestly believe there is something going on with console developers that dictates that consoles can not use mouse and keyboard call me crazy but why else would it not have happened yet
agreedalso shameless plug
supported not much more to say really i think a pc version would be great
signedi really think soe dropped the ball on this one
i dont agree with this because i want to be able to convince my wife into letting me buy a ps3 for christmas however i do agree a keyboard and mouse is superior in fps games so if ccp can implement those into dust that would be greatly appreciated fyi drivers for keyboards and mouses are pretty much standardised anyways so an implementation of such a thing may not be that difficult especially when we are talking about usb devices and fyi what call of duty 4 does and what ccp does are two different things if call of duty 4 decides to jump off a cliff do you think ccp will
i must say im extremely dissappointed about this console exclusive releaseim all for consoles having their own exclusive titles but not when they are based on a pc titlewith the development process being the way it is i dont understand why pc cant at the very least cannot receive a direct portnot happy at all
simply stating that creating a game that plays well on both platforms is both doable and has been done
perhaps ccp is worried that people will play an eve client and a dust client at the same time on their computer thus allowing one person to provide fleet support and to be a ground troop at the same time not that im saying they couldnt just have their tv near by and do the same thing why are we talking about this instead of real questions like can mercs just travel from planet to planet and conquer them on their own or do they have to travel in the same eve universe via transport ships and escape through gate camps just to get to a planet that is what im most worried about if they have to get through a fleet first before they get to a planet in order to take it over also these planets under control of alliances will they be required to have troops on the planets to guard them at all times
ccp knows people like to dual box so i dont that is a very big issue and for the movement of troops seeing how they where talking about being casual id think it safe to assume that it would like a jump clone instateleport thing maybe the corp or alliance just produces empty clones and the players queue up to into them etc etc teleport
im sure ccp are aware that they are excluding large numbers of people from buying the game with console requirementthey gotta have some really clever reason for it did ccp share it with us in any interview im sure its one of the first things any interviewer would ask
k what we have been asked by our readers is why only make the game available for console and not for pcccp shooter on a console are different as shooters on the pc we want to concentrate on developing a good console shooter
well you see that would be bullcrap i think they should have to escape fleets and physically transport the troops from planet to planet in order for this to be a more fair system although i really have no room to talk because i know nothing on how the mechanics will really work in dust and how they actually transport personnel from planet to planet will work
im also worried about whether if you have an eve account allready will you beable to play dust for free or will you need to buy a totally new account also if so would they provide a discount for those that do have eve accounts
supported make sure you tick the little box that say you support this topic my guess is the csm and ccp use the supports column to sort what gets discussed and what is just people whining about nothing
i would appreciate the thread not be derailed if youd like to speculate the general forums would be a better mediumthis thread is for discussion on a specific tangible issuethanks guys
ahhh was wondering when this would show up in assembly hallpc vs console tears taste just as good as the restplease stop speculating on something with so little information
its nothing like that theyre just trying to tap into a new market cool idea if they can pull it off
ccp could get more profit as most eve players would buy it on pc
perhaps a ploy then with sony and microsoft to bring in sales for christmas time maybe farfetched dont see much a reason other than to stint the existing players of eve to run multiple accounts at the same time perhaps they are gearing for the possibility of the next generation of consoles and to bridge eve to those consoles eventually and then getting rid of supporting them on computers
1 dust2 3 profit
so now you need a console to play eve as both games are related and have mutual influence in the game world just fck off sony and ms ccp sellout lolalso console games have a life span of  how long think about how well that will mix with a persistent world like eveoterrible idea ccp fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
that was me speculating not factual also i honestly think consoles can handle the graphics of eve online anyways plus the fact they have the storage to run it all you need is a keyboard and a mouse so why not on a console
im going to have to disagree consoles offer several things over pcs1 a stable platform that never changes  if ccp releases dust 514 only for the 360 for example then ccp only needs to test their product on one platform  the 360 if they were to release a pc version they would have to test on hundreds if not thousands of combinations of hardware2 consoles offer a more secure platform to operate on than pcs ccp has realised that the pc is an insecure platform to put it simply they can not control the code that runs on your computer if you want to run aimbotshackingcheating programs there is little they can do to stop you without resorting to draconian drm which has limited effectiveness and causes stability issues true  consoles can be modded however this is harder to do and costs money as compared to downloading a cheat program for free off the internet and installing itaside from these two things if ccp releases both a pc and a console version the pc player will have a definite advantage over the console player as the pc players has precise aiming and control with the use of the keyboard and mouse the game will become fun for pc players and not fun for console players unless you segregate the twoon top of this unless ccp already has a pc version planned it will be excessively time consuming to port from the 360ps3 to pc due to fundamental differences of hardware architecture not just the fact that the 360 uses the ppc instruction set while pcs use either x86 or amd64all in all porting dust 514 to pc would be too expensive unless ccp has been planning to from the get gonot signed
and yet somehow countless companies ccp included manage to make pc games that work just fineand somehow ccp manages to keep eve running relatively hackfreetoo bad sucks to be a console player huhand this is why it will suck on a console as you admit the mouse and keyboard is infinitely superior to a controller in fps gamesthen if its so difficult they need to scrap the project and use the art assets to produce a proper pc fps
ccp did just send out a report on banning macro accounts macro accounts are run on computers which can run multiple accounts this could be ccps answer to nerfing multiple accounts this also would serve as a way to get rid of someone logging in an alt and leaving that alt to spy in a system all day long cloaked up so you know we can say get rid of the speculation here but instead of throwing a sht fit about this not being on the pc lets think about this
any more time consuming than porting between 360 and ps3 most certainly noti also know quite a few console gamers who will say that pc has no advantage i dont agree with them but well they seem confident enough
this should not only be on the pc it should be part of the eve subscription and part of the eve pc client
pc version pleasejust give the console peeps an exclusive weapon or something
in the documentary title unholy rage ccp states this the war against the rmt element continues we strive towards driving their operating costs to unsustainable levels our objective is to get rid of them plain and simple they are a heinous nuisance and a serious drawback on our systems and resources credit card fraud and account hacking is their game  the recent hacking troubles have been the work of the isk sellers they must be driven out and kept outface it eve online is going to make a push for consoles part of the reasoning is to make it too expensive for rmts to operate requiring multiple consoles to run multiple accounts would make such a thing too expensive to do i applaud ccp for this at least they are warning us now so that we can get our own shiny little console before christmas time when demand is high  here is the link to that document btw
the premise of dust 514 overall is fantastic and innovativeconsole exclusivity however is a terrible idea
just say no toinfecting ccp with more microsoft idealstaking options away from playersspending dev time on such a huge hit or miss ideacome on ccp dont slap us in the face with thisanything that makes an outside force the deciding factor in something like world controlsystem controlconstellation controlregion control is taking the power out of our handswhats that players you are a pc gamer who does not own a console because you have your superior pc which is not left behind by the planned obsolescence cycle of manufactures well too bad enjoy being worthless in capturing that planet then i guess you have to trust in random xbl kiddiesor buy a 360station buy the new game at new game prices buy subscription for xbl and buy a subscription for new game at new game prices and force your entire groupcorpalliance to do the same and then you can still have the fun of having your months of planning ruined by l33t kiddies
yep sounds about right emote calls wambulance
dust should not only be available on pc it should be available through our current subscription eves major selling point is one server no instances freeform sandbox play with no further outlay of funds beyond subscription ie all expansions required for play are free this idea in one phial swoop urinates that all away planets will become battlegrounds not in a cool back lit epic cinematic way but a lame a world of snorecraft way how this does not equate directly to an instanced bg dictating the set up of the eve map is beyond me i could get behind the idea of fpsrts being tied to sov would in fact even welcome it  but if i have to not only buy a new game pay a new subscription but also a new platform as well  dust is fine console only is fine exluding me and other subscribers to eve from an important aspect of game play is just moronic everything and i mean everything that eve has to crow about will be destroyed if dust goes liveccp i beseech from the bowels of christ whilst at the same time knowing i am wasting my breathe rethink this idea
keep it on the consolesif youve ever played on a console multiplayer service youd know this market is filled to the brim with 12yos screaming that you arent playing how they told you tokeep them on consoles i dont wanna talk to em
if youre gunna provide a silly reason you could at least still give the thread a thumbs up xdin all seriousness if that is your reason you can still opt not to play
i honestly dont even care if this new content is free or not i do think however that it should not be console exclusive i loathe the thought of some console knuckle draggers having direct influence in our game while we have to sit back and watch from a distance im sorry but that is distasteful i dont begrudge ccp to try something new to make money but not at our expense make it a stand alone game for the console or you better damn well make sure that the pc players you know the ones paying your bills have first dibs on this new content especially since dust effects eve directly
unlike led zeppelin this is going over like a lead balloon
you might just have to buy a console and intervene with these so called knuckle draggers then so that they dont influence your sov its that simple or perhaps recruit some of them to protect your sov there will be lots of options being a lazy tard with your nose in the air wont get you anywhere tho just lost sov
so what you are saying is you have so much disrequard to the existing player base that you condone exploitation of characters used via multiclient to macro mine the assets of the game only to be sold to cheaters you condone alts being used as spies in cloaky ships in systems 23 hours a day you are also saying yes to people hacking into the game and accounts basically you are saying you would rather debase the game this way just to prevent an alleged target audience money grab got it
oh yes lots of other deciding factors wait no outside of throwing isk at them this takes important gameplay elements out of our hands us the players
so the thought of throwing isk at mercs to protect your beloved planet never occured to you then got it or the fact that you could recruit them into your alliance either didnt ring a bellgot it
ah now i get it you are acting foolish on purpose because its hard to imagine such talent coming along by accidentreducing gameplay in this game in eveonline to throwing isk at mercs is a bad plan recruit them into your alliance ah yes people who dont already play eve will sign up for it because of a game that is lightyears different in play got iteveryone wants 2 sets of fees to play two games plus hardware just to fulfill a function in one got it
i could deal with it if it was on pc however ing over your players by taking any of the control away from us over 00 sov and wanting us to purchase a completely different gaming system is ed
thisccp is tard or what
well i do believe it would be foolish to charge eve players with existing accounts to play dust unless per say they introduced a discount to said players of like 5 dollars a month to play it that would be a logical compromise i agree they shouldnt charge for two accounts to play both eve and dust using isk is a method of gameplay look at trading a simple form of pvp is just by being the highest bidder and one who meets demand better discounting the tactic of using isk as reducing gameplay instead of enhancing it is whats foolish

i would also like to point out that titans and other capital ships fleets support ships and so on dont grow on trees just in case you didnt know it takes isk to put them all together if you think of merc groups as a part of these assets you will understand how important it will be to be the highest bidder or the one with the biggest army down playing the tactic of throwing isk at a merc group is like saying you would rather be in your pod against a fleet of ships same concept it will just become another expense to those alliancescorps who want to keep sov just like buying a pos or a capitol ship
in ccps case no they have nothave you looked at the support forums do you have any idea how much of a companys resources can be eaten up supporting the many configurations a pc can be inthen throw in the osx supportsince this is probably a new engine it will require a whole new support chain starting with console only probably makes the differnce between we can support this and you are on your own but everyone will rage if we dont hold their hands through every single piece of hardware in existanceand it costs them dearlyin order to run eve hack free they have to do a lot of the computations server side and have lots of laggy communication between client and server it is this relatively hack free requirement that stops them from having dog fights and true ship control if you can not trust the client a lot of abilities go away
who the hell said anything about my sov i dont have any to even worry about my gripe is that players on another platform have the ability to influence our world i wouldnt care if it was a console game based on planetary mining ffs if content is being made for our universe that will at some level effect us then we should have a crack at it on our own platform why the holy hell should i have to cough up money for more hardware to play something that should be on our platform lets not even get into console shooter controls shall we regardless im more than willing to pay for it for christs sake i love the idea of what the ground war is and can do im rather irritated that the players that have been keeping this game afloat are taking a back seat to these so called knuckle draggers this isnt about sov this is the principle of telling the pc users theyre not welcome to this content
this is entirely about sov no more no less that is the only impact they will have on the game if you dont have sov then dont worry about it no one said there wouldnt be a way for you in eve to impact their play style in fact it hasnt been discussed yet except for the fact that you can draw up a contract and hire the mercs no one has discussed yet how they will arrive at a planet to invade or whether support fleets can engage forces on a planet through space also sure you could pick up a console but that may not even be necessary the use of your isk will be a controlling factor for these players in fact it may be the only way they make isk who knows i agree i hate using a controller for fps games if ccp can find a way to integrate a keyboard and a mouse while using a console i would be more proned to playing dust myself either way getting your panties in a twist before knowing the full details makes you look silly
this is merely an advantage that i speak of i never meant to indicate that it was impossible to develop for the pc as that would be a foolish statementthis is because eve online is nothing more than a dumb client and the server does the vast majority of the computational work all the players computer does is draw some pretty pictures based on the information presented by the server this is only possible because eve online does not require cpu intensive computations such as pixel perfect collision detection ray tracing or handling a continuous flow of input you will notice that space flight in eve is not directly controlled by the player instead the player issues commands such as orbit approach or maintain distance input only happens once every few seconds or so eve online is also a high latency game the game is capable of working properly even if you have a ping of 10002000msthis will not be possible in an fps as fpss require lots of time consuming computations such as the pixel perfect collision detection and ray tracing that i mentioned above most fpss today do almost all of the games computations on the client and then the client sends the results of the computations to the server where the server puts it all together and sends the appropriate updates to the other clients this is why games like team fortress 2 have problems with aimbots wall hacks speed hacks invulnerability hacks so on and so forth all that is needed is a third party program to modify a couple of bytes in memory while you can do these same things on a console it is much harder to do sothis would be like saying wow is superior to eve because its ui is superior to eves in reality it does not matter because everyone in eve has to play with the same ui so everyone must deal with the same limitations the fact of the matter is that millions of people find console fpss to be fun  even though they are not on the pc so long as everyone is on the same playing field dust 514 will be fun mind you we can have the same problem with dust 514 suddenly being required to remain competitive in eve online or vice versa this is a bad thing in my opinion however if ccp is careful they can hopefully minimize this scrapping the project would be a kin to throwing away millions of dollars and thousands of manhours this would generally be considered a bad business decision
i like how some people here act like a usb mouse and keyboard isnt compatible with the ps3supported anyway  i would like it for the pc even though i have a ps3
i hope so i wasnt just acting i dont own a ps3 so i wouldnt know if you could hook up a keyboard or a mouse i did know they had usb connections but that could be used for additional storage or a bunch of other things although with 80160gbs is alot of storageany ways if it can im game to just switching to a console for both eve and dust 
the main difficulty with that would be drivers for the mouse and keyboard however those should be simple enough that anyone who needed them could simply code them themselves keyboards and mice are pretty standardized now that one driver should work for almost all of them
i must give my support to this topic i am a poor uni student and buying a console would constitute spending about 12 of my yearly paycheck something i cant justifyi would very much like to see this implemented on pc and if subscription based could perhaps be added onto my current sub like eve voice was once optional for another 5 or somethingif it is implemented on consoles only i would feel very alientated since i could never afford to take part in what would become a very important part of eveone of the things i like about eve is that there is nothing you cannot do a caldari can fly gallente ships a miner can turn to piracy but if you split the game like this and then dont allow those of us who arnt ting money to get access to it it goes very much against the spirit of the game
damn you ccp letting mac players into our game whats next a linux client have you no shame
supported i dont want to have to drop 300 dollars on a console to expand my eve experience i dont really care for consoles anyway id much rather play it on the pc
console exclusivity give us dust 514 for the pc sod consoles
im on the fence here on the one hand i can see why ccp didnt release it on the pc and on the other i would have liked to play it as i refuse to buy a consolepossible reasons for the console release console gamers dont read reviews they buy on impulse based on pretty adverts in the shops consoles are easier to code for than pcs as there is only a set hardware and thus no compatibility issues eve players can play the console game as well as the mmo at the same time thus milking them off money this is a way to reach out to a wide audience and possibly attract more players to evethe most important ones are probably the average intelligence of console game buyers and the fact that ccp would like to reach out to a wider audience and thus make more money now i know we would all like to play the game but would a pc release detract from the game and draw people from eve to dust that could be one reason why ccp havent released it on the pc to be honest im pretty happy with eve as it is though i do like the idea of interracting with the planetary crowd even if its to bombard those fools with wave after wave of antimatter from my megas railguns  guess who has the upper hand if this were possible chribba can sit there and bombard the amarr planets all day long in his veldnought so unfair

i dont own a console i dont even own a tv how much ccp do you expect me to pay to play this gameno thank you
ps3 same usb port you can use a usb storage device to input drivers or you can download them from internet directly on the ps3
make it available for pcmac because there are tons of kids who would love to get in on the action but dont have the consoles to begin with
all thumbs up for making dust a pc release supported
i agree develop eve online for consoles
i just hope all the interaction with this market of people is at arms lengthreally dont want to have to talk to console squeakersif youve got a mate with xbox live jump on spend 10mins playing any game youll see what i mean
this obsessing about cheating is just stupidfirst the problem with cheating in a normal online fps is incredibly exaggerated ive spent countless hours playing them online and i very rarely encounter any cheaters or if i do they still suck so much that i win anyway most of the time the only sign of the cheater is when they are automatically kicked with a banned for x hack message the moment they connect to the server but besides that theres a fundamental differencea normal fps has countless individual servers therefore cheating has minimal risk even if you get caught youve still got plenty of other servers to play on the most any one server can do is ban you from that specific server and there are some that dont even do that much with one copy of the game a cheater can pretty much cheat as long as they want and annoy as many people as they can until they finally get tired of cheating and either decide to play honestly or move on to a new gamedust will have a centralized server or at least it will for all of the events that can have any effect on eve this means that if you get caught cheating say goodbye to your account youll have to buy a new copy of the game to play again and a combination of an automated cheat detection system and a report to admin feature and they will have to have this no matter what system they release it on as cheating on a console is merely more difficult not impossible means that you will get caught how many people do you think are going to spend 50 every day just to keep cheating in an online fps when there are so many other games to cheat in that dont have this feature
i wonder how theyre going to work thatthere is no way possible to play an fps from australia on an overseas serveranyone enjoy playing a game based on reaction time and accuracy while being half a second behind the other players
i am very worried about the fact that dust gameplay will have a direct impact on the landscape of eve i understand the logistical reasons for making a fps for the console only ccp will make more money plain and simple and i guess i understand the connectivity in some sense with the eve world maybe eve customers will staddle the fence and spend money on both eve and dust while still attracting an entirely new player base sovereignty though seems to be an insane tie inmy question is this why are the players of eve being in a very direct way taken out of the equation in terms of controlling space we inhabityes ccp has stated that fleet warfare will still play a part in the role of sovereignty but it makes no sense to link such an important part of what makes eve special to an entirely different player base than those flying the ships and truly inhabiting the space we were here firstthe main thrust of my point however is that instead of making a clever add on that could impact players in a tertiary way ie hiring an entity in dust to steal isk directly from an entity in eve or using an entity in dust to transport consumables through the universe of eve fighting along the way they are implementing a system that will require a new game in another medium to not only be successful but also require players of this new system to care about the subtle power plays that happen in the eve worldmainly though this is taking a major portion of the ownership feeling that eve fosters and giving it to a group who in a direct sense have nothing to do with eve i am all for expanding the ways that we can play eve but i want to be directly part of it i dont want to hire a group that may or may not be good at what they do and hinge the space that i fight for and inhabit and fill with very expensive things that take very real time and energy to acquire upon themeven if the dust players require some sort of major support from eve fleets for movement or funding or whatnot it still begs the question why is our sovereignty going to be affected in any way at all by a different game
what are you doing on this server i dont like you get out of my playerbase
easy you host the game itself on a local server but you have a centralized server to keep all the statsaccountsetc and exchange information with eve when you join the local server it pulls your statsetc from the central server just a onetime thing and verifies your account status get your account banned for cheating and you might be able to play on a lan or something but you sure as hell wont be joining any official games or having any influence on eve
i kinda doubt ccp would be setting up geolocated servers so theyd likely have to be 3rd party which would be a nightmare to manage and keep the data legit which likely means itll all be on a central server cluster somewherewith maybe mirrors in major marketsaustralia not being a major market id hazard a guess that well miss out
get out of your player base why dont you take your infantile response and deposit it where sunshine will not reach while youre there why dont you find something constructive to say instead of trolling
yes i support thisi woudld go even further and ask for dust514 integration in eve online thru wiseve online players keep paying something like 15  month and console players that can only play dust514 and wis pay somthing like 8  month
anywhere an statement from ccp to the community bc everything they promised us in the past is given to the consoleits a stab in the back is the way i think about it
if it quacks like a hypocrite walks like a hypocrite and looks like a hypocriteif you so burn for keeping console players out of this wonderful world of ours called eve perhaps you should reevaluate your reasons for being here first they go for the console player and no one complains because we dont like them then they go for the linux players and no one complains
pc  console having bought two which idle in a cupboard now way im buying another to play wtf is wrong with making a pc version
dispite this probably being a troll attempt i cannot resist feedingas said before a console vs pc argument is entirely different from one flavour pc vs another a maclinux player also has a mouse and keyboard and has the same advantages and difficulties as a windows player a console player is stuck with either a controller or very limited keyboard and mouse support on top of that this console game is an external factor all of a sudden an external factor you have no control over can severely limit what you can do in a sandbox game this is pretty much contrary to the very foundations on which eve is built if you cant see how this is a bad ideamaking this non exclusive is a first step so supported
pc or death
i dont have an issue with it development time on console is often shorter since much of the work has been done before youif ccp were wise they would liscence engine software and instead just worry about filling the contenthint hintfrostbite ccp

not much to discuss i hope ccp comes clean at the fanfest that a pc version is in parallel development there is no way i would use a gamepad controller

first fps games are much better with mouse controlsecond while its good to expand target audience to console players theres no good reason to exclude pc audience ccp wants to make money right why would the purposefully deny themselves 100000 sales theres gotta be something tricky going on
signedive been playing eve for almost 4 years now on and off mostly off but i have pretty much a one year sub that until now i had no plans of ever cancelling frankly if they deny pc users access to dust514 an fps given that the fps genre began on the pc and is still the medium in which the controls permit you to excel at no console controller can replace keyboard mouse for shooters i will for the first time in a long while cancel my account possibly completely backlash against ccp for such an absurd move
im all about bringing this to the pc only problem i could forsee is the use of cheats which is easily countered by using steam as the distribution and play method or make it a true mmofps with regular updates and support to counter hacks and cheatsnot bringing this to the pc is a mistake you could update the game on a regular basis with weapons mods all sorts of nifty tools power suits or mechs the possibilities are endless and ccp is selling themselves short there is a severe lack of good mmofps on the pc planetside was fun while it lasted but got stale and repetitive even though they tried to keep it fresh their efforts were half hearted at besttypical soe there is a very large market out there waiting to be tapped and ccp will miss the mark if they dont develop and implement this part of the eve universe properly bring this to the pc as an mmo or an addition to evealthough that would be pretty hard to do but dont let it go to consoles only where it will wither and die in 6 months or more when the next big shooter for consoles arrives with the exception of a few diehard playersthis has a lot of potential ccp the community has been asking for something like this for a long time terra firma battles have been speculated about for years and years then you go and anounce it for consoleswhat were you thinking dont  this away ccp i hate to see a great developmental idea get flushed because console gamers get bored with it in a few months
the vac system tends to be a little intrusive into the server aspect of the game im not sure ccp would be willing to allow thatbut its a valid point nonethelessand i know for a fact that the vac is very effective
i know they released eve on steam however im unaware if it uses the vac system also or not anyone
signed
hahahahhahahahhhhhahahahhahahahahahomg the tears the tearsget over it pc s all this crying is truely pathetic
your idiocy frightening notice where i mention other areas that could have tied dust into eve i do not want to keep the console gaming community out i just dont want them to have an impact on something as huge as sovereignty can anyone here honestly tell me that they are fine with an entirely different game controlling even in a small fashion the sovereignty in eveplease get off your high horse and turning this issue into something it is not i actually think the idea of blending two different games into one persistent universe is awesome i just dont want to see things taken away from eve players and especially not something as gameplayinfluential as sovereignty
matt damon
and for cheat thing bf has punk buster steam has vac etcso it cant be a problem and also u can make a flagged acc thing just flag that game key as a cheater so no more problem for ya till that bstrd decide to buy another key
i dont like the console idea simply for the reason that some other people have mentioned im not a console person never have been i still have a ps2 that collects dust no pun intendedi would like to see it made available for both systems
no it does mot you would see an indicator or logo of some kindvac requires going through valves network in some form or fashion
change the colour of the afterburner icon so its different from the mwdsbasically the same as the change in the icon for warp scramsdissysonce the icons were subtly different it became easier to find the module you wantedjust think it would be good to apply the warp scramdissy logic to afterburnermwd as wellsubtly different icons to make the one your looking for easier to find
supporting this
umwhy is this an issue
red paint makes ships go fastererrr with apologies to warhammer onlinei dont see the problem ive never confused the 2 why is this an issue again
not an issue which is why i didnt put issue in the title just small improvement to make selecting modules easier
im going to have to go with no on thisif you lack the situational awareness of your own ship to know which module youre clicking on you may want to consider a change of venue
i was refering to ship fitting and icons in hangarcontainers
itd be nice for sorting stuff in hangars
obvious bad colour is obvious red iz good colour cuz red wunz go fazta
some differentiation would be nice
only if its pink and purple
this thread has gone quite far but i think most people forget something very importantsince a few years most patches were pro blob and against smallscale warfare a change is urgently neededi dont see how any of the proposed changes are gonna improve the situation
these changes are geared more towards sup cap fixes than they are about blobsthat said dd today do not solve the blobbing problem theyre just as effective for the blobbers as they are for the blobbies the proposed change removes the stupid pro dd idea for fleets and replaces it with a pro fleet approach for every one instance today where not having a fleet cost a titan there are 100s of instances where thats just not true and thats the inherent problem the change listed provides chances for strategy tactic and counter tactic to titans that isnt so cut and dry as avoid or dont avoid and tank x amt of dmg it will also change the role of all warfare not just sub capital warfare while helping to usher in the age of t3 equipment and ships in massas for the mothership changes beyond extra hp i really couldnt care about them i personally feel carriers and moms are all wrong in their implementation in game atm they are single handedly the most over powered and underpowered tool in game atm it really takes flying them and commanding them to understand that sentiment my hope is that even if they are not fixed soon the changes to sov will be properly implemented which should expose carrier platforms for the frauds they are
supportedbut the 00 coward carebears always dont wanna changes this cloaking crapthey wanna more benefits for cloakers like localchat nerfnobody would be discover them on local long times ago the ccp removed them in games when thet dont move their ship under 30 minutes but the 00 noobs were crying too much and the developers removed this opportunity from the game 30 mins or 1 hour or 2 hour nvm
supportedbut everone know this cloaking rules will not change because the most of csm members just insignificant 00 chessmen who got their positionsthe 00 alliances made it compulsory for their members to vote for themso  csm  only the 00 the embodiment of interests
so you want some one to improve your situation for you because you are to lazy to improve it your selfyou picked the alliance mates find another group of idiots

issueidea misson rewards rebalancing
even more valid given recent developmentsthe announcement of dust 514 has created a lot of heated discussion on both sides of the fence clearly there is no middle ground in this debate nor does this proposal attempt to force one whether one is for or against dust 514 there can be no escaping what it representsdust 514 is a paradigm shift in the endgame of eve online and will change everythingas no amount of petitioning whining or other acts of textarea can serve to dissuade ccp from releasing dust 514 as developed the spotlight must fall onto those individuals who choose to represent the interests of the playerbase the csmmany questions remain as to the role of the csm in this affair it is the purpose of the csm to gather player concerns and suggestions regarding all aspects of gameplay from the new player experience to the endgame it is clear that the announcement and subsequent release of dust 514 having such far reaching effects on eve must have been discussed within the csm the question is were the csm aware of dust 514 before the rest of us or notif the csm were complicit in the knowledge of dust 514 then any work performed by them is tainted if this were the case they are keeping important information from the very people they are sworn to represent what is the purpose of raising concerns if the conduit through which they are delivered knows of future developments that render these same concerns meaninglessthus they cannot be trusted to best represent the issues of the playerbase instead basking in their position of secret privilege non disclosure agreements aside inside knowledge such as this can and will be used to the advantage of the csm and their alliances a common theme in the history of eve as t20 and band of brothers reloaded will testifyif the csm were not complicit in the knowledge of dust 514 then ccp are not equipping them with the information they need to perform their roles if such a gamechanging development were held secret for three years then what other secrets are being kept from our elected representatives how can our issues be adequately represented if sweeping changes are to come without warningthus they cannot adequately represent the issues of the playerbase and become no more than figureheads with as much influence in the direction of eve as the star wars galaxies senate had on their ruined gameeither way the csm has failed to serve the mandated purpose  that of providing a trustworthy conduit between the players and ccp as with dust 514 there is no middle ground either the players cannot trust the csm or the csm cannot trust ccpthis is not the much vaunted first digital democracy that ccp would like to boast to the media it is a sham tainted by the undeniable truth of deceptionwhich leads to the inevitable conlcusion that the csm should and must be disbanded at the end of the current tenureas those who seek power are invariably least fit to wield it clinging to their privilege like all good firsts among equals the onus falls on us to ensure this power is dissolved we the players must steadfastly refuse to vote in the next csm election without the will of the people behind it the csm will crumble as it would fail to serve its pr purposecontinued
as an alternative to the little good that the csm have provided the playerbase i suggest a more direct method of ensuring our concerns are heard we already have a tool available to vote for particular posts in the assembly hall forum i suggest that a fortnightly qa session be raised with a different developer each time responding to the top n posts in the forum relating to their own development discipline as the next developer will be announced in advance this will ensure that those with a vested interest in having their concerns heard will promote the posts that best express themthese sessions must be uncut and unfiltered as the pr whitewash that was the previous csmapproved qa still contradicts ccps supposed stance on transparency and accountabilityif ccp can bankroll an entire skunkworks project team for three years then they can afford to take a developer off work for a day every fortnight to prepare these responses it would definitely prove cheaper than shipping their puppets to iceland every couple of monthsthis is not to diminish the individuals who have worked hard to make the csm the best it can be nor to cast blame on for example jade constantines excellent write up on planetary colonization now rendered worthless as it is incompatible with twitch fps gameplay it is most likely that they were just as much in the dark as the rest of us and have been equally played for foolsin closing we salute those who tried their best to bridge the gap between ccp and their customers but it is time to move asideif dust 514 has proved one thing it is that change is inevitable and should be embracedwe need action we need change and we need it now
its called a nondisclousre agreement you dumbassassuming they even knew in the first place assuming they even had any possiblity which they dont in making anything changeccp is in charge we are notgot it get it goodnow quit already while your ahead

its a known fact that the csm has no influence in whatever ccp decidesthey sold their playerbase out to microsoft and sony as a lot of companies did before thema lot of players play this game for years and payed for itin return they get this instead of using the money we pay to make a better game its going to a platform a lot of them dont even ownyesincluding mecsm cant be accounted for thisonly ccpccp did the backstabnobodyelsesorry for my bad english

agreed no need to watch the  storm this will startthere will be plenty of others
too quote gabe newell from halflife 2 raising the barone of the unique characteristics of games as a medium is that you have to create it in cooperation with the audienceif you want evidence of this you simply need look no further than classic events such as the stars wars galaxies nge and combat revamp ultima onlines renaissance and age of shadows especially the latter and the recent performance of warhammer online age of reckoning and age of conan hyborean adventure
and how does this help anyor are you just complaining to be complaining like this fail thread

its not eft its a calculator the npc ship database ive found shows resistances and a simple comparison of 115100em resist to 16100therm resist will always show the ogre winning against any npc ive ever looked at maybe if you got a hypothetical mission with nothing but crazy sansha hacs you could conceivably have em drones winning but there is no real mission like that the show info doesnt show structure hp use the compare tool  praetor ii has 806 structure hp ogre ii has 1421 the difference is significant and you neglect to mention the 40 less dps thing i see it as balanced because thats a highly artificial scenario a carrier that isnt killing you has one smartbomb as a defense and nothing else and whose primary defense is a bufferbecause your dps is far lower its only aggregate damage you win on and youre stuck with 125m3 of praetor drones in your hold for when you run into something that isnt a smartbomb carrier instead of having useful drones like ogres to be honest they wouldnt be good after the change  they suck now because they do ty dps theyll suck afterwards because theyll still do ty dps i just want them to have a role  a bad one perhaps but at least an existent one as it is they could remove acolyteinfiltratorpraetor drones from the game entirely and id call it a positive change because itd prevent people from being crazy enough to use them after this change i still wouldnt use them but id feel less of an urge to mock people who do and ill actually be willing to accept arguments about why they might be good in a particular circumstance
believe it or not ive actually killed a few people while using praetor iis yes i was crazy enough to train amarr spec iv unfortunately the only use for them is against shield tankers who have completely neglected their em hole this guy eg but other than that their low damage modifier makes them utterly useless and hence i support their buff though again not quite the extent hersch is suggesting
give them a reason to be purchased other then reprocessing
agreed in general not sure about 46x hp bonus but certainly 3x is possible alternatively balancing speed vs damage mod would be a good method gallante are the highest damage dealers but the slowest the fastest are minmatar and are second highest damage that leaves caldari and amarr drones rather lacking should be a more direct progression i think gallante highest damage but slowest caldari 2nd slowest but second highest damage amarr with 2nd worst damage but 2nd highest speed and minmatar with best speed and worst damage
err uhhh since when are minmatar drones 2nd highest damage
herschel lets see if i can explain myself sounding less antagonistic as i am not against a buff for amarr drones but i find a x46 increase in hit point really excessivetrue amarr drones have 30 less damage but again we should decide against what we need to balance npc or playersagainst players the choice will be always top damager or fastest so unless you want to increase damage or speed beyond all other drones of the same class they will not be picked against npc it is another matterwhat matter are the target resistances to me what tis important is killing my primary targets the other stuff is secondary there we have 2 class of important targets neutralizing towers and high resit ship especially those that use scramble web or use ewar neutralizing towers have shields with 0 em resist and 20 thermic resist that is a 25 increase in damage and while i cant find the data in the database you linked those towers have a lot of shield hp i have recently done some level 5 missions and the amarr drones were doing much more damage than the gallente against top orders npc targets of the right kind the difference between thermic and em reist is 144 but the resists are 7879 thermic and 6474 em a difference between 64 and 78 resist is a 63 increase between 74 and 78 a 18 between 74 and 79 a 24 increase between 72 and 79 a 33 increase all that while you have a decent increase in speed and a real but hardly significant loss in hp when your drones are targeted by a horde of npc they generally die or the damage become insignificant as you are recalling them and speed become much more important for survival then there is a matter about the drones that will be introduced with apo 15 they will have x2 hit point and better tracking but for that ccp feel the need to reduce damage by a 10 weight that against a x46 increase in hpcaldari and amarr drones getting some buff surea x46 increase in hp no i have no idea what would be a reasonable buff but generally it seem that ccp feel that drones are already doing too much damage as every special model augmented improved the new faction drones has his damage reduced in some way in my eyes the split damage of the augmented and improved is a way to reduce damage better trackingsecond fastest and second damage as someone suggested but then where it leave caldariabout your artificial example when you make an example you need to use the equivalent units for all the races comparing t2 drones with t1 why no one will train for the t2 reduce the example value after your buff people would train for the heavy amarr drones
so for those towers gallente does 1608  128 effective multiplier whereas amarr does 1151  115 effective multiplier gallente still wins pretty handilyfor those npcs the best resistance set i can find for your argument is some centum loyals with 72 em and 79 therm  gallente does 16021  0336 amarr does 115028  0322 and gallente still wins by 4 and its not like those are the only things you have to kill in any given mission even if they are the most annoying if you can find an npc with 64 em and 78 therm then ill agree that amarr are better against them but ive found no such npc when i was lookingits not a matter of ccp feeling that the drones are doing too much damage its a matter of them not wanting to make using the new drones automatic if faction drones has 2x hp better tracking and the same raw dps as t2 everyone would be pushing towards using faction and ignoring t2 which would be kind of silly theyre trying to make you trade off in your drone choices which is similar to my proposal damage speed hp or being decent at all three  which do you prefer i just want that third choice to exist and i cant think of any way to get there from here other than a hp boostalso speed and hp are both good at surviving drone aggro getting back sooner or surviving longer do similar things besides amarr are fairly fast i put the numbers for t2 in right after t1 dude was saying my change wouldnt do anything i pointed out that even t1 amarr would be be better than t2 gallente at the designed role its a narrow role of course so im fine with that but i was showing that it would be a functional buff to that role
its not like amarr depend on drones and trive to make them goodits like demanding that kia or hyndai be as good as bmwif you want the best specialize in gallente drones and pay with skill training timenot supported
so what youre saying is that the secondbest drone racesee arbitrator curse pilgrim should have the worst drones and that people should pay for using the good ones by training a skill that takes exactly as long and has exactly the same requisites as the skill for the bad ones
from my observation the amarr are third in terms of drone use after gallente and minmatarregardless any change that would improve the amarr light medium and heavy drones would be a good one i have almost 7 million skill points in the drone tree i have gallente minmatar and caldari drone spec each to level 4 i dont even have the amarr drone spec installed why the amarr light medium and heavy drones are completely worthless to me and neither the curator ii or templar require a single level of the skill to use ive never had any reason to train ittheir damage could use a little look at but i agree that as an amarr construct they should be able to at least take a beatingsupporting this because again pretty much any change in the amarr light medium and heavy drones would be a positive one
an even worse form of the lottery just noif you want to buy a t2 bpo earn the money buy one it is as simple as that
the t2 bpo lottery sucked because it was chance basedinvention esp on ships sucks because it is chanced basedif any solution for introducing new t2 bpos into the game is going to not suck it should not be chance based
if invention is meaningfully chancebased youre doing it wrong invent within your budget and regression to the mean is your friend if a few successes or failures is what will make or break you youre too close to the edge back off and try again
if this is right i have some doubtthe solution is fairly simple without need for absurd positive me levels from invention simply remove the negative pe levels making invention baseline value for pe 0 invention has already a time sink in the invention part of the process so it can be removed in the build part my opinion is that it will only further reduce the margins for inventors without increasing the selection of invented items but it can be worth a try
companies licence out technology all the timethis is the equivelent of selling production rightsits rp breaking that while t1 stuff bpos can be purchased t2 bpos cantt3 bpos should be available also leaving production component aquisition as the player contributed requirement
i highlighted and underlined the most important part that you conveniently ignored yet still quotedjust because the material efficiency is not a great benefit does not mean it shouldnt be improved much like one feather is insignificant but when you have enough its a nice mattress so it is for one small change amongst many they stack upstill i personally believe that if people invented bpcs that came with more runs in them their profit would go up nicely as it shouldand if you make the me to be a positive then as you say ship production will benefit but more importantly its one less thing people can complain about when it comes to invention vs t2 bpos

wow waste of a thread peeps gotta use alt only way to make it and guess what alt makers can make more free trial accts in 5 min than there are koreans to pile into runescape
no
allow me to support this proposal well me and my alts
yeah nail em all
death to the alts
this proposition is full of fail people need to buy extra accounts for meaningfull alts anyhow all they get now is either simple scouts or marketprice checkers or they have to give up training on their mainnot supported op is trolling

are you confusing alts and jump clonesand not supported
get rid of mains they always trying to keep a brother alt down
here here would mean youd have to really decide if you wanted to have that 10 status and rely on someone being able to create a lowsec market for you to buy your stuff at since you dont have an alt to ferry it out to youeven better idea 1 account logged in per ip address no more multiboxing
and limits on reelection
i suggest that since eve is getting more and more people joining and being active in eve it would only make sense that the recruitment forums be further divided to organize the morass it has become break it down into alliance recruitment corporation recruitment and pilots looking for recruitment or something on those lines
pvp  wardecced basedpvp  pirate based low secpvp  00 basedpveminingrattingstory based corps00  alround pvp pve etc shadow xdeathxhaulingmiscbroken down to roles so it would be easyer to surf around what your looking to dothere also should a template of what ads should be
if ccp had a civilized set of forums these would all be subforums hanging off the main darks list is excessive but the principle is one i like
darks list would not worksome corporations are multirole as it isbut a simple division suggested by the op would be finesupported
i agree something needs to change the recruitment forum is to be charitable useless
today even a small 00 alliance can replace their cap looses quite fast its because capitals are cheap yes even if your corp or alliance doesnt have a nice moon whipround among corp mates  some work of few people and you can produce your own titan from some time to time we see battles where 100 capitals died after a week few days or even few houts those capsuleers have new fancy dreads and carriers and everything start over againtoday a non capital non faction tech2 marauder hull have worth of well fitted carrier and fitted marauder have higher value than fitted dreadnought blackops hull have same price as carriers hull not mentioning that they are quite popular today people like to rat in a marauder pew pew using their bo all this in a ship of around 120 of cap eff hp and even if they loose their fancy ships few days x few hours spending on asteroid belt and here it is againnot mentioning that this game turned into who will dd more roaming gangs today and solution for this isnt only in terms of buiding new titanssolution or more like first strong stepoffensive oriented capitals are to cheap in general well maybe except motherships people corprations alliances living in 00 have too much money today but even without moons or just good systems on map its a matter of corp tax or organizing an op from some time to time increasing amount of cap component needs for carriers dreadnoughts titans by 100 will result in better isk sink and more logistics job in addition to increasing manufacturing time for those ships by 100today carrierdreadnought in a pos have build time less than 10 days titan 47 days this is one of the causes why everyone have plenty of them and for example dreadnought is more like a battleship today not some kind of ultimate siege weapon like year or two ago
im supporting this
why is it a bad thing that people can play with ships that they like playing with its not like theyre cheap  a fitted carrier costs north of a billion which is like 2030 hours of 00 mining or 40 hours of highsec missioning  but the fact that they can fly them without obscene difficulty is a good thing and besides spaceholding alliances are there because they tend to be pretty hardcore if youre willing to spend tens of billions pos spamming a single system youre willing to eat a cost increase to your carriers and just keep pumping them out hardcore players will always do what they need to do to be successful serious alliances will never run out of dreadnoughts until the day they failure cascade no matter what they cost

well its not its just that isk lost his value in the past with 10 dreadnoughts and small t2 support you could take entire region today with 10 caps in fleet you are asking yourself if its wise to kill single enemy pos without bigger cap fleet on stand bay ready for counterdropi remember when there was maybe 3 titans in game and that was really something today we have around 220 titans with few naps you can have a friendly titan per each of your system even if you are controlling entire region its because titans are cheap and quite easy to build if ya know how to do it and many people do one person with trade alt in jita buying large tech1 turrets tachs 425mm 1400mm 100mn mwd have good mineral compression also and ofc some other stuff around 35k units of turrets total its six jfs if i remember correctly so no big deal when you move it to 00 reprocess in minmatar outpost its good to have lvl1 reprocessing upgrade because without it you need scrap metal to 5 and h60 implant and even then you have around 992 if im not mistaken then you calling 23 of your friends with freighters to move minerals to pos where you build cap parts and then a ship or if you have amarr outpost in other system cause he have better bonus to produce cap parts but still you need to take them to pos afterwards three weeks later using few of your production alts you have all components and one and a half monts later you have another titan in game so like you see its not a big deal even one well organized person without girlfriend to care can do it all even around 80ish runs from outpost to pos with cap parts isnt too much specialy if you have pos at undock direction of your outpost insta warpyes i know that thats why this idea is good
i dont know the exact numbers as im not into caps too much but i believe the loss of a carrier should come down to about 400m fighters fittings insurance which is 6 or 7 times that of a lost rigged t2 fit battleship not to mention the horrible effort in building a cap compared to building subcapstheyre the new battleships and finally a counter to titans which just deserve to dieand remember theres also a lot of players out there who dont have dozens of r64 moons
not supported capitals were purposely made cheap so everyone could fly one some daycheap  easilly replaceablethere is just no way around itattrition still works with capitals so you still have no issue other
if you made the capitals more expensive then new alliances would find it even harder to get onto the ladder and claim some space iv just trained built and fitted a carrier and that drained my money pretty wellif they are made more expensive they would never be worth the training the money and how easily they can be killed by a mistake or a well led gang

didnt realize this was active but i had a suggestion for this in this thread linkage
itd be a good idea that tie in afterburners and mwds so that they turn off whenever you hit ctrl  space or stop the ship using the stop ship commandthis saves numptys like me forgettig its on and draining cap at a standstill
not supported unless its a toggleable option personally id rather have the extra bit of control over my ship any day if you hit stop ship when you dont intend to youre down that much capacitor and might not have enough to reactivateits a reasonable idea but it would have to be toggleable
hersch i miss talking to you 3
this
id say more but the dust 514 chicken little crowd on eve general has been keeping me amused today instead
the main problem with that idea is that it would allow all ships with mwd to warp in 3 seconds
put it into your f1f8 spaces jeeze
i think the proposal was for it to turn off as per standard deactivation not as per being scrammed id oppose the threesecond warp if that was what was being proposed but i dont think it is
current issue missioning in high security space appears to be overpowered  too profitable compared to other activitiessolutionfirst let me demonstrate how the current mission mechanics work highlighted are the areas which i believe need modificationa person takes a mission the mission rewards are generated based on the following factors agent quality mission level security rating of agents systemonce accepted a player then goes into the mission area and begins killing npcs for the sake of argument assume this is a combat missioneach npc has a set bounty depending on the npc type this bounty is the same regardless of the system security status or system populationevery 20 minutes from the first kill the player receives bounty payoutplayer turns the mission in receiving rewards originally indicated in the mission descriptionthe following solution demonstrated could be implemented to resolve the issue of the high sec reward dillemaa person takes a mission the mission rewards are generated based on the following factors agent quality mission level security rating of agents system unchanged from current implementationonce accepted a player then goes into the mission area and begins killing npcs for the sake of argument assume this is a combat mission unchanged from current implementationeach npc has a bounty on them set at spawn determined based on the following potential factorsnumber of times destroyed of this npc type in system in the last x hours or minutesnumber of mission deadspaces active in system in the last x hours or minutesoptional level and quality of the agent being missioned foroptional relative congestion of system compared to others in region  constellation  faction space ie gallente amarr blood raider etcplayer turns the mission in receiving rewards originally indicated in the mission description unchanged from current implementationreasons for suggestionas evidenced in the gamedev forum top 3 issues thread there are a lot of people unhappy at the imballance in risk v reward offered by the high security l4 missions additionally there is a general perception that low security space is the orphan child of eve with both high and null security being perceived as more profitable this solution aims to address these two issues by introducing variation into the main rewards of missions which are the bounties provided by them the idea behind this solution is that if missioning out of a popular high security system with low perceived risk being acknoledged by the popularity of it your rewards should diminish based on the factors outlined above namely number of other people actively exploiting the benefits of the location and the speed of this exploitation additionally by using comparative metrics for the systems within a certain range this system can also bonus the lowsecurity andor lowpopulation systems by providing them with higher bounties on the same npcs as in mission hubsprosworks to even out the eve population as opposed to the current system of hub  spoke mission areasworks as a stealth buff to lowsecurity space doubleeffect of both higher agent quality and low system populationsaddresses the problem without affecting the current difficulty of missionsencourages player movement and alternative professions via reduced rewardsmay create additional opportunities for the salvagingninja salvaging miniprofessionscan be implemented across all levels of missions

mission hubs are not bad things the lag from them has been dramatically reduced over the years and the existence of other options for where to mission helps a lot as well id love it if the other races were to get as much carebear love as the caldari have gotten but i dont think this is the right means of doing that its far too complex a method of achieving your desired goal
im not at all saying mission hubs are bad what i am trying to get at is that at the moment id hazard a guess that most of the income from l4s 60 comes from doing missions in hubs which are themselves located in highsec by applying this it works to both even out highsec rewards across empire but also to up the rewards in lowsec lowering the lag in hubs is a sideeffect but its not at all what im trying to achieve with this proposalso tldr for the whole proposal 1 nerf to l4 hubs via lower rewards 2 buff lower q agents  lowsec  less frequently used corps via higher rewards 3 potential for easy addition of other factors ie loot drop corps mission frequency etc into the rewards
i suppose i see your point but the problems with l4 lowsec missions tend to be more systemic  the races nobody missions for have piles of awesome lowsec agents the races everyone uses have a handful of worthless ones give the caldari navy a couple l4q20s in 01sec and id bet lowsec missions would get less hate i just think that there has to be a better way of making lowsec missions better than the rather impressive amount of work for the server you propose to create
an interesting thing has happened in the console world coincidence perhaps here is a link
thumbs up
and i suppose those of us who dont want to pay 300 for one game are just left out of what is going to be a significant part of eve  that
consoles are easy to hack and hard to keep updatedits likely that the console game will be more exploitable then eve
wrong it is much harder to hack into a console to steal information like user names and passwords for one most hackers dont even know the operating systems and browsers well enough for the consoles to even pose a threat with consoles its a known fact that most hacks are directed towards microsoft operating systems
yes a little bit harder to steal passwords remotely but who said anything about hacking into consoles remotelythis has nothing at all to do with keyloggers or browser bugsits about taking the dust game changing it and playing the exploited version that gives you some version of god modea very common occurrenceto suggest that consoles somehow make exploiting the game software impossible is completely 100 bogusas for microsoft hacks are targeted towards victims no matter what os they use just so happens that most people use windows and therefore its the biggest targetthe op said consoles which are indeed damn near impossible to hack into this statement is wrongthey are easier to hack as it is easy to control the updating of the software involved as they are designed to run well in offline environments old software gives more inroads then new software
most people who exploit in fps shooters are banned rather quickly also this is something more than just a douche running god mode its about a third party sniffing out ports to gain a persons login credentials so that they can commit fraud this is about protecting customers from that sort of thing so if you have a choice of the possibility of protecting your clients from fraud versus the random idiot who thinks hes cool what would you choose to do
eh why would that be any harder on a console then on anything elsemaninthemiddle attacks are just that doesnt matter what os the endpoint is if youre in the middle you can read the data if not encrypted or crack it if it is encrypted with a bad random generator or keys dont cycle often enoughos doesnt make any difference at all in this style attack
most of the time they have to connect to your ip in order to remote acess your data which make that hard to do since clicking on links on a ps3 may be different does the ps3 have a browser for the internet and if so is that browser regularly targeted by these types of people it is a fact tho the person who is making the trojan would have to code it using the same language as the targeted console in question and there is no gaurentee that that trojan would work properly due to how that operating system works so no i highly doubt it is just as easy
the point is that its possible to do it changing from a pc to a console or whatever does nothing if the target has something worth stealing and is stupid enough to fall for it
well it depends actually we dont know for sure if someone could secure another persons credentials while they are running a console if a consoles operating system doesnt support that type of coding to run in that system it may be impossible first off when a console os boots up there is no way for a virus to start up because there will be no options for it do so thus limiting the hacker only one chance at to sniff out information if heshe can even do that
a computer is a computer is a computer
and thats why you make a different type of virus targeted at the specific console or computer you want to infect nobody is saying youll get a pc virus on your ps3 theyre saying that the same hackers who are trying to steal your account info on the pc will simply create a new attack to steal your dust info from your ps3
okay so a computer is a computer is a computer the problem with that is that certain operating systems may not be sophisticated enough for complex viruses like a trojan to operate inside it the only way possible is if a person hacked a ps3 to run like a computer using linux and to acces login credentials for a game like dust the user would have to switch from linux to the regular game os loaded on the ps3 so in reality the linux which is loaded on the hard drive wouldnt be active and secondly the game os is located in a flash memory seperate from that it would be near impossible and not worth doing since trying to sniff out such data would be accessing sonys servers and that may not be fun at all
the os on your phone is exploitablethe first xbox is exploitablethe new xbox is exploitablethe next xbox is exploitableas for stealing credentials its just not an issuewho cares about these credentials there is near no value in themexploiting the game itself would be much more prevalent
heres a hint for you viruses arent new theyve been around on much more primitive systems than any modern console
are you a r e t a r d seriously ccp banned 6000 macro mining accounts macro mining accounts have been linked to isk sellers who are also linked to stealing account info and login credentials in order to play the game and make money if they dont sell the isk they will try to sell your account and even scam people who are trying to buy an account this way i had a character hacked into recently so i know first hand how sucky this can be it is all because if they find out your ip they can run your system remotely using different ports via trojan viruses and sniffing systems or perhaps the virus downloads itself sniffs out the info finds it and sends the info back to the author so if you think it is a non issue then you can eat sht and die
thanks captain obvious the problem is in order to run a complex program it takes a complex operating system i believe the operating system on a console would not be complex enough to perform such a function
you are mistaken
lets say i am mistaken about the hacking even tho i believe it would be more secure than any windows machinemuch like the reason a linux system is even if i am mistaken would this not get rid of the macro miners or the alts who stay cloaked in system 237 what about those neutral alts that repair ships during a corp war in high sec switching to consoles ultimately would solve so many problems in game as it is the option to run multiple accounts would still be there but you will just have to have another console in order to play each account i like that idea
dont listen to dr whinesmith hes running low on cheeseseriously where do you get this crapthe only thing ive seen happening is hijacking of xbox accounts exploitations and cheating are few and far between due to the jailed nature of the console youd have to physically modify the hardware just to get anywhere let alone risk damaging the warranty on already large pos hardware which suffers from nearly if not higher than 50 failure rate welcome to rings of death weeei think chicken little should take a little walk and get some cheesethe odds of cheatinghacking are extremely low due to a plethora of reasons id be more worried about the pcsnot to mention the fact your talking about the majority of which are a bunch of kids and even if they do cheat its to kill someone in a game like halo and not to affect your precious internet ships which are very likely gong to get ganked by some random pirate in some random gate campwhy is this even an issue sheeshoh and not supported i hate it when a console benches a game and keeps it from the larger computers when its fully doable on a standard pcmac
youve been playing since january 2007 so assuming youve been subscribed the whole time thats 350450 youve paid in subscription fees so apparently you do feel like paying 300 for one game
other than the last sentence i agree with every word drake saidbattlesmith doesnt really know what he is talking about he keeps talking about old software and crap but you cant even get online unless you update to the current software modded consoles are almost immediately detected and banned outright and since its really easy to report hackers on the console their escapades generally only last a few minutes before the ban hammer drops
get em herschel
very well said i loled
thats the point we pcplayers have i dont mind consoleplayers as long the gameplay doesnt change to muchbut thats exactly what is gonna happenif dust 514 was pc and console you wouldnt hear me but indeed a lot of the money the pc playerbase payed is invested in the consolemarket and in return we get sht and thats what the most pcplayers are angry aboutand again if dust was multiplatform pcconsoles i would welcome it
so let me get this straight youre concerned about hacks and account stealingso you want it on consoles only thats got to be the most assinine thing ive heard pc security isnt as flawed as you make it out to be its just as simple to hack a console and its os as anything else take for instance the ps3 and xbox360 which can be hacked to run other oses whether through hardware or software hell the old xbox could be hacked over its lan connection given time the new gen consoles will be too guaranteedif account security is your concern along with hacks and cheats let them release it through steam or another monitored and regularly updated distrubution and matching service your argument for console only is not only flawed but not very thought out or realistic console accounts are hacked on a regular basis you just dont hear about it as much consoles are no more secure than a pc the pc has just been around and is more widely distributed and therefore more people are trying to circumvent its security measures for gain not much to gain from hacking a console account other than free play then again the same could be said for hacking a pc account as its been stated beforea computer is a computer
mouseover of time in eve should show the current datenot everyone is on the same day in their local timezonesi know its easy enough to remember but a little prompting does helpi often mouseover the time expecting it to show me the date the ui paradigm is strong enough that i keep going back looking for it and then remembering it doesnt show date
good idea simple to implement improves the game i agree
yeah ive hovered for the date a few times before i remembered that eve doesnt have that be nice if they did it

create a separate area of the forum for dust514 related threads  or give them their own forum dust514com or somethingthen move all the threads about that game to that forum area let those of us who frankly dont care go back to our lives without having to filter out all the sky is falling sky is falling posts
and get them the hell out of heredust has no place here in assembly hall the game is not involved in the daily happenings of eve online as it is it may affect eve but not on the scale everyone is screaming at hell we dont even know what will be affected let alone howwhile i do enjoy collecting tears from the mentally challenged i feel that there are more important matters to discussits not like they have a slim chance of being heard as it isthey would get more just writing letters oh shock of shocks writing you people still do that to ccps main offices  o pcsm doesnt dictate policy as it is and to force them to discuss a game that is not eve online is a total waste of there time
some guy has already done itdust514orgi can not remember who it was that set it up but give him some loveedit its eddie gordo who made it
much thanks
agreedand for the love of god do a better job on its forums than you did on eves
i expect the nerdrage to die down in a couple days and well get use of the forums back if it doesnt then this becomes a bit more urgent still i expect ccp will do this without our prodding  they have some idea of how to support a game theyll make forums for it when theyre ready to this isnt something we need to ask for
this console exclusive game should have zero impact on the 6 year old mmo known as eve it should have nothing to do with control of planets or sovereignty at alleve should remain one single game undivideddust 514 should be an independent console based mmo in the eve universe not part of the current pc based eve mmo in any way
not supported change is coming you should adapt it is stated in the eula that game is subject to change
besides imagine someday we get planetary bombardment in evethe tears of all the 812 year olds the tears dude
that doesnt mean fans should welcome radical changewhat next we should introduce klingons to the world of eve because the eula says it can change please
actually that would be really cool i would rather fly a bird of prey over a t3 ship
this oh god this
the hilarity of that would be epic
swg tried that hows that nge working out for them these daysthey had 300000 subs back in 2004 just like eve does today they proceeded to radically change the game not once but twice in 2005 which led to them having less than 30k left today even though the game is the same age as eve soe and lucasarts have a reputation in the industry somewhere between that of politicians and radioactive wasteradical change in mmorpg games fails every time its tried in fact the nge is such a notorious event that its generally accepted as the industry example of what not to do what to never do the fact that ccp has failed to learn from that lesson is depressing i thought they were the only mmo publisher who got it apparently not
do not support
i think eve and dust is a good combination if done right but they need to make sure that pc players arent left out in the cold if this is going to be a pure console release then i completely agree delink it asap
it has been stated that sovereignty will be decided by multiple factors and we can assume dust 514 will be but one of those it is against your religious beliefs to talk to console players well then do take sovereignty the hard way
i know all about the nge i was on the kettemoor server in fact one of my favorite videos was done by a relative about the ngelook up darth velveeta on you tube the difference between the nge and this is that the actual game play is not going to change in eve ie pvp mechanics for ship to ship combat and such eve players will have the option of either playing dust along with eve to defend their territory or they can hire people from dust to do it totally different from the nge which got rid of most professions turned the game into a point clicky mash mash clicky mash mash and made everyone conform to what soe thought was epic the only thing this affects are alliancescorps who have sov no more no less and we dont know how easy it will be for these mercs to go into a system and attack a planet to me it should be as easy as getting a transport ship past gate camp andor a fleet waiting there to intercept at a planet
not supported lets at least get more info before overreacting shall weinspector please get some rest before you post more cause youre beginning to sound a lot like your namesake as far as intelligence is concerned speaking from experience posting while tired and angryupsetstressed etc is a bad idea you end up alienating people who may have agreed with you and they dont forget it for a while
cautious support i dont want to see years of work destroyed by a bunch of console playing asshats if its part of a multi factor then yes i think im ok with it lets get more info then get the pitchforks and torches
i understand where this is coming from even share much of those fearson the other hand i salute the idea and concept of dusteve if done right
i really hope that my not owning of a console will impact the joy i have in eve im not going to support this or be against it until more details are released however i hope ccp look after their current income stream as i know alot of player corps will be hugely annoyed if sov depends on the skill of a console fps
not supported good thing theyre changing  up
not supported for the following reasons1 industry massive explosion in industry we now supply arms vehicles supplies ferry troops damn i can smell the isk oh the joy2 planetary bombardment and space artillery strikes oh the joy of being paid to respond to calling in strikes3 corporations now span 2 entirely different worlds this would be staggering to think of the possibilities4 eve online in all honesty has been in a increasing state of stagnation now we have something that could blow the doors off now we have something to interact with walking in space stations becomes justified while we the demigods of eve online older players who pay for the privilege of flying in our ships can directly intervine and affect changes on planets where these kids in there little xboxs and ps3s can shoot there brains out its not a half bad idea honestly my clan is really a multigaming one hell id jump at the chance to dig into this5 the chicken littles of eve online unsubbing priceless so yes please protest and emoragequit the damn game can i has your stuff6 and last but not least ccp has been working on this for 3 years i dont care how loud you frakking scream you dont have a snowballs chance in hell of getting them to change there mind the amount of money invested in the project would be staggering so please stfu and drop it before you embarrass yourselfthreadnot supported
signed conditionallyif its going to be a consoleexclusive thats just pure bull and it should have zero effect on eveif its going to be a pc game with a proper pc version not just a hackjob port then im willing to wait and see more detail on the mechanics connecting dust and eve before commenting
omg the tears on all the forums since the announcement is flowing hardget over it there is so many thread of whining and crying and most of them asking questions that were already answered if you actually watched the video and read the interviewall you people all butt hurt over the game being console only is truely pathetic
i wanted to support the op but this made me change my mind bring it on on a serious note i dont think dust 514 will have some capital impact on eve universe its just a marketing trick to sell more dust hmm sell more dust sounds appropriate
i dont have a problem with a separate game influencing or being tied to eve in any way i just dont think that sovereignty should be one of those factors i dont have a problem with it being console specific or anything like that but why sovereigntygranted ccp has stated that dust gameplay is going to be only one of multiple elements contributing to sovereignty but why have it at all why not make the connection something less incredibly impactful upon all current eve players i want to fight for my own space in the eve universe not have to contract it out to someone else who may or may not be terrible at fpssmake the interaction more like you have goods at planet x and need them transported to planet y send in the mercs we spend a lot of time maintaining our space and building its infrastructure to have elements of that ownership skewed by an entirely new independent gamer basenow if it turns out that there are say 5 new ways of achieving sovereignty and holding it in a system and dust is just one of them this will leave 4 other in eve options to claim sovereignty this still would leave the main eve playerbase in true control and planetary fighting would only sway the sovereignty in highly disputed systems if however planetary fighting in dust is the main consideration for sovereignty levels then i just have to ask why sacrifice eve players direct involvement in shaping their space

well i havent seen either but the older one sounds better
i dont think were going to be able to do  about this but ill mention it
the concept is interesting and it will be very interesting to see the implementationthe console is kinda part of the design tooim thinking of the console users as very simple aithey are ants running around being stupid semied squeaker console kids make near perfect ai it might actually be sad if pc users played this side of the gameid feel sorry for any real person that subjected themselves to playing in this audiencewe can all look at console users with disdain making our demigod status as capsuleers reflected in our superiority to people who buy bad computers with bad audience and bad expensive gamesit might actually work 
i appreciate you being willing to bring it up and thats all i ask i certainly understand that for this particular issue the csm likely has very little influencethanks though
in your will can you say that i can have your stuff
ccp should just make their own gaming system and make it capable of using both eves on it p they allready have their own engineers to make advanced systems to support this whole eve universe seemenignless and single shard server etc
signed
any game that can interact with the eve universe must be available to the pc signedjust a speculation here is it possible that the reasion dust isnt being ported is because the features and capabilitys will simply be included in a eve patch
support
agreedfrom this end it appears that ccp is wanting to expand their gaming universe without detrimentally effecting their eve online player basewhy else would they distinctly exclude the pc user from dusttheir programmers cant be that moronic as to be able to program for an xbox and not for a pc or mac
yes pc would be good for people that dont want to buy a 400 console just to play one game
i certainly hope that there will be a version accessible to pc users even if not at initial launch
yuppers
this isnt about lacking anythingits about making your inventory management easier when dealing with hundreds of modulesim in favor of improving the inventory ease of us
in the recent patch ccp decided to put a 2 second delay on scanning you can still click the button repeteadly but it will now only update 2 seconds instead of the normal every time you clickno seriously a delay on scantiming how the hell ya gonna check a 50 au systems different celestials in a inty in the 2 second scantimer delay you will have passed over 30 au yes there is now a scan timer delay  thats messed up i could understand making it a 010 second delay or even 03 but 2 seconds is rediculous for interceptors and the likeedit remember to click support this thread
yep undo please  signed
signed narrowing people out at different belts with the scanner just got a lot harder
this is as dumb as a box of rocks or jester p
agreed in a situation that requires very quick and exact timing to scan down hostiles this change has a drastic negative impact on the playability of the gameplease lower it to 1 seconds
signed even a 01 delay would filter out a lot of spam clicking but 2 seconds is just way too much
signed for a 01
how do you check 50 au in an inty well they have these things called probe launchersno the antilag feature should stay expand the range on directional to solve some of these problems maybe but dont bring back laggy directional spam
probe launcher on an inty good one and scanning down someone to a belt  1 second probing down someone to a belt  placing probes in position  clicking scan would be 3040 seconds depending on how fast you arealso for that reply i would wager you do not actually play the game and scanning hardly has anything to do with lag putting it down to a 01 or 03 delay would evaporate any lag that is currently
confirming yet another ccp fail
yes back to the old setting
agreed this is fin stupidyou didnt even mention the fact that if you jump into system and are trying to narrow a ship in a belt that carebear now has a huge amount more time
gg ccp 
please edit your post and click the support this topic box or it wont be counted signed is useless in assembly hallit is a huge nerf to pvp its the first time that i am really disappointed by this game
agreed ccp making 00 as safe as high sec 1 update at a time
supportindirectional scan was terrible enough already without it nerfing if further
i liked when the devs actually played the game and understod what consequences their nerfs have
brill idea really shows you thought it through but at the end of the day its a numbers game and you can count me against this
agreed ratters just got even safer jump in scan raven on scan narrow it down wait two secs hes in oone of three belts wait 2 secs to narrow it down to eachoh hes safespottedpart of the overall plan to make ratters pretty much fireproof which i thought was against the ideals of the game wheres the risk if people cant scan you down
mehstandard patch day whineathon
you do realize there are other ways to find a ship in a system right even in a safe spot
and probes will get him before he warps to a pos docks or logs rightgood thinking
i dont seem to have problems finding people with them maybe youre doing it wrongthe part about this i find to be very ironic is that before the patch all the mission runners were complaining about how it would make it harder for them to watch out asshats like younow you lot in here ing about how much harder your job isffs  its like a damned kindergarten playground around here this week
mission runner spotted i fully support this
just had a look on evekill and battle clinc of you and your corp thanks for your valuable input do you tutor people i am sure i have lots to learn about pvp from you
why was this change exactly necessary it lowers the killing potential i dislike thatalotninja editto the person below this postdear sirmadamthingby the time i find some one that can teach mangold something besides drunk driving i find that the money is best spend on booze and s thank you
youre welcome for the input its nice to be apprecitaedi do have to forgo the opportunity to offer my tutoring services however since you only seem to judge the worth of people by their killboard aka epeen im not entirely sure the lessons would stick and id hate to waste your money
this thread needs moar ch tbh pccp said in patch notes that this change was being made purely to combat lag which means that any other effects it would have on game play are unintendedclearly this change is effecting more than just lag both carebears and pvpers alike have been compaining about it and for that reason i support the reversal of this change or reducing the delay signifiantly
carebears and pvpers unite repell this evil feature
well there goes plexing in 00

bullcrap you did   however as any pvper of any sort of competence should be in full agreement i guess we do share the same opinion if this is the first step in changing the scanner in such a way as to not require spamming of the scan button or integrating it more fully into the system scanner arrangement then thats a good thing unfortunately the current implementation is awful

i already posted this in the deployment thread guess its good to crosspost herethis is just horrible in my opiniona you cant see people who decloaked for just a few seconds eg when decloaking after jumping in or when they landing at a gate and decloak before they jump out anymore unless your timing is lucky right now it is the job of good scouters to keep spamming scan which results in skill  luck insteadb you cant time many things correctly 2s delay means 6au to 27au someone got closer to you especially in fast roaming gangs  sniping hac gangs its crucial to see how far the enemy is spread out and to get exact information asap 2 seconds are a lot of time therec when hunting people or eg ratters decent scouts keep checking belts they are not warping to midwarp right now it works because there is no delay between scans here again 2s delay in an interceptor is just huge also 14au scan range  27au warp distance within 2 scans doesnt mix too wellif there really has to be a fix for performance issues id suggest a delay which relates to the systems current performence aka a relation to the normal lag you get in systems with more people in them while 2s delay are insane and horrible in a system with 10 people in it they pretty much dont matter in a system with 150 people when its slowly getting laggy anywayalso id suggest if this increases overall performance a delay in highsec but way less or no delay at all in lowsec00
wordsigned
agree
if anything do it for efram the ed rabbit
yep this is a really dumb change
meh
i wrote this in general discussion but its more appropriate for this threadi live in 00 and often times i try to scan down farmers at asteroid belts the best way to do that is to warp to a planet with many belts around it reduce your directional scanner angle to 15 degrees and start pointchecking 120 belts as quickly as possiblethe time it takes to scan 1 belt and aim for the next belt with a scanner is just under a second 1 second tops 2 seconds definitely creates noticeable lag when trying to scan 10 belts this mostly benefits the defender  the farmerbut aside from extra benefit to farmer the main problem here is the high level of annoyance this would create for everyone scanning belts id say this sacrifice is definitely not worth it any slight server performance improvements unless ccp can show us direct evidence that this change helps a lot of people have better game experience or there are many willing who will testify that they have much less lag with the new scanner mechanic  ccp should undo this game change if ccp has any shred of care for the community left enough to put aside their huge ego they will do thiscsm people have the opportunity to do real good to the community unlike most other issues this one is the simplest and offers the greatest benefit for the effort if they can do anything they should resolve this issue

im in
get rid of the delay no 1 second or half second just get rid of it
 scoutinti pilot
signed yup take this off
2 second delay are you 
revert changes signed
signed
signed really bloody annoying now
this is annoying and slows down scouting i can no longer pin point people in belts while im in warp with 2 seconds delay i could of past the entire cluster
supported by many mad piratescaer
i think the best possible compromise between performance and gameplay here would be adjusting directional scanner time depending on the shiptype youre ineg interceptors 2 sec delay battleships the full 2 secondsthis would have a positive impact on scouts as theyd be able to find ratters with a greater degree of success and would make solo ratting in potentially hostile space an altogether more unwise idea as it should be anywaythis would offer up a much more balanced solution to the lag problem and is probably the best possible compromise in this situation
1im out of practice with the directional scanner but im not likely to get back in practice with this nonsense
absolute terrible change it needs to be reverted  sorry ccp
it is now much harder to locate a target quickly on jumping in to a system terrible change
agreed either revert the whole change or set the delay to a fraction of a second  2 seconds is way too long
when cva and uk agree that some feature is bad it must be sosigned
agreed this was a bad idea on ccps part this one needs to be reverted
agree bad nerf 
revert the change signed
this is a horrible changei cant see them not reverting it
agreed bad nerf
this is a bad change signed
reduce it to 1 sec and it will still lighten server workload and still be usefull
this is as much a nerf to solo roaming as removing mwdcloak was lets hope it goes the same way as that did
agreed change the scan delay to 01 second maybe 0304sec absolute maximum2 second scan delay is unacceptable
horrible change please fix
this idea is a stupid one revert itsigned
agreed
yes more boost less nerf

i was just as surprised as the rest of you we have had no contact with ccp about anything yet maybe theyll ask us for some feedback when we actually do the iceland conference who knows
what do you mean how do this help you forget your intelligence augments today or somethingyou just made a very absolute statement that ccp is in charge and i pointed out what has happened in the past when developers ignore the majority of their audience and exert supreme authority over their creative decisionswe cant quite gauge what the majority is just yet as the announcement is only early but should the outcry continue it may very well be against console exclusivity
did you forget to readi suggest you go back and reread what i saidits not that hard to figure out
despite my usual and quite evident disdain for gs in general im quite willing to accept this statement as truth but vel why why accept the word of a vile scamming conniving goonie because i work in software development and you dont tell your customers about new featuresproducts before theyre readywhy is this you may ask we pay for these productsservices and we demand to know well students its so that they dont raise a holy ing storm when your promised release turns into vaporware due to lack of funding or a corporate direction shifttldr quit your ing  ccp is under no obligation to make any announcement to anyone including the csm about any new product until theyre damned good and ready to make it now pull up your big girl panties and stop acting like a bunch of god damned 2 year olds that just had the cat  in your sandboxwarning  meme alertif on the other hand you insist on being a whiny y little girl about the whole thing please choose the meme that best describes your situation1 ur stuff can ai haz it2 this is game3 youre a dumbass  because of falcon4 cool story dumbass
i dont think dust is the issue i think the issue is any potential impact on eve and the way that information is being managedi dont think any of us can say whether dust will be good or bad for eve without more information and ccp is failing to provide thisif dust armies have to travel in vulnerable convoys through hostile space and even when they get to a planet can be bombarded from space that would be a good thing it would force fleet fights to protect invasion forcesif dust armies can just randomly spawn on worlds and take soveriegnity that would be a bad thingits a pity that ccp didnt implement this as a means to capture stations instead of ambulation as about 80 of players had already suggestedfinally if dust and eve are linked then shouldnt it be a single subscriptionim sure there are many more questions and that is the problem there are many question but we are not getting any answers
so instead of having a panic attack and going ape  how about we go back to our internet spaceships and just wait for ccp to give us more information ehbecause all your doing grabs popcorn is feeding me a ton of laughs while you all look like a ton of idiotsx o dshares popcorn with de and hersch and anyone else with brains
the rampant speculation is just hilarious and is going overboard bigtimei brought up dust in local yesterday and people spazzed out start talking about stuff and claiming it as fact saying it was in the press release but it wasnt posted the entire press release to prove them wrong and basically got the answer so in responsesome people are just apt to the deer in the headlights approach to life the dust announcement has highlighted those people bigtimeall i can say is calm down until we know more right now all you whiners are doing is making yourself look like idiots because we have no idea what it will do to the game
ooh popcornom nom nom
i can say the csm was blindsided by this as well there were lengthy discussions in iceland with csm ii about how sov would be changed some sort of pendulum that involved planets was the basic idea presenteddoes that invalidate the csm i dont think so i am sure csm iii will get lots of opportunity to learn more and offer input as to my reaction to the dust 514 announcement i think it is an out of the box idea that was bold for ccp to bet on am i personally happy about it no its not how i would have liked ccp to use its resources but i dont get to make that call here are some of my concerns1 in general successful console titles will be played in numbers dramatically larger than the number of players in eve today what impact will this have on the already overtaxed server infrastructure i have no idea but i could see it adding to the lag we already see2 no mater what anyone says this is ccp removing resources from core eve development as has been pointed out before there are so many broken promises of features that never were delivered or if delivered completed if dust takes off expect even less focus on eve3 console and pc game experiences are fundamentally different consoles are considered a living room experience often with a rl social element pc games are generally considered a solitary deeper experience in terms of where you play the game not the interactions in the game in an mmo ie you sit by yourself at a desk with a keyboard at a monitor not sure how these two experiences will mate in the end as ren once said could be something bad could be something good until dust is out well never know4 it really wont change anything about the balance of power the big alliance will still have the resource advantage to offer more incentives to the console kiddies to do their bidding of course not sure how anything suggested as a change for 00 gets around the fact folks with more resources have an advantage not sure anyone would want a giant set of stellar dice that dole out 00 sov randomly5 finally as a pc gamer i am alarmed anytime i see a company that has created a pc game that i like to play get into the console space pc gaming is in decline as the potential revenues of consoles draws greater and greater numbers of developers off the pc as their primary platform mmos are one of the places pcs have remained a healthy gaming platform now the ccp has tasted the console koolaide can they stay true to we pc usersso i am concerned but i think we still have lots to learn and i am remaining open minded that dust 514 could be something good lets see if csm iii has anything to share when they get back from icelandissler
1 im pretty sure theyre going to buy new servers for dust if it sells a lot of copies theyll buy a lot of servers this is a direct cash influx most of which can go to hardware  i dont anticipate scale problems of that sort 2 not true in any meaningful sense thats like saying that you buying clothing takes resources away from food  sure you could buy more food with that money instead but if youre already eating why would you our dollars arent marked eve only theyre ccps and they can spend some of them expanding the company if they like 3 agreed this is a concern but im not too worried about it at this point 4 largely true though i think that most people are severely underestimating the effect of parallel alliances 5 this is a bit alarmist i think ccp was created to make eve and the white wolf mmo will be pc as well i doubt that their flagship product will be forgotten especially when its still quite profitable
tell me ccpwhat is the logic of not being allowed to transport plexes in your cargo holdwhat possible reasoning do you have behind thisyou come down on the isk farmers you strongly discourage buying from the farmers then you pull this absurdly illogical move to hamper people who are trying to play by your rules in order to earn isk according to your rulesforgive me ccp i dont see where youre coming at with this restriction
i brought up same point many months ago  because i wanted to see plex traffic that pirates could take advantage ofccp replied that you dont need to transfer them because they can be applied to your character from any remote system and they dont want to risk real money items falling into pirate hands cause of some stupid reasons
why do you need to
i use gtcs to make my isk mining bores me to tears and mission ops get old after rescuing that stupid damsel for the umpteenth timewhen ccp had their rage on the isk farmers was when i noticed the price of gtcs drop so a colleague offered to buy them from me in providencecant generate plexes in 00 so i headed to empire spacenow i cant even move themim taking 140mil isk hit just because ccp doesnt want plexes to movegreatnow tell me how to convert them back to a gtc so i can sell it and only take a 40mil isk loss rather than a 140mil loss
op is being more belligerent than the topic deserves but supporting the ability to move plex around if you let scammers have their fun with them why not pirates im proarbitrage
the op so you failed to do your due diligence and research made a bad business decision because of it and its ccps fault right as long as were clear on thatthat aside ive never understood why you cant move a plex i would support the csm aski
if this is true why the whine in the op cant he contract them like everything else and let his collegue activate them remotely why is it necessary to move them im not against making them like normal objects not just seeing why he has so much issue with them the only complaint that seems legit comes from the pirates not getting their chance for tasty plex loot
ccp has previously stated in response to questions about why they are scammable that since they are in game items they can be scammed like in game items why doesnt this apply to moving them toosupported
maybe ccp doesnt want haulers with plexs getting ganked and people getting free game time
back to the head of the class
im still not convinced this buff needs to happen and where are you getting these numbers of 6m sp to be effective as amarr and 2030m to be effective as minmatar from the arguments youve made it just seems like youre downplaying the positives of min and making mountains out of molehills lets get real if youre fighting someone and your even doing as much as 100dps less than them your overall setup is going to matter much more than pure damage output autocannons have amazing tracking and artillery still have their ridiculous alpha i dont know if youve seen jita lately but arty fit tempests are the gankers choice as a final note ill say that i think there are plenty of things any of the four races could whine about changes that have been made over the years how about the fact that the megathron lost its agility bonus and now has a lot more trouble staying in range or that falcons can no longer engage from 150km or that lasers cant track worth a damn this is the biggest problem with eve its become so infested with whiners that ccp gets distracted from fixing glitches and adding cool new content yes your race is at a disadvantage and so is gallente and so is amarr and so is caldarinow quit wasting ccps time
6mil is a pretty good estimate because an amarr player can train up they typical support skills laser skills and armor skills and be reasonably effective in pvp not saying great but i am saying that hes not going to be a slouch either on the flip side a minmatar pilot will have to train those same support skills and armor skills and projectile skills plus drone skills relatively a minmatar pilot needs to get more dps out of his drones than a compareable amarr pilot would have to train plus missile skills and their support skills plus shield skills if you want to fly more than two of the three battleships as well as ecm skills for all four different ewar types especially true for the tempest in essence you have to train for two races just so that a minmatar battleship can be equal for just raw dps on the field and that is saying nothing about projectile weapons themselves as far as the advantages yeah i already stated the realities of the situation and what happened how it affected the tempest etc etcautocannons do not have amazing tracking in fact they come in second to hybrids by 0001 radsec arties have good alpha yes but as i mentioned before and as you seemed to ignore yet again alpha isnt all that any more sure you may be able to one shot cruisers but against a battleship its a different story after the second round of combat the advantage moves from alpha to dps add to that falloff which still again you ignored and the loss of dps that represents then you are stuck doing only 385 of your damage while everyone else is sniping for much greater damagealso your whine about the mega losing its agility has no weight here because the tempest is even less agile than the megathat being said you clearly havent read a friggin thing on these forums or anything else for that matter but if you clearly want to keep pushing this to the top of the forums while we get this matter pushed up to ccp by all means you are more than welcome to do so
megathron was covered alreadyfalcons having that range was over powered and everyone is now happy with the falconlasers track better than arty and can switch ammo instantly so it makes fighting at optimal range really easyanything else we can help you with
sure in order to be 100 effective in evverything their race can do minmatar take more sp than amarr the difference is that minmatar are a much more versatile race if you wanted to train into a maelstrom it would take the same amount of time as an abbaddon the difference is that if you wanted to train into a phoon youd need some new skills to cover its rolei never said they had the best tracking but their tracking combined with their effective range gives them a distinct advantage as for alpha you just admit that they have an amazing advantage over other weapons systems if youre instapopping t1 cruisers youre sure as hell putting a dent into t2 logis before they can broadcast repyes but once a megathron is out of optimal its fcked with a tempest you have quite some time before it really becomes an issueagain no race is the best at everything but every race is the best at something
projectiles need a huge boost thumbs uptill bc shipsize i would agree with you every race seems to have some good ships in every class maybe not amarr t1 frigs i dont know much about those but minmatar bs arent good a whole class and the most important one is far behind in your theoretical situation that 2 players would fight with comparable skills minmatar would lose definitively more likley
you really wanna park your super cap in an array at a pos with all the meta gaming bull if i put all that time into being able to fly one the money into gtcs and skillbooks to get there and the money to properly fit the damned thing i sure wouldntsigned
i support any topic asking for a buff and not a nerf
i would love nothing more than a drone that can tank a belt spawn on its own withought constant armor repping
not supportedyoure not a race that relies heavily on drones
wth does race have to do with drones
still thinking what would be a better change as the hp increase seem to highcaldari e amarr are the shield and armor resist races so maybe an increase in drone resistance for shield caldari and armor amarr while shifting most of the hit point of the drones to shields for caldari and armor to amarrit would require some change in armor hit point recovery too allowing the drones to slowly recover them in the drone bay but it could make them more unique especially if the resistance bonus are different for example 10 exptherm 5 emkin for t1 caldari 10 emkin 5 exptherm for t1 amarr something like this could make people chose between fastmore damagemore resist as after all even if i disagree on the level of change you propose amarr and caldari drones need a buff supported

stop asking for a nerf ask for a buff a way to get more t2 bposmaybe useing bpos to try and invent a t2 bpo with 66 stats so you have to resurch them up to a positive
supported
no giving more t2 bpos are an horrible idea to break the production of t2 items and make it as profitless as t1 productionmaybe what should happend is items not worth inventing being fixed also tune a bit the production times of certain items like ceptors so bpos cant cover the full demand and its fine
not supported how ever it would be nice to have the locator agent also have a background check option where they can give info on alts of the same account ofcourse if someone has more then one account they cant find that accounteditand yes im posting as an alt because for some reason my alt is defalt
not supported but if we get rid of alts we also need to get rid of those pesky main chars as well in fact lets just not have chars to begin with

speeding up industry interface is useless why not get rid of 90 of all clicks by allowing batch install no confirmation on successful invention not having to change range on every invention job or any other of the brain numbing commonsense solutionsstop screwing up things that are good with the game and fix the obviously horrible things please
speeding up industry interface is quite useful  its not my first goal but im glad to have it and if you want industry to be easier to do then make a proper post to that effect not an eve generaltype whine thread
i think having secure containers to be repackable this would make it easier to transport and trade them if we can fold up ships why cant we fold up lockable boxes

ladies and gentlemen of the csm team having just endured the most annoying of wars i propose a change to the war rulesif someone assists a pilot at war eg with remote repairs etc could the message stating that the rrer is going to become a legitimate target be changed to read that this will be for the entirety of said war and not just 15 minutes please consider putting forward this proposalkind regardsdilli
i like this you have become an ally by helping that wt so you should be part of the war now
that would be funny with people repping pilots in fw maybe the npc navies should start attacking them afterwards then aswell 
oh lovely a new exploit i can see it now a cascading wardecreal smart op real smartnot supported duh
i dont understand the reasons behind your flame drac the ally would be a wt not their corp a legitimate target can then be countered at the outset of an engagement pure and simple
you open eg the door for lofty style scam again something we just got rid offcan you rep me quicklyerr why is my corp wardecced nowthanks no
fake war between two corps one of which asks for rr help from randoms in local you can now attack that person forever as long as you keep paying 2 milweek to keep the dec up that is entirely disproportionate
corp a decs bb gets repped by cc is now deced by ac reps ac is now deced by bd e and f decide to greif bthey rep ab is now deced d e fgetting the picture yet
if they got the pictuire they wouldnt have posted this thread and you know ittakes popcorn and throws it at random people
whe i salvage for about 5 hours i have a vast amount of unique items on board the problem is that i have to click and sell each oneif you could select all and sell that would be great
lol
you know what would be greata vetting process for assembly hall threads
good god dosnt ccp nerf things enuff on thier own stop giving them ideas ya noob
the missions are fine as they are for bounty and mission handinmission bonus what needs to be changed is the amount of loot thats dropedas for level 4s being too easy for the isk you generate i dont see you complaining about macro miners so all you really want is for someone to venture into low sec so you can pop their shipand if i rember correctly theres moduals in 00 that sell for billions i dont recall anything droping over 50 million isk in high sec and thats only if you do cosmos missions
missions dont make anywhere near as much money as trading does and you dont even have to undock to do thatthe reality is that it takes a long time to train up to the optimal mission running capability and we are at least still getting shot at if a mission runner gets distracted it can cost them a ship if a miner gets distracted it costs them a few m3 of orethere are plenty of ways to make money most people just like doing missions instead of the alternatives
i think you hare highly underestimating the number of db calls and the amount of data that will be stored to make it work as you suggest it would create a lot of problemsif you really think that the npc bounties are the core problem it is way easier to simply add a modifier to the bounties value based on sec level of the system and agent qualityno need for extra data storage modifier is determined once for all the ship in the mission the modifier can be applied once when the bounties are displayed in wallet so doing 1 operation every 20 minutes to me it seem more straightforward
it has always annoyed me that large station containers and general freight containers can not be taken with you when you move between stations i agree with the fact that industrial ships cant hold a full freight container but there is no reasion that an empty station or freight container cant repackage into a very small size for transport aside from a thin metal shell they are pretty much all empty space inside so my petition in short is make all containers repackage to 100m3 or smaller as well as allowing owners to bypass the audit log waiting period for repacking station containers or remove this alltogether as the feature is a usless annoyance that serves no game ballancing purpose whatsoever
the audit log waiting period is for corporate security  if i leave valuables in a container in a corp hangar and someone steals them i have three weeks to see who they are before they can take the container and run also gfcs can easily be moved in freighters and if you look at the stats on station containers their inside is only 1 as big as their outside  99mm3 of walls doesnt fit in a freighter more seriously theyre npc seeded everywhere and are absurdly cheap why do you care about moving them
ok forget removing the audit log i see what you mean but there is no reasion the owneroperator shouldnt have the option to override the waiting period
just because i am a director with the permissions to access the container doesnt mean i should be able to hide my traces from other directorsthe ceonot supportedas a way out1 name containers dont use date the date is the current date2 contract unused containers to the corp and have someone else accept the contract3 4 weeks later you can repackage the container and then either trash the 19800isk worth container or sell it
why in this day and age is copying something like bookmarks such a pain you can only copy one at a time and god help you if you want to trade themi just spent an arduous session copying all my bookmarks to trade to an alt account only to have them fail to transfercan we please get a fix for something that should be a very simple mechanic
what1 ctrlor shiftclick all bookmarks you want copied2 hold shift drag bookmarks to cargodone
you can copy 5 at a time and copied bookmarks are dead slowyou dont want to have more than 5 in your cargo anywayno issue
supporting the topic as something that needs work  i would love to see transferable or copypasteable or corplevel bookmark tools
the limit is there because mass copying of bms causes some pretty heft client and server lag
yah only ccp would know for sure but that was a problem back when there was an active market for regional bookmark sets 500 in many of the sets there were people who made a living copying bookmarks and putting them up for sale that market is dead now
not before bookmarks get optimized if you have 50 bookmarks in a can it already takes like 4060s to load that can dont want to imagine a few hundred bookmarks hours waiting for your corp hangar to load because a joker thought it would be smart to drop a few hundred bookmarks into itno thanks
bookmarks are server side data copying them cause lag and was used to lag combat and crash the server in the past when it was possible to copy a lot of them at the same time thats why we have limits on coping bookmarks bookmarks are server side to avoid people from creating deep safes outside probe range changing the coordinate of a bookmark
yes this is another introduce new t2 bpos to the game thread but it is also a risk vs reward thread someone pointed out an issue in another thread that i think has potential to add a new dynamic to t2 bpos specificly why would the companies that developed the t2 tech allow thier unlienced designs to be used all over the place answer they probalby would not they would sue or just like real life get the policemilitary involvedso my idea is this introduce new t2 bpos or a way to create them lottery invention side effect alternate invention goal loot drops whatever but make them a restricted material that you can not run around high sec with restrict hisec manufacturing lines to t1 and t2 bpc onlyend result more t2 bpos but people wanting to use them have to venture into the less safe low or null sec in order to profit by them
you do realize that most23 t2 production is made with bpcs already right
you want t2 bpos buy them from current owner where you build them i dont care not supported
yes i am aware of the numbers i do realize that most t2 production is from bpcs and bpc owners generally are the ones setting prices and meeting demandif new bpos started coming in though they would probably end up dominating the market unless some kind of additional penalty were thrown inwhat i do not want is a bpos are isk printing machines i want an isk printing machine too situation i do not want t2 bpos back in because they are better but because they add a richness and variety to production that has some potential for tradeoffs
even with limited knowledge on invention i know this is a fail thread for one main reason invention is far more effective even if its twisted as far as math is concerned than bposso suggesting that you make them contraband is total waste of timethe idea is to improve the situation not make it bloody worse
yes because so many people haul t2bpos around for funjust make it so that you can do invention with a t1 bpo and have a shot at getting a t2 bpo
this thread misses the point entirely illegality is hardly going to be an issue  just build them in place or in 00 or wherever its not hard to haul illegal goods to my understanding this would be a meaningless barrier

thisyou can software exploit an xbox and play on live for freereally they make much better mediacenters then games platforms anywayedit ps3 is just the same but i dont know it as wellto those who think you need to modify the hardware its not the caseconsoles have software software is exploitable once its exploited any access required to upload modified code is possible as for it being banned instantly do you really think there isnt a way around that dbtw the reason i jumped on those comments about ip address is because ive wasted months of my life explaining stuff like cookies are not virus to people because of missinformation like that taking hold

thanks dv d
how about we get a statement from ccp this bull has been in the game for far to long
i have doubts about the concept as a whole but if its gonna happen at least let me bloody play it edit  i fail at ticky boxes
not supported game is not required to play eve its a spinoff with features that can help in eve and completely optional cross platform consolepc fpsing would never work and this game is three years into a console development cycle there are already a ton of pc fpss go play them

dust needs to on the pc alsoyes pc gamers have a up over the xbox ps3 with control so give them a semi aim bot or something to balance this outbut if something is gone interact with eve current eve gamers should also be able to effect it and not be forced to buy a console semi vote for being able to nuke dust players from orbit would be nice to
game boxes are next to obsolete as computers are far more widespred now its a dead end imoi was happy anbd excited about this new thing especially because i am an rts gamer for 15 years now really but i probably wont buy a box just for that game pc i can use for many things console just for 1 game thanx for leaving us loyal customesrs 6 years here out in the coldbtw how do i vote here i guess its related to the hands on the left side
id realy like play dust or at least id like to try it however i will not buy a console for it signed

supported
confirming that the sky is indeed falling and all you chicken littles should continue to run around screaming and waving your hands in the airjesus christ this thread
there is nothing premature about this topic the ceo has said it himselfk what we have been asked by our readers is why only make the game available for console and not for pcccp shooter on a console are different as shooters on the pc we want to concentrate on developing a good console shootersource
note that statement from ccp implies the game will not support mouse and keyboard control not in a way pc fps games do  for sure so even if you can plug in mouse to your ps3 or xbox it will not work as expectedimo any fps not designed to handle mouse and keyboard as primary input is a gimped fpsits like making a car that drives with joystick instead of wheel and pedals it can work but theres something wrong with it and certainly offers less convenient control simply not best design path
i would like for it to be released on the pc but even if not for that case i would support it simply in reaction to the hypocrites who whine about other people who whine
having played fps competitively for  i dont know how freaking long i made the transition to one on the console with the battlefield seriesusing a controller instead of a kybmse combo its really not as bad as some people make it out to be in fact in some instances its actually better
does that make you a hypocriticriti learn a little bit more about the purpose of this forum before you start pointing fingers and calling namesthe reason why this thread is full of fail is because of three things1 polling pc gamers which is what this thread is more or less is generally going to end up with biased results anyways in all likelihood the majority of these people are those misguided individuals who think that spending 5k on a computer that barely outperforms a 1k dollar computer in an area undetectable by the human eye anyways gives them an edge so they did that rather than buy a console and will be paying off their alieneware or equivalent for the next decade2 the morans saying consoles are dead considering that the vast majority of games sold now are sold on consoles reality begs to differ but reality isnt these people strong points anyways so take that for what its worth go to your local gamestop and the pathetic pc section sums it up pretty well for a reason3 the csm is a representative body of the player base not a governing body of ccp so they have no say in this matter anyways half the stuff they recommend to ccp is either rejected or ignored anyways of the other half 14 is crap that is easy enough to fix and the other is generally implemented in some way other than what the player base expected which hasnt always been a good thingtldrwhining about this is like ing about gravity
id say yes except at this point a pc version would be rushed and moreover itd have to come prenerfed otherwise the pc players would slaughter the console tarts like the nubbins they are im sure porting would be a snap what with the xbox being closelyish related to windows but theres no winwin herethe cod analogy doesnt apply as cod console players cant play with cod pc players so its not unlikely both are good relatively speaking so ultimately it does not matter

what if dust will be released for the next gen consoles 2011 or earlier and not for the crappy old ones will we get a new petition for all old xbox and ps3 players 
correct but cod was a pc game activison shifted interest in consoles and al was left was a bad conolepc portthat scares me when i think of eve
indeed
it takes about 10 seconds to reenter your password after a log out you used to be able to switch characters without closing out the client and it was buggy as hell the reason ccp removed it in the first place
i like this idea
yes it takes 10 seconds or less to enter your password but there is also the issue of shutting down the eve client and opening a new version which on slower systems can take a lot of time so to the op thumbs up
sensible suggestion is sensible
omg do want
hell yeah ive been wondering for a while why this is not so to begin withsigned
supported
definitely makes it a lot harder to scan down anything or even to check whats in system while warping around signed
signed
signed
totally signed scanning ruined it is
signed
supporting this because this issue is seriously gamebreaking for me and as im often scouting for targets the delay is just unacceptable as others here have said its about moving the angle around and hitting scan in the direction of different celestial objects quickly prepatch i could get a target ship to 5 degrees within 510 seconds now it can take 20 as the original poster mentioned scanning whilst midwarp is badly affected especially with interceptorsthe bare minimum delay i would be okay with is 03 seconds but i would prefer it lower than that or removed entirelysigned
this is almost as frustrating as the jumpbug maybe moreso since ccp actually intended to do this one
signed
signed
totally unnecessary nerf
can we get some csm members that are supposed to represent us normal players on board with this so we know we arent completely ignored
signed
please reverse this makes scoutingscanning for a target very difficultcera
ccp please dont give free tickets to macro ratters
realise its a problem butwhenever i hear someone frantically clicking scan over ts all i can think about is oh i wonder where the lag comes fromspamming the server with scanning is bad
signed please undo it ccp
the delay is a huge issue any experienced pvper often uses their scanner more often than the current system allowsif you must have it then introduce this delay only in systems with 200 people that way it doesnt contribute to fleet fight lag but wont hinder daytoday pvp and skirmish tactics where it is a deciding factor
yet another solo pvp nerf harder and more annoying to scan down people guess thats fine for the bears and farmers
signed
another fine well thought out and market tested solution for a better gaming experience you make me proudps i really do have a cv in the post
signed i understand that spamming it might stress server too much but 2 seconds is too much time reduce it or better yet remove it
ive been pinpointing targets on the scanner for a long time now and its nothing like the olds days but thats ok times change however this change is too much too harsh this breaks the game experience for alot of peoplesigned
signed
signed
thank you ccp for turning all pvp into station campssigned
supporting this idea
my understanding is that macrosfarmers were setup for spamscanning on a continuous basis basically something new appears on scan  they logoffski therefore causing excessive levels of server use and lag a hint might be that graph in the unholy rage explanation a few days ago showing significantly less server stress with the removal of those macrofarmer accounts as they were perhaps generating server use above and beyond the typical real playeras well as the patch note announcing it which says this has been done due to performance concerns and exploits
2 seconds is far too long 1 second or better 05 second delay would still reduce lagsupporting definitely a bad change
signed this is an awful change
agreed roll this back please the idea is atrocious both in concept and implementation
this is a nerf to both pirates and carebears please revert
i just submitted a petition about a broken scanner that just gives an error now and no results only to find that was a deliberate patch changeget serious if this was to prevent lag in fleets yknow what i just dont care more people means lag will occur however breaking gameplay in an attempt to fix it is edsigned
signed ffs
signed please revert the changes
major problem please undo even postin with my main for this
seriously ccpnone of us want 00 any safer than it already is this is just a ridiculous idea and needs to be reversed if you want to reduce lag get rid of local
seriously undohonestly this is ridiculousthey can make or break the chances of getting into warp and getting that target pointed those 2 seconds can be the time you hit it on a 5 degree begin your warp sequence and get on top of that target before he warps out there vitali am not just whineing im making a valid argument here i have gone out today and i have killed a few things using the scanner in its new form and the 2 second delay has had some affect on the efficencythose 2 seconds are vital for a minor performance increase i think the choice of change was badly chosen look elsewhere rollback to the orginal system
i have 17 million isk can i help fix the scannerid be perfectly happy with a 12 sec delay but 2 seconds is a bit excessiveedited for ty word choice
supported and reasoning posted in feedback threadstupid stupid change which really frustrates people who know how to use the scanner to hunt roll back this change
quite honestly the worst change to happen to the game in the past 2 years makes it even worse they dont bother to explain any of the rationale outside of the blanket server performance bsplease undo it or post something serious explaining why it got nerfed the way it did as in pretty graphics and charts
your nerfs they are terrible
good call reverse this
signed
friggin unfair changehere is the reason they nerfed itpeople who were decloaking after gate transit were showing up on scanner before they were showing up on overview this was causing people to gain a lock before the target showed up and created a lot of sad people and a lot of petitionswhat they did wrongthey nerfed the directional scanner instead of providing a solution to the problemhow to fix itprovide a protective amount of time that targets will not show up on scanner in the area of 05 to 1 second so that people cannot use the scanner to get a faster lock on targets this is a direct nerf to the directional scanner and it affects the game everywhere not just on gates
urgh
agreed 
terrible terrible changereal pvpers will post in this thread
signedthe delay and the automatic refresh when changing the angle is frustrating
signed
i lag enough that it already takes more than 2 seconds between scan cycles that doesnt keep me from scanning people down and killing themseriously if you cant adapt to a 2 second delay thats kinda pathetic really
agree too much delay lets carebears slip away
checking a belt cluster with 14 belts previously took me about 10 seconds now it takes almost three times as long
rather have lag reverse please

op dscan range is 143 auif you scan constantly flying in a 135 aus interceptor then you will have crossed 27 au per dscangiven that youre scanning 143 au in every direction every 2 seconds you still scan every single bit of space that you did before

a nerf to pvpers probably brought upon us by scan button spamming carebears that is just wrong
signed
you have obviously never used your scanner or at least not in an efficient way like most pvpers do i think we are all aware that ccp is making efforts to improve the servers and noone is blaming them for that what were all saying here is that this 2 seconds delay is just way too much and badly screws up the directional scanner several solutions have been suggested hopefully ccp will reconsider this

signed
signedshade threads is best threads
signedi hate the delay  but am slowly adapting to itthe most annoying thing is the damn popup right in the middle of the screen  if that could be replaced with the button being greyed out with a timer like that of the probe scanning mechanic then the two second delay may become bearableperhaps instead of this implementation there could be another something like a computer processor percentage bar for your scanner like overloading modules  if you overuse the scanner ie constantly spam it for too long while say  idk macro mining in a belt it renders it unuseable for a long period of time 3040seconds maybe even a minute maybe you even have to dock up and repair it or have some nanite paste handyit could have a quick cool down period if you havent overloaded the scanner cpu unit but a long one if you havethis could potentially allow a scout warping around to use the scanner quickly for a while until the pilot leaves warp and has to start actually piloting his ship  clicking buttons other than the scan button  allowing it to cool down with this in place an active miner in a belt who isnt macro mining and actually watching local can use the scanner in the same way as a scout to avoid being caught however a macro would not be able to constantly spam the scanner without actually breaking itencourages active play from both hunter and gatherer  penalizes macro playersthoughts
agreedthis nerfs the game for anyone who ever played it properly if this does not nerf you then you are doing it wrongi cannot help but feel that some devs need to sit down and actually look at the way the people who really care about this game actually play instead of how the majority of highsec missionrunners feel i really dont understand why anyone would pay monthly to grind in order to make money to buy gear to grind more efficiently go play wow
this might actually be the best idea ive read in a long timeps make a cooler cyno effect more like the old one thats totally a game changing nerf for me p
lame ccp really fing lame
signed
hey i like the idea  although i think the prepatch scanner system was just fine i trust ccp if theyre saying that the scanner has to be changed in order to improve the performance and your suggestion is a good solution to that plus it adds an interesting dimension to the scanning without completely screwing it up like it is nowlets hope ccp will even read this 
dohsupport
5 of a second would barely noticeable 1 second would be just about bearable 2 seconds is a gigantic pain when trying to scan down a target quicklyalternativelythis person may be onto something here linking the rescan delay to the scan resolution of the players ship and perhaps making the scanners results marginally delayed according to the target ships sig radius too might be a way of salvaging this

hurr threadnaught ill bring it up at the next meeting due to database issues ccp are unlikely to change it back the way it was however ill push for a change to a 05 or 10 second at most timer takes me about that long to adjust my angles cause im pretty pro like that i certainly agree that 2 seconds is currently far to long
signedid sign it again but theres probably a 2sec delay and an error messageand it should be noted that these are the two most common ship classes used for scouting and scanning
some interesting ideas in this thread  especially the one tying scandelay to shipclasses  but overall a reduction to 05sec or even 1sec would also be sufficienttherefore signed

terrible implementation of a terrible idea half a second is reasonable two is not and give some feedback when we can use the scanner again like graying out the button the pop up message is terrible
strongly supported this isnt an issue of nerfing any one particular playstyle or group its a significant blow to one of the most useful generalpurpose tools in the game a delay of 05 seconds would have my support as it would stop the server lag from scanner spam without significantly delaying the use of the scanner for scouting and targetted information gathering
signed
signed this is krepedit the pop up is beyond moronic btw
signed

srsly if there was an issue or exploit with using directional ccp should focus to fix it and not whacking a hammer on games funcionality like this therfore reducing pvp options in gameit was already goddam hard to scan ratter in belt and tons of way to avoid beeing catched like local  wcs  beeing in system with belts outside scanrange from gates  etc etc and even with old system it was impossible to catch ratter even in inty when ratter hited warp just after you enter local this change brings it to the point of absurd does ccp really wants to limit pvp options to blob warfare vel pos and gatecamps
2 secs is too much  especially when in warp or narrowing the scanner angle on target and refixing the loc but adhd spanking of scanner can go out of the window also get rid of that damn onscreenlongerthandelaytime warning message  thats the biggest pita with current scanner messif the reason for the tyfix for the exploit of using scanner to lock decloaking ships faster at gates and causing use adhdspanking of scanner due to that maybe the fix would be to get overview working better instead of just hammering dirscanner to all crap

item corporation level wardecs can be freely shed in empire by joiningleaving an alliancesolution when a corporation departs an alliance any wardec against the alliance is carried onto the corporation and lasts for its natural duration these leftover wardecs do not count towards wardec costs for other wardecsthoughts using an alliance to shed wardecs was previously classified as an exploit by ccp but i think they didnt want to take the time to enforce it and thus reclassified it as not being one later this now means that any corporation can shed empire wardecs within 48 hours simply by joiningleaving an alliance and getting the added bonus of increased wardec cost both against the original target and against the alliance for the attackerthis is even more dodgy when used to protect empire pos example  lets say you wardec my corporation to attack a highsec pos i own ok you reinforce the pos so it will come out of reinforced 15 days from now i now go ahead and have my corp leave the alliance 24 hrs later it is untargetable and you were not able to declare a new wardec against me because you still had the leftover one from before that was expiring when you finally can rewardec my corp my pos will have already come out of reinforced and been fully repped ready for me to simply rejoin my alliance and repeat the processthe attackers only real workaround here is to use secondary corps with prevoted wardec proposals ready to be dropped on the defending corp the moment it hits the leave button on its alliance now this corp can join the attacking alliance you were an alliance werent you sorry if youre a corp you have no recourse at all and share its wardec with that alliance thats a huge amount of extra work cost and rules juggling to accomplish what should have been simple in the first place you wanted to wardec a corp and kill it for a week which is exactly what a wardec is supposed to pay for make it do exactly that
fully support this1
supportedwhen you pay to declare war on an alliance for a week you are paying to declare war on all the corporations in an alliance for a week if they leave the alliance after war has been declared they should be subject to the same week of warthe current mechanic makes no sense anyone who knows what theyre doing can make their highsec pos invulnerable by continuously joiningleaving alliances if you want to defend your highsec pos during a wardec either deathstar it which is already op enough in highsec or take it down for the duration of the wardecthis is a very big issue for anyone pvping in empire and i hope that the csm gives it high priority
last i heard this was a petitionable offense if abusedi suggest you explore that route
nope we already petitioned and they said it was legal even though they have a dev blog about it being illegal
ill quote a petition of mine when i get home but no this is no longer considered an exploit
thats consistencyweve had similar discussions about this before corphopping etc to avoid war decs  id frankly like to see the entire war dec mechanic overhauled to be more functionali think it should be possible to withdraw from a war surrending or what have you but it should involve some kind of sacrifice aside from just making a new corp or leaving the one youre inheres an idea  alliance a war decs alliance b corp c leaves alliance b to dodge war decwar dec follows c and they gain a new free war dec from b for being deserters now everyone from a and b can shoot themmeh it may be my meds talking im really not feeling well today
that could be fun  though it reminds me a bit to much of the lofty scam i have the feeling someone would find a way to abuse it
u mad
i was fine until you posted 
theres already a solution to this wardec the corp that left the alliance if you want to blow up ships so badly whats a few million moredont support it
have had experience of thissince tower reinforce can last two days corporations may easily save their towers with the current 24 hour wardecs
from the opplease read the arguments put forward before dismissing them
and in the time it takes you to wardec them theyve joined and left another alliance thus invalidating your wardec and making their pos invulnerable they can do this as often as the please costing the wardeccing corp significant amounts of isk and precious timedont get me wrong if this mechanic wasnt being utterly abused in its current state id have no problem with it but for now high sec poses are invincible to those who know how to bend the rules

1 of course some of it depends on how things are constructed  if for example you had every dust player in one place at one time youd make a puddle out of googles server farm but were spreading them over 50000 planets which is a problem that lends itself neatly to parallelization much as id love to see the games closely linkedeg orbital bombardment i dont expect it so the players can be on entirely new selfcontained servers instead of adding to the eve ones that do tend to suffer from everybody in one place at one time issues add to that the fact that everything will be split into sectors and i dont expect much problem making the servers parallel enough to handle a population bigger than eves if the game is a success any more than blizzard has a problem running a game 30x our size 2 care to elaborate we pay ccp for a service and they provide it what they do with their profits is their business  we dont have any claim to the money we pay them past whats in the eula yes there were fewer eve developers than there theoretically could have been but i dont see why we have any right to get annoyed by that its not our money anymore 5 oh i lament the decline of the pc as a gaming platform too and consider consoles to be generally inferior my preferred genrestrategy is still fairly pccentric but the idea of playing a fps with a controller still feels like gimping yourself intentionally im just not worried that ccp will forget eve even if other developers forget their pc roots and im totally going to use that last bit if i run next time just so you know

perhaps but it seems a bit crazy that its ok to gank a hauler with billions on board which can be sold and plex brought rather than just getting the plex in the first place shrugshould be transportable imo too
of all the weird things ccp does i have to say i think this restriction is a fairly reasonable one if plexes become transportable noobs will be bringing them to jita in their ibis and when they get ganked it will result in numerous albeit unjustified petitions and complaints to ccp which will do nothing but slow the process down for those with legitimate problemsmuch fun as it would be to pop a badger mark i full of the things it would cause more problems than its worth
as far as i see it ccp is just trying to prevent legal issuesright now a plex can only change hands if the owner sells it he may sell it at a bad price but he still has to sell itif plex could get stolen things might get rather messy because plex are a direct transfer of real world money sure you can rob people of billions worth of assets but those assets have no direct connection to hard currency indirect in some cases but never direct since money cannot be directly translated into items or isk plex have a direct hard currency connection always that may also be the reasy why even a multimillion isk ship can be trashed but plex cant be trashed they can only be sold traded or used
i too am a matar pilot and since i recently got a few mil sp in shield tanking as much as i love the temp it has no use to me mael it isnow when i first started playing eve i was told that matar ships were the equivalent of the largest engine you can find strap a cockpit and some guns and there is your ship duct tape and all i dont see that while like many people here have stated very clearly that the frigs and cruisers are truly kick ass i can say that i feel the bs class of matar is also lacking i thought one of the ideas of matar ships was versatility yes it isnt an all out dps ship and if the initial idea was to give them more speed and agility why cant we keep thatmaybe make its base speed closer to 150ms or even 175ms allowing it to have true and distinct tactics over dps based ships slap on a ab or mwd and allow it to be the kiting ship that it once was i for one feel that if the speed was significantly faster than the other bss while the dps is lower it has a player required tactic that can bring it back into existencewith the alpha strike issue that i see others posting just a stupid idea here but increase the time between shots and seriously ramp the damage make it the hard hitting tho slow firing ship that arty was best known for maybe only on the 1400s and keep the 1200s faster firing obviouslybut back to basics and as someone earlier has posted let the races have their distinct advantages over the other races i am just thinking bring speed and tracking to matar bs ships so that the hit  vs other races decreases make the pilot have to use evasive maneuvers rather than fly straight towards the enemy with blasters blazing or just sit and tank with changing of crystals for optimaljust some ideas that stick to what the descriptions of matar ships advertise anything some love somewhere please
go back to lala land tortugan youve obviously never flown an mitari battleshp in pvp or for that sake in pve the best and only good thing i can say about minmatar is we rock vs angels and amarr suks
do you not understand my point if minmatar were top dog in battleships theyd have everything in the bag as it stands minmatar are the kings of subbs pvp sleipnir hurricane vagabond rupture etc isnt enough for you yes minmatar bs are weaker overall than other races of perectly equal skills but for 2 reasons it doesnt matter1 its not a significant enough disadvantage to offset the difference in a wellfit maelstrom versus an average fit hyperion or other tier 3 bs2 even if the disadvantage is significant in the bs class its not as significant as the advantage minnies have over just about every other classyet againevery race is good at something but no race is good at everythingget it yetif you dont like minmatar ships crosstrain into a mage and cancel your subscription your asking for petty changes here and there that dont make a difference in the swing of things the devs whod be responsible for making unneccessary tweaks like these could be working on making dust 514 something awesome or finally redoing the ui or finishing ambulation
since the speednerf and other changes minmatar isnt the king of subbs sized warfare anymore minmatar is good but far away from being king like i already said any race has some good ships and some bad ships in every class but bs sized minmatarships like the bs themself or marauders are utterly crap compared with amarr or caldarithe buff is badly needed and only because you arent minmatar doesnt mean its unnecessaryi accept your point of view but the time minmatar being the fotm of subbs sized ships is over and the bs disatvantage is not only significant its huge
the problem with this is that speed and agility are not the dominant factors in bs fights damage and tank are the dominant factors and minmatar lack both hell you can get more close range dps on a maelstrom by mounting blasters and largely better dps with pulses if you can keep your rangesomething it cant do against its gallente counterpart because gasp the maelstrom isnt the fastest tier 3 bsthe maelstrom is a ship that cant win anything but a one on one fight because it either has to get in under pulses tracking range or stay outside of a hyperions blaster range even then it depends entirely on what range that fight starts at and not any capability of the maestrom itself all things being equal it would succeed in neither before it dies simply because it would be outrun by a hyperion so it cant outrange it and it would have to traverse a likely 10km gap while webbed which would take too longnow that we have that covered think about how speed and agility effect arty it has horrible tracking so they actually make arty worsethe lower levels of it function perfectly well but large projectiles are just freaking broken hell reduce the sig resolution of large projectiles to about 350 and it would function pretty well because the increased accuracy would boost make up for its short falls and then it could effectively fight in falloff
you definitely shouldnt have to have a parking alt to continue to enjoy the game after youve gotten one of these floating coffins of funsigned alot cause i want an aeon but wont do it if moraguth cant ever fly his other ships 
first of all you can train any race drones for any character so having drones of diff types is coolbesides everyone knows amarr are already atop the food chain with their long range high damage lasers
a boost to make them a viable option would be nice theyre just useless atm
this seems to be a well thought out suggestionit gets my support
only if they nerf err balance amarr battleships in line with all other races herschel
i fail to see the relevance this has to anything in this threadon a different note supported
its got everything to do with it dribble not only do you have the best tank range and dps now you want the best drones well hopefully you wont get it but if you cry loud enough and since the devs love amarr im guessing you will
anyone can use anyones drones im trying to balance drones here not battleships if you want my opinion on battleships look at the turret rebalance thread from a couple weeks ago where i specifically talked about boosting blasters and autocannons because pulses are too good thing is an attempt to make amarr drones marginally usablebecause thats all theyd be has nothing to do with that so im limiting my discussion here to the drones also ive been playing long enough that the phrase the devs love amarr is incredibly funny to me i think that might be the first time ive ever seen it used nonironically
theres three game loopholes that are easy to fix and have been mentioned but never addressed id like to see ccp get on the ball and get these crossed offitem selfdestruct should generate killmails according to the npc killmail generation rulessolution this should use the exact same mechanic that is currently being used when an npc gets the final blow on a ship kill the lossmail is generated normally and sent to the dead players corp the killmail is sent to the last other player to aggress this ship before it diedthoughts killmails are a permanent log of ship destruction within the game theyre a great source of history and enjoyed by many players right now the only way to dodge one of these is to selfdestruct unfortunately selfdestruct is actually pretty trivial to do any time youre flying a heavily tanked ship as the enemy did not bring obscenely excessive firepower this is particularly true for capital shipsthis problem was further aggravated by the addition of heat now any ship that is going to selfdestruct can overheat all its defensive modules to gain additional lifespan yes the attackers can overheat their modules too but remember that they arent going to be dead at the end of it so thats just extra cost for them to do so at all large ships successfully tackled and killed by smaller ones is something eve should revel in as it shows tactics  bulk dont continue to spit on these engagements
note that this topic has a lengthy thread when posted in the feature forum a fair while back too you can read that here

item ships that have been actively aggressed within the last 15 minutes should not dissapear from spacesolution logoff timer reset when a ship is aggressed so that if youre actively being aggressed no 15 minute logoff occursthoughts with giant fleet fights becoming more and more common the quick solution to a losing capital battle is to through your fleet into siege mode turn your reppers on and log sure youll lose a few ships but eves frequent struggles to deal with large battles odds are you wont lose that many and most of your fleet will get offscrew that if people want to retreat from a battle then use ingame means to do so if a ship has aggressed you within the last 15 minutes then your ship should still be there if you dc or desync in the middle of a battle then log back on and keep playing though i think youll find an awful lot of people claiming those excuses are really just trying to save face for a ship they are looking for an out of game way to save
supported if its extended to all ships
like hell ccp will just simply accept that considering there is no possible way to track whether the log off is legitimate or a disconnectionand no im not going to entertain it or educate you because i already have in other threads look it up on your own time
correct me if im wrong ive been lucky enough not to have to deal with loggofskisif a player jumps into a camp then logs off from cloak but gets tackled before warping off he then sits there for 1 minute before disappearing magicallyif a player jumps into a camp decloaks gets tackled and then logs off he now has 15 minutes before magically disappearingit makes sense to me that in scenario 2 if hes being shot at his 15 minute timer stays at 15 minutes until he is no longer being shot at and only then does it start counting down if that is what your proposing then you have my support
you are responsible for your internet connection not ccp and not your opponent if you feel youve made an indisputable counter argument feel free to link itpoint has already been raised by larkonis however would like to see the proposed measures extended to include the suggestions in the op
oh ok so your responsible for the internet connection breakage when some joe shmo trips over the damn backbone in his backhoe and disconnects you so you lose your multibillion isk ship and then you scream at ccp with a petitionnot as easy as you thought it was ehhence why ccp has not made a move to change any of the current mechanics
logging off to save capital fleets is simply ridicilous
ill support it if it only applies to capitals and t2t3 ships 
what does this even mean pa prerequisite for participating in an mmorpg is that you have a working internet connection breaks in connection is an inherent risk that you accept from your ispi couldnt care less if youre in a noob ship or a titan principle remains the same reagardlessdisconnection due to server issues should obviously be petitionable
so basicly the timer starts when a ship is first agressed but continuing to agress a ship has no effectin such case supported

not everyone lives in uk  sweden and has a flawless connectioni have often to connect with usb internet keys and theres no way in hell i can prove to ccp it was a disconnect and not a logoffski that made me lose the ship the same mechanic applies to pve btwother evenings the network backbone ccp are using lags horribly and disconnects 50 times a day another time no player can prove maybe send 10 pages of traceroute why he disconnectedin other countries there are still the older technology isps usually you only have 1 available in your town and pay 60 euros a month for a crap connection who book dynamic ips and force disconnect every 12 hours and you cant reconnect before 2030 seconds say the ship bye byealso what about the many who suffer from the socket closed issue dev tagged 38 pages long big thread in the issues  workarounds forum since 2008 and the issue is still not goneso for 1 that cheats his way off your killboard once a week you are going to penalize the hundreds who disconnect daily
disconnect  just log back in if your internet connection sucks which it doesnt for most people i dunno where you get the swedenuk idea from then thats your problem tbhif a ship is being shot at it shouldnt just disappear because you log out
sucks is quite of a freeform concept when using mobile its easy to be disconnected while the receiver adjusts from hdspa to umts and then back and it takes up to 30 seconds per switch often bouncing 23 switches per adjustment
cant say ive ever seen the abuse you mention but if thats happening then this mechanic deserves to be looked into
seriously when you get disconnected from server its a pain having to warp in and see your drones die as you slow boat it to pick them upccp should make a recover drone feature like there is for probes so when you warp back in you click recover drones and they return at normal speed to drone bay to stop it being abused make it so once selected the drones must return to the drone bay before they can be used again and also that no drones can be recovered whilst you have active drones in space so that way you cannot keep resending new drones to say attack and then disconnecting and recovering them while sending drones back out you can only recover drones when you have none active in space
just out of interest how is that gonna get done drones unless theyre fighter class cant warp probes can warp w
id say you have to be on the grid with the drones just like you do today it just saves you the trouble of having to fly around scooping them back upsupported
yeah thatll be cool
strongly supported
just good oldfashioned common sense
im not going to support as i enjoy stealing peoples drones when they leave em behindhowever i think you should be able to tractor your own drones you have a greater chance of saving them after a warp outdisconnect and you still have a chance to losing em to someone elses scoop
im not sure the ops suggestion would prevent someone else on grid from scooping them in any case while i support the idea i agree that they should remain scoopable by other people so long as they are not being directly controlled at that time
supported if they are within your drone control range otherwise this could be abused by warping back to a beltplanet at 100km or further and recovering drones in relative safety after a fightps op needs to stop stealing my cans in his rookie ship outside 44 
the way i read his proposal was youd get on grid and recover drones and they would reconnect thus no longer scoopable by a third partywhile i do not do lvl 4 missions with t2 heaviessentries because of the risk of disconnect i still would rather have uncontrolled drones just be tractorablejust my opinion
making them tractorable by the owner would definately be a plus no need to add a crapload of code just to recover a few drones

current policyi lose a ship to a glitchexploitetc and petition it should ccp decide to reimburse my ship i get my ship back minus any dropped items issueccp will not reimburse dropped items because theyd have to do it one of two ways1 duplicate the dropped items and return them to your hangar which would be too easily exploitable i kill a friend with expensive mods on his ship using an exploit he gets his ship reimbursed and i keep whatever mods drop2 trace the actual items and reverse any related transactionsexchanges to return the items to your hangar in other words random guy loots my wreck and sells my mods to another guy that guy then has them on his ship ccp would take them off his ship reverse the transaction and notify all involved partiesproposed solutiontake advantage of option 2 for only losses worth over 50 million isk this way ccp dont get bogged down with having to retrace random item drops but it allows players experiencing a significant loss to get a reasonable reimbursementive lost the same megathron navy issue twice now once to a concord glitch and once to a gm detonating 70 shuttles outside jita 44 in the middle of a 4 on 13 fight causing me to desynch and log back in in station in a new pod both times my ships were reimbursed but both times i lost 100m worth of dropped lootcsm please consider raising this proposal to ccp
negatory i do not want random mods disappearing off of my ship because of thier historical involvementsnor do i want random money dissapearing from my wallet possibly putting it into the red because i sold an item someone lost
a reasonable argument however ccp already has this policy when dealing with isk that originated from an illegal source in other words if an illegal isk buyer buys your items and gets caught ccp will remove the money from your wallet and depending on your involvement with the isk buyer give your item back seems logical to me that exploits  glitches should fall under the same general category as illegal gameplay
if its an exploit that implies that the killer did something wrong im for reversing the transactions and if they go isk so be it if its a game bug i dont think that reversal is a viable option somebody has to get shafted by the exploit  either the guy who spent money assuming he had earned large sums off the drop or the guy who lost a lot on the drop  and i dont see a pressing reason why we have to reimburse the latter at the expense of the former its no more just and itd take up a lot of gm time
i think it is a good idea pending there is a cap to how many runs you can have at maxalso make the number of decryptors required to invent on the bpc proportionate to the number of runs compared to the standard max ie if 10 runs was standard max and you had merged it to 50 then it would require 5 decryptors instead of 1
in that case big stamp of supported
since carriers were too versatile capital module sizes were changed from 1000m3 to 4000m3 to prevent carriers from carrying all viable fits with themnow that the carriers own cargo bay has been ruthlessly trimmed any chance we can get cap modules dropped in size a bit not necessarily back to 1000m3 but maybe 2000m3not sure if im overlooking something obvious the corporate hangar is still 10k of course but 3k fuel bay isnt exactly a lot and i know that for field ops i used a good chunk of my corporate hangar for fuel too

ok i dont know if this impacts other towers as i only run gallente  shadow towers right now about 34 months ago i think ccp did something to improve the looks of them however that was bugged causing the towers to flip flop all over the screen distort into odd shapes taking over the entire screen and to generally make the game very laggy when at a tower you can do stuff there you just have to use your overview exclusively cause often you cannot see anything on the screen doesnt happen to every tower though just about 1 in 3 or 4 and it sometimes impacts a tower sometimes doesntnow i didnt read 100 of everything in regards to this bug and ccps response but from what friends who were following it said with the patch we were got yesterday it was supposed to be fixed well it isnt nobody seams to know why it isnt  so i figured i would ask here cause i know csm is supposed to track these things any word

just thinking out loud i guess but hear me outthe scanner nerf has a lot of people upset since faster ships are now at a terrible disadvantage when using it as they fly well past their scan range in the 2 seconds it takes to repeat a scan how about allowing some ships eg the ones used mostly for scouting like interceptors and covops to vary their warp speed a bit not down to freighter speeds or anything but maybe from 2550 to 100 of max too slow would allow them to essentially hide in big systems by warping 100au at 01ausec but allowing an interceptorcovops to warp slower while performing system sweeps would give them back some more utility in the face of the scanner nerfthoughts
why a workaround if they can just fix the scanning bug
its not a bug though its intentional
they really need to fix warp acceleration before this could have any effect whatsoever
if youre changing surrounding mechanics to fix this interaction id prefer to increase directional range away from itsobviousccpusedasignedint km to something longer this change just feels a little too narrow and confusing
i was wondering for those pilots out there that are in small corps 10 and under and lone pilots if ccp is ever going to come up with a small alliance version i mean if i could afford a billion isk i would totaly be in a proteus or a kronos right now as it stands i can afford what i can afford i go through doing missions do the occasional wormhole and so forth  but if ccp could come up with say a collaborative skill that could bring together 5 or less corporations with fewer than a total of 50 pilots no corp being greater than 10 pilots it would be easier to put up pos and maybe even brave 00 space although ultimately we would be prey to those bigger alliances  but we could run lvl 5s and so forth  just throwing it out there
you can set each other blue already and just work togetherand if you got 5 corps its 200m for eachso if each corp has 10m members its 20m per member voila suddenly an alliance is cheap
alliances dont make it easier to exist in 00 space they do about three things1 give you access to sovereignty mechanics2 let you share some types of pos lab slotmepe with allies3 change wardecs from 2 mildecweek max 3 to 50 mildecweek no maxother than that theyre just a chat channel and a mailing list from the sounds of it you dont need any of those things you want an alliance set standings to the other corps and start a chat channel its not like youll actually be taking sov with 50 guys who cant sc up a spare billion

im concerned that this is a break from the promise ccp has made to its player base that all game updates and new content would be freei also take a very skeptical stand on the response that not by much the fact of the matter is that target area coding for consoles fps simply opens the targetable area larger than the pc by implementing to varying degree auto targeting on some console games its overt a setting that a player can toggle on other game its simply hardcoded and adjusted along with difficulty settings if at all this is done to compensate for the gross control those tiny joystick provide to players of consoleswhatever the true reason ie money console game development is simply cheaper now to those that beleive that there is any other superiority the console game have over pc becouse of the miriade of configuration let me say you dont know what your talking about there is no pc programmer that writes his code be it game or buisness to hardware unless his companny sells the specific hardware thats why pc game players know to keep the latest drivers updated becouse programmers write to the latest standar drivers not to hardware another thing to consider is that all games ps3 xbox wii are written first on a pc in an emulator runtime enviroment so consoles will always be behind the curve for speed and graphics power than pcssomeone mention thiswe have all be awaiting encarna the ambulation upgrade i hope this is not an admittance of defeat for ccp to actually implement what they have hyped for so long on the other hand this would be great if our veterans could interacting with the new player base providing them with the capabilities to be transported to planets were the fps game style could make a difference in holdinggaining systems just imagine what influence a ship captain can hold on the goings on of ground warfare even if its simply the vehicle to introduce more resources into a battlefieldproviding and transporting weapons men and ground vehicles could be a nice business it could also create a real smuggling sub profession as well soveranty would only be affected were we that hold space chose to allow andor bring forth the grownd component my imagination explodes with possibilities but nothing will be even possible if they dont begin with the first step
why do people keep talking about transporting troops cant see how that fits in at all no console user is going to wait at a loading screen while a player freighter moves them into positionthere is a difference between console and pc shooters gta4 on console features autotargetting gta4 on pc uses the mouse and you can get 100 headshots with ease halo on the console uses the joysticks very well and gives finegrained control in a way that becomes an extension of the player halo on pc havent tried it but likely works quite well the style of halo should lend itself to a mouseso there are different methods and some crossover better then othersim just really starting to think if were going to have bottomfeeding subcapsuleer mindless plebs then they may as well be kids playing on consoles makes it good for roleplay and immersion when the pleps are considered just that in rl as well as game

i agree with most of the original post but wanted to add something concerning this bitthere are enough online gamers that dual box games especially in a game of the intensity that i expect dust to have that the idea of someone running vent on their pc or laptop even though they are playing on the console will not be entirely uncommon this should be especially true for the leader types among the ground pounders frankly those are probably the only ones youll want in your vent server anyway
i think it will be like thisdefensive space forces have to matter waiting on the xbox while being transported would not be popular no matter how good the shipboard casinoi think we will have to transport and install some sort of device on the planet which will open the ability for dusters to teleport in i think this process will have to require enough time and effort that it wont be super easy to slip in and open an invasion before the defenders can do something about it mere conjecture at this point of course
you think throwing isk at them is the only influence you could have sounds like giving up without firing a shot at the mere rumor that an enemy exists out there somewherethe one clip released so far makes it pretty clear that the space and ground combat systems will influence each other it is not merely the ground determining the fate of sovereigntieswithout details one must speculate as to the form of space combat incfluencing ground combat but there are only a few options really1 troop transport i think you can right this off as being conducive an an unreasonably boring console game but there is an analog to troop transport that would still fit the same strategic role without the tediumwhy not make ships transport and install a device that enables the ability of invaders to teleport in make the process time consuming enough that defensive space forces have a realistic chance to react and prevent the invasion altogether doesnt this actually sound like fun space battles with more at stake than the mere destruction of the other sides ships2 ground support i would not be surprised of some sort of orbital bombardment is present that again is a way for eve players to have a significant impact on the fate of the planet instead of just hiring more mercs3 logistics troops should require supplies and should have some sort of penalty if not being supplied this should be easier for the system defender hopefully4 anything the offensive fleet has to accomplish to pull off a successful invasion is something the defending fleet can interfere withinstead of condemning something that we know next to nothing about how about keeping an open mind and looking at how this might add some very fun elements for the eve players then of course there is the aspect of profitability the better ccp does the longer this game sticks around and the more effort that can be dumped into enhancing it

scan nerf is unneccesary ccp just wants carebears and isk buyers to get away comfortably in their macro ravens and minersccp why are your priorities so ed up seriously do something right
if there has to be timer make it 05 sec that prevents scanning and will be way manageable for real use
i fully support to move back to the old scanner system before the patch i hadnt thought it would be that bad but damn 2 seconds are long
2 seconds is too long especially since it seems a premature click resets the timer for another 2 seconds without actually producing any scan result
i dont approve of the changes introduced in crypa 15
this is why ccp recently banned over 9000 isk farmer accounts recently from what im aware the change came about due to these people causing a load on the server by constantly spamming their scanners and whatnot
15 pages took most of downtime to read lots of experienced players in here make me believe this is more than just the whine dujourhowever calling people carebear macroer farmer etc doesnt help make your point the style of game play you prefer doesnt make your account any more valuable than anyone elses asking for changes reflecting the way you play where you live or the ship you fly does not represent any kind of balance ignoring the fact that 2 seconds scan does not leave gaps in the brief time that any ship is at top warp speed doesnt help the case eitherok so throwing those posts out to me this is another heavyhanded workaround that should have been dealt with differently theres many other ways the exploit could have been dealt with as pointed out in several posts a whole overhaul of the scanner could have reduced lag while eliminating the server load caused by constant spamming of scanthis quick fix only made the deficiencies of the onboard scanner stand out more than before put an autotimer on it greyed out while unavailable stop the autoscan when you change degree setting try a onesecond delay combined with a proper fix of the scanner should make the game playable for every stylebad fix is not good ill signedit to click support

no this was implemented because of excessive server calls when people click scan as fast as they can i think there simply needs to be a new mechanicor reduce the timer to 1 second the whole idea is that you cant scan as fast as you can click maybe 2 seconds is excessive but doing away with the scan timer entirely probably wont happen
supported
i could accept some delay but 2 sec is an eternity when trying to catch someone by the time you enter local your target is already aliging to a safespot or celestial if not cloaking any delay in scanning means the chance he gets away is that much more likely
supported i still miss the red moon rising scanner with the directional window in it that was the best

i dont mind the scan delay much however thanks to this people are gonna keep localchat even closer localchat should go away imo but with the current scan system that is not possiblesecond is the way they did the delay instead of masking out the scan button for two sec you can still click the button and a message appears and i got the feeling that everytime i click the button within the 2 seconds that it counts as a new scan and the message gets updated while the effect does not result is that my 3rd or 4th scan works but i still see the messageif they could just darken the button and make it unclickable for the two seconds then it is fine to me

supported the war dec should stay with the original entity and not be shed like a snake skin when you join  leave an alliance 24hrs later
presently there is a loophole that some corporations are using to avoid wars that have been declared on them as soon as a war has been declared on the corporation they join an alliance and once admitted they immediately leave the alliance again the result is that they are only involved in an active war for 24 hours and not a week as should be the case according to normal war gameplay mechanics bogus alliances have even been created for the sole purpose of giving corps a way out of wars this is an unintended game mechanic and it will be fixed as soon as possible until then we are putting a stop to this situation and anyone found abusing this loophole will receive a warning for their trouble repeated offenses of this nature may also result in a ban ccp now states the following from a recent petitionhi senior gm xxxxx here please accept our apologies for the delay in responding back to your petition the issue that you were reporting here to us within this petition is not considered an exploit given it is how the game mechanics currently function within the game this may be somewhat against the spirit of eve and we assure that we will have this brought up with our game design team to see if they wish to take this mechanic under review we apologize for the time it has taken to respond to this and hope that the final decision presented to you here will be to your satisfaction if you have any further questions or concerns then please do not hesitate to ask best regards senior gm xxxxxxeve online customer support team and followed up with by thisthank you for your update the news update from january 2008 is no longer applicable as it was sent out in response to another issue which was declared an exploit at the time that was later resolved the current issue is simply a factor of the current game mechanics and will only be altered with changes made to those mechanics best way to voice your concerns with those mechanics is to make yourself heard through the eve online forums as stated we have informed the game developers of the concerns expressed to us through the petition system and that is unfortunately all that we can do at this time best regards senior gm xxxxxx eve online customer support team signed again

beside thedont post gm replies rulecan you post the question you madefrom the sound of those replies i have a doubt your petition was unclear about the exploit used from what i know leaving a wardecced corporation in allowed joining a alliance when wardecced and then leaving giving the wardec to the alliance and shedding it from the corporation was declared an exploit and never undeclared as such if really that was changed and it is not an effect of miscommunication yes the ruling must me changed

the original petition which i submitted wasgiven i also linked the post ccp said doing such actions were an exploit i found it quite humorous that they now choose it to be normal game play mechanics

fully agreed withthe natural progression of skills is good frigates  destroyer  cruiser  battlecruiser  battleship  carrier  dread  momsthen you need alot more training to get into a titan with the olyimpian its a stopgap between caps and supercaps the whole capital fleet needs looking at carriers  dreads  supercaps t2 modules are needed t2 ships are needed and definitely a ship designed to take out capital ships when are the caps gonna get a looking at ccp
bumping an important topicalso i think that after spanning over 40 pages last thread and this one and over 1k player support replies ccp should take 10 minutes to post a gmdev response however much ccp would like to keep the status quo i will not allow this issue to be swept under the rug  this is a real part of the service we pay for as players as much as we pay for the hardware and the dev teams we deserve a working support system and we deserve a reply to this thread even if it is a plain acknowledgement that the issue at hand is being reviewedi think ccp is mistakenly believing that this issue is not important enough and that we will forget about it in a month or so  i say they are wrong and that paying customers will demand the full service they are paying for so what will it be ccp  will you ignore us again lock this thread or maybe grow some balls and face the issue even if its to say that you wont change the system
yes
i personally like this dont list modsships that are at full health better but anything that makes that nightmare a bit easier will do atm i use reppers in space cuz its less hassle than using the station rep service
loophole forum banitem player character has been banned from forum use for a length of time for inappropriate forum activity player character creates a new account with a similar or dissimilar name to continue to using the forums when player character has been bannedexample longfellow tortia was banned from the forums for 6 months he has created a new character named longfellow tort1a and one named sloppy he then uses the forums as if he is not banned he is in my opinion violating his ban by doing this just because he creates a new character with a similar or disimilar name does not mean that he should be allowed to use the forums solution your ban in my opinion should be based on your internal ip address otherwise the person banned will be able to create multiple secondary characters and use the forums circumventing the banthoughts with all of the negativity in the eveonline forums i feel it is paramount that we eliminate those who want nothing but to troll and flame others for their enjoyment allowing people to use this loophole by being able to create other toons and access the forums while they are banned is in my opinion exploiting the ruling
i support the idea that a forum ban should be a forum ban but the fact is its easy to get around got an ip ban its not hard to get a new one got an account banned its not hard to get a new oneafaik though correct me if im wrong when you get banned from the forums your account is banned not just one character on your account this means that people who are getting around forum bans have an entirely different account they are paying 15 a month forif there was an easy solution id support it but i think ccp would have already implemented it if there it did exist
your solution is sadly not workable at all many provider do regularly changing dynamic ip addressesi fear there is no way to achieve what you want
and lets not even get into one larkonis trassier  id like to rip on the guy for it but its actually sort of necessary for csm stuff should he be banned from doing the job he was elected to do its not an easy question
sure ban by ip address1 aol user  most aol users1 saudi  all saudis1 chinese  all chineseyou can not ban by ip many people on many networks share their public ip with others
moderation makes it worsewith overmoderation you end up with a forum full of yesmen they all have the same opinions and all suck up to the moderators as teachers petsovermoderation destroys communities creating an environment where only those who agree are allowed to talk and all others are hectored until they leave or do something to get themselves banned
i fully endorse this it is terrible that a person can pay for multiple accounts and when one of them is banned due to internets stalkers reporting any of his posts for possible infractions he is simply able to switch to another ip banning seems like a good idea a small price to pay that some innocents are affected for the greater good of the forums
seems like a good plan supported
you seemed to have supported this by accidentits cool though an easy mistake
its true larkonis is a cool guynot supported
u madnot supported
counterproposal give us a proper ignore function so that we can decide for ourselves who we want to ban from our screens
this and people that got a forum ban should not be able to run for csm and be kicked out if they get a ban during their termnothing personal to larkonis and darius thoughcsms just should have exemplary behaviour just like youre not allowed to run for politician if you have a criminal record
because this games aim is clearly to form model moral citizens bad behaviour is simply never allowed
edit nvm  i forgot members of the troll squad shouldnt be treated as if they were actually saying anything
so you think that player representation should be subject to the whims of forum mods thats like firing my mp because he got a speeding ticket
this is a mockery of justice the feelings of 12 year olds and people who act like 12 year olds is important
have you ever podded anyoneoh ok yourre firedwell you said anyone with a criminal recordand podding people is breaking concord law in a senseanyone get my point yethell why stop there pirates tooplease use head before you speak

i fully support this post product andor serviceninja editi totally agree real life politicians would never break the law oh bill clinton dodged the draft and committed perjury hmm that new york mayor was into prostitution and ted kennedy killed someone and got away with it then got elected to forty some odd years of the senate what a mockery of justice
i use two pc in different locations to play eve one has a static ip the other a dynamic oneso if i get banned what ip will be banned ccp should ban a range of ip in a university town because i have been banned your example guy almost certainly used a different email address to create the new account so ccp has no way to know if he is a alt without checking credit card data if he use a credit card your suggestion is inapplicable at most you can report the player in your example to the moderators
can we at least please hurry up and ban bbbb45 the guy whose been posting those stupid keylogger  links if you look at the forum index hes posted the last topic in just about every forum i vote for more active moderators hes not exactly being subtle
hmm i got this strange feeling creeping up the back of my neck that someone tries to abuse the assembly hall forum as a weapon in a personal feudlooking over the thread a bit further it seems that another person jumps on the train as well no offense bud a lot of people would have tried i guess
have you seen his threads hes repeatedly posted links to keyloggerridden  sites in every subforum
wat i wasnt talking about you
oh
i realize coming up with decent ideas is hard for you but you really do need to stop posting all your horrible ideas on these forums
supporting this as well this blatant abuse of the system must stop
wikipedia did it to quatar or however that one is spelled some kid at school was modding pages with dumb content and a mod caught and banned him the whole country runs though a super nat
just wanted to complain about unfair forum bans
my bad was talking about isler dainze heh no worries i was seriously confused there for a minute thoughi was like then i was likeno hard feelings
nope i stand by my statement your both rightand your both wrong
yeah we understand your point the problem is that making a rifter good which ties for first with the amarr punisher not dominates the class same with the t1 cruiser rupture which ties with thorax so it doesnt dominate that class either same with the hurricane which is dominated by the drake for defense and ties with the myrm for offense again doesnt dominate same with hacs vagabond is second to the ishtar in fact the only class that one could say that minmatar dominates is the field command ship class with one ship the sleipnir so you are telling me that because we get one really good ship and some decent t1 ships that we get the shaft on the most important ship class in evei personally wouldnt mind if the minmatar battleship class didnt do well in the amarr style or gallente style or the caldari style but the problem is that the current minmatar style really sucks for battleship class so much so that even with a massive difference in sp it still cannot compare against every opposing ship class the tempest has no advantages none the maelstrom has a bit but only in short battles and the typhoon is only useful after an ungodly amount sp to even have a prayer of using it to any effectmy favorite part of your comment is the part that says we are looking for petty changes in the game that wont make a difference in the game exactly they are small changes and they will not make a major affect to the overall game its exactly what we want a small change to make minmatar bses more viable not make them overpowered let them do what they are meant to donow that being said if somehow with the dust 514 interact the tempest and other minmatar battleships do ground assaults best well i might call that good
so youre admitting that its a waste of ccps time to make the changes youre requesting
you really dont like to read do youno i said that making minmatar battleships viable again would be a minor fix and not break the game
just like the original falcon nerf which led to a falcon buff which led to a falcon nerf my point is that its not a major problem and would be a waste of ccps time its not easy to get a small change right the first time when that small change effects hundreds of thousands of people i feel the same way about this as i do about assault frigates getting a 4th bonus sure it would make things coherent but it would be a hell of a lot more trouble than its worthas i said if you really have that much of a problem with minmatar cross train quit eve or stfu already
edit you almost got me there this is what the forum is for mate if you cant figure that out well tough for you
the forum is for bringing up important matters to the csm to present to ccp not bull sht whines from people who cba to actually fly their ships theyd rather complain about them until ccp does something which will inevitably overbuff minmatar causing all the whiners of the other 3 races to unite and make even more work for ccpyouve said yourself this isnt an issue worth writing home about why dont we let ccp deal with real issues first like the current glitch where you can get randomly concorded in highsec or having to log out and back in after a war dec goes live for wartargets to show up in your overview or any number of other legitimate issues that theyve had to put off for ages in order to attempt apparently unsuccessfully to silence the whinersquit whining quit trying to divert ccp from real issues and a above alllearn to fly
balance is one of the most important things in an mmo it actual doesnt pay off to spent sp in minmatar bs rather then amarr even if you have already skilled cruisers to 4 or 5 and projectiles to medium t2 its a waste of time because you have to crosstrain sooner or later too catch up in lvl 4s for iskshour and in pvp for nearly everythingit may be only minor changes with only a small effect for the game but with a huge impact on minmatar pilots i love to fly the vargur but im crosstraining the paladin because the vargur is useless against all other factions then angels compared with the paladindo you want only one faction easy to balance no waste of time if you dont balance them and make one uber and the others not as good it will end like only one faction is played sooner or laterthis is why we need balance even in the most improtant class 
so now you are recognizing that whining will get stuff done yeah well as i said i love it when you post here because you have yet to read any facts present anything related to facts to counter what we said post the lame learn how to fly junk that every minmatar for the past twothree years has learned to ignore as the clueless talk that it isand guess whatbalance is an important part of the game and again learn to frikkin read you have yet to read any single one of my simple answers correctly not one maybe english isnt your first language i dunno i dont care what i said was that this was a minor issue one that could be easily solved without breaking the game what part of that are you not getting what part of you thinks that because its minor its not important did vagabonds sneak off with your carebear cnr while you werent looking did zulupark put something in your wheaties for breakfast this morning we have put fact tactics configurations graphs analysis of every possible strength and every possible weakness here and made them available for you and ccp to read which strangely enough neither of you appear to have made the effort weve looked weve tested weve fought in the tempest typhoon and maelstrom weve compared fact and figures and you well youve done nothing you havent said anything enlightening except im tortugan i know more than you well you have yet to prove even one thing you are no better than ccp and their well it feels balanced viewpoint if you want to have ccp to have them look at the issues you mentioned then you place them in this forum and you keep pushing themso keep on posting here tortugan keep on pushing this wonderful topic to the top eventually someone at ccp will take a look at it and eventually after alot of constant pressure maybe theyll do something
or maybe youll get bored and find a new game to complain about d
hehe maybebut i wouldnt bet on it
you do know that anyone can use any type of drone with just the regular skills right the ships that do have drone bonuses or a very large drone capacity can freely use any kind right now boosting em drones wont make amarr ships better since nothings stopping them from just using the best type from another racesupported as a caldari  minmatar pilot as the amarr drone designs look kinda neat and some kind of reason to use them would be good
supported amarr drones are just too weak in almost every situation when compared to other types

full support make amarr the drones for lazy people p
definitely not the fact that youre trying to boost amarr drones and not gallente or caldari or minmatar i understand what you mean but currently amarr need no buffing not even their drones somebody has to have the worst drones we might as well leave caldari in the dust by boosting the hp by a factor of 4 rightyoud get some disgustingly high hp on some of those dronesedit 4k armor8k structureis this what you mean
i use em drones all the time and i think theyre just fine
im assuming since youre in carebear stare youre probably using them for pvp right given their damage type and damage modifier their only use is against shield tankers with an em hole the problem is that on a ship with 0 em resist youll usually have 20 thermal resist so even if they dont plug their em hole and just omnitank youre better off using ogres for the bigger damage mod the only time ive found amarr droens useful is when my target has specifically tanked for everything but em ok other than curator iis 
exactly so for popping caldari ships running guristas missions they work pretty great and can be useful in many antishield tank applications especially if combined with a neut

thumbs up here for surepermanent record of all ships destroyed should be kept mails with only npcs can be exempt from killboards but still should generate a lossmail for the player  players corp where applicable
yes please
self destructing should definatly generate killmails self destructing to make sure your enemy doesnt get your loot is one thing but to deny a killmail is silly
signed if they did this for the npc losses i dont see why selfdestruct shouldnt give a mail aswell
right now its called a kill mail not a selfdestruct because you are made of fail mailif you want a kill mail make sure you bring whats needed to get one if you start generating killmails via selfdestruct then you might as well remove the whole mechanic selfdestructing has other uses as well1 denying your enemy intel2 denying your enemy a morale boost3 very tasty tears to fuel some towers4 denying your enemy any lootyou want a kill mail kill something other than that you can always just copy paste thisyou killed a leviatan u r fing awesome gratz you win eveps epeen
i concur additionally ive always been an avid nerf killmails camp guydont buff themkillmails are seriously a massive breech in intel i would be content to know that a kill took place and said parties where involved but no specific statsthis is one of the reasons i refuse to postbuypublish a kill board its just stupid waving of epeensyes i wont deny the value of data for intel for enemies or ship reimbursement programs but it is wholly a waste of time and nothing but epeen strokingim not stupid enough to think ccp will ever hear me out on that one but im entitled to my opinion flame awayim just not into that sort of thing if i wanted to see what was fitted ill slap a damn ship scanner on my ship thats what its for isntif i want to deny you intelligence by self destructing well screw you pal  o pits my choice and right
the intel argument is reasonable would you be willing to compromise in generating self destruct killmails that dont show what modules were fit that way we still get to stroke our epeens but you get the satisfaction of knowing that your enemies wont know about that officer coprocessor on your moa d

erm  the hundreds who disconnect daily wouldnt be penalized if they werent in a combat situation if youre not being aggressed you disappear as usual after a couple seconds if youre in a fight and you disconnectlog off to clear lag then obviously youre logging back on so this change wouldnt negatively affect you in any way whatsoever what this does affect is the ability of people to  out and log off ships to avoid being killed

this is purely running away when you shouldnt be able to youve committed to the fight but it isnt going your way so you do thisand of course this would apply to all ships cap ships do it cause they have plenty more chances to survive a dread in siege combined with lag can hold alot of time

if you cant read and fully comprehend my question then why are you trolling
to me its a matter of balance in the large fleetfightsa have 1100 guys disconnect and maybe lose their cap to crappy internet connectionb allow 100 guys to log off and get 80 caps out via exploita is the lesser evil in my opinioni would also like the change suggested for smallscale pvp its quite common for all these shiny navyravens golems etc in 00 to jump into your gang  logoff if you have a hacgang they die if you have a frigate gang or just 56 people they dissappear full support for pvp pve is a different theme
this i heartily disagree with since it would overly penalize any legitimate disconnects i do agree with the ops idea of resetting the timer however
for counter resets would this apply to rats though i can see some people pitching a fit about my shiny hulk got hulk smashed by some little gurista frig due to a dc or whatever and it had me scrammed at the time
put a small active tank on it just sayin
it has long struck me as unusual that in a hypercapitalistic economy like eves manufacturing  research costs at npc stations are completely static everything else is allowed to fluctuate due to supply  demand even office rental costs yet even the most indemand factories dont charge a premium for their servicesfixing this oversight would help to disperse market hubs increase manufacturing costs to a nontrivial isk sink and could even make lowsec potentially useful

im unsure about this the ability to reconnect when within drone control range let alone recovering contact with drones from anywhere in the solar system would be a big buff to dronescorrect me if im wrong likely but wouldnt this be useful in battle suppose i die if its a fleet battle and if my abandoned drones were not hunted down and if i come back quickly then i not only get my drones back but they reactivate in position and ready to attack clever new tactics might be possible eg a sniper warping from one side of the battle to the other waking up different sets of previously deployed droneswhile the above might be kind of nifty i doubt very much that ccp would go for it its work and i can imagine that it might marginally increase lagbeing able to tractor your own drones is a much better idea
this single t2 bpo only one manufacturing slot argument is bull anyone reading it knows it you can make multiple max run copies and be making 30 runs using alternate characters and each copy will have the same mepe as the original if you are indeed only using the original for a single factory slot youre being silly due to the much better mepe on your t2 bpo you can manufacture that item at far less cost than the inventor of the same item who uses a t2 bpc
and now please check the stats how long it takes to make a max run copy of a t2 bpo to help you a bit it is insanely long compared to eg copying t1
and even t1 copying takes about 5x as long as producing the same number of runs by straight manufacture
supportedremoval would level the playing field on t2 research and manufacture true many t2 bpo owners will take a loss on their investment they wont be the first or last to lose profit to an act of god and have been aware of the possibility of their removal since the end of the lottery such a small number of people controlling even 8 of the cov ops cloak market via the existence of a mechanic unavailable to the majority is a mockery of eves much lauded player controlled market let alone the much higher figures seen for other productsim a firm believer that opportunities should be equal and that skill and dedication should be what sorts the wheat from the chaff
no go to another market and stop crying
im currently involved in neither invention or t2 manufacture im a margin trader pure and simple i go where the money is my opinions on this matter are driven by my beliefs regarding good game design and equality amongst players if there were an effectively indestructible combat item that provided a clear pvp advantage while being unobtainable by the majority of players there would be uproar and its removal would be almost unanimously agreed i dont see why competition between players in another format shouldnt be held to the same standardthough i must say your fine logic and wit are very convincing
poss are not the problem with sov warfarethe problem is that the reinforcement timer system designed to allow the poss owners to show up and fight back does not actually encourage fighting back because during the 151 hours the pos is in reinforced theres zero reason at all for either side to do more than check how long it will be until the timer expires at that point a simple comparison operation occurs and whoever has the bigger fleet assembled moves in and deals with the pos as they wish the basic idea of adding some level of arbitrary delay into the process for killing a pos is not necessarily a bad idea though in a game with a global playerbase it is necessary even lest geographically clustered alliances wake up one morning to find all their holdings destroyedno the problem centers around that 151 hour time period of enforced inactivityfortunately the fix is relatively simple and nondisruptive to the current game enviornment  give alliances missions to complete for the duration of the reinforced timer and have the results of these missions affect the state of the tower upon its exit from reinforced mode as a result either the attackers or the defenders will have an advantage compared to the current system when the pos exists reinforced examples would be increasingdecreasing shield resists or tower pg but there are a wide range of buffsdebuffs that could be applied to the pos as a result of these missions while its in reinforced modeof course there will necessarily be a careful balancing act to make sure that the buffs are large enough to impact the results of any fight upon the poss exit from reinforced mode without making them so large as to negate the usual postreinforcement fights completely while this proposal could be applied directly to existing sovholding towers i think it blends nicely with the planetary xl pos idea as this leaves all current mechanics unaffected and allows for balancing to be done without mucking up any of the pos located in lowsec or highsec spacereally though this proposal applies regardless of whether the sovclaiming method continues to be pos or not any sovclaiming mechanism is going to need a builtin delay to allow defenders to show up and fight back the key is to make the delay stage of contesting sov into an active instead of a passive period doing nothing but waiting for a timer to count down for up to two days simply isnt any fun
your idea makes this a wholly complex situation that is already painful enough as it isi get what your saying and theres some rationality behind it but even i cant support thissorry  o 
ep1c idea i never liked my 10 alts anyway lets comitt genocidew
first find out why people are using alts then if its possible make sure they can do that in 1 character without any penatly and you got my vote on thisin some cases i know people use alts for mining and another one for hauling fix that problem so that i dont have to haul 300 times per cycle and its going to probably workother cases are scouts mhhhh maybe sending a drone in a jump so you can look on the other side for a couple of seconds then this should workif you find a fix or quick turn around for this then you got my vote
i am an alt and i support this advertisement
am i the only one getting fked of about this yet another patch and still no sound i looked at the csm issue discussion page etc and didnt see audio or sound anywherei admit my web and forum searching skill is at lvl 1 but for such a serious issue it shouldnt be that hard to findthe only thing i can hear is a rather loud annoying hum when i switch on invun fieldsnow and then various random sounds pop in and outbut thats iti find it absolutely ridiculous that such an important aspect of any game should be neglected so badly ccp should be apologising to all players and working round the clock to solve iti mean its the sound ffs its like only having half a gamei just cannot fathom why this isnt everyones top prioritywill this ever be resolved  is there some other thread i can go whine in 
sound engine woesnew dev blog audio in eve onlineeven before csm3 had the chance to approach ccp in regard to the 1st link above ccp took the belated preemptive approach of establishing the audio dev blog ie 2nd linksometimes a google search or eve search will provide better results for whats in the forums once you obtain your results there you can return to the official forums with them
thanks for the effort matebut im not buying itthe dev blog is nothing but rhetorical claptrap about striving to improve etcthe new audio engine was installed in q1 2009its now almost q4 and a major patch later and still nothingbut reading the dev blog you would think they were only having a few minor issueswhy arent csm throwing their shoes at ccp 
because the csm doesnt control ccp why does everyone think this the csm brings up issues that ccp doesnt know about ccp does know about the sound issues and are striving to fix them just because they dont fix them right now doesnt mean they arent it could be problems harder to fix than you realize furthermore will you calm the crap down geez get your panties in a wad why dont you its just a game for crying out loudisaac
i dont think anyone thinks csm controls ccp nor did i say anything like thatcsm represents the players to ccp but at the last ccpcsm meeting i could find in april 2009 absolutely no mention of audio anywherebeing a fanboi you probably only glanced at the dev blog and instantly assumed ccp are doing a wonderful jobhowever if you care to actually read it it says and i quote some mixing errors like turrets fading to fastseems pretty evident that ccp dont know anything about the current sound issues to me being as there is no sound at all
its my understanding that additional changes to eve sound will be implemented soonUFFFD perhaps its because ccp is comprised of mostly westerners who wouldnt understand the insult of such an action and would rather exchange locker room banter amongst each other as to who was the best at dodging shoes so a question remains that is if ccp has preempted csm3s sound inquiry by creating a dev blog what information should csm3 strive to aquire by approaching ccp with the sound woes wiki item as for me since the popping and clicking issues seem to have been resolved i would appreciate some elaboration on the statement the argument of having the sounds stay with the ship regardless of camera position has never been part of the plan however its an interesting idea and we have started looking at this idea from different angles  we will post some ideas here later i would guess that is your interest also mr robbyx ultimately the challenge is for ccp to make eve audio immersive aranis nax from the new dev blog audio in eve online post 40 the sound was somewhat immersive prior to apocrypha as you or one of your alts might remember you are likely correct in your findings however you didnt try the google thing yet did you otherwise you would have found this issue sound engine  sound bugs which is a result of what you discovered and that is a lack of concern regarding the sound issues by the csm csm3 recognized the importance of the issue an voted unanimously to bring it to the attention of ccp csm chairman dierdra vaal saw the issue as being of high enough importance that he took it upon himself to wikify it without even being asked the issue is to be presented at the next csmccp meeting it wouldnt hurt to show your support of that happening by giving a thumbs up in that threadok someone else please be last
i suggest you read all of the 15 patch notes they fixed the current sound problems if you still are noticing problems file a bug report dont post a whine in assembly hall

are you sure that it was there mistakewhich glitch was thisi hear a lot of people blaming the weirdest things for shipsno offense but most people make alot of human errors when it comes to losing thingshell id might be really upset if i lost a multibillion isk to a glitchbut then i may be denying myself the reality that it was my screw up that did it
prolly the glitch where the gm popped his friends nightmare as well via detonating shuttles etc
i definitely see where youre coming from a lot of people petition for dumb reasons but the fact is if ccp is reimbursing your ship they should be reimbursing the whole thing not just part of itas for my specific losses one was to overwhelming server side lag causing a handful of desynchs induced by a gm detonating about 70 shuttles in the middle of a fight where we were already fighting with the odds against us losing all control over your ship in a combat situation like that is never funthe other loss was due to a concord glitch essentiallya takes from bs canb shoots aa docks upa comes back out over 15 minutes later after bs aggro expires and takes cs canc shoots and kills a and b shows up on as lossmailbecause bs aggro has expired and hes on the km he gets concorded it is a definite glitch a s the system obviously wasnt meant to work that waybut again regardless of whether it was a legitimate loss or not if ccp makes the determination that it needs to be reimbursed it should be reimbursed in full
if you lose something because a gm does something stupid like blowing up 70 shuttles then you should definitely be reimbursed by ccpim kinda surprised to hear about this i wasnt aware gms got to do stuff like that
specifically what happened was some idiot in an orca not the gm undocked and jettisoned 70 or so minmatar shuttles outside jita 44 we started fighting knowing they were there and the lag wasnt too bad the problem was that a gm saw the strain on the server decided that the shuttles needed to go to alleviate said strain in the long run it definitely helped but for about 5 minutes after he detonated them there was a huge lag spike which i dont think he planned for and caused us to lose all control over our ships couldnt deagress couldnt switch targets couldnt move etcim not that angry at the gm for messing up everyones human but its frustrating that i lose 100m worth of mods due his mistake
fair enough and i can sympathize but the mechanics of the system will prevent you from achieving your goaltracing back would cause massive slow downs in petitioning which is a system seriously frakked over as it is generating duplicates or even giving isk would also cause a major problem with exploitsthis is a classic damned if you do and damned if you dont problem

yep
not much to say here apart from yes
good idea
another cathegory  wormhole based
i like the idea im supporting on the general principle but i bet recruiting will go mainly on cosmos when it arrives personally id like to see some more in depth indexing of corps allowing someone to search by faction alliance corp population and selfdefined roles say i could search for a specifically gallente industrial corps with a minimum of 30 members that is currently in an alliance and see a list of all corps matching my parameters come up along with recruiting information and threadsthere are some other eve sites that do this but its all voluntary and requires that the corp has had someone create a profile on that site and keeps it updated
posting in a waa it isnt fair other people have more money thread

definatly supported although as well as the fix i would also like to see a true tii destroyer the intradictors are more specialized tactical ships than tii frigate killerson a side note i forgot to add earlier destroyers are one of a very few ships that are equiped for large scale salvage operations to fit in with that role more i would also like to see a massive boost in tractor beam range and speed targeting range and a reduction in activation cost for salvaging modules

i agree with the op fully but also like your idea about being able to waive your loot rights it is pretty common that i am mining in and area where i leave behind a bunch of npc wrecks that i have no intention of picking upid just as soon give them to someone else or even just open them to all comers
your reply would make more sense if the looter were at least in the original victims corp or possibly even alliancethe complaint here is that a unrelated 3rd party is able to safely steal from a wreck to which he clearly has no right at all

i think the most probable solution to the waiting around thing that most people seem concerned with because lets face it if they are not having fun we lose people to fight for our sovereignty is having some sort of installation to allow the troops to warp in meanwhile we feed them with supplies and suchi am all for this idea actually but as i have stated in the past i believe it is folley to connect it to something as important as sovereignty the issue of console exclusivity does not put nearly as bad a taste in my mouth as that doeswith this being said i think we need to ask our csm representatives to get more answers for us and quicki am very concerned with the removal albeit a potentially small portion of direct influence over sovereignty and i would like to know just what eve pilots roles are going to be in the process i think that this linking of worlds to be a great piece of the puzzle in relation to the sovereignty problem but i think now that we have digested the initial news we need to know what the exact role of the eve player is going to be

2 seconds is ridiculous as someone who frequently uses the dscanner to get a general location on mission runners before dropping probes ill often find someone on 60 degree then set to 30 degrees and scan abovebelowleftright of the initial 60 degree scan for me that comes out to 5 legit scans within 2 seconds now i need to spend 12 seconds instead of 2 each time i narrow my scan range 18090 9060 6030 3015 plus finding distance this really adds up when trying to find ships not at a warpable object and even though the time isnt all that much in the grand scheme of things it makes scanning feel very tedious its just bad gameplay design there are much better solutions than a flat 2 second delay in between scans maybe something like no more than 5 scans in 10 seconds or even reducing the delay to 5tldr versionthere are plenty of legit non spamming reasons to use the scanner more frequently than once per 2 seconds change it back or if its really necessary to limit scanning to reduce server load any of the many other suggestions of other ways to implement the scan delay are better than the current form
signed
signedi support the removal of the very camp 2 second delay
its clear that both the carebears and the pvprs think this change is the worst thing since bootinihow about you reduce eve lag by reducing local spam in jita or any other system that has 500 something people in them
1 for this is ed make it 01 or the way it was
2 seconds its not nice but i can survive i will still play evewhat does annoy me is the goddamn log message its a spam reversal instead of me spamming the server with scans they are spamming me with logs it makes it difficult to notice the newly refreshed scan results too and i have to work harder and pay attention i dont like working harder if ccp insist on having a delay time perhaps make the scan button greyed out and unclickable until the delay timer is complete instead of having some annoying message lashing at my face3

check your support box
well speaking as a carebear i fully support this idea
ok for mission runners fine but do they really have utility beyond that why wouldnt ogre iis be more effective if the target was in a standard pvp omnitank regardless of whether a neut was involvedthey have uses now but theyre few and far between i wont be heartbroken if they dont get a buff but i think it would be nice to see more variety in drones than there is currently
they are the second most drone focused race dumbass they even have multiple droneboats
caldari gallente and minmatar drones are usable under normal circumstances amarr are not after this change somebody still would have the worst drones and it would still be the amarr theyd just have bad drones with a wider variety of possible applications and your hp numbers are high  by my count 4x would be 768 shield 2304 armor and 3224 hull for a praetor ii in other words enough to take a licking but not so much that theyre unkillable or anything they live through one bomb but drop to the second for example given the sort of performance hit youre taking to get that that seems fine to me
very interesting idea in general pvp gallente and minmatar would still be the best but this could make amarr drones worthwhile for pirates fighting on gates and stations with sentries on themedit forgot to click support
does not mean you rely heavily on dronesand i count 1 single hull that is a drone boat i could be wrong about that thoughlol the base hp would be768 shields2304 armor3224 hullafter drone durability v they would be 960 shields2880 armor4030 hullafter say cruiser v on a vexor they would be1440 shields4320 armor6045 hullthats more than a cruiserdangerously close to a battlecruiser
arbitrator curse pilgrim one hull but three ships and their other ships tend to have decent drone bays too  far and away better than caldari and generally equal to or better than minmatar its not a stretch to call them the 2 drone race yeah but theyd still be the worst drones around all itd mean would be that people wont shoot your drones and that if they try your drones will actually be doing something helpful to justify their embarrassing lack of dps
i do think a 4x buff is a bit excessive though go 23x and let skills  ship bonuses make up for that little extra mile hell iirc theres a proteus setup that gets a double bonus to drone hp 20 per level which would be getting kind of ridiculous especially considering the size of the drones essentially youre talking about a destroyer tanked like a battlecruiser times 5
this there is nothing stopping a curse pilot from speccing in gallente drones even though its an amarr ship all these people crying that it would give amarr the best drones to make the em drones usable are tards think of drones like ammo and less like a race only items and youll start to understand a domi pilot could use amarr drones to deal em damage but why when ogre iis are just so much better in every aspect
much needed thanks to mistress for the excellent series of loophole posts
i dont see why sding should be adressedits a tactic to keep the honour to yourself that km junkies see this as a loophole is there problem it silly to generate a km when you sd just to get to your clone station when not having a cj availableso the only reason you wan this is to boost your ego

fix it i cant see itplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesseriously its getting worse each patch i could look past all that mess of flashy graphics if at least i could see the probes themselves but instead ccp is making them darker each patch in conjunction with the shadow cast by the solar system plane they become pretty much invisible the screenshot above is from a class 4 wormhole system which is one of the brightest solar system background graphics you will find it is worse in other systems please ask ccp to finally fix it for bonus points get them to punch their graphic desingers in the face for being obnoxious on purpose ive got no other explanation for this
sometimes ccp take the were in space its dark here thing a bit too far theres no reason for shadows like that to occur
this pretty is fine invisible is not also can we get the arrows on the drag boxes to rotate to face us be nice to be able to actually see them and not be edgeon
dunno for me its actually much better now depends a bit on your screen i guess
depends on your computer hardwareon my main pc it looks ok but on my laptop its worse than the ops imagesupport that the game should be playable on more hardware
something needs to be done regarding the logoffski mechanic ive posted on the forums several times about it if it means that a handful of legitimate internet disconnections are blown up to stop what is a far greater threat to the integrity of eve then so be itheck having a logged off character just sit in space for 30 minutes would be better than current mechanicsccp please do something about the logoffski mechanic
ccp did not change the logoffski mechanic because if you lose a kill people get miffed if you lose a multibillion ship to a disconnect people ragequitsince an overhelming majority is off bears losing subs and not losing some killmail is what ccp consider the lesser evil
logging off is so gay
disconections usually result from dropped or corrupt packets caused by whatever problem exists in the line it would be a simple matter for ccp to make the client actually send a logoff request when you click the little x once this system is in place there would be no more need for an extended timer the system would detect a dropped connection and take apropriate measures to assure your safty wheras someone closing the client would have the normal or an extended timer

a goon came up with this before anyone else holy ing moses absolutely supporting this most awesome idea
not as good as the various proposals to open up pos lab slots publicly but since ccp has nixed those this seems to be the nextbest thing
i hope this minor change to your quote clears things up for you
it has been proposed a lot of times already it will damage new players most as older players will be capable of put up a research pos in high sec by themselves or paying someone to start a corporation with the needed standing to me it seem more a way to kick in the balls budding industrialist than anything useful will not touch market hubs it will simply add more haulingit will increase manufacturing and research cost for new industrialist while all the others use posthere will be no more people building in low sec than today as there are a lot of moons in high secit will increase ice prices and add pos spam but i suppose that as long as other people is forced in that game it is all ok
yes
supportbut please introduce variable taxing regarding trade volume too that will disperse trading hubs
might cause some problems but considering the problems it would solve im willing to suffer the consequences
pos arent free to setup or maintain so older players putting one up blindly could find themselves at a disadvantage in a hurry on top of that pos are actually vulnerable to disruption giving new players an alternate way to muscle in on the competitionthere are already plenty of manufacturing slots in highsec nevermind lowsecnullsec that are rarely used for which costs wouldnt move noticably yes it would involve more hauling to use them i consider trading effort for profit to be completely in the spirit of eves economyi see this change as mostly working against the entrenched industrialists living in jita 44 with billions of isk worth of buy and sell orders up at all times who can make just as much profit without ever leaving the station as an industrist setup in a more remote area if a battleship were 500k isk cheaper to build somewhere out in the slums it would be substantially easier for a new player working in batches of 35 ships to compete with the entrenched players who never leave 44
as someone using 60 slots at a time i support this idea
browsing through any forum especially general discussion you see tons of threads that follow the format ofccp you must read this immediately i am an important person this gets extremely annoying after the 6th such topic all on the first pagei propose that ccp setup a filter such that any thread that has the term ccp in the name be immediately deleted this would make many people happy i believe
idiots will be idiots filtered or not i dont see this really helping matters any
ill bet if ccp sees those they laugh until they  their pants why ban that kind of fun
ccp please ban the op clearly he is insane
choice between 141000 isk and 10 rss scan probes seriously i know minmatar is hard mode but this is just ing stupid
if you want to change something give us some background info and a proposal for a reasonable fix as someone who has no experience with the epic arcs i have no idea how much or how little work is involved and how that reward compares to other races also are there more potential awards for the minmatar arc or just those two
you could try assaulting the agent when walkinginstations arrives
for reference a good l4 mission can easily be over a million of agent reward alone not counting bounties time reward loot or salvage i havent tried the new epics yet but 141k would be an embarrassing reward for a l3 mission never mind a l4 arcassuming op hasnt tarded out somewhere along the line and that this is actually the reward fully supported
did you have fun though were you challenged surely thats more important than any material reward
its not just the minmatar arc the gallente and amarr ones are equally crappythere is no faction standing gain either and at the end of the arcs there is some crappy implant or module that is worse than the stuff already available on the market a 2 armor hitpoints and 2 armor repair bonus for the gallente implant or a covops cloaking device for examplethe missions themselves are sorely disappointing too and the branching once again doesnt really have much of an impact
so i looked up the rewards for the various epic arcs caldari gets a hyasyoda mobile laboratory with 4 me 4 pe 6 invent for 600 cpu 110k pg given that a regular ml is 90m this one i expect to sell for at least 150 even after it stabilizes between now and then a lot more the other rewards amount to basically a pile of junk that no player bar entity could ever find interesting drone link augmenters prototype cloaks 141 freaking thousand isk these arent epic rewards these are epic fail i can think of no reason for this sort of reward structure  theres not enough beer in iceland to make this seem like a good idea either the player base has collectively missed something ccp is genuinely trying to screw over noncaldari missioners or whoever designed these missions is a blizzard spy this kind of stupid doesnt happen naturally

to be honest i like caod being a cesspool prevents the idiots from cluttering up the useful forums too badly i might change my mind if i thought it could be fixed but thats about as realistic as setting up a leafscanadiens forum and expecting civil debate no the only thing thats going to happen is that youre going to get sworn at in two official languages
ive seen something like that happen in another game trust me you dont want those guys invading other channels if coad gets the hammer ban people sure but dont delete the forum
i pretty much agree with drake here itd be interesting in some ways but really the mission for those 151 hours is to go reinforce other poses most pos combat doesnt take place at a single pos it takes place over a decent area of space i cant see the added complexity justifying the results
oh yay more boring stuff in sov warfarebad idea
right now the raptor and the crow are at the bottom of the interceptor food chain because of two reasons1rockets blow2and the raptor cant track for crap at high speedsi suggest swapping the two interceptors rolesthe crow would become the interceptor with the warp disruption bonus and the raptor would become the combat variantcrow10 bonus to kinetic missile damage 10 bonus to missile velosity15 reduction to mwd signature radius 5 bonus to warp scrambler and disruptor rangeraptor10 bonus to small hybrid range 15 bonus to small hybrid tracking and 15 reduction to mwd signature radius
1 try fitting blaster on your crow you got turret hardpoints2 crow rocks for tackling big ships not so much for ceptor vs stuff close range stuff
1 fix rockets then 2 depends what its tackling raptor can hit a battleship just fine and same with a cruiser as long as it doesnt get in too close if you fit it to track better it can do just fine against frigates for that matter the numbers are nothing special and a tracking bonus would help a lot against smaller targets but i dont think that justifies swapping roles
hmm one ship doesnt perform as well as another onea game where not everyone is on a perfectly even playing field scaryno support for yawt yet another whine thread
thats was quite a contributioncan no one start a thread about any damn thing on this forum without being accused of whining
tortugan is right and your whining about whining  o p
not sure you read the first part of my post that a ship is the worst at something doesnt mean it needs a buff it means that the game is diverse when everyone is special no one will be be creative in your fits and counter the cookie cutter fits that other people always use to whine for buffsnerfs
putting a remapcard in the eve store wouldnt be such a bad idea although it could create a canyon between rich and poor playerstherefore apply rules such as one can only use one card each 3 monthsi can understand people who say no to this as it can make skill training fastereasier for the more wealthier players but making a fckup with the remap and being almost unable to train your skills is also a thing we dont wantpersonally i make 2 pages of notes and skill trees before i even considere a remap but may i screw up i would love to buy one of those cardson the other hand if people fail because they dont think before they act i always say just let darwin do his jobconclusion dont ditch this idea just yet

we all make mistakesi usually find that the people who say that make a lot of them daily and expect them to be easily fixedyou have plenty of time to research the cause and effect of your choices and can always change yer mind before clicking the done buttoni dont support this
mining has never been as profitable as running highlevel missions and now with the new wormhole opps it is gettting harder and harder to pull in a decent profit aside from a few bonuses training exhumers to level 5 really serves no purpose my proposal add the 4 and 5 strip miner variants that we have been asking for since the dawn of time missioners just got a massive isk fountain in the form of wormhole opps so i think it is time for miners especially the solo high sec miners that have no use for orcas to get a isk fountain of their own in the form of better exhumers
not supported an extra strip miner would be too much two more be game breaking
it wouldnt be game breaking if you limited cargo capacity it would just make the ship fill faster besides when worm hole opps net over a billion isk in one night where it takes a high sec miner several days to make 50 mil the game is already broken in favor of fighter jocks
if the miners want more profit perhaps tuning the tritanium price will be in orderseriusly the miners hold the economy in their hands to bad there will always be someone that will lower the price to get the minerals soldwhen trit was at 20 isk an active miner with skills  support did 18m ish if the price go upp to 4 well thats 36m iskhour point is if the price go up so does mining profit and btw wh ores are great isk for miners
it has been shown on these forums time and time again that an increase in yield would not increase a miners iskhour extra strips would increase how much ore everyone can mine leading to a proportional increase in supply when supply increases price usually decreasesim sure akita t has a detailed calculation somewhere in the si section if you would like to look into it morevic
a solo hulk can pretty trivially make 10 mil an hour so if it takes you several days to earn 50 mil youre not playing very much wormholes earn in my experience around 30 milplayerhour depending on how the drop rate changes are going this week wormhole running also happens in 00 meaning that ship losses are way more commonyes even when people go around suicide ganking you and they require more skill often more coordination and cant be done afk also exhumers 5 is a highrank specialized skill you dont need a reason to train it to 5 any more than a hac pilot needs a reason to train hac 5 if you want to spend a month getting 5 better at a particular ship you can if not move on to something else i know lots of people who train exhumers 5 and they dont need a 5strip barge to do it
you are basically wrong mining can be very profitable add an orca for hauling and you suddenly rip through complete belts
as you can log in only 1 character for account it will make no difference
not gonna happen unfortunatlly no csm will rise this and even if someone did it wouldnt pass and even if it passed ccp wont implement it also this
not realise eve was even supposed to have sound tbh
i like the idea of a ship for scientific purposes for those of us that are researchinvention and for those that are exploration only decent mids decent tank bonus for astrometricrelated stuffs dedicated high for probe launcher small drone bay that wont accommodate scout drones its a nice ideadont really need a heavier transport or a logistics cruiser
your ideas are respectively strategic cruisers transport ships and logistics i see no reason to duplicate any of these classes nor any obvious way of improving upon them keep their factionspecific lp rewards to things like implant sets id say
so gents in order to stop this slightly on topic how do you feel the current csm has done so far are you happy with the volumequality of issues raised thus far were off to iceland in a few weeks so obviously there will be more to report on when we get back

you could do what i do at work that is to tape a big hand on the door jam for pats on the back csm3 has raised the bar in terms of the quantity of issues raisedperhaps folks are just afraid to put anything else on your plate at this timegood luck in icelandi wish i could go but since i didnt turn in my vehicle for the cash for clunkers program i had to throw money at it

like if so many people agree could we get some attention i have seen no reason not to implement this so far and i still fail to understead the reason to 25 rate of fire penatlty
nice that the problem is supposedly getting looked at but well keep bumping this thread until its fixed
agree with above poster
i believe that says it all really
well ccp has a really weird idea here i think our sandbox just got destroyed i wonder how goonswarm pandemic legion against all authorities razor morsus mihi wildly inappropriate etc etc will react to losing their sov to a bunch of 1214 year old finger twitchers if you own a supercap it just pretty much became worthless and im not sure caps are worth that much now either all that being said i spoke with several first person shooter fans who really really want this on the pc they do not like playing consoles so my two cents is you ought not exclude fps pc players from your market share ccp
i like the idea i think it will expand the playerbase of greater eve to include fps gamers but im sorry consoles were not meant for fps games i would love to ad dust514 to my daily regiment but you really must consider expanding it to include pcs at the same time you have to be careful not to throw eve out of balance and to watch for hacking which is rampant in the fps worldsummary 1 i like the idea 2 make it for pc too not only consoles3 careful how you unbalance eve you dont want dread pilots angry at you4 hacking is rampant in fps this is your biggest problem in a perpetual world
i dont own a consolei am not willing to buy oneif dust comes out for pc i would try it and if i like it i would buy it if it comes out for console i will not be able to play it hence i am not buying it maybe it is simpler to make games for consoles or whatever but buy doing so you exclude alot of potential cutomers
how nice of you to offer your opinion on thingsthe number of people who play fps on consoles eclipses those who play on the computer it is the way of things
guys this is a sales figures thingy dont exaggerate on this its still a long time till dust hits reality and several decisions can be made until thenuntil now we know close to nothing about this game and the implications on eve and sovereignty
to be honest i get bored of reading every ones post as they all say the pretty much the same thing so i havent read everythingmy post will also no doubt be lost amongst the many that will surpass it howeveri agree that dust should hit pc markets aswell as console markets but we have to remember than when halo went to xbox exclusivity with halo2 millions of people switches to console fps and when the pc version of halo 2 emerged a few years later almost no one played itmy main problem is that dust isnt halo its more battlefield whos console platform of the game plummeted in players due to its inherent nature of it being larger and more involved game than jumping into a smaller map and shooting people until some one gets the most frags like halo and codhowever the reasons for ccp going into consoles with this type of fps mmo is understandable and some what courageous whether this works out for them will only be truly known upon the games releaseall i know is that i personally will be buying the game as my interest in the eve space race is some what dwindling and only as long as dust doesnt require an extra subscription ontop of the already expensive xbox live subscriptionof course once the next xbox1080  is released dust will be sent to the place all my original xbox games ended up the dusty loftattic this will no doubt be around the time a pc version is released which would make sense for a development companyafter all of that i would still prefer a pc version but will still buy the console version providing it is popular with the online console community probably a month after its release

allow us to save bookmarks just like fittings for a whole corporation or even alliancereasoni am living in unknown space for nearly three months now with 20 other people at the zenith we spread the bookmarks by putting them into the hangars where people can copy them its a repetitive and dull job but we have to do it most likely we have round 3040 bookmarks each day needed by many people i dont know where the bookmarks are saved client or server but it takes a long time for the client to load the content of a bookmark container round 30120 seconds for a container with many bookmarks thats additionaly to the copying process itself a pain in the ass waste of timeallow us to save this time allow alliances to give theyr members uptodate bookmarks of jumpbridges allow us to save bookmarks in a way other people have easy access to it hey we are 21000 years in the future arent we

why do people keep trying to get a reduction on the jump clone timer no
not all of us play 237 the time we do play is valuable we can always fall back on pod jumping to get into the action but that brings up the question why should character farmers get skills faster than those actually playing the game
hmm as much as i would like this and i really would i cant support it a change of that nature would disproportionally benefit two groups that already have significant advantages very active players and larger alliances bigger alliances in general benefit more from logistical changes than smaller ones do and this is most definately a logistical change the more active players will be able to operate between multiple locations with less concern about having to worry about putting themselves in harms way this would make wardecs more difficult to prosecute bountied players easier to get away defense fleets would be proportionally larger but so would staging location attack fleets both of which benefit larger alliances over smaller onesas far as verys second argument if you are operating in 00 space its generally easier just to fly a clone down in a cheap ship to a station buy the ship you want there even if it is more expensivedependent of course on how well stocked it is then jump back and forth as the desire arisessorry not supported though much desired

i think the 2 second delay itself is manageable but the expression of the delay in the ui is pretty awful the message that appears when you click too soon lasts longer than 2 seconds so its very difficult to know whether or not your next click has produced an updated scan if youre not movingnot supporting the original complaint but i would support a change in the ui that simply greyed out the scan button for 2 seconds after clicking it as an alternative to the current messageben
got my thumb irritating as hell trying to solo with this change
please change it back
way too long of a delay and the message is annoying as anything

i understand there is a problem but lower the timer or put a timer on 360 degree scans only to reduce lag 2 seconds is too long for every scan
ccp you gotta find another solution for a good replacement of current scanner 2 seconds wait timer isnt the way to go
yeah

ccp probably wont remove it how about a topic asking ccp to make scan probes more usable
so uhm this thread isnt slowing down on postcount increases is ccp going to ignore us completely cause its getting a bit silly
if i aint broke dont fix itand it wasnt broken so what was the point
totalt disagree with this 2sec delay this is breaking a big part of the gameplay that is scan to find people to kill and scan hostiles to not be killed at least follow the scan resolution of the ships  no delay for small shipsinterceptors and 2 secondd for biggest ships between its proportional
what a stupid idea
yes do away with the delay please

this make it take way to long to find a ship at a celestial when you enter a system just getting it down to 90UFFFD scan can take 6 sec if you are unlucky its was hard enough to find targets before this nerf
yes once in a year or lifetime maybe with some payment in real money and history of changes
no dont be a dumbass and chose your characters name wisely upfront at creationmaybe some more drastic hints from ccp at character creation screen that you really will have to live with your characters name all the upcoming years of eve
perhaps ccp would consider doing this on a onetime basis in conjunction with an upcoming expansion after that youre stuck with it and of course there would be a fee similar to a portrait swap

while i do think that people who really not want or have the capability to fight a war do need a way to not fight apart from the dock for a week method just to pander to the big boys who want to beat down on easy targets i think mitch has brushed upon an important thing a pos once a corp has hung a tower it has basically left the play eve with no commitments stage behind and planted themselves in the target corp bracket by holding space even if it is just a moon in high sec for a tower from that point on they should be wardeccable with no escape from it wether they leave an alliance or join one the war sticks until the deccing corp stops paying or accepts surrender this from a carebear btw
your point about having a pos making you truly playing eve at the multiplayer level prior to that you can basically just belong to an npc corp sit in empire and play eve singleplayer is a good one i think more in terms of playerowned corps as the breakpoint for the same thing as long as youre in an npc corp youre pretty much not yet playing the game with other folks or perhaps more accurately dodging much of the accountability of doing so once out wardecs should as i believe they were designed stick

adding support
i believe ive already added my support to this but ill try again fake edit guess you cantive just been reading up on the discussion since i saw it lastit really saddens me that most of the people willing to support this argument offer concrete facts and logical assertions when they do it and the main detractors offer nothing of the sortthe main reasons against fixing projectiles ive seen1 minmatar have good subbs ships you deserve to suck at the bs level2 balancing weapons ie making large projectiles a viable option makes the game less fun which sounds the same to me as saying games are less fun when there isnt an underdog you know you can thump 95 of the timehopefully any future naysayers can mount a better defense than that i do love me some statistics battlesin any case i really hope this is brought to ccps attention and if it is that they give it serious consideration
to important to be forgotten
well so far i have yet to see either csms or ccp acknowledge this thread or any of the other ones especially considering that larkonis trassler a csm said he would look into it needless to say i expected at least some information back about what the hold up was or that it was under review by the csm groupso i think well wait a couple days then on aug 27th please send an email to all the current csms and their alternates that we would like them to make this issue a high priority and that they as representatives of the eve populous should take this up with ccp immediately and not do delay any further it is important for each of you who do send an email to the csms to do so respectfully and politely ie no cusswords doing so gives dignity to the situation as well as gives you and the person you are talking to honor and respectthe primary csms are as followsdierdra vaal  chairmanvuk laumazzilliuzastrow jerik finneganavalloclarkonis trassleromber zombiemeissa anunthielthe alternates areissler dainzeserenity steeleshatana fulfairaschip mintagoweazy zagain please be respectful as frustrating as it can be to be ignored you will not help the situation by letting that frustration cause you to say things that arent useful

so so very much agreed tackling and putting a mothership into structure only to have it selfdestruct and drop no loot and give no killmail sucks he wouldnt be blowing himself up if we werent shooting him therefore we get credit for the kill
10
supported except for pods
i agree with the fact that ships that selfdestruct in combat should generate a killmailwith the mention that the said ship self destructedhowever i dont think that unagressed ships that aself destruct due to varios reasons that are unrelated to combatinsurance fraud inability to transport them etc should appear on the kbs
i agree something should be done to avoid this but i also agree with the fact that there may be an issue of keeping fit secret etc etcso maybe the solution is not generate a killmail but something else1 this happens a lot with capitals so just extend the timer for a capital self destruct to 5min this should provide the attacker enough time to kill the enemy ship2 do not give an insurance compensation if a pilot self destructs atm the only disadvantage to a self destruct goes to the one who survives by denying the insurance payout to the loser he also loses by self destructing so if he wants to get some money  even default payout  he should let his opponent destroy him
removing insurance payout for selfdestruct always seemed reasonableim a combat history buff myself so i actually consider the km generation more important but would be perfectly happy to see the insurance payout nuked as well
introduction ive been spending quite some time on these forums reading assembly hall and fi forums quite alot in these forums a quite common topic appears less now though and its about insurance payout when concord is involved what strikes me when i read these texts of people thinking that the insurance company are complete morons when paying insurance to ships that have been concorded is that almost evry time someone says a real insurance company wouldnt pay out insurance if you used the car in a armed robbery and i can agree a rl insurance company wouldnt do that neither would they insure a combat vessel built for one thing combat also accidents happen like the por guy in a mammoth that accidental smart bombed my drone and rather quick got reduced to ashes what about him will there be an ingame trial for that pilot or will i as a victim decide his insurance fateso people want some realityintroductionproposalremove any insurance on vessels that are designed for combatkeep insurance for industrial type ships that cant fit any weapon system such as turrets and missile launchers void the insurance if the pilot fits any offensive mods such like the smartbombi did not include drones since i consider them protection from npc drones proposalid like to see a discussion about the good and bad stuff for this insurance measure i am aware that this can hurt the pvp part i did however write this proposal as an option to make eve that bit more real i personally think the insurance is fine it need not alter but as this seems to be a problem this is my 002 isk on how i best think the issue should be resolved
rubbish idea tbh insurance opens up pvp to a lot of people people abusing the system isnt a call for removing but perhaps just a revisal of payouts to concorded ships removing all insurance is a baaad idea imhoout of morbid curiosity how much do you pvp
not much now days i did however have this stupid idea to only pvp in t2 ships so insurance never really have affected me i am however packing my bags putting fuel in my megathron and heading south to take up the hatchet of warcalling upon rule 1 of pvpnever fly anything you cant afford to lose seriusly
support
only insurance change i will ever support is removing insurance from concorded shipsif you remove insurance from the game just flying battlecruisers almost because like flying t2 cruisers for those players like me who make just enough isk to keep up the pvp habit removing insurance would destroy the game i would be reduced to flying possibly t2 fitted t1 cruisers battlecruisers would be too expensive to continually buy and lose you already lose isk through pvp in ammo mods and a little bit of isk lost through insurance if you want to pvp in a nice toy that others cant afford and doesnt pay back insurance buy a t2 ship and fly it not supported
whatever happened to dont fly what you cant afford to lose or eve is a cold dark place or adapt or diedeath to insurance you get a free rookie ship if you dont have anything else left
no
insurance exists because eve is a game you dont want a player to be left destitute so insurance is the way to make sure that even someone who does stupid things has the ability to buy a ship without losing their shirt entirely its a necessary role and i cant support its removal
how realistic a game is should never be a primary concern in game design we are playing a submarine simulator and pretending we are flying spaceships so we can safely ignore what real life has to say about gameplay at best it is a secondary issue by removal of insurance you are removing choice from the game now people can choose how much they are willing to lose without seriously gimping their ability to play they can also spend most of their time playing the game instead of grinding isk at the cost of flying inferior ships of the same class and using cheaper modules people who fly uninsurable ships are already rewarded by better performance and thus have an advantage over people flying insurable shipswith the removal of insurance you just force some people to fly smaller ships and use cheaper fittings while gaining nothing worthwhile from doing so you force the people who dont like to grind for money to grind it some more nerf suiciding yet again and punish newbies for their mistakes suiciding is balanced well enough as it is so nerfing it even more isnt justified especially at the cost of the other two groups even if you just remove insurance from concord kills you would still hurt the newbies im pretty sure this was the main reason suiciding was nerfed by buffing concord response times instead of denying insurance from concord killsps why are you posting about an issue even you dont consider a problem im sure you have your own pet peeves to complain about so use your time to get them fixed instead of fighting other peoples battles let the people who think this is a problem defend their own positions if they arent willing to put in the effort needed to do it you shouldnt waste time on it either
eve is still a cold dark place and you should open your eyes and take a look at the game as a whole if you dont see that im not going to sum up what makes this game that way for the millionth timeinsurance is only a partial coverage of the actual loss that is the loss of the ship modules rigs cargo all of these are not covered by insurance and can cost more than the ship itselfinsurance is a helpful hand for the starters and those with small wallets as not everybody can afford to fly t2 ships it does not refund completely however it makers it just a little bit easier t2 ships however are still worth flying over t1 due to their specialization and bonuseshowever concord killed ships should not receive insurance thats just plain silly
agreeing with all but what i removed
this you want more pvp not less if ensurance helps to keep people fighting hell yes
insurance needs to be a player invested system if you lose more ships over x course of time your cost increases by y security status of systems also needs to play a role in insurance the reason major alliances dont die like they used to is because its become to easy to sustain heavy heavy losses in 00 i agree with the sentiment that insurance helps to entice pvp but it shouldnt reward carelessness bigger ships should have more penalties for insurance too i think this would create more diversity in the game where every fleets focus wasnt all dreads or all battleships it would instead refocus the mindset on bring what you can and well adaptand one thing that still blows my mind is if i dont buy insurance why do i get a base payout still i mean ffs i dont insure i lose a ship stupidly and i still get 30 mil for that battleship or 20 bil for that titan loss i mean wtf yes i realize and encourage the fact that titans cant be insured
if someone created a proposal centered around these ideas id be much more likely to support
problem spotted
there are games that went this route yes the issue is all but newguess what the players did theyd just unplug the network cable off the pc to simulate the connection drop
have not happened to me but logging off should not be mean to save your ship
sucks
i support this if you make trouble on the forums you should be kept out of the game to or maybe just have your training paused
i support this idea
it should include alts toocough lark cough
i apologize if this has been mentioned before but i couldnt find a proposal like itone thing i have noticed are more missions against other high sec factions ie fighting gallente caldari etc some mission runners prefer not to fight these factions due to the security hit other people love them anyway here is the proposalfirst of all you start out like what is currently the case youre given a random mission against a random faction and you can choose or decline it this would continue on until you reach a certain standing with the corp or agent etceventually the agent likes you enough maybe at 50 standing where you can tell the agent you prefer not to fight gallente for example you just want to fight pirates you tick a box for it indicating it this does not mean you would never get gallente missions but it would decrease your chance of getting those missions there could be another box for pirates etc realistically an agent who likes you is likely to want to keep you anyway so it would even fit into a roleplaying settingi feel this option would allow people to get at least a little bit more enjoyment out of missioning its not much but at least itd be something ccp has expressed wanting to enhance the mission runners experience well this could help
heh youre going to get a lot of not supported on this one
and could you explain why
i would suspect it has something to do with missioning being too profitable already and people trying to avoid the less profitable missions and the ones giving standing hits people do that now but at least it takes some effortthinking back on my missioning days i would only take angel missions because they pay a lot better then anything elseat least back in the days pirate missions are also much more faster and lucrative since you get most of the income without having to loot anything having this option would have greatly increased my income this is what the real consequense of this idea would be anyone able to fly lvl 4s is going to have the standings for this and will choose enemies that give the best iskhour i dont know if this is what you want but this is what it will be used for so please buff missioning income and remove even the little downside that comes attached to it by lowering the chance of getting missions with poor iskhour and standing hits
actually the idea was more to choose between empire factions and pirates it wasnt to choose between angels or blood raiders i have just heard a number of complaints about the fact that there are more empire faction missions being added in so i was trying to think of a solutionif you just allow it to be chosen between empire factions and pirate factions i dont really see how it would be a problem
oops that was me above
ill agree that this is annoying but i dont think that changing it makes sense its not flavourful it boosts something that doesnt really need a buff and it nerfs gang missionssince one of their current advantages is having more choice in missions which is also undesirable no support
pirate factions are tied to an area of space so being in minmatar space would mean more angels even in your system so the actual effect would still be the same since people already mission in space with their preferred pirate faction what is important is that you can also do this all now so it isnt like you dont have the option at all it just has a downside to it you have the risk of getting no missions to fly at times but you also have the option of bringing this risk down by having more then one agent available being picky about your missions should have some negatives attached to it in my oppinioni would also like to point out that some problems are not actual problems more often than not it is just another way of trying to get more for yourself or force others to play the game in a specific way this is a problem since everything is tied together in this game and is in competition with other things missioning is already one of the most risk free and profitable things you can do in the game and it is an infinite resource always available so there is no competing over it missioning could use some changes but a income buff isnt on the list of many
well if the one suggesting this doesnt even think it deserves a supported why would anyone else 
id be all for ithowever there have to be drawbacksid suggest high standing requirement 6 or 7 even and a monetary penaltythe agent has to use other means to get the mission done so hes going to reduce your pay to be able to get someone else to do itno idea about numbers but lets say 10 per filtering optionno missions against amarr 10none against minmatar either another 10 reducing your pay by 20and so onyoull still keep bounties but the rewards would be reduced even if you continue to get highbounty missions youll get less than if youd just accept the standing hitof course the choices have to be for a set time so you cant just switch it on and off whenever you feel lucky
oh well why not only me tho my alts stay docked for that one
what he said not supportedwhy not because it would be easy mode choose a side from the npc empires and go with them cant stand any more of these lousy ultracarebears who never want to ruin their standings towards any entity bah
yes not supported i am one of those not wanna ruin but i make an effort for it an switch around agents in all empires btw lowsec pirates and suicide gankers are worse carebears
recently a few topics have popped up in general discussion regarding the recent removal of npc corporation descriptionsthe majority of the posters in said topics are against the change so it seemed logical to post hereas a questionshould npc corporation descriptions be put back into the gameupdatefixed with apocrypha 151 wed 9th sep 09on behalf of everyone who supported this thread thanks ccp and good job
whats the use of a npc corp descriptionseems to me like just another text file or something to be loaded up after downtime is doneild say leave them tbh i dont know anyone that realy pays them any attention tbh
i feel they should replace it if only to help a player make sense of why some lp stores just give out navy bpcs and others give out both navy bpcs and ships those sorts of content reference points go alot farther to helping you remember than you might think besides ive heard there are some people who really like that rp fluff
its simply ridiculous that they should flesh out the universe with novels and eve chronicles and then axe the flavor text from the within the actual game wtf
let us not forget that eve is an mmorpg that means role playing game as in you have created a universe in which my character exists removing the flavor text and other npc info from the game removes pieces of that universewith all the work that goes into developing story lines and writing news releases about the happenings of new eden why would anyone consider removing npc reference points it undermines the entire effort of the content development team
thanks for your replies peoplethe same as that of the majority of items in eve they add depth to the gameplease be sure to check the support this topic checkbox if you agreesupport this topicthanks again
yes they should be restoredi dont understand why they were removed in the first placeneed another 10 mb to cache all npc corp descriptions on my hdd fine please go aheadneed another 1 mb per patch for changes in those cached descriptions fine please do thatafter all its a slippery slopeno one really needs those incredibly long descriptions of the t3 ships or any other item for that matter eitherif this continues we will really end up with online 3d spreadsheets

i know scandolous isnt itput them back
supported i feel like it added to the immersion in the game and helped understand the background between corps now no new player knows the difference between suukuvestaa and hyasoda the function behind the ministry of internal order the theology councilit used to be that a new player could get some understanding of new edens lore by reading the description of npc corps now no one has any idea what makes one corp different from another and what role they are supposed to play in the universe please put back in reading the descriptions of every corp in whose stations i docked was always interesting to me id like to be able to do that again was there really ever any reason for removing them
im not a huge believer in fluff but this removal goes a bit too far id say put them back

i reported this as a bug a while ago and they said it was already fixed and closed the bug reportits not fixed grr
no it was actually an idea that was born out of the first csm delegate threads before they presented ideas to ccp lvv compiled a list of requests and this idea was one of them that was thought up but dropped for presentation in lieu of other more pressing mattersorigin aside though im glad its been brought up againsupported

pos cost is negligible for a veteran how destroying some random pos in cruisers i did my first research on a ammo bpo when i was still flying cruisersdestroying a pos will be a way to try to stop someone from selling bpc but will in no way free copymepe slots for a young player here we agree it will increase hauling good for those in that business sure you pay 500k less to build a bs in a out of way location and then pay 50k for jump or your play time to bring it in a trade hubhardly helpful for the builder especially as he alredy paid to get the minerals in his building station again it will help entrenched players with freighter alts and damage new players but effectively goonswarm is a entrenched alliance so you are minding your interest in very eve like fashion
most seem to agree that pos warfare is one of the most cumbersome and boring aspects of the game many also agree that nulsec is impossible for small corpalliances to even consider holding space in because it is dominated by huge powerblocs and bloated alliancesis there a better more fun wayfirst there needs to be an alternative way to sovereignty i propose an idea of settlements settlements are established by a corpalliance on a moon or planet that is suitable this would require ccp to either make all moons and planets or some of them suitable for settlement which could be an issueeach settlement would have three major statistics the player influences population which would be fairly cheap to build up levels and would affect mining and some aspects of money making from a planet or moon supply just like supplying a pos a player would have to ensure a settlement was supplied with things such as water food equipment these things are already trade items in the game here is a great way to make them very valuable with good supply both population and machinery run well or get bonuses but if supply is lacking or disrupted it will lead to population loss and machinery level drops machinery this is the equipment population uses for various things such as control over a star system making money on the settlement research etc this is expensive for the player to build up but the higher its level the more the settlement affects system sov and incomethis idea for settlements will lead a greater strategic use of planets and moons in star systems in all of eve nulsec it will be great for those who want to take a greater role in empire building running settlements will take minimal management because my other ideas is to set up automated managers and supply rather than doing everything yourself lets say you could increase the population simply by sending tourists and scientists and exotic dances to the settlement you can increase the level of the settlements machinery i have not figure out how to do that yet lets talk automated supply convoys lets say you have a system with a settlement you need to supply next door is your capital system that has a station or large pos you can set up an automated npc supply convoy that would bring supplies from one location to the settlement you set up the times of the convoy you pay the cost for the materials to be moved you pay the cost of the ships haulers any escort you could let this convoy supply the settlement or you could do it yourself just buy the supplies and haul them over in your own shipsnow some would say this would create a field day for pirates and enemy to shoot at convoys exactly right it would be fun for them and the other side of the coin it would provide a way to draw your enemy in to then gank them too either way there is more pvp and looting and less player micromanagement and boredom isnt the fun of a game spending more time doing the things you enjoy and less time doing the things you loath
ccp clearly has some ideas for the sov overhaul and were going to have to wait for more info on dust to see what they are after fanfest well see what the future holds
add option to allow fleet access to industrial ship and transport ship cargo holds pilot would have a configuration option to allow or deny fleet access i see this opening up new fleet support roles and oportunities for industrialtransport ship pilots like myselfthanks for listeningdeji natrin
in general only corp hangars were accessible by fleet membersgiven that fact i cant support your ideaeither bring a ship with a corp hangar or jetisson your stuff
its called a jet canever hear of im
so i can laugh long and hard thanks
proposed numerous times already and will hopefully never happen cause its nothing except epeen shortage
been raised by csm 3 already the issue will be raised in iceland in 2 weeks
omg that hauler i popped the guy had industry implants you fail noobseriously
can we also laugh about your inability to use the search function
hell yeah
not necessarily weve raised the idea of implant reimbursements within goonswarm but theres no way to police it with the mechanisms in game now
and besides whats wrong with being able to accurately measure the damage youve inflicted on the enemy or viceversa there are uses for that outside epeen waving but i wouldnt expect clueless carebears to understand that
i think highsec missions need to be beaten severely with the nerfbat but this if accurate seems obscene even to meof course it seems all new missions suffer from lackluster rewards upon introduction l5 in particular had this issue how about instead of introducing new missions with the lowest possible reward by default and letting the rewards slowly work their way up you find an intern or two to playtest any new pve content and provide feedback as to what level the rewards should be initially seeded at or you could even just ask the mission designers where to start off the rewards
this seriouslly epic arcs are not designed for farming but to have fun pve contentpeople woirries too much over pixel money ffs

i have heard constant whining about low sec being a virtual wasteland this is mostly caused by the greifer types who attack anyone and everyone while pvp is part of the game it should not be a way to depopulate areas for ones enjoyment this said there is a solution low sec empire space is still empire space not lawless space there needs to be a war dec by the aggressing pilots corp before any empire pvp starts at this point all you need is boredom and you can attack anyone in empire space low sec you then get a 15 minute aggression flag and thats it why not make the aggressor and his corporation members suffer for acts of lawlessness we pay taxes ingame when selling items ingame you are paying for protection from lawless types thus the lawless types should suffer the full weight of lawless acts what i am proposing will have no effect on null sec if you are in 0 space it is by definition lawless however if you are in an empire system it is a law abiding system your game taxes go to support the empires why do they get your support yet render none to you if you wish to commit lawless acts in empire fine but there should be a cost to you your corporation and those affiliated with you say 30 days of empire flagging as a criminally minded corp no get out of system free cards in short you do the crime you do the time if you attempt to enter empire space you meet the gate guns up close and personal
i would answer seriously but this has to be a trollyour stuff editwhoops this is assembly hall ill be nicelowsec is low sec for a reason there already are gate guns and there already are sentry guns the only thing there isnt is faction spawns and concord if you take away the freedom that lowsec provides you essentially kill small gang pvp save huge battleship and t2 cruier gate and station camps and roaming rr gangs you essentially kill small gang pvpedit2 spellingalso describe in more detail how youd change the mechanics in lowsecyou made it really confusing
00 is as space significantly more dangerous than lowsec and yet plenty of people live out there why because the reward exceeds the risk in their mind if lowsec worked the same way there wouldnt be a problem fix the reward dont destroy the risk that pretty much defines eve
epic facepalmid quit while you still have dignity kid
mate you seem to have missed the point of the term low security space its only empire space in the sense that the empires have claimed it for their own doesnt mean they police it at all
alas may be too late
worst idea ive ever heard get out forever
so what will be the difference between empire and lowsec
cearbear detectedi think
indeed i would go as far as say anyone whos posted in coad more than twice  hey we all make mistakes  should only be allowed to post there and on no other forum section
by removing coad you are basically asking for a goon nerf how dare you target an alliance like that
ban euthinase everyone in caod
so what better have all the mindless idiots focused into one channel so they stay away from most of the others its kind of a honey pot trap and works fine imho

supported we need to know more details and it would be absurd if external factors could influence the sov in game
agreed if ccp is seriouse about makeing a console game afect our pc in game sov this game well bomb this is to deep of a stratigy game to have 10 and 12 year olds screwwing with our sov
even if the csm asks there is no way theyll be allowed to pass on the answers to us they signed a nda for a reason and stuff like this is it wait for fanfest because you arent getting anything more until then
theres 38 days left till fanfest the csm needs at least 2 weeks to get nda covered material cleared for the publics eyes so just wait till fanfest and we will get more info than even the csm would get
this obviously
i dont know if it is wise to wait for ccps spin at fanfest i would hope that the csm could raise this issue as soon as possible and continue following up as the issue develops
do you really think that the csm will find out anything that ccp doesnt want them to know were getting the spin either way
delink pos stations from sov and go with a system closer to faction warfarenow you can create any number of situations which require supercap fleets to roaming gangs of frigates
thats why im suggesting we swap the roles of the two caldari interceptors so the crow can do a better job at tackling and then the raptor will be the combat varriant interceptor
quite the opposite when one particular ship significantly underperforms or overperforms in a particular role it doesnt lead to diversity it leads to uniformity as everyone switches to using the better ship for the most obvious example see mission running and the navy ravenif caldari interceptors are underpowered it reduces diversity because it means interceptor pilots have only 3 decent races to choose from rather than all 4

anyone who has been into exploration will know how annoying the current bookmark trading system is fix it please
i support the idea but safeguards need to be installed with it require roles to make a corp bookmark dont let them be copied possibly even a role to be able to use them fleet commanders with the correct role should still be able to warp a fleet to a corp bookmark this would make it more balanced in regards to spies they could still get the bookmarks if they got warped to the location or conned the corp into giving him the role and warped there themselves but they would have to get there and make a personal bookmark a balance so getting them is not as simple as just getting an alt in the corp but still possible

supported 2j in 48 hoours or just simply reduced jump clone timers more paticipation  more pvp
not supported bolded the reason eve doesnt need more instant projection of power over several regions the ability of pilots to move on a whim makes logisticstheir interception even less important its already bad as it is it doesnt need to be worsenedjust a thoughtyou have several regions under your control your alliance is fighting a war against neighbour a on monday you engage them on their turf on tuesday neighbour b decides hey they arent at home now we could try to sneak in through the backdoor  suddenly all your pilots are back home and killing off every attempt by b the impossibilty to intercept such pilot movements makes controlling travelroutes less important and puts the emphasis of such a conflict on singular spots like stationsystems poses  guerilla tactics are useless large scale battles the only way to achieve anything time  space are important factors as they limit the projection of power if you have to fly for 2h having to pass 60 chokepoints in  outbound gate controlling space has a different notion as when you just have to use a jumpcloneeve definetly doesnt need the projection of power over several regions being easier than it already is
especially given tqs daily downtime ive never been able to understand why the cooldown wasnt 23 hours instead of 24
these reasons fail if you dont realize that you can get back to your home region without using a jump clone you either fail at this game or have never been in a pvp corp that was willing to teach complete noobs like myself which end of the ship was the front this proposal just makes life more convenient for those of us who have limited time to play and dont always know in advance which nights well have free for what its worth this has more to do with implants than logistics i personally think the whole attribute system should be scrapped wtf learning skills and replaced with drugs to boost learning speed

1 flying back manually 2 podexpress1 can be intercepted and takes time its not impossible to fly back to your homeregion but you have to plan ahead if its a worth to do 30jumps in one direction  especially if you have to move trough hostile territory b if its actually a good idea for an alliance to operate over more than a few regions2 can be really expensive atleast a good drawback for the instantanousness sp of travel

you really have never left highsec have youfinding people really slowly is not my idea of acceptable in any 00 system the only systems you would ever be able to stay under the local radar long enough are heavily populated outpost systems and thats only if you name happens to start with gq in any normal population 00 system you have no chance at all simply because you pop up in the big warning window that is local chat as soon as you enter

do like lots of other poeple do use a heavy inty or a sling shot then and overpopulate the systems gate so he wont get away if our alone use the heavy inty yourself or just be lucky at the first scan mwuahaahahah believe me just adapt its possible to do that im sure some wise guy out there as already figured a way out of this loophole

heres my two cents1 whatever method is used to remove abandoned poses if the corporation does not fall under the systems sovereignty then the pos can be flagged as fair game this way people who hold sovereignty can keep offline poses as they want them such as alliances that have a few poses still holding sovereignty in a system and maybe some are offline and online those who dont have sovereignty in the given space eg lowsec hisec whspace or dont hold it at all can be flagged as fair game2 if this will involve some sort of hacking skill make it require anchoring 5 something of this level does involve a fair bit of assets at play3 poses that are flagged as fair game need a time period after the pos goes offline this could be as long as 30 days but who knows4 whatever the timer is for poses it has to start after the pos goes offline regardless of external conditions once the timer has exceeded if sovereignty is still up then the pos cannot be flagged however the moment sovereignty drops then the pos can be flagged immediately5 if the owning corporation comes and even just configures it then the time period is reset if a corporation bothers to come and do this then the pos isnt abandoned to begin withps if an alliance in 00 needs a pos removed asap use current mechanics as needed
this
first its an exploit then its not nice
supportedwe had this happen to us and it was pointless to try again after they rejoined the alliance as they had removed all their industrial mods and just fitted it out a lot more defensibly i also feel its not fair to single corps out there who are war decd and dont get this second chance those in alliances dowe are a corp so its even worse that we have to do a 24 hour vote before even getting to start the 24 hours period
please fix this
i fully support thisthe existing mechanics can easily be exploited to save poses that otherwise would legitimately die and can be exploited ad nauseumif a corporation leaves an alliance any wardecs should stay with them for the full remainder of the weeks wardec if a corporation joins an alliance then that alliance should be at war for the remainder of the week the latter option still gives a large boost of defensive capabilities to the decced corp in question but at least provides the declaring corp with the ability to continue their campaign against their original targetsurely concord would want to see the spirit of the yulai convention upheld would they not
support clarify either whether it is an exploit which i hope it to be found to be or not an exploit and then alter game mechanics such that you can warm up on any corp in an alliance and not just the alliance itself when the they drop the alliance you should then be able to dec on the corp however this is not currently possible because it is impossible to warm up a war declaration on an corp in an alliance which is all shades of bull really with all of that and fixed exploits that made eve a better game for all that inevitably comes out every time a patch comes out one would hope something as easily fixable as this exploit would make the list
fully support thismoreover i would say that the extra wardec on the corps leaving the alliance should not count to the active wardec count which is both relevant for wardec fees on additional decs as well as for the three wardec limit for corporationseg atm if you dec an alliance as a corp and two corps leave the alliance your three wardec slots are effectively filled because of that adding injustice to insult pretty much
fixes for this have been proposed for years and ccp avoids them allowing exploiters to continue their exploits without repercussionwar declarations should flag all members of the corpalliance declared upon jumping alliance should not be a defacto escape clause the war flag should maintain through the current war cycle and expire only when that period ends likewise jumping corp should not be an individuals escape clause they and they alone should be flagged for that current war periodend of storymechanics should be put in place that enables an individualcorpalliance to avoid or terminate a war prior to the cycle end the current contract system is perfectly suited to that use

im sure you mean external address here internal would be something like 1011x 24 or 1921680x 24 or even 8 or 16 bit masks long story short if you banned someone from their internal address you would essentially ban 90 of eve besides the internal is natted anyway therefore you could not detect it for the websiteperhaps you mean their mac address however mac addresses are not contained within the packet headers therefore you could not detect the originating mac address from the website again same problem as aboveexternal would be a bit more practical but not much if you ban the 32 bit address a single ip address then the person can simply reconnect to their isp and most likely get a new ip since most do not use static if you ban a subnet as others have indicated before you would end up banning multiple people from eve ie in the us a lot of people use comcast baning comcast would then prevent a lot of users from playingand really anyone can just use a proxy server to bypass this restrictionsorry not supported i like the idea there is just not practial way to implement it though
better solution make it so you need to have 2 months of paided active game time aka nontrail accounts to post on most forum areasleave this away from a set area for new players to ask questions and let them read the other areas40 and 2 month to spam and get banned sounds like fun
thats actually not a bad idea
the wording of the op is a bit off but yeah i agree that someone who has received a forum ban should not be able to create a similarly named alt for the purposes of forum posting unfortunately ip addresses are mostly dynamic and mac address bans could be gotten around by spoofing the mac address or simply using another network adapter there definately should be something in place to prevent obvious alt posts though
giving every minmatar bs a huge bonus and dont buff the projectiles might be the best solution but there are alot of large weapon sized ships which need this buff the t1 and the t2 battleships if you give them all the same bonus it might be an acarty problem you probably might overbuff one of those while taking the other to the right level maybe its better to buff one system a bit and then give all minmatar bs a bonusthe other option there is give every ship an different bonus to make minmatarbs versatilethe tempest could get a falloff and a bigger alpha bonus the vargur would profit from an falloff bonus from tracking computerenhancer and could get an 5 alpha per lvl bonus  the typhoon rofbonus could get changed to 75 and could get and mass reduction the mael should change the boost amount to restistance and get an 575 alpha per lvl bonus  the mael would profit from the target computer falloff bonus too and would probably be balanced
looks like they did a recent change to the csm wiki here is one of the relevant postshowever i cannot tell how old it is so well still need to push this0101050038 rebalancing large autocannonsthese issues are being looked into by fendahl and they do see some good points to investigate mostly centered on the clip size and rof leading to some imbalance between the variants and with performance against other turret typesso the next question how do we get ahold of fendahl
looks like its over an year old and likely declined the didnt even bother to record the resultsi dont think there are many minmatar player in the csm team still flying minmatar bs i mean there arent many ingame player flying minmatar bs as well

i dont think we need this its part of the eve that you can loose isksps when you are not careful so i dont see any reason to give special message when you dont have clone up to date though maybe there should be this kind of message for people under certain amount of skillpoints this way new players would remember to update their clones and older ones would have to learn to do it without any extra messages
i am proposing a policy to delete the name of any character that has not been used in two years the primary purpose of this is that there are many awesome names for an that i have come up with that are all registered but none seem to have been used in many yearstake the character darth vader as one example this character has been a member of state war academy for 6 years 3 months and 16 days how many of you would be willing to bet 100m isk that that person hasnt even logged on in 6 years 2 months and 16 days i bet a lot of you would there are also many other spacerelated and other names that i have come up with all being members of newbie corps for many years and i bet maybe one of them is actually currently in use but just hasnt joined a corpso i say we open up all these names that havent been used in over two years and will probably never be signed into again i dont think that we should delete the characters just in case somebody plans on coming back and doesnt want to lose some absurd number of skill points that took them forever to acquire but just force them to pick a new name if theirs has been claimed during their period of inactivity if that is technically possible what do you say
or you could stop borrowing names from other sources and make up one of your ownits not that hard really just stick some damned letters together
what do you think i did to come up with this name
i dunno used the name of some obscure venereal diseasejk i do tend to use original or at least semi original names and still see them taken occasionally thats the breaks you get beaten to a name you really like and it annoys the stuff out of you had it happen felt the same just had to move on
i do not support the recycling or forced renaming of old characters you register a name its yours until they shut down the servers its good marketing if nothing else
not supported
noyour name is your identity in evei have old friends that left more than 2 years ago if they return to eve they can recontact me and i would be very happy to help them adjust to the changesif a guy called nick2879 call me and say i am your old friend xxx my name was deleted and i had to change it i will have a different reaction especially if the character portrait was one of those not particularly noteworthythen what wall happen to corp historycorp founded by xxx now called yyy
i find your lack of originality disturbing
names such as darth vader sic are copyright and as such the devs in their relatively limited wisdom created those characters to never log in for the express purposes of preventing them from being used in ways not expected or condoned by the copyright holderthough yes some names not holding rights and never being used should be removed i hate having to weed through the close but not quite exact copies of some names big lottery for examp to get the right individual
nopeople can always return and continue unless you refund them all the money for skills and training time noif someone was faster than you be creative and find another cool name
not supported especially in eve where one can have a rep even after years
actually if someone is an impersonator you can petition to get them renamed just fyi
especially if they are actively trading off that impersonation such as the chribba impersonators that pop up from time to time
people do come back after 2 years or even longerif this was to be considered id say limit it to characters that have never left the trial period and who have less than say 5m isk in assets on their account because anyone returning after that length of time with no skillpoints or money to their name is more likely to roll a new character than pick up the old one anyway
open your mind and dont pick any of the obvious character names from films and suchpeople do return after very long breaks so no this is a bad idea
ok its a well known tactic  bumpinghowever its crazy that ships dont attain any damage sorry but if a frigate rams a battleship its likely to have quite a bit of damageso what can we dofirstly have a specific ramming ship only for each skilleach skill level determines hull damage say something on the same level as the tactical shield manipulation skill where level 5 you recieve no hull damagefor standard ships if you ram anything you get a percentage hull damage proportionate to the size of ship you are bumping for example if a frig bumped a bs then its fair to say that should get 75100 hull damage but if a bs rammed a frig then it would get say only 25 you get my driftits just too easy to use bumping as a tactic and not get any penalty
i heard they did used to take damage a loooooooonnnnggg time ago but then people apaently just set up like frig fleets and rammed things to deathspecific ramming ship seems a bit pointless tbhbumping isnt realy an exploirt or anything its just good use of game mechanicsso bumping is good as it is p
not saying theres a problem with bumping just there should be a penalty to itwell i think there is a point to have a specific ship its like saying why have a ewar ship when you can add mods to other ships or why have industrial ships when you have cargo expanders etc
the utter pain of implementing this would be too high and the benefits too low movement in eve isnt precise enough to do this properly
as much as i would love to have the hacs that bumped my mastodon to death explode from impact damage nice job you two but i still hope you die  in game of course you open the door to a lot of other issues especially since as hersch notes movement in eve is very imprecisewhat happens when my wtz overshoots and i end up bouncing off a stargate im not keen on the idea of my frigate going pop because i suddenly encoutered an immovable object
keh of course it is its called collision detection how do you think missiles guns blah blah work its already there the system already knows that you are bumping something you just add damage to thatwith respect in the scheme of things its not rocket sciencethere isnt a benefit directly its just mental that a ship can ram any ship and not get any damage sorry but its just not right lol
ok fair point well remove the clipping then  job done so you dont bounce off anything
the accidental if not intentional carnage that would result at the jita 44 undock would be a hilarious and b cause to immediately revoke this
yes i can see it now new ramming ship undocks and gets concordd for hitting a freighter on the way outnot very bright op not bright at all
no dont you dare say that i want to see the carnage in jita 44 lol i will personally record this and laughand probably die of laughing too lol
not possible tbh because its internet youll start getting blobs that cause that mutch lag that you wont know if you popped bumping or some one shot ya etc plus ping becomes a issuebumping is also a nice tactic ive been bumped and ive bumped others too it can be a nightmare if its un expected at a station with a huge kick out
heres a genius idea you can fit a bunch of small smartbombs and it will feel like youre ramming somebody because you have to get so close to do any damage
or lets just think about undocking 5060ships from a station at onceby the the time they would be scattered normally they would all be in their pods as the ships scrubbed each other to death d
raised too many times by too many people to be ignored for the love of all things exploding please fix

im not sure if this has been covered or not i looked but didnt see itit is my understanding that t2 indys were to play certain roles but why do they not have 2 high slotsthats it really i think having 2 hi slots on a crane or bustard would be great they dont even have to be weapon slotsskanwaits for the flames but hopes for a real answer
you lack to explain why you need two slots
i think maybe the real question is why is the prowler the only one that does at least from what i can see it is
shhhhh if you get my prowlers nerfed ill make it my personal mission in eve to hunt you down and pod you every chance i get
shh i fly one too so i dont want this either the prowler is not the ship you are looking for
des correct the only transport ship in the game that has 2 high slots is in fact the prowler minmatar vaiant  blockade runnercov opsall others have 1why dont know except for the fact that the prowler is a bit short on meds and lows in comparison to othersi tend to slap a tractor on it but in all honesty its not needed and usually only has a cov ops cloak on itthe only thing its good for is to run like hell and survive without getting shot down other than the obvious industrial stuff prowler pilot
not supported i like getting money for being blown up
no pvp is expensive enough as it is without grinding level 4 missions for hours to get popped by your local blob
so what does that leaveshuttles and freightersmining barge and exhumersanything else
supported anyone who doesnt want it is a carebear or just sucks at pvp and loses tons of ships fail more
its about time for the horrible old and outdated insurance system to go
carebears dont lose ships that often so your proposition that people who dont want this change are carebears is wrong more pvpers would be against thispretty much anybody who pvps alot and doesnt  pvp behind their blob should be losing alot of ships so i dont understand your argument
more people would be willing to pay ransom for a ship if pirates arent too stupid never honoring ransom and so it would help low sec pvpi thin that is the position of bellum
ok so after seeing the eve wiki post on jita speaker corner here
postthe csm concept was revived about 14 months ago by now it has been a bumpy ride but does it deliver and if not how does one fix that heres my take on itwhen csm1 took first took office it was dropped into the position with very little help from ccp we had to make up all our procedures on our own and we had a fair fight trying to justify our existence and requests for resources from ccp departmentsa private forum email system a wiki one might call it a social experiment and i think its quite fair to call it thatthe csm was tasked to structure itself beyond a simple distribution of roles given by ccp this has the inherent feature of creating an organic organization however given the lack of challenges it faces its not going to get pushed into a stronger state its like survival of the fittest without any sort of threats to species existence the specie will survive but not evolve into the ideal shapeso before i draw any conclusions based on this i want to put the csm into the larger scheme of things when it comes to communication inside a communityif we look back at my earlier blog posts i have discussed how a successful way of keeping customers happy is all about communication some people did note that i maybe was a bit harsh and i think thats fair to say however i think that its more the case of the ideas and conclusions being put forward were very idealistic and slightly overdrawn in order to make a pointonce again im going to take basis in the idea that communicationfeedback is a desirable thing to have how might one apply this to the csmthe csm is a democratically elected body of players already there theres the idea of an election where people vote and players are elected theres a feedback loop which is solid people can go and check who got the most votes and see some sort of progress based on their interaction however after that the csm sort of becomes a blackbox operationits not that its impossible to find out what the csm is up to however the time and effort required getting a sense of progress being made by the csm is extremely high this means that people are going to lose faith in the csm very quickly it means that theres no incentive to go and take active part in the community around the csm it means that the csm is going to become irrelevant to the masseshow could the csm be made relevant its all about having a feedback loop that gives people a sense of control and influence this creates a sense of communication which is criticalright now the csm is stuck to a patched part of the eveonline forum where people can give an issuethread a thumbs up and this is hardly desirable due to1 the fact that only a small part of the community takes part in the forum2 its prone to altspamming3 theres no way of getting a feedback loop goingthe problem isnt directly technological as much as its about managing the lifetime of a csm issue that means that all the way from when its first raised by a member of the community till its taken care of by ccp it needs to be transparent what the issue is about what has been done and what is being done about the issueright now the issue starts out at the forum is taken into a wiki format and then passed onto ccp from that minutes are created and placed on the wiki separate from the issuethis is a major problem and quite frankly its a technological problem more than anything else
how to fix itin essence things need to be wellintegrated the wikisystem isnt really a bad system however its currently a halfassed solution that doesnt do much more than simply providing a way of storing and tracking changes to a documentheres i suggest is donea system is created that allows for submission of issues that adheres to standardized templates it could be a wikilike system that containsvotingup and downdiscussionpublic editing is allowed until the issue is marked as being under discussion by the csmdone when the issue is voted on by the csm the csm members could have to accept changes optionalprogress trackingprioritization by both the csm and the public on a 2month basisthis raises the barrier to entry a bit however this could be fixed by creating a staged system where an assemblyhalllike forum is kept in place this ought to be the place where rough issues are raised and the community is encouraged to create issues in accordance to the template and then submitted it to the systemthe result of a system like this would be that a portal is created that allows for easy access to all relevant information about the csm and allows for easy feedbackvotingright now the public voting aspect is rather much of a farce as pointed out earlier its kind of a slappedon thingallowing for voting by both the public and the csm on a peraccount basis creates a metric that can be used in the overall scheme of things when it comes to raising the issue to ccp ill talk about that againdiscussionwe already have a system that sortof allows for discussion however its currently not very useful due to the fact you are required to post in the thread to throw a thumbsup while having to post could be argued as a barrier to entry for voting for an issue but theres not any other requirement for the post allowing for empty posts making it impossible to discuss anythingprogress trackingone of the major things i hear from people when i discuss the csm with them is that once the issue has been posted to the forum its hard to find out what happened to it first of all you have to figure out what meeting it might have been raised in find the minutes and then find the csmccp meeting minutesa very simple system could be put in place to allow for keeping records of all aspects of the lifetime of an issue that includes the raw meeting logs from the csm meeting the voting result and finally the meeting minutes from the ccpcsm meetingall this information ought to be contained inside the issue page itself one might even suggest that if there are relevant patchnotes these could be tagged despite ccps previous stance on attributing patchnotes with a csm tag but if they dont want to do it i guess the csm will have to do itprioritizationone of the crucial aspects of the csm issueraising is the prioritization of the issues thus far it has been done by each csm member at the end of a 2month cycle give each issue a value between 1 and nn being the amount of issuesone of the main purposes of the csm as far as im aware is to get ccp a sense of what is most important to the community hence we ought to extend the prioritization job to also include the publicgoing by the same rules 1 to n for each issue players should be able to give their opinion of which of the raised csm issues are the most important to themthis gives a better sample of what the community wants and its virtually free in terms of time as its a voluntary thing which people can do
how does this all fit togetherso now that i have explained what kind of tools ought to be available for the csm you are probably wondering how it fits into the grand scheme of thingsas established in earlier posts communication is extremely important right now the csms largest problem is that theres no sort of feedback loop its a black box where people put up issues and give a thumbsup and if they are lucky the might even know if an issue was raised after that the communication stops and issues do not evolve beyond being a document in a wiki systemby allowing for more consistent voting on issues as well as public prioritization you give people a sense of having influence and control they can see that their action makes a difference and thats crucialhowever as times goes by having once put in a vote doesnt make much of a difference thats where progress tracking comes into the picture by making progress information easily accessible you get another feedback loopassuming that theres actual progressthis way the csm becomes another viable mean of communication between the playerbase and ccpconclusionthe csm suffers from not being pushed to becoming more than it is and is seemingly not given the muchneeded development time in order to give it the tools it needs in order to the csm to evolve and not stagnate progress has to be made and tools have to be provided for pushing the boundaries of whats possible with a playerelected democracy

you can not ban by ip addressseveral reasonswhen ip addresses were handed out the us dodgied their numbers and were overallocatedmeaning that us users often get their own ip for an internet session in other countries it can be a paperwork nightmare and ips have to be approved for various different purposes meaning that websites and internet users often have to share ips as there just arent enough for the countrythen you have the topology of certain companies and countriesaol forces users onto proxy servers so that most of their hits come from a few ipssaudiarabia and china have firewalls that expose only a few ip addressyou cant ban by ip it cant work like that

current situation if you doubleclick in space you start flying in that directionproposed change let us change what command does thiseg altclick instead benefits people will stop randomly flying off into space just because they misclicked a couple times trying to select something drawbacks slight interface clutter in esc menu
this isnt broken leave it be altclick already has a function is changes the camera anglenot signed
altclick was an example ctrlaltclick if altclick is takenthough personally given how useless a shortcut to just zoom in is id personally customize away the altclick function in favour of moving in a direction my goal is the ability to customize not any particular input scheme i just want people to stop randomly flying around without meaning to
although im trying to break this habit i tend to pan my camera around a lot more than i really need to just to see whats up around me and i find that even though im supposed to be orbiting this one target at 5000m i somehow end up over 10km away because my ship started flying off in some random directionwhy do we have to doubleclick at all to move our ships why cant we pilot manually or something if we want to move to an unmarked point in space rather than clicking on some arbitrary point in space with no direction of depth and hoping you go the right waysigned
i use altclick a lot to quickly change camera angles in a pinch its far from useless i have never had a problem with doubleclicking either maybe its just meim all for allowing more customization but its such a minor cosmetic change most people use overview to select anyways since no fc will shout a command like select the dude 4 oclock from my ship as it is all relative in space the only people really benefiting from this change would be someone with benign fasciculation syndrome
or someone who clicks in space a lot judging by my own experiences and those of people i fly with its a pretty common problem also at risk of derailing my own thread how does this altclick thing work im testing it and it seems that altclickanddrag works exactly like clickanddrag and altclick with no drag is a maximal zoomin i cant find any other function you do know that you dont need to hold alt to change camera angles right

my main problem with this idea is that it will cause more smack talk and hate mail toward me i already get enoughif people were a little more mature this wouldnt be a problem

anybody who doesnt support this shouldnt support killmails existing at allwell feel free to not ing look at it you idiot
i support ego boosting for killing pods
i think that people that want to do pvp just for fun of it dont care about killboard and carebears dont care about them either so only people that do care about killboards are people that like to swing their epeen around that said there is no harm for showing lost implants on killboard so i think this would be good thing
yes
this wouldnt affect budding industrialists as much as some of you seem to think many of them start out using bpcs off of the contracts and dont need the research slots right away this would free up npc research slots a bit so ppl can start research jobs much sooner than they may have been able to otherwise as i can always find plenty of manufacturing slots with little or no wait this probably wouldnt affect new builders much at all a possible positive secondary effect of this would be to spread players out a bit as they look for available slots without a high price due to demand for them especially if they are running missions in addition to manufacturing well this new agent isnt quite as good as the one in that hub but i save more in my manufacturing slots than i lose in agent rewards
as someone using 60 slots at a time i agree but by the gods make the manufresearch interface bettermove pos cargo to a single static storage area hangartower and have associated manufacturing locations take from that stockpile managing materials is a bloody nightmare

now i know that just about everyone gets ed off one way or the other when they want to move to a new location but due to you having ships that are rigged most often it involves you piloting each ship individually to the new location and for most of us this isnt feasible or practical due to it either being time consuming or just annoying as hell ie i had to move 16 rigged ships over 864 jumps total took way too long now a simple solution i would thing is some type of modified station container that can hold 600000 m3 since no single battleship exceeds that amount in volume second option is a new type of freighter designed specifically to move assembled ships and maybe a jump freighter equivalent for it as well specifications might be something like this maybehalcyon classrole transport freighteras the capsuleer population grew with time so did the need to move their ships increase with the passing of time as well the halcyon stands out as a behemoth even amongst freighters due to its cavernous maintenance bay designed to accommodate fully assembled ships that are unable to be repackaged due to ship modificationscaldari freightor bonus 5 bonus to shield hitpoints and resistances per leveltransport freighter bonus 5 bonus to ship maintenance bay capacity per levelfittingpowergrid output 1 mw cpu output 1 tf launcher hardpoints 0 turret hardpoints 0 structuremax velocity 62 msec inertia modifier 00631plasma propulsion strength 6 points mass 1367000000 kg volume 24956000 m3capacity 7500 m3capacitorrecharge time 26436 sec capacitor capacity 3950 energy targetinggravimetric sensor strength 98 pointssignature radius 437 km shieldshield capacity 7800 hpshield em damage resistance 0  shield explosive damage resistance 53  shield kinetic damage resistance 41 shield thermal damage resistance 20 shield recharge time 190000 secarmorarmor hitpoints 19700 hp armor em damage resistance 49armor explosive damage resistance 12armor kinetic damage resistance 29 armor thermal damage resistance 51 miscellaneousship maintenance bay capacity 1700000 m3 required skillsprimary skill requiredfreighter transport i advanced spaceship command iv spaceship command v secondary skill requiredcaldari freighter iv advanced spaceship command i spaceship command v caldari industrial v spaceship command iii caldari frigate iii spaceship command ino doubt this idea has popped up before but considering how many people do have this inconvenience i am surprised by the lack of support for it to be resolved dunno what all of you will think but some feedback would be good to hear
unsupportedmoving of rigged unpacked battleships should not be aloud except in massive ships like titans so that would mean no empirei want my wts moving the nice expesive faction fitted pve ships thank youalthough i can see your piont if you have a large fleet ive had to do it once or twice
now that we have special bayswell the introduction or the beginning of it perhaps it could be possible usings rigs or so i think i heard this from a dev somewhere that whay you just introduce a rig which allows you to fit only rigged ships only it would simplify the coding for sure
or there is always this concept have it to where all freighters have 1 rig slot that only accepts 2 types of rigs rig 1 allows the freighter to have a regular cargo bay rig 2 converts the regular cargobay into a maintenance bay maybe with a bonus of 120 room vs a normal cargobay to compensate for the larger volume of the assembled ships this would make it easier for ccp as they wouldnt have to design new ships from scratch though i love new ships this would also reduce training times
how many battleships would this allow you to move at a time doing math based on your initial design above at max skills that lets you move roughly 4 maelstroms however having that skill at level 1 allows you to move the same number so you have no real incentive to train the skill past level 1id suggest something like a base number of 500000  75 per level of racial freighter  10 per level of freighter transportthis give you a total value at max skills of a bit over oa million m3 thats enough to carry 2 battleships and a few smaller vessels or 34 battlecruisers or a pack of smaller ships but at first level its not that useful for transporting battleships because you can only carry one and at that point you may as well fly itin other words in forces people to invest in the skill if they really want the benefits of itas for the it makes it too easy crowd seriously  could you imagine the gank blobs these things would engender people would go out of their way to find themat any rate i think the numbers need tweaking but i like the idea
not supported we do not need yet an another shipjust allowed rigged ships to be transported in freighters and only allow offloading to take place at stationscorp hangersship assembly arrays and suchproblem solved
id be just as happy with this idea tbh
pretty much this
its very annoying to open each time agents info to find out the distance from your current location or may be you can add filter setting to show agents in current constellation
a workaroundpartial solution is to open the map and rightklick on the agent set destinationno need to open the info but still bothersome
similarly you can show info on agent location show info on the system that station is in and then look at the route this would be a pretty minor fix but still i wouldnt mind it being simpler

drake d the problem with jet canning is that the can is very vulnerable to attack heres your cap boosters and ammooops enemy poofed it not very practical
darius m a very interesting idea i would be ok with transforming industrial and transport ship cargo bays into corp hanger bays or even a new class of ship that did the same
drake d you never had a jet can near a mercoxit cloud have you 
thats exactly the point if the can is an orca a carrier or some transport ship they all can be shot they all die relatively fast if the opposing site has enough dpsif you want the luxury of a corp hangar you have to bite the bullet and bring the carrier or an orca if you dont want that risk you have to risk the jetcanrisk vs reward
no we got that already it is called orca only capital ships got an corp hangar and i think it should be like that otherwise we will see that dropping cap booster with alt thing more often
never hear of common sense to click the edit button
thanks fixed it
so whats wrong with having some middle ground it would follow the same concept industrials and transport ships are still pretty vulnerable to attack and with rigs can get pretty spendyrisk and they have less cargo space so the reward would be less in proper proportion to the other ships you mentioned
just to clarify i am not talking about frieghters i am referring to industrial ships ie iteron mark v and transport ships ie occator
this could be avoided if the new command is implemented appropiately lets say this command reads reconnect and recover drones this means if you give this command all lost drones automatically return to your drone bay this requires that are in a ship with sufficient bandwidth and drone bay you need to wait until they are all in your drone bay before you can give them new commands but this wont work for sentries if they are to far awayusing a tractor beam with lost drones would be nice anywayid also like to see a final fix that you loose control of drones that are on the way back to your drone bay seems to me this happens mostly if they are under fire they float in space without control and must be recovered manually
too many peopleisk behind keeping the current system in place but why not shake things up some more
not particularly bright are youwhile im copying the bpo which takes 2 to 3 times longer than it takes to produce a manufactured good im not manufacturing with it in other words it cuts my production on that bpo by over 60 when i finally do start producing all of those bpcsand t1 bpos for the most part copy at considerably faster than the time required to produce with one and you can purchase multiple originalsso my argument standst2 bpos are not isk prints like they once were some are still up there but nothing like they once were by the large the margins due to invention have come down massively only the broken moon minerals mechanic is keeping them inflated and even so meta4 items are now often far more expensive than t2

2 seconds really feels like 7 secondsthis is a completely nail bitingly frustrating irritating annoying care bear hugging counter productive excessive illthought out untested nerfget rid of it pleaseif you are trying to counter macro ratters and such then change it to like a 02 second delay as this is how long it takes to reposition your cursor for your next belt scan and is enough to catch people decloaking after jumping into system etcalso this popup message is crap we have no idea of knowing which scan worked and which one didnt2 seconds youre taking the  ships can align and warp quicker than thatrubbish rubbish rubbish
very annoying with 2 secs waitpls change it to keep directional scanning useful and fun
i normally dont whine about changes but try to get the best out of it adaptingbut this change is fail2 secs waiting time is a huge nerfbat in the face and annoyance for pvpers who know how to use directionalccp should encourage gameplay for pvp not kill it
bad bad thing i have no idea why this change was part of the last patch but it wasnt your best ideachange back this crapalways changes that dont help my gameplay like this couple month ago
scan timer is terribad actually the timer itself isnt so bad but the recalibrating message suckier than mr suckys vacuum emporium at the very least if the timer is going to stay stop the scanner from automatically rescanning when you change angle  direction cos that message is going to make me kill someone in game
ccp failed with this change yes but those of you who are posting without ticking the box support to the idea are failing just as bad
i think the whole post is supportiveto be honest im getting tired of ccp putting in these delays just make performance betterits really lameeither go back to the coding and resolve the issue properly and stop putting in hacks or seriously start looking at hardware cos this need for speed has been going on for years and get worse
these guys coming up with these changes do they actually play on tq

what is the thinking for this new scan delay do you guys play eve or do you just brag about building eve theres some of us that every day life in eve depends on that scanner unfortunately the majority of eve is filled with care bears that seem not to understand that the ship loss in eve is what bank rolls their fat wallets they want to get in their care bear social groups and say whats bad and then petition gms about what is wrong with eve just general info the pilots that pvp dont have time to jump on the forms and petition every time someone jumps into system and scans them down oh by all means pops their ship you would think they would be happy with out us they would have no one to buy their mods and ships plz fix the scan nerf and stop listening to care bears before you turn eve into some kind of social club for ex wow members

personally i would be happy for rsds to be boosted massively but then given a 100 stacking nerf i dislike having to put 3 damps onto a single target in order to achieve anything of notealso the hybrid bonus is something of a bad joke since you cant fit much of merit in the rest of the ship whilst fitting anything above dual 150 rails which have poor range even with spike and damage that is not worth noting so would swap that for a boost in rsd strength bonus to put it on par with the falcon in concentrated bonusthe scram range bonus has imo been superseeded for the most part by the tackle inties and where these ships can attain longer ranges the ships higher lock time is such that for the most part a tackle inty can close the difference in that time true an arazu can project a faction scram out to 20km ts scram is the only one ive looked at but im not sure that is enough to save the ship given its natively fragile nature falcons complain at having to get within 60km never mind 20km
ya the arazu is somewhat good at holding stuff down via disruptor and as an ewar platform damps but its really such a weak ship its pitiful plus you can often just damp 1 or 2 ships at a time as any more than 3 damps really nerfs the ship itself fitting cap issues
my thoughts are something like thislocal should be a service provided only in high sec whywell high sec is empire and concord land as i see it these are the entities providing the use or means of the communication system known as localfor game feeling improvment it would be nice to get a more i am leaving the secure space of high sec to travle into the unknownmy resons are more for the game feeling than anything else but there would certenly be alot of other issues with a change like thisin my oppinion it would give more of a adrenalin rush not knowing how many or what is flying the space i just enteredif i am not all the way of the grid most corps use their own chat channels while in low sec anyways and local is mostly used to give greif or smacksome players certenly use local to just chat with other players but i think it would be much better if you actually have to see or find other player to interact with them the feeling of empty space would increase enormouslybut what if when you scaned down a ship and intercept it you would have to hail the pilot and deliver your demands or what ever instead of just deliver them through locla wouldent that give a more rl feeling this is just an idee but i would like to vent it with other pod pilotes and hear thoughts and whats good or bad with the ideethx for the timemrpentexi do apologize for my spelling disorder
it already feels empty
unsupportedlocal is used by npcs from time to time missions complexes etcyour proposal can be made makeshift by any pilot at any time if they so choose by minimizing the local window and using direct player conversationsheavily benefits pirates and negatively affects everyone elsethere are many other reasons to not do this but ill let someone else jump in
would hugely epically fail especially with the nerfed directional scanner can you imagine 2 huge fleets running around a huge system which has been pos spammed with ships so you dont know if anyones really in local and those 2 fleets not being able to find each other
hacs what about all the other t2 ships pvp centric game indeed that is when youve grinded enough isk to afford a ship
simple enough change the standing system to allow only five 10 slots and five 5 slots
eff no we like having friends thank youisaac
i dont even know where to begin on this do you really think this will have any effect in practice itll just make people use outofgame tools to compensate for an inadequate ingame interface even more than they already do this proposal is bad and you should feel bad
what the hell
1 to i accidentally the whole nc
out of game tools to get those nice blue icons back in their local windowim intriguedop idea is certainly not a solution im thinking more about some kind of fee to resolve the issuesay 1mill isk per member and week if you want to set an entity blue
have you looked at razors blue list recently
perhaps you should give a reason
i have never understood what is the drive behind forcing alliances from forming diplomatic relationships between each other eve is a game where building diplomacy also matters greatly if an alliance builds its empire based on political relations alone that itself is quite an accomplishment it doesnt always have to be by the gun
quoted for emphasis
while your proposal certainly is simple enough it offers absolutely no reasoning why this should be changed i mean hell i can come up with random proposals with no reasonsgo back and try again a little background on the supposed problem this will fix might help
while it would be hilarious i also say no
omfg yes whole heartedly agreenot sure if 10 is the right number but it definetly needs a slap hard
do you pay for your friends
silly idea no support
i dont know of any outofgame tools to mod your overview i assume someones coded one but that sort of thing is strongly banned by the eula no im thinking simpler  put your standings list into a webpage and have it open off to the side

this tbh
obviously proposed to fit personal needs and without contemplating negative effectsunsupported
if you want to prevent people from having lots of allies you need to create a game mechanic that discourages them from being friendly with each otherthis proposal certainly wont do it as has been said already people will create lists elsewhere and just manually check or theyll use red to mean blue there is no game mechanic tied to standings and so simply not allowing somebody to turn somebody else blue will not have much impact
or just grow some balls and voluntarily not have as many blues as you currently have nobody is forcing you to keep adding blues
and as the op hasnt bothered to come back in here and justify why this is even a problem im calling it a troll
this is not a troll or a flame or directed at any one person this thread is a legitimate proposal this thread is not the place for paranoia and assumptions this is a topic i feel needed to be proposed and looked at for the greater good of the eve community
lol i think this is even more relevant in these dire timesback up you go
not going to work your just slow them downthis is ccps problem we cant pretend to have any solutions at that rate
slowing them down helps the situation a lot and its really all one can hope for for so long as people are able to post links next csm meeting ill write up this issue as a proposal unless something new comes along before the meeting that solves the problem i have some questions about the subject of billing though before anything gets written into stone1 they say these paid accounts to spam forums are fraud credit cards yes2 how many days usually passes before a fraud account is opened and ccp realizes its fakeassuming it doesnt get itself banned first3 is there any way a legitimate purchaser can supply supporting documents to end this period of time earlyalso i hate captchas and i really would like to find a solution that doesnt involve them
this seems like the best solution to the problem in the short term ill give it a hearty ugh because itll start to impede legitimate players but its about the best option ive seen
great idea will slow them down  why make it easy for them
it needs moar attention so it getsa bump
looks like unanimous agreement just so long as it only functions for ships in your hangar best by a float over popupdo it ccp
please
i have a strong suspicion that the reason why have these balance issues is because ccp designers think like this tortugan guy as opposed to relying on months of pvp experience in gameeft stat comparison has its place but when it becomes the center piece of reasoning it misses the big picture
put this on an dps graph pls i did without drones the mega would even do better with against an omnitank not moving bcsized target the mega outdamages the tempest after 5km but the tempest will catch up after 12 km again if you take an omnitank with 150 ms the mega peaks at 7 km with 800 dps without drones and the tempest peaks at 9km with 470 dpsand you dont have include reload time in dps activated activate it bevor posting pleasewhy didnt you put an siege missle launcher on the mega like you did on the tempest you can fit the malkuth without problems i this its because it would do more damage then the tempest and you didnt want this
he has been trolling this thread from the beginninga main point that should be acknowledged is that the tempest blows large projectiles blow and everyone knows this ccp doesnt carekeep this thread going though
1 by default lower tracking speed with higher damage would lend itself to shooting targets that are the same size or larger than you if youre shooting another battleship the tempest would win2 yes the tempest does less damage outside its optimal but the tempest also has 150 the base speed of a mega3 go ahead and fit a siege launcher on it you then get a whole 10 dps more than a tempest still with 10k less ehp and now very vulnerable to neuts unless i had dual cap boosters or cap transfers id go nos on a mega any day
oh sorry 
fully agree to thisi fly all 4 races and minmatar is fun to fly but hard to know were to sit p
well since projectiles run off the falloff 90 of time you never feel the pleasure of all that dps since its cut very badly
1  2 if you choose an zero resistance megatron as a target in dpsgraph with half speed the megatron does still more damage and would kill the megatron definit faster as the tempest does the megatron itselfs dont have much problem with speed but the tampest with hail itsefl does if the tempest flys with full speed it has huge problems to hit anything and would lose the fight the megatron wouldnt have problems to hit the tempest3 its 30 dps if you consider reloadtime but yes its not muchthe megatronfitting you gave us is much more versitale the tempest you have a nos a targetpainter and web and still the tempest does far less effective damage not raw data on the battlefield this tempest is next to useless if your target is more then 30 km away or not tackled by anyone else down to 50ms and still then its worse then the mega about 100 dps less against an not moving bs if the mega has the torpedo fitted 30 if not even without the torpedo it would kill the tempest without problemsthe tempestspeed only lowers the ships damage in this situation itself by about 300 dps not considering the enemy is moving the mega would lose nearly to zero damage if the tempest flys at full speedto sum it up tempest is worse against a moving bc a not moving bc a moving bs and a bs that dont moves if the tempest moves itselfs it will lose it a huge amount of damage and will lose the tempest is less versatile with your fitting then the mega which would let it be even more worse you only suffer during capbooster and 10k less ehp thats it but you would win in every situationyour fittings are just another example how bad the tempest realy is

because you dont know how to fit a ship no mwd which is critical especially for a 9km scram both shield and armored tank very impractical youve successfully given yourself additional detriments at a cost of a mediocre omni tank increased mass and increased sig not a good ideano remote repcap booster both necessary in a rr fleet and no local rep eitheruse of hail with out any tracking enhancers or tracking computer you know hail has a 75 penalty on tracking right it means that its effective range it 35k to 5k and you can only hit if your transverse is next to 0 yes ive tried this in combatand the silly part is that all of these changes if applied to the mega or apoc would have little effect or no effect on their damage dealing capabilities and none on their tankyou must work for ccp
you guys really have no creativity have you ever considered that theres more than one way to fit a ship the setup i offered was to beat a megathron in a 1v1 which it would transversal should never be an issue if youre faster than your target and if youre that worried about your lack of flying ability switch out the adaptive nano plating for a tracking enhancer in either case youre putting out the same dps with more ehp than a megaas i said i didnt really intend to get into another forum whinefest but i was curious to see what all the complaints were about so i decided to fit out a tempest and see for myself and as i also said if youre that sure that minmatar fail at pvp train into something else nothings stopping you
no it wouldnt and i have shown in different ways why there is only one situation in which the tempest would have a 5050 chance to win both ships sitting absolute still at around 7km in an one on one fight every other situation and every real situation is a situation where the tempest will lose most likely we are creative enough to fit different fittingsand because of this we know it isnt an good shipwe have shown very often that the tempest isnt a good ship for anything there are alot evidence for thiswe could proof it and you couldnt counter and still you say we have a lack of creativity i think you dont care if minmatar needs a boost you just want to argueyeah sure lets all train amarr and nerf everthing else this game would do so much more funthen the tempest has less ehp less rawdamage with torps about the same without torps on the mega less tracking less range dont have a web or pointer sure it would beat the mega but tbh its a better fit then the first try
i dont have a vested interest in this fight but after reading page after of page of data formulas fitting info and reasonable arguments from guys like astrophobic seriously bored orakkus and many others i have to say that minmatar large ships and large weapons are seriously in need of a rebalance things are so far out of whack that i have no idea why ccp hasnt done something before nowi hope the csm will bring this matter to ccp immediately and get the players some response supported
given the recent rig changes i think we now have a need for a ship that can transport rigged ships in greater quantities than the current meansorca carrier i propose that this ship be based off the freighter model and have two variantst1 t2base statst1 variant875m3 cargohold7500000 ship maintenance bayt2 variant875m3 cargohold10000m3 fuelbay2500000 ship maintenance baythese ships should use the freighter and jump freighter skills as their prereqs and should have the same bonuses as their traditional counterparts with the exception that instead of giving a cargo bonus they give a ship maintenance bay bonus build prices should be about the same as the current freighterjf build prices the numbers for how large the ship maintenance bay should be were done using the number of packaged bs a unskilled freighter can hold now15and multiplying by 495000 this is in keeping with ccps policy that carriersdreads are not giant transport ships this should be rather easy to codeimplement because there are no major changes that need to be made to the game in order for this to work if anyone has any suggestions on the idea let me know
supporting my own topic
i very much like the idea of this
as its been said several freaking timeswe do not need an another bloody shipallow freighters to transport rigged ships and keep to the freighter standard of loading and unloading cargo that being only able to drop ships at hangers in stations poss ship assembly arrays and suchthis solves the problem without the devs taking precious time away from having to build a new ship and the coding is already therestop trying to make a mole hill into a mountain use what you got
freighters only have 900000 cargohold or so that is only enough to transport one rigged bs so using normal freighters to do it completely misses the pointi agree with having restrictions on where ships can be loadedoffloaded as well this is not designed to be a giant carrier the point is freighters are not currently big enough to allow rigged ship transport so we either need to change current freighters to allow lots of rigged ships to be transported or create a ship based on existing code to do this job i would be ok with either solution
i like the idea of more ships with different rolesthis proposal isnt as simple as it would seem they would not be able to use a ship maintenance bay as it is designed to allow access in space this would simply make it more of a true carrier rather than an industrial transport however it may be something to consider if it had drawbacks though the requirements would be more along battle and not freighteras for the idea of just let freighters do it i think a new ship type is in order for the purpose freighters are set to carry packaged goods or raw materials just as a car carrier is quite different from a standard freight carrier plus i would rather have diversity in jobs for characters with different skill sets than a simply flying one ship and do many things
this is the age of t3to that end let the new ship be a t3 freighter having an even 1 billion m3 ship bay and zero cargo with a t3 jump variant where the jump module comes at the cost of ship carrying capacity say 30 reduction and the addition of a fuel only bay for the jump fuel in every other way it has the same rules as current freighters and jump freighters which for cargo carrying are more than sufficientnow imagine the tears generated from ganking a t3 freighter with 10 rigged tier 3 battleships in it
mmm i like t3 freighter but come on we need it sorting asap
if t3 werent so bloody expensive it would be doableas it stands now a ship that is needed this badly by a whole lot of people cant be t3 if it could be t3 with a t2 pricetag i would be all about it though

it just would make them a little more usabletheres no reason a badger should have 2 up top when a t2 version lacksi usually haul in a bustard when i mine since i cant fly nor do i have an orca and being able to salv and tbeam rat wrecks is what made me think of this in the first placeim sure there are pleanty of other cool things you could do with a transport ship im just not thinking of themso since noone has linked me to where this was before has no one brought this upskan
because they are designed to run like hell and survive what your implying is to make them do things they are not designed to dothis is not a big problem nor is it an issue hence why your not getting a whole heck of alot of feedback let alone support
ever see someone use a cane or destroyer to salv with all those gunmissile hardpoints arent there for no reasonif yer gonna troll do it righti know its not high priority and i asked if it had been brought up before
last i checked we where discussing transport ships not battlecruisers or destroyersi suggest you take your own advice kid before you embarrass yourself
well since they changed the cov ops haulers to support black ops it only makes due sense that all of them should have twin high slots for their cloak and covert cyno tractor or other utility module
definately not supported are you madthe risk vs reward in pvp is already crazy and making isk as a actual pvper is difficultor tell that to the noob whos spent 3 months ratting and slogging to get his shiny new raven only to get ganked on a mission or something and then have nothing left only to go through the slog again infact remove account as soo many people already do becuase of the crazy loss factor in eve
a real police force will not respond in 30 seconds it will not have indestructible vehicles it will not have the most powerful weapons it will not have the cash to respwan sentries every 5 minute must we go onthis issue is not about realism its about fun please take this circlejerk somewhere else
forgot to support my own topic xd
in this current economic situation i agree
agree with this as well
i aggre fully with this allso
what a stupid idea you are a stupid boy
i support this
not supportedthough you are allowed to sell your character for isk it requires you to pay for the transfer if paypal methods of payment were possible given the easy and free way you can transfer cash between paypal accounts then it would side further into a a rmt venturei can foresee characters being sold where you ask for the buyer to send the funds to your paypal account for transfer that alone is opening up a can of worms even everything went smoothly it would enable someone to farm accounts without having to pay any real money on their own buyers would pay cash for transfers and isk sellers trade isk for plex to pay for accounts to sell and the cycle would continue i know it can be done now but at least it takes some validation and responsibility instead of a paypal account which only needs an email
hehe a bump is in order
the failings of the tools the csm is expected to work with have been an omnipresent barrier to the body working at peak efficiency for over a year now and youve come up with a very clean way of eliminating just about all of those problems i like this proposal a lot  not even necessarily because the idea of supporting the csm with the necessary tools is a new one but also because this is an intelligent and plausible way of getting ccp to do it fully supported
i support this idea
ok i support this but heres my take on thingscsm was supposed to be that bridge between player and ccp long awaited and much neededyaybut since its inception i hear absolutley nothing from csm members apart from the goons smacking on coad i know they are there but where what are they doing whats happening they should be almost acting like the community unionsometimes its seems members are doing this for kudos and not for the real purpose it was meant for so i really would liek to see more communication whats happening with issues minutes and agendas of meetings more communication on the forums discussions etclet us know you are there and actually doing something
well it would be cool imo
oi page 16 that wont dofree complimentary bump
what thats too far from the topbump
hehe i think you need a bump
bumps are goodme grumbles at the fact he will have to wait needlessly for yet an another skill to finish before he can inject next skill he wants
for those of us with varying sec statuses give us an option to warn us before going into a system of a certain security and while we are at it let the autopilot follow suit by avoiding all systems at your discretionthere is a warning for entering low sec so why not one for high sec
are you implying there are low security pilots who are stupid enough to enter high sec and get shot down because laughs they didnt check the sec rating of the destination systemsepic fail man epic failnot supportedlook before you leap kid
i will say it again because you dont read anything apparently they have a warning for going into lowsec why not for going into high secim starting to wonder if you actually play the game because you seem to troll just about every thread
this has been proposed before and the basic response is usuallypay attentionunlike a noob who has no idea that low sec  you can be pwned at will now a player with a negative sec status character should hopefully have a firm enough grasp of game mechanics to know where they should and should not flyand you can already set your autopilot to avoid specific systems mine for instance will not plot a course to or through jita  because i hate it there but arent you tards the ones always telling us that if we get popped while autopiloting we deserve it
this is not for autopiloting purposes its for creating a route from point a to point b in which we can click the yellow gate warp to and jump rinse and repeat if you werent so narrow minded you would understand this has applications other than your first assumptions yes everyone knows you can avoid systems and rather than manually going through and click avoid every x security to y security system this will do it for youmapquest does it superfuture eve cantif you havent noticed there is an autopilot setting that is stay in low sec when possible which gives you a purely lowsec route if possible and shows where it will not be low secwhy not make that option available for people who have varying sec statuses you offer absolutely no help ever in any thread you just get angry at people because of them merely posting ideas please find a life
so what your trying to tell me is that you lost your ship because you failed to pay attention to where you where goingsome of us actually pay attention to that sort of thing you know why cant you
i support the addition of a more customizable autopilot its not a matter of paying attention its a matter of finding the most efficient route as fast as possible we should have an option that says avoid systems of xx security or above and another that says avoid systems of xx security or below  its still plenty possible to mess up but it would make it a bit easier on all of us
finding a life wont do me any good id just lose it again ask me where my car keys are i bet i dont knowoh and i fixed your post to accurately reflect my actual reason for raging on the forum
this id support had this been what the op suggested id have supported it unortunately it wasnt so i didnt
thats rational and that i can supportnot the foolishness the op came up with and the context in which he worded it
um how about bring back hull tanking either way i have suffered the awesome fate of having 4 hull left and the really fun bit of repping it afterwards for anybody that hasnt trust me youre better off not suffering that experience
they should also introduce hull repping drones as wellsupportedreal men hull tank
have someone else do it for you with a remote hull repper they rep twice as much as local hull reppers and only 20 as long cycle time so basically rep 50 of what a remote armour rep doess the big downside is the might higher cap use local hull reps on the other hand use less caps but rep much lesssecondimo just use a friend or take the time required to rep yourself up even something like an abaddon with 10k hull hp max skill only take about 67 minutes to rep itself back up with the 4 hull reppers that it can fit or 45 seconds with 7 large remote hull reppers applied instead which an abaddon can perma run with the right fit
except you get almost capless 60 across the board resists from 1 module hull tanks are only viable as a buffer tank activerepping a hulltank is lunacy and making it doable seems unnecessary nay overpowered since you could use your mids for reppers lows with a damage control and bulkheads and wouldnt need to make the decision between buffer resists or rep amount that everyone else has to make
well i still really want this so bump it is
i endorse this serviceproduct
would be nice to solve thatto many kills are lost to that
easily worst idea ever congratswhy should my gametime be limited by some faceless forum moderators kneejerk reaction to what i post on the forumsthe fact that only sploitermonkeys support this idea is proof enough it is 
yes that was the joke this entire thread is a pretty obvious parody at least if you know about mr trassier i should really have made my original post have a thumb in it but i couldnt quite do it
dumbest idea and affront to free speech what hell is wrong with you guys its not like it audio dont read it if it offends you shakes headbut im willing to compromise if youre ban in forum you cant log into the forum leave the game playing to the gamers bears slaps forehead
yes and ban all accounts on the same ip and creditcard being able to use alts to get around bans should be punishable by extra long bans
extend bans from any game to every other game someone plays also remove temporary bans and make them all permanent banned people should have their computers and other internetcapable devices seized aswell put them into jail for a few years theres no place in this socity for people who brake eveo forum rules personally i wouldnt mind if theyd be just liquidated
hi gents lark here the op has been stalking me on the forums for some time now he and his little squad of cronies check all my posts and report any which infringe on the rules hence my most recent holiday for my main hes also quite upset that my corp and i are inhibiting his game time by harrassing his corp camping them in and causing them to haemorrhage members he cant do anything to me in game so hes trying to kick up a fuss here on the forums we have of course been vigourously trolling him for his efforts but its time to put on my csm hat and become a bit seriousmy personal serious opinion on this matter and his other thread also a callout thread if you check the initials in his examples if you are so upset by someones actions or words on an internets message board which deals with an internets spaceships game then you should probably get out more i believe during one of the previous csms it was discussed that ccp believe the forums to be a seperate entity to the game i see it that way too and not just because i personally have just copped a 6 monther obviously if illeagal things are posted on the forums then its a different matter but for run of the mill smack trolling and banter that goes a little to far banning someone in game for forum indiscretions especially if their efame in game and on the forums attracts the kind of attention from those with too much time on their hands on the subject of alt posting its the account that is banned not the individual and its exactly the same in game as well for minor offensesregardless this topic is a troll aimed at me im done with it and rest assured wont be taking it to any csm meetings
not sure if serious
a game ban is more severe than a forum ban sogame ban  forum ban yesforum ban  game ban noip ban  no  a lot of internet connections use dynamic ips so banning ips is pointless and could cause issues for non banned players account ban  yes  ban all accounts of an abuser
either serious or very consistent in her joking
this topic is not a troll aimed at larkonis trassler it is simply something i feel needs to be implemented into the game paranoia and assuptions have no place in this thread this is a legitimate post of a legitimate idea
i would support a game and forum ban for trolls that start stupid idea threads how about that i know it would never fly since stupid aint against the rules or anything but its a pleasant thought
yeah considering how easy it is to get forum bans without realizing it and how theres no way to appeal a permanent forum ban and how you really dont know how many strikes you have left unless you keep all your warning emailsgreeeat idea
no
i might have known youd support a stupid idea for getting at people you cant touch in game
hmm i didnt make myself very clear i use altclick to change the point of reference if you altclick on something in space it functions as look at shortcut
i like it how it is but having a broken mouse like mine that randomly double clicks when you click once is a freaking pain loli dont want it changed from this option but if they added joystick control it would be awsome lol d
didnt know that but id like to have more shortcuts ingame changeablebtw is tehre is list of all those pesky nonchangeable shortcuts with the mouse etc i didnt know the altclick one
unsupportedbuy a better mousebuy a new mouse UFFFD399 in pc world if your in the uk
theres no reason not to allow more customization those who like double clicking can double click those who dont can make their own shortcut
hm whats this its a bump is what it is i still think this would be very useful for many thingsbump
ohgod bumpi would love to make a ninja have to work for a wreckskan
firstly this is a bit of a spur of the moment thinkup and would greatly appreciate criticism constructive or lolfail that would help to put this out as a proposalinsurance seems to be a bit of a minefield and it helps sustain pvp quite a bit in cutting off some of the loss if you lose a ship butlets look at an irl car insurance company if you are an older good driver who is living in a safe area of town with a respectable job and a small car with not alot of power the insurance will be cheap as chipsfor the same company if you are a young driver who lives in a concrete jungle with no job and write off very powerful cars every 2 months the insurance goes through the roofthis could be applied to eve considering the type of ship being insured the space in which the character is in most of the time the type of activities the character undertakes the amount of payouts previously had the security status of the character etcthis idea would make it harshly unfair to pirates in any kind of combat oriented ship i admit this is an area where suggestions would be appreciatedand it would also allow characters with high security status who usually mine in high sec to fly the equivalent combat ship for a tiny price compared but thats how insurance works is it not risk basedother issues such as selfdestructing being concorded agressing in lowsec then being ganged down should also invalidate the insurance as it would with normal insuranceagain i stress this would be quite a complex thing for ccp to do and its just a rough idea but any advice would be greatly appreciated i do not admit to being a hardcore pvper so i do need you pvpers to give me your side of it and how it affects youthanks
ok you do realize why the insurance was brought into play right it was put into place because it was causing a huge grind and the game was not any fun you also do realize that this a game about space shipsand the physics of all this is fake you get that right
yes i am aware that the physics of it are fake and that it is scifi i dont go to the supermarket looking for webs to stop usain bolt facerolling the sprintsbut no i was not aware that was the reason for the introduction of insurance but this doesnt make it a grind at all does it or atleast not as bad is it would be without insuranceexample you buy ship a for 100000000 isk and say you are in terrible standing and lose ships quite frequently for whatever reason your insurance costs say 35000000 isk but covers the full value of the shipokay so captain care will insure the same ship for 20000000 isk or whatever value you attribute to it its not actually that bad a grindpurely random figures though btwwhat would you consider as a horrible grind
he was talking about the grind to get new ships wthout insurance
this is usually when someone with an eye patch and a bird on his shoulder says dont fly what you cant afford to lose
oh whats this a shameless bump
horrible ideathe game is already set to make annoying the miner or mr a profession lets cut those two a break and say hell to the noespecially when someone could just tow away a jet can no barge is going to catch upand dear lord to make us play tug of war with tbeam strengthskan
yes please it would help prevent noobs from locking themselves out of certain parts of empire besides people who dont want faction mission will just decline them anyways a really clever mission runner will move to a place where heshe has 34 agents available to them within 23j so having to decline a mission here and there is little more than a nuisance if that eventhat being said i think there should be a list of missions to choose from and not just acceptdecline not saying all the missions in the game should be available to choose from but a list of 45 different ones would be nice at least that way you would never get the same mission twice in a row unless you really wanted it anyways
not supported you dont want to run a mission thats fine suffer the appropriate consequences  which include hving to wait potentially to get another mission or having to fly to another agent to look for work

similar to the videos played at race selection would be good if not difficultawkward to implement for each corporationwhile its true that the corporation descriptions are limited in usefulness to veteran players i recall when i first started playing way back when i enjoyed reading about the different corporations and the descriptions were the sole piece of information i used to pick my first ever agent before i understood quality and levelsit seems odd that given ccps improvements and implementations to the new player experience that they would remove something like this
this is not a proposal seeking recent cargo and bay changes to be in any way rolled backthis is a proposal that asks the csm to discuss raising with ccp a long outstanding balancing and use issue related to carriers that has now been made extremely pointed by the changes to carrier cargo and bays in short the issue is the matter of refitting capitals on operations and the difficulties presented by the high volume of capital modules 4000m3 before the recent changes it was at least conceivable that a carrier could by making fitting compromises ie at least one extender and combining its hangar array 10000m3 and cargo eg 3500m3 extended at least once to 4460m3 carry sufficient capital weapons to for example retool a dreadnought or refit itself and others it was at least possible even if rarely done it has been rather severely limited ever since the capital modules were increased in volume from 1000m3 but it was possible and as it was possible it was a bit harder to argue this was an issueit is now beyond rationality to consider it a carrier may carry a couple of capital mods and retool itself in a limited way but it cannot possibly serve as a tender for capital refitting in any practical mannerthis is a severe limitation on a combat logistics vessel it can handily operate as a refitting tender for subcapitals and that is fine however if the carrier is to be a combat logistics vessel capable of operating fully in all fleet types then the question of capital module volumes needs to be revisited speaking personally im happy to accept that the carrier is not a volume shipper of freight if thats the design decision but i think a quid pro quo is needed on the question of its role as a refitting tender for sister capitalsi am aware of the general game balance issues when it comes to the volume of capital modules i know why they were changed from 1000m3 to 4000m3 a couple of years ago i know that the bogeyman here is mineral compressionbut its not good enough for the spectre of mineral compression and a fix for it on capital modules to significantly impair a designated and intended ability of a line of shipsi dont ask for a specific fix i can think of a few eg as special purpose bays are the new flavour capital refit array  a large bay 40000m3 at least on carriers and motherships that can only hold capital modules would be an option but i think it is more important to get this on ccps agenda so they can consider the options and their merits than for me to be offering up my prescriptions i ask the csm to discuss the merits of bringing this issue to the attention of ccp for rebalancing and ask people to support this if they agree there is an issue here with the use of carriers and capital refitting in space in essence if carrierhauling is to be less efficient now thats fine but in return can there please be a consideration of restoring the ability supposedly designed and accepted of carriers operating as capital refit platformscheerscosmo
supportedthough sadly i think youve melted the brain of the tldr crowd
im not sure that carriers need this capability  their smas can only carry battleships so making them battleship tenders onlywhich their current corp hangars are sufficient for would seem adequate i like the idea of motherships being fleet tenders though and giving them the ability to hold a large number of modules for capital refittingalong with a sma expansion and a couple other wacky ideas ive seen like the ability to access corp hangars at long range for droneammoice replenishment would be perfectly reasonable limited support
it also seemed odd to me that the carriermoms never had any major capital support roles this idea makes sense if anything it would define the role of a mothership greatly so and make them useful and the titan less tempting aside from the obvious
supporting thisi would be lovely to see ships able to fill their roles more suitably even roles that they are at present perhaps not used in regularly
stupid support this box unchecking itself after a preview
not supported at least for carriersyou can still outfit capital sized vessels just bring along a transport
well i think 999 of the eve community are not happy with how ccp conducts its customer service personally it feels that they dont care and we will get round to it when we do attitude shut up and put up attitude to be frank its not acceptable there is also a serious lack of communication internallyone occasion had to wait 4 days for a petition to be answered as my account was accidently expired by ccp 4 days i couldnt log in to the game nothing eventually got a standard reply as it was happening to a few people then a gm answers my initial petition and states send me an email address for the account but you have my account details from the petition and this issue has been resolved why didnt you know do you guys even look at the petitions or what your community tells you it doesnt seem soanyway surely ccp can put in a real customer service help desk just like most companies do1st line support  helpdesk just normal techie people help with account issues logging in billing payments immediate support yes even have a phone number we can ring on2nd line support  maybe things like stuck issues3rd line support  gms then get involved with the finer detail issues reimbursements game issues etcthis would free up gms to actually spend time on real problems not silly account billing issues etc and we probably wont have to wait so longalso communication in general i seriously would like to ccp devsgms management etc to get more involved with its players on the forums talk to us get involved dont just wait until fanfest if theres topics on the forums then hey get involved in the discussionsyes we have dev blogs but thats not getting involved
lowsec lp is the same as highsec lp  its summed at the corporation level are you asking for say a lowsec cn station to have better offers than a highsec cn station theres no way i can support that
i actually could it would bring more to lowsec danhything bringin people to lowsec i fully endurse d
and what would prevnt a high sec runner to go to lowsec for better lp shop while running in high sec still carebearpirates camping station and gatesie its not boost to low sec as missions dont have to be run in lowsec to gain lp for that corporations
of course a change like this would require extra coding to identify whether for example the lp was acquired from a high sec navy agent or a low sec navy agent but im pretty sure it can be done
what your asking for would likely be much easier achieved by increasing the lp payout from losec agents the problem is finding the point where you can tempt away those who can be tempted there will always be a block who wont budge for anything and thats their playstyle without opening up the can of worms that would be major alliance interest
fully supporting this product d
i dont mind people seeing my plus fours or when im ed my fives
people like kazuo using 60 build slots will by their heavy usage cause their build costs to go up powerusers of npc build slots will have a much harder time finding lowcost build slotsand lets be honest here a battleship requires 100k m3 in raw minerals to build so new players trying to get into that market already need to have substantial hauling ability or understand courier contracts everything else can be pretty easily handled by a t1 industrial yes it requires more time input from everyone looking to maximize their profits but smallerscale manufacturers are much more flexible and this gives them greater ability to undercut the entrenched manufacturers by saving on production costsprojecting a bit are we
they do it for offices already why not
nothing
i guess people using suckpuff mice can wait until next year to get their zoom buttons back
rofl 65 issues werent the main purpose of the csm to filter the wishes of the playerbase to the most important topics 
i would say that considering the number of posts that go up in the assembly hall weve done a pretty good job of filtering themwhy are you complaining its no skin off your nose if we take 6 issues or 600 issues most of them are minor ui tweaks anyway
where did you get the impression from that i were complaining  i was rather being amusedand what is that talking about my nose skin dude seriously 
im not 100 sure if youre poking fun at ccps development time or if youre implying that were not going to be talking about the zoom buttons but its number 24 on the list bring back zoom buttonsand as larkonis points out there are quite a few minor issues in the list that will not require extensive discussion with ccp
oh i can think of one thats missing
in addition to the 3rd csms issue list there are several issues that the 1st or 2nd csm passed that ccp has yet to resolve things like incentivizing 00 or reverting back to the old cyno jump effect these topics are still ostensibly on the table even though theyre not on this list

close thisits useless adapt or play wow
agreed2 seconds is way too long a delay since most skirmishers and scouts are in ships that warp  9aus or greater these fast warping ships cannot realistically scan for targets while in warp any longer as they will by pass by potential targets without having them on scan entirely

im pretty sure that 600 characters cannot fit on 100 accounts the math just doesnt work outas for the 2 second delay it is too much i can see that if they have bots spamming the scanner like 10 times a second if thats even possible then it might create some lag however this change is limiting actual player skill all they ned to do is change it to a 5 second delay and it would be sooo much betterhonestly when i see posts like yours i wonder how stupid you can actually be im so astounded by your stupidity that i actually dont know what to say in many cases i cant argue against you because you made no point other than saying we are butt hurt s i really dont know what else to say to your completely incompetent post you must never use the scanner

i didnt read all posts here but i can definitely tell you t2 ammo needs a rework in there design when manufacturing them it takes way to much time and the profit margin is ridiculously lowi would rather spend my time and isk getting the lp for faction ammo than building t2 ammoi dont know if its considered charges or something cause i know nothing about mining but making omber crystal and the likes takes more time for the copy and inventions  ridiculus i cant say numbers cause i dont have them in front of mebut i was angry when i saw those especially when i saw the profit margin at the endalsmost the same as the ones i do regularly no dont ask i wont tell what i invent lol

bumpalmost a month since this has started and still no response at all from ccp im starting to wonder if this is all a waste of time as this whole subforum and the csm is it really that hard to get a devgmrep to post anything even if its damage control also i finally gave ccp another chance and petitioned a ship loss that happened due to docking mechanics being bull as usual the petition and another different one have been open for 6 days now with no response at all but then again ive had a friend wait for a carrier to be reimbursed for a month so ill prob still be waiting till the new csm gets elected next year
i have always wondered why this wasnt already in the game
ive thought about it honestly if a cov ops ship can use a standard cloak and a cov ops cloak for any number of reasons it makes sense to assume that a black ops battleship could use either cov ops cynos and or a standard cyno likewisenot that it makes much sense but i suppose for those who dont want to train for covert cynos would like this optionsupported

i kind of like the situation
this is not an issue ccp is in a position to affect it is a matter of supply and demand in a player run marketstop flying hacs or stop dying in themnot supported
the price of hacs seem ok to me not that i currently can afford one but no point in moaning about thatthere are in my opinion issues with the moons but that has more to do with the value distribution among the moons rather than the total need changing the needed materals should only have the effect to even out the value among the different classes of moons not so much the end price it could be affected if evening out the value would lead to a greater total production capability but im not so sure it would might actually rather lead to a slightly higher cost due to more work being needed to do with regards to pos fueling and such
ok im going to go out on a limb here and suggest that the ferogel exploit lead to the drop in hac prices rather than 00 wars restricting productionas for ccp interfering with the market thats been going on for some time what about tech 2 bpos and inventioni dont think the issue is t2 ship prices rather t2 insurance or lack there of sort that out and it wouldnt be a problem
that means messing up t2 rig market some t2 ships can drop 70 mil of blue salvage now lets increase the insurance and u will see me buying up hacs insure them self distruct them and then salvageim gallente and i only buy a deimos becasue a ishtar is more expensive 160m without rigs  fittings and i dont want to use drones that will explain the fact that deimost will be bought always even if they are 600m why do i wanna buy a hac cause a vexor has drones a thorax has too little dps and dies very very quickly max 300 dps the eos sucks drones and guns wtf and the astarte is too expensive hello 350m  always primary so better stick too cepters and ausault frigs for gallente or skill up for other races question who are using hacs not the people in low sec gate guns and not the people in high sec mission runners bs a well maybe the mercs mostly hacs are used in 00 now lets tie that too income gain how much isk does a avarage player makes per hour in 00 20m is the correct answere a t2 fitted deimos with rigs cost about 220 million 11 hours of grinding now wonder if that is alot or if its fair vs the fact that its a ship designed for 00 warefare
mwhauhaha gotta love those pirate tears flowing idiot tears imo toobut i never would of thought of that about the marketfor being to high  lmao the op made my weekand yeahits fine as it isbelieve me
stop buying them and theyll lower in pricehacs are for noobs
but hacs are used by pirates mostly and the likes i like you  you put fuel in fiyamwihaha
while the op is mostly pure whine there is a useful idea herethe number of players in the game is increasing not decreasing and thus the number of pilots wanting to fly t2 ships is also increasing however the total supply of the moon minerals needed to make these ships is stagnant every other building material in the game has a moreorless unlimited supply there can always be more missions runrats killed minerals mined some new factor creating more r64 moons fixing alchemy etc will likely be needed in the future to accommodate the rising demand
please spare a thought for the people trying to keep the prices high this is their livelihood they have children to feed
exactly the supplydemand relationship is broken in this case and ccp should look into it i havent bought a hac in 18 months but prices have still gone up they went up because of ccps intervention which was needed but had this unfortunate side effect
yep ships aint to expsensive it the insurance thats the killer 19mill for a vaga when the cost is around 200mill to buy and fit
you mean youre blaming ccp for fixing the pos exploit that artificially depressed prices
i believe hes saying that fixing the exploit was good and needed but that there remains an underlying problem in placing a hard permanent cap on the quantity of materials needed for the modules and ships used by a rapidly increasing number of players the eventual consequence of the current mechanic is shortfall as the number and sp totals of the eve populace growson a side note snide is not the same thing as smart clever or insightful comments like yours dont make you look intelligent  they make you look like you dont get what the grownups are talking about the same remark posed as a question or suggestion would have had the same constructive effect without making you seem like either a jerk or an idiot
i support this idea 100 abuse of a system for the sake of trolling or harrassment in any format is wrong and should be dealt with strongly
up
if a single crystal has a 1 in 1000 chance of breaking then on average its lifespan is 1000 shotsit also means that on average youre replacing a single crystal every 125 or 142 rounds fired depending on whether you have 7 or 8 guns also how much more or less effort does it take for the servers to generate a random number as opposed to ticking a variable down by one i can see this as a good idea if there could be found evidence that it would lighten the server load
im pretty sure that the status quo is actually random as well  youll note the volatility stat on fancy crystals i dont fly amarr myself but im pretty sure that if you put in two identical freshbuilt crystals into two identical guns they will break at different times due to the randomness of volatility as such the status quo is both generating a random number and decrementing the hp whereas the proposal would just generate the random number and not need to keep the hp stat thus im pretty sure that this actually would be a server improvement
as an amarr pilot im gonna have to say no this idea is terrible
there are ways to do a quick randomthe one that comes to mind is to set aside an area of memory to contain an array of random numberegtake 64kb of memory and fill it from a random number generator with numbers in the range 065535this gives just over 30000 random 16bit integers do this when the server boots upthen every time you want a random number you just move the array pointer up one  back to the start if off endthen pluck the number out the arrayits a lot quicker during play time than using a pseudo rnd function which can use quite a few cpu cyclesto clarify on the subject of 1in1000 chance that might not be the actual numberit was just an examplei have no idea how many shots you normally get out of a crystal
suuported imagine the tears when someone shells out 15m for a fresh xl mf set and they shatter on the first shot awesome
not supportedi pvp alot and just the chance of one of my crystals breaking on the first shot would force me to put an extra set in adding another few millions to the costalso what do you do with grouped weapons and crystals shattering do all guns stop firing and all your crystals break or is the chance calculated per each crystal or is the 11000 applied once to count for all 5
yay

sup tortas a pure min pilot out side of caps i disagree with alot of points in the thread that start minmattar arent as effective as other bss i live in 00 where to survive if someone calls titan you either try and tank it or you try and get outa the bubbles and warp ive found nothing more effective at quick high speed burns than minmattar bss i clear bubbles and am into warp much faster than 90 of the fleet therefore survive longer also the high alpha means you can cut chunks away giving them shorter time to recoveralso to those who say the pest is a bad rr boat you sir are wrong it is an amazing rr boat with the right fits seeing as close up you can get a repper 2 torps and acs in there and nothing but the repper is using cap in your high slots and you can fit point and web in the mids with a cap booster and mwd yes you armor tank try it might change your mind the mailstrom ive only dabled with not a fan of shield tanking actively just buffers a personal opinion tho but what i have used it for is tank breaking on command ships you can fit a ship with a stunning alpha if your support fleet cant keep the active rep in check then your the hammer and their the anviltho i do agree the mixd weapon types does require more training it also opens you up to much more in your favour i mean look at the huginn mixed damage and fast you cant keep damage off you even if your tracking disrupting and if you have ecm jams prolly wont even hold minmattars have by far the best interdictors in the game the sabre can shred any of the other three with ease their afs are bad ass tough and yet fast the hurricane is so versatile you never no what to expect from it acs arties nano tank neut could be anything the rupture is the i win button for t1 cruisers fit right you cant lose 1v1 and its counterparts muninn and the broadsword are both wicked if you know how to use em the broadsword being rated as the best hic or second best you can fly and the muninn being well thats a minmattar secret if you havent figured it out keep looking the vaga fast tackler and deadly to a tee rapier best hot drop cyno ships availible if your dropping onto a pos for some good ganks as well as being one of the scarier recons out there you got a station camper or a guy sitting on a low sec gate nano phoon and he aint there no more n2m the machariel the thrasher which is a great sniping dessie and can alpha through inties and frigs slieps are deadly to boat and we all know that the only ships that really dissappoint me are the vargur panther maelstrom and to some degree the rapier and huginn and vaga after the speed nerf they all lost that charm of if your fast enough to catch me your not the type of ship that wants to
needs moar support plx
i have to say that atraxerxes is right in some way the way this is presented mining will be hurt a lot and anyone in local wont have a clue whats going on on the other side so just because of mining yeah i dont support it cause mining is already hard right now causewell mining ships sucks lol thats why you need a gang for defence and with what this is proposedits going to get worsebut when i look at wormhole local and how it worksits awesomealways on the edge cause you need to be aware and alert wow i love it for combat and all the rest i do support it but i have say it again only because of the mining part this is not a good idea
how do i
i would like to know whats the stance of the council and ccp regarding a single player using multiple trial accounts 45 trained to drakes and disruptors to hit target ships in high secsuicide ganking and then ditch the trial after 23 weeks and start with new ones on constant rotation and thus never suffer security standing losses is this a sort of cheating is this an accepted practice
recycling alts for the purpose of resetting your security standing is a bannable offense last i heard
agreed if you have reason to suspect this sort of activity is going on file a petition so ccp can look into the matter
i have petitioned it and i was told it would be investigated that was almost a week ago and im still tracking this crew and theyre still active maybe ccp is waiting for this batch of trials to be recycled otherwise i dont know they cannot say if actions will be taken or not and if so which actions i mostly wanted to know if this was a tolerated practice and if i was wasting my time or not but thanks
in theory it is prohibited in practice it is hard to prove your best bet probably is to et screenshots of the characters with very low standing and then when biomassed of the character search saying they dont existit should fall in the same category of evading concord dong the crime but evading the consequences
the gm department is constantly overwhelmed and thus can be slow especially when it comes time to do investigations that take digginglike this one ive seen petitions take more than a week to answer on simpler issues sadly youll probably just have to wait still best of luck

qft this is like asking for there to be a warning about freeforah ok this is like asking for ccp to delete freeforah

supportconsidering the potential costs associated with failing to update your clone this is an obvious oversight in the ui design though i would ideally like to see an option to autoupdate your clone every time your clone sp retention  your current spsto the naysayers  sure its an easy thing to do and people should be doing it themselves but in a game this complex and with so many things to keep tabs on will a little userfriendliness really be that horrid i honestly cant see why this shouldnt be an automated process its not like anyone would ever knowingly refuse to update their clone for cost reasons  and the penalty is quite severe for something that can happen purely by accident or due to exhaustionangerintoxicationetc

i posted the following in another beleaguered whine thread and thought it might be good to liberated and made its own issue in short the demand for t2 will continue to increase as time goes on and pilots get older but the supply of moon minerals particularly the valuable r64s at best remains constant and at worst decreases due to blockades etc this is a unique mechanic in eve  the supply of any other material ore isk construction blocks etc can be increased arbitrarily to meet increasing demands on the economybefore i go any further let me add that this is not an emorage thread against the evil 00 alliances nor an attempt to demonopolize or otherwise interfere with their ability to fund their continued hold of sovereign nullsec i simply wish to point out the problem inherent in the system and open up dialogue on possible solutions that would be of benefit to all those evil alliance bastards included  here are some possible suggestions of ways that the inevitable shortage of t2 materials might be avoided will be updated with the ideas of others as they are suggested and discussed1 lower the timematerial costs of the alchemy system to make it a valid method of meeting market demandcurrently alchemy requires so many resources that it is hard to imagine it ever becoming a costeffective supplement to the t2 market  so much so that by the time alchemy breaks even the t2 market will have already entered severe shortfalls reducing these costs would make it a more viable alternative2 create a ship class capable of moon mining alongside a pospart of the reason that minerals and named modules will never experience widespread shortfalls is that and increase in the cost of tritanium or arbalest heavy missile launchers encourages miners and mission runners to step up production of these items through mining more rocks or running more missions such an option is not currently available to increase the amount of moon minerals that can be generated in a given time perioda ship class capable of mining moon minerals would allow pilots most likely those in big alliances since they have access to the moons to increase production one idea might be a supercap version of the rorqual  and thus unable to be built outside sov nullsec  that can moon mine while providing fleet bonuses or even systemwide bonuses to mining while operational3 create an alchemy style mechanic that allows t3 materials to be converted to t2 and vice versaselfexplanatory has the disadvantage of removing alliance control over t2 manufacturing additionally the current form of alchemy in the game is already broken and adding another may not help the advantage would be normalizing the t2 and t3 markets in a way that allow either to compensate for shortages in the other4 create an exploration site which allows specialized ships to mine various moon minerals these would likely be restricted to lowsecnullsecwspace to encourage pilots to branch out beyond highsec space might be designed to involve some player interaction beyond typical mining eg mining moving comets etc5 create a method of converting asteroid minerals into moon minerals this solution could either complement or replace the current alchemy mechanic solution proposed by wardecevading npccorpalt  whose full solution may be found hereplease indicate your support and propose other ideas
4 provide an alternate source of t2 materials to take the hard cap off the most common proposal ive seen for this would be comet mining  have objects that can be mined with special gear and refine into t2 materials make them transient and higherdifficulty so that people dont just mine them into oblivion like they do with ice but itd provide a source not related to moons while still leaving moons as the best and easiest source of t2 materials similar to how bpos are for t2 still supporting a fix to the ludicrous status quo
im actually leaning in the direction of herschs proposal as fix have sites you can scan down that could be exploited by ships with the right equipmentyou could as an aside also only make them available in low and null sec or wh space adding an inducement to get more characters out of high sec and into those areas where the risk is higher
that already exists iirc isnt alchemy what you are looking for
might possibly incorporate it into a probeable site of some sort rough idea say a new spin on a salvaging site where you interact with ruins of a moon mining facility or possibly a new type of profession in the gravimetric vein in which a new type of miner is introduced with moon asteroids with varying elemental composition one way or another this is obviously something that could become a future issue
from the op
probeable comets which spawn in lowsec and 00 and can be ninjamined for exotic materials for a few hoursdaysweeks before they move on would at least be a tangible reason for moneymakers to leave highsec for a timeso support not necessarily for the ops suggested solutions not because i disagree but because i have no strong opinion either way but for something to address the problem that it raised and the ideas in the posts that followed
i dont know if its been proposed before but here goes current situation you give access to do inventionsmepebuilding and he could cancel everything and probably get away which is not goodwhat i would like is the person that installs the job for researchmepe or building for example is the only one to cancel itno one else makes sense to me current situation if i give access to a pos in my corp that corp member as access to every pos in the corptechnicallyi would want that to be changed in a way that i want to have the option to give him access to a certain pos onlywould make sense to me anywayit occured to me when i wanted to do a wormhole and put a pos in and give access to that posthen i realised it would be nice to give acces to only that pos im aware i can do restrictions on arrays and equip in the posbut still
i am not sure if this is the way to pursue these changes but im definatley on board for a hard look at the way pos permissions are done and how they are definedsupporting the general idea of reviewingrevising pos permissionsin regards to your specific proposals i agree with number 2number 1 is a little more problematic however since my corp owns the pos i as a director should be able to cancel the jobs in that lab if i need to do so for example we need to move the bpos out due to a wardec or what have you having them bound to just one character seems like it could cause more grief than it prevents
sorry about that yes thats what i meant with 1 of course if your a director or a ceo or have a higher position in the corp you should be able to cancel it for not the average joe out thereeither for greifing stealing or doesnt know squat what hes doing thats the whole point of 1 thank you for noticing my lack of details on this
yes installing jobs and canceling jobs should be separate roles also split up science and industry and do a similar thing for corporate contracts and orders not sure how practical 2 is though  do you want to be the guy who sets access to thousands of poses owned by an alliance with thousands of members still supporting for 1
i loldand not supported for the sheer tons of problems it would inducedo you get concorded for bumping something in highsec
if your goal is to kill the trading hubs you are on the right trackbut it will kill the server too and any bigh fleet
i dont agree with ships taking damage from bumping but a special ship for that would be pretty nice  maybe a bc or cruiser sized vessel with a bumb field generator or something like that limit it to lowsec  00 maybewould be a funny and usefull ship  dont needs many guns or maybe even without guns it would be funits not easy to add new ships to the game cause they can make others useless but a ramcruiser would surely find its usersi was thinking if it is even room in game for new roleships but this one could actually work out
it already exists  get a fleet stabber with bs mwd on it
since my previous proposal to fix ratting in lowsec and 00 was well received i decided to offer my suggestion to do the same for miningill begin by stating my experience with mining is very limited so if there are glaring problems with my approach i hope you wont hold that against me i did some jetcan mining for crokite in an osprey to purchase my first battleship and havent mined anything since mining today isnt what it was in 2006 back then if you had access to an abc ore in 00 near a refinery you could make good isk i recall selling my refined zydrine for something around 4500 iskunit or morewhat happened to miningsimply put the drone regions happened ccp added several new regions with npcs who had no bounties but dropped copious amounts of alloys that refine into high end minerals after some tinkering with npc goods t1 modules and other things we arrived at the situation we find ourselves in today1 the most profitable ore to mine in empire space including lowsec is veldspar the only exception is possibly some individuals and corporations with multiple accounts who have long term purchase contracts for ice products2 low sec ores aside from ice are worthless3 00 ores aside from bistot and arkanor are mined only sparingly in light of the risk vs reward valueveldspar is worth roughly 100 iskm3 while gneiss dark ochre amd spudomain are closer to 150160 a whopping 50 improvement for mining in 00 and all the risk and difficulty that entails with the price crash of zydrine im not sure why or if anyone mines crokite anymore except that it might be more profitable than rattingsimple approach to a solutionmy goal is to make lowsec and 00 mining more profitable in terms of iskhour considering the risk and difficulties involved the simplest solution would be to nerf drone region npcs give them bounties and drops like other rats and call it a day however i assume ccp had a reason for creating them the way they are weve also seen a number of alliances develop the space in those regions dropping outposts forming rental alliances etc based on what the rats drop to make a wholesale change along those lines now would be extremely unfair to the residents of those regions regardless how many might welcome itin order to make lowsec and 00 ores i propose two changes to their refine tables1 add large amounts of low end and small amounts of mid end minerals to their refines  trit and pye for the most part and perhaps smaller amounts of mexallon isogen and nocxium this serves two purposes a it makes the ore more valuable and b it provides another source of those materials making lowsec and 00 more independent from refined highsec mission drops2 add very small amounts of valuable moon minerals to their refines for ores like jaspet and hedbergite this could be as low as 0 or 1 dysprosium and promethium for gneiss dark ochre and spudomain it could be 1 to 3 per refine for the abc ores perhaps as many as 3 to 5 this will have the effect of minimizing the monopoly on high end moons currently enjoyed by basically two power blocs in eve without nerfing the value of those moons entirelyim not really sure what to do about mercoxit my understanding is it spawns alongside the abc ores but isnt typically mined im not sure it needs to be changedi dont propose changing the highsec ores if ccp thought it was unabalancing having people mine basically only one ore in highsec they would have done something about it by now
now as far as the amounts referenced in part 1 above  here are my thoughts when i say large amounts i mean it 10003000 trit and 5001000 pye for lowsec ores three times that for poorer 00 ores and ten times that for abc make all these ores provide a balance of materials some can be higher for one than another since entire regions are typically limited to one of the abc ores they should get good amounts of anything  helping to balance out the present large disparity between crokite and arkanor rich regionsas far as adding moon materials in that was my idea to compare to ccps plans to possibly boost alchemy and rumors they intend to nerf moon mining having valuable systems based solely on their moon minerals isnt necessarily a bad thing in and of itself it adds some variety to the game where you would otherwise only shoot pos that serve as logistics routes or station system sov claiming you can take or leave my suggestion about adding small amounts of r64 moon minerals the bulk of my proposal is to add low end and mid end minerals to ores that people either a dont mine at all or b mine with much lower frequency than they did previously the addition of moon minerals is an extra plus in my view and isnt critical to my proposal either wayfor highsec denizens dont worry that refined mission loot will become worthless overnight with these changes they wont the amounts i propose to add to these ores are infinitesimal when you look at the mineral requirements of capital and supercapital ships people will and perhaps should still need to import low and mid ends to lowsec and 00 to build these shipsat most my changes will help lowsec and 00 industrialists in ammunition module and ship production decreasing their reliance on highsec mission loot and veldspar
the only problem with this is that veldspar isnt really the king of empire space anymore eith the recent price crash in tritanium i havent looked at the numbers in about a week but currently anything that will give a good yield of mexallon is the ore to get with plagioclase seeming to be top of the heap at least for where i normally mine in empireall of that aside i agree with your overall concern which is that its simply not worth going into low and nullsec to mine for most people i dont know that i exactly like the idea of tinkering with the refine rates of the various ores  there should still be some give and take between the various regions what has happened and should not ahve been allowed to is that empire has become largely self sufficient theres really no pressing need to go into null sec for the really rare ores or at least not enough of one to drive more people into doing it given the inherent risksat any rate im throwing in my support to the more general idea of reincentivizing nullsec and low sec space somehow
remove t1 loot from mission  that should help you
i have one concern about your proposal to base lowends in highend rock look at every important production system ccp has implemented other than t1 minerals  t2 moons t1 salvage t2 salvage and t3 salvage all of them suffer from atrocious problems with bottlenecking the materials drop in a mostlyfixed pattern they get used in a different mostlyfixed pattern and theres a handful of matsarmor plates melted nanoribbons dysprosium etc that act as the limiting reagent for the entire production chain t1 has never suffered from this problem too badlythere were some oldschool issues with zydrine and some more recent ones with tritanium but theyre minor by comparison because t1 ore is discrete if theres a shortage of trit mine veld thats what everyone has spent the last year doing of course but the more important point is that they could if theres a shortage of cap consoles you can sort of adjust your production by doing amarrspace missions but thats a high barrier to entry for a fairly minor change overall and if theres a shortage of dysprosium there is nothing whatsoever that can be done about it this is why i find it so hilarious when ccp changes t3 drop rates to clear out bottlenecks  its not actually possible to eliminate bottlenecks under their system just to move them around the point of all this rambling is that youd be changing the advantage that t1 production has over t2 right now if its impossible to produce a megaheavy ore without pumping out lowends then you go from a system where production can shift to cover needs to one where it cant which leads to bottlenecks and the type of ineffective flailing were seeing as ccp tries to correct the problems with their production systems that should have been spotted by an intern with a calculator inside an hour back when they were being developed as such i cant really endorse a proposal to homogenize minerals creating a lowendheavy ore for 00 maybe but adding lowends to existing 00 ore no
t2 hardwiring are ganglink implants and omegassecondly getting implants in 00 is vey easy once you have an agent to do missions forcurrently i get 10k lp a mission from my agents per a level 4however there are nothing else to buy buy implants oh and crappy ammofaction ships do not sell well in a high frequency thus implants are the only real source of lp incomeso before you all start saying great idea goto 00 and learn how that works if you do this 00 agents will be redundant

it has been 6 years now and few months since we started playing this awesome game well few of us at leastnot counting beta dand for at least 4 years i have been cursing how it is well the things i would like to see improvedi would like to see few changes that wont make that big of a difference to the game play as it is today other then make it more exciting1 overviewi suggest that on overview wont show the names of the pilots ccp has been talking about making fights last longer well this would make that happen in bigger fleet fights at least a bit longer and more exciting since broadcasting might make it harder because of lag until players start making new ways to call targets faster other reasons why names should be removed is to protect certain players that some might call eve celebs or even the fleets main target callers and so on this would also make the killmails more exciting since you wont know who you where shooting until he dies or you see his capsule name that tend to show your name right awayi could keep on explaining the next 2 pages with how it will probably change the game play but i think this will do with overviewplease visit your user settings to reenable images2 local chat coop with overview changethis i have cursed allot and since they dont want to remove the names so i thought about something to change it without hurting the local chat exploitsso how about make the names of the pilots that are either neutral or hostile to be blank local will be like it is but you see neutral guys with no names and no pictures and if you right click on them to get info you will simply only see their cooperations and alliance information but the char info is not possibleif they talk in local their names will only appear there and you could right click on them there to send them mail and so on so we wont get harraset for our game play and so on who needs to talk to your enemy anyway dso if the guy likes to hang around talking in local he kind of gives away who he is and what he might be flying if he is the only hostile in localother then we see his name in local and if you had good memory you instantly know what he is flyingwell it depends where you are kind of hard to explainplease visit your user settings to reenable images3 buddy listwell since i mentioned the 2 things above this whould be involved with these changesi would like to see buddy list removed but thats kind of silly so why havent it been changed into like any instant message programs that we use eg msn skype icq and so on
general suggestion1 proposal per posting that makes it easier for people to support your proposal otherwise you might miss support when people dont like a part
thinking about it i doubt your proposal for the overview would change muchthe suggestion for local is just stupidthe buddy list thing sounds nice but space is limited in eve so it should be an optional featuresum up not supported
this all is one changelike a train wagon wont work very well without the train it self
hehe well thats perfect then isent it overview wont change much so a change like that is a win win for alllocal give to much information for the lazy players or every players you see a hostile join your local and you see his name and since you have fought him few times before you instantly know what hes up to and the other way around the enemy is frustrated that you might know what hes up tobuddy list must be lagging the server just imagen 50 of the chrs ingame have 218 known titan pilots on theyr list  few friends and enemys
i dont get it the overview part at leastoverview doesnt show pilot names already it shows ship name for pvp people rename their ships as a matter of standard practice
the overview shows you the names unless you edited your overview settings to not show it if you look at the first picture you notice that on the left side of the picture then on the right side i have edited the picturemaybe you are talking about the directional scanner in there it never tells us the name of the pilots
not supported cause u will damage fleet fight severly and make spies useless i like calling the fcs primary
thx for making my point even strongerthats one of the things that need to be protected ccp mentioned once they like to see longer battlessurely all fcs will fear this change will happen if they cant take out the target callers and fcs then there is a bigger chance they will lose or more lossesand when you mean this will damage the fleet severly do you mean more losses d im sure thats just for the better good
not supported nothing is truly wrong
i do not support making the game harder to play so 1 and 3 are out for 2 ill say what ive said to every other changelocal thread in existence  i will support changing local when the other intel tools are improved enough to make it possible
it cant generate a covert cyno so that wouldnt help and a tractor isnt much of a utility mod for covert fleets  what are you tractoring
doesnt matter what they were you were making it sound like using a ship for something other than it was intended was somehow horrible and wrongi just pointed out two common ships that are used for other thingsand kid   srslylets not bring out the internet tough guy just go hide under your bridge or whatever it is trolls doskan
you heard me you obviously do not understand the ships nor do you know how to use them properly if your making such ridiculous notions of how they should be usedi suggest you go back and do your homework before you make off the wall suggestionsthey have a very specific nicheand are quite good at there job stop trying to make it an issue that they cant do what you want them to doherch  i fit a tractor for the purposes of grabbing cans in certain situations but i rarely ever need that second sloti wouldnt even use it for probing if i wanted to do that i should be using a cov ops frigate or a force recon ship at that rate
the prowler is the ship to use for wspace exploration as it has plenty of cargo capacity and can fit both a probe launcher and a cloak all the rest of the blockade runners cant do that buff the other three
and that would be all it could do no weapons no drones just look and run and hidenot very useful to me in that aspectcovops frigate at that rate would be betterbut ok whatever floats your boat
why would should one be vastly better than the rest there a few less slots in other places but the rest of the races all play the sameoh and my homework i did it and read up to see if anyone else had suggested it couldnt find it and since no one made a post about it im going to assume no one did i even asked if it was covered beforetry again mr trollskan
asking why and flying the ship are 2 entirely different things smartassthey dont have alot of room to fit things as it is its just a stealth cargo can at bestturning it into a salvager would work but you wouldnt have the cov ops cloaking fitted thats for sure unless you wantted to fly up to eachandeverywreckeven with defense bonuses once you get shot at your likely to die anywayas ive said along with other pilots they are meant to run and escape not get shot atthe fact the prowler has a 2nd high slot is likely to compensate for the lack of midlow slots that other ships havei also have amarrian transport ships as well they tend to haul a bit more than the prolwer but only 1 high slot does this mean its not fair hardly its its own nicheif the prowler is just that unusual its likely some ccp dev that did it for some odd reasonpoint being this isnt an issue and its not earth shattering to say the least
different  better the prowler is the only br that cant carry a packaged cruiser hull in return its the only one to get a utility high seems reasonable to me
the ship would have to be very valuable to risk paying a ransom since there is no reason for a pirate to honor it theres no reason for anyone to pay it
besides realism whats your point or goal behind this reduce pvp  your in a good direction since you want to remove insuranceincrease pvp  nope bad ideapersonally i dont like it because of the realism but there is something wrong by given an insurrance to a person that blew someone up in high sec cause he felt like it suicide looting or whatever the cause isbesides thatno its fineso in all i cant support your idea
removing the npc insurances would allow player corporations to offer insurance services  contractseve is about player control therefore its allways good to remove npc controlled systems from the game and enable the players to replace them
free insurance  80 for first 6 monthsafter that welcome to the harsh world of eveisk faucet of insurance props up mineral prices and makes all shipsmods more expensivei would prefer cheaper ships and mods to the artificially high prices we pay today because of insuranceinsurance rewards the carelesstime for it to go
what the op did not get is that insurance is used in multiple ways including minerals price controlthe wrong part of insurance is that in certain periods it allows for free ships when people should always have to pay something for a loss yes beyond fittings and rigs as deterrent for sucking or as deterrent for spamming zero cost ships vs expensive weak ships want to suicide 300m worth of stuff then afford 30m loss in the ship  2030 in fittings not zero it is not eve karma

you know a simpler solution to that problem is just if csm members update the status in their own sponsored threads in the assembly hall with a link to the meeting minutes that the issue was contained in i see old csmvotedon threads being bumped up again all the time and people dont realize the issue is already done
mazz i used to do that but when your reply isnt the first or last post in the thread people post in it anyway th eonly way to stop it getting bumped is to ask for it to get locked which only helps when the issue has actually been implemented into the game
maybe there can be a bit of coding done to allow csm members to lock only the threads of issues that have been raised after having the final word on the issue in that forum section onlyi guess nobody liked csm having mod powers but if the mod actions were logged and there are very specific rules as to what can be locked then there is very little potential for abusebesides csm not having the ability to organize the discussion happening in the domain they are supposed to be running is absolutely silly limited mod powers are definitely called for within our domain and safeguarded to prevent abuse by anyoneits also far easier then implementing a whole new system for voting issues up and down which wont be a whole lot more used or accessible then the current system with these tweaks
id say there is an opportunity for ccp to really show exceptional appreciation towards the playerbase by how should i say actually creating a functioning player operated middlehands to deviate the development of this game into new spheresi endorse this possibility
i had though of this than realised that they might already be here but there like camera dronesinvisible to us they could be how we pull stuff into our holds our put it out to cans that are already in space

this is a stupid suggestionin the autopilot settings there already is an option that saysprefer less secure  stay in 00 to 04 where possible
are you daftwhat exactly do you think this means thenmight not be the best wording to express the idea but since youre so smart you shouldve figured that out
this is a stupid answer there is no option that lets you avoid say systems with security above 7
did you play around with the security penalty slider
yes i have and thats all it isa slider i never use it cause it seems a bit difficult to get to the right setting idk how the f a 100 point scale somehow determines what security system my autopilot setting decides to send me through
supporting a more customizable directionfinder program in eve
yes i have played with the directional slider and it doesnt work the way one would expect it to it still treats all high sec as a lump hi sec and all low sec as a lump lowsec and there is no avoid 0 sec option which if you are in lownull sec very often you will notice a much different play style im not asking to cut out all possibility of stupidity nor did i loose a ship in high sec but i think its odd that it goes one way and not the other not to mention people forgetting about 0 sec altogether
did you it didnt do much difference last time i tried itthe warning message proposal is a bit silly but fixing the autopilot setting would be neat so supporting that
and you point issay wait cant shield tankers do this already but more efficientlyhull tanking is win bring it back seeing as a max of 60 resists isnt much 3
heres what id like to eventually see and i say eventually because it would be a massive undertaking some kind of player housingstation agent missionsthe addition of clothingarmorweapons and the required skill books to upgrade themfinally have a reason for trading mindflood crystal egg or drop they boost a skill temporarily but not without some kind of negative impact
where is the priority list
no wonder there is so many on the list
oops its the one posted i left off the priority numbers but its sorted in ascending order by priority so the first item on the list has the highest priority
thats their noses skin
five months after the original post and this topic keeps on bouncing up what does that tell you ccp
why was this even changed
ccp was having its period
bring this back im in caps soon
you can make the fitting difficult the range suck the launchers expensive  but please make rockets do great dps on small to medium targets
i support this as well
sounds like a great idea until a spy creates manual bookmarks from the corp list and sells them to someone bms are server side for a reason as well as the laborious act of copying them
what is the difference between the current situation expect that the act of copying them manually will be skipped there will never be a way of an secure bookmark management published in this game and i dont it anyway not hereedit you dont have to use such a system for confidential bookmarks btw it would just be very nice from ccp to just give us the option
i so agree with nerevar dwemorwe have the same probelm in our corp

i dont understand this line of reasoning ccp is the god of the eve universe they can do whatever the hell they want to the game if you think eve is some kind of ultrarealistic economic simulator youre mistaken sure its complex for an mmo but thats not saying much if you were to imagine real moons across multiple star systems do you really think each moon would contain an unlimited supply of only certain kinds of minerals or would they each have a ratio of most minerals with some moons having more of some kinds than othersso if you want to bust out with the supply and demand stuff lets go ahead and talk about redesigning the moon mining system to give us a more accurate representation of a real market supplyid vastly prefer to see moon minerals come out of each moon in ratios of lots of minerals that changed over time so that instead of these capture the flag type static points that everyone wants to hold the situation is far more dynamic and unpredictablethen we can talk about supply and demand
simple solution is to download the greasemonkey plugin for firefox and grab the caod script you can ignore users corps and alliances which puts the tools in your hands and not ccps
if thats the case then i love this ideaand re the poster immediately above if you fly amarr and use crystals that can break you need to be supplying spares anyways unless you plan to fly with fresh crystals only if this idea is implemented in a way that doesnt alter the average lifespan of a crystal then the change to gameplay will be minimal
anything to get over the issues damaged crystals create if you happen to have a reasonable number of amarr ships and ammo managing moving them between characters is just such a massive pain
so instead of a gradual decline that is easily predictable you want a system which i cant predict since it relies only on a single roll of a dice i cant really think of a more horrible change the difference might be insignificant from a statistical viewpoint but from my gameplay perspective it would be a mojor change for the worsethe issue of damaged crystals is annoying but ill take it over this any day of the week find a better solution to it
i find it absolutely surprising how overstated the importance of the 1000 shot average is in this threadyes this would solve the stacking issue however this comes at the great expense of the charges reliability in comparison to other weapons remember there is no random chance that all of a sudden your missile launcher will lose a few thousand missiles from your holdunder the current system there is a certain understanding that your crystal will last at least a certain amount of time this allows for the combat pilot to effectively plan for scenarios rest assured that the crystal if new will last throughout the engagement if its an extended action then he can plan for a spare set of crystals much like any other pilot would bring more ammo to an anticipated long fighti could go on and on explaining the significance of this proposal and the fallacy of the assertion that because its still on average 1000 shots its close enough to the way it was beforeinstead i decided to actually program a demonstration at this linkthis flash program runs through 50 crystals in succession recording how many shots it can take until it breaks the line graph below the numerical data represents the amount of shots taken per crystal notice how high and low the spikes are for the shatter method and how even and predictable the current method isclick the red circle to run the tests againwhich would you rather have to deal with knowing this informationme id rather have a predictable life span and deal with the minor inconvenience
even if i had no other reasons to dislike this idea this post would be more than enough to say no waysadism shouldnt be the driving force for changes in a gamealso i simply do not trust random chances enough we can see with invention how streaks of bad luck can cause problemsi see no reason to keep a dozen backup crystals all the time just in case several in a row decide to shatter on first shotwhich one would have to assume because otherwise youre without ammo and no means to get new ones
yes one of the stated cons is you would need to carry sparesi dont know what happens currently when a crystal wears out i dont take out badly damaged crystals and never live long enough to find out for grouped weapons the calculation would be alteredso 5 guns grouped would have a 1200 chance of losing a single crystal each shot based on a crystal that has a 11000 chance normallythe odds may be better than 1200  11000 as that was a number i used as an exampledoes anyone know how many shots you normally get from a fresh crystal on the issue of stop firing i would support the idea that if there are spares in the hold  a spare crystal would reload automagically and guns would continue firingso from a programing point of view  it would be simpler to comsume a spare crystal from the cargo hold if available if no spare then obviosly the gun would no longer firea grouped weapon of 5 with 1200 chance would turn to a grouped weapon of 4 with a 1250 chance etcon the grounds of cost  due to extra crystals being carried  lost in combatif the runs per batch on the blueprint were doubled this could compensate for extra costs
you cant predict pvp you are far more likelly to die due to the unpredicatable nature of pvp before you run out of crystalsecm  major randomevery time you fire your guns the damage is randomfrom a gameplay perspective all you need to do is carry spares
very nice programhow come the bottom graph is not completely flat  is that due to volatility i ran the test a lot of times it looks fine to mei think the lowest total shots i saw was 37k and more often than not the shatter method gave more shots than the current methodwhat happens in your simulation to damaged crystals how about programing it in a way that means a player takes out 50 crystals with random amounts of damage from 0 to 100  while the shatter method only ever uses new crystals or better still how about an input that allows us to specify the maximum amount of damage we allow for current crystals and then looks at crystal usage over many encounters
i wonder if removing the randomness from volatility will help with the lag situationso amarr people whats more inconvenient having a crystal break more randomly as per the above guys graph or having damaged crystals that cant go on contract or be repaired or stacked
id rather have the damaged crystals as they will continue to fire until worn outrandomly occurring or not you cant possibly predict random occurrences of shattering crystalspeople will throw a fit about them particularly the ones who assume there wont be an issueat least the current mechanics are predictable
absolutely incorrectecms randomness is actually much more predictable without getting into the ugly details a cursory glance at the system shows that it is indeed manageable through skills analysis of strengths etcyes this is due to volatility the top graph fires crystals with a 11000 chance of being destroyed and tallies the total shots the high peaks and low troughs are important especially the low dips in the graph unpredictable and importantly unreliable this is unreasonable for something as mundane as ammo also notice how in zero instances does the current method result in crystals that produce less than 100 shots the suggested method allows for very low yield crystals plenty of times yielding 1 shot before dyinggood catch there again look at how consistent the current system is the relatively flat line means you can reliably plan for it this is extremely important for something as basic as ammo the current suggestion is akin to having a mwd being able to randomly lower your maximum speed instead of making you go lolfastdamaged crystals are accounted for the bottom graph fires calculating the chance for a crystal to be damaged adding this damage until the crystal is destroyed and then starting again until it goes through 50 crystalsi thought about adding input to change some of the variables but i found the exercise to be meaningless for the purposes of this demonstrationi hope i helped you understand whats going on here
i ran your program 20 times here are the results from the number of total shots53286 5042249818 5010346278 4930455105 4996747523 5010660728 4933451380 4962049348 4989361428 5013851838 4957554817 5063359406 4900852012 4946345387 4995954598 4850852187 5052850869 4967252268 4947739815 5095631808 505711019899 997237the left column is shatter chance methodthe right column is the current methodas you can see the shatter chance method actually averaged out at more shots per crystal than the current methodthe  denotes any run where a crystal shattered on its first shotthis only happened once in 1000 crystalsthis is hardle surprising as the crysals tested had a 11000 chance of shattering on each shotthis is pretty much as expected crystal usage has not changed significantlywhat is really important is the effect it has on pvp and what you need to analyse is the chance of a ship runing out of crystals in combat before it is destroyedlets take a crusader as an example on a solo roamcrusader fits 4 guns so lets take 8 crystalsshatter chance per shot  1250 with grouped weaponslets say it takes 50 shots on average to destroy an opponent if your soloon averagethis means you can kill 15 opponents before your down to your last spare crystalyou are gonna be droppin off loot and reloading spare crystals much more often than every 15 kills and very few players manage a 151 ratio soloper fight  what is the chance of me losing firepower due to crystal loss assuming 50 shots to kill an opponentchance of losing any 1 crystal  1250  50  15chance of losing 5 crystals and therefore being down on firepower  15  15  15  15  15  13125so you would need to rack up 1500 kills before there is a 50 chance that you might suffer once from total crystal failureif you dont like those odds then taking 2 spare crystals per gun puts the chance of firepower loss at 1 in 2000000 encountersnow to work out the isk cost impact to pvp of a crytal shatter method  cost of losing spare crystals  profit from extra crystals recovered from other player wrecks  profit from not having to discard badly damaged crystals  profit from the extra time you have to rat  due to not having to sort out badly damaged crystals from one that are still ok 
i very rarely have a ship that last a lifespan of a set of crystals  usually it dies before that so for me this would add an additional cost overhead i have no problems affording it but it would add to the cost of my standard t1 cruiser fitsalso if we take the 5 grouped lasers with the proposed system there would be a 05 chance that ill lose firepower on a shot since weapon groups cannot work with 4 crystals in a 5 group it would stop firing if the system was changed so that my 5 lasers were able to fire with 4 crystals only while maintaining the shatter chance i would be okay with it otherwise not
again you only bother to look at and analyze one set of data there is a good reason i showed all the other data in my programyes you have the possibility of more shots overall however you can plan for nothing in the new system your pros and cons are small instances and meaningless compared to the con of suddenly losing good crystals because of a dice roll the reality that the program conveys and through my own work on it 100s of iterationsis that there is inherent unreliability in a part of the game that is supposed to be the most reliableany other pilot can tell how much longer he has to fight based on how much ammo he has there is no legitimate reason to deny the amarr that a better solution is neededthe demo program for those who missed it
please share the good reason for the other data as i am missing that bitonly 2 things matter as far as i can see1 how much use will i get from a crystal on average  this is unchanged as per your demo 2 how many crystals do i need to carry to prevent total crystal losstaking along a spare set means i get to kill 15 ships on average before i need to go get more crystalsand i can allways carry t1 as an emergency reservei only wish my killloss ratio was anywhere near this you cant plan for anything in this game anyway what are you going on about no pilot knows how many kills heshe will get before hisher ship is destroyedno missile users knows how much ammo to takeno hybrid user knows how much ammo to takeno projectile user knows how much ammo to takeno laser user knows how much ammo to take in either scenariothe numbers i quoted you demonstate that even with a 11000 chance which is probably on the high side you only need to take 1 spare crystal for each gunif you want to remove any possiblity of it ever happening then take 2 spares per gun why is that a big deal your crystals are gonna die with certainty with either methodits really not as big a deal as you seem to thinkas demonstrated carrying spares means you will lose a few more when your ship is destroyed thats it on the drawback frontit is highly unliklly you will run out of crystals in combat and you can always carry t1 as a fallbackincorrect  you just look at how many spares you have left once your down to 1 spare its time to go reloadno one is trying to deny the amarr anythingwhat i am trying to do is get backing for a proposal that will fix the amarr ammo problemthe pluses massive outway the drawbacks the drawback and the only drawback is as stated 1000 times now is you will need to carry spares no more hangars  cans full off half dead crystals that dont get used or get trashed because they dont have enough life left in themno more ships that cant be contractedresale of second hand crystals becomes possiblei killed this guy last night twice in facti got 6 scorch small i cant use t2 atm how can i sell them for profit i cant contract and i cant sell on market cause there busted and i cant rep themif you want to take about being denied things  how about all the pilots who get a kill and get denied profit because they cant resell t2 laser ammo 
bobbeh you didnt mention artillery or maybe i need to read it again the tempest is very poor with artillery and maybe only slightly subpar with autocannons depending on the circumstances from the thread in ships n modsi like the idea of a highestdps longrange weapon  152km increasing artillerys damage mod but leaving its range alone it may make fleets think twice about engagement ranges if they have to leave out their highest dps ships to engage at 180 or 200 i havent looked at how it performs vs other weapons systems with close range ammo but at least increasing the damage on tremor may fix artillery in generali feel that the maelstrom performs fine compared to its competition at least with autocannons but the tempest really needs something how about a marauderlike bonus a base 100 bonus to projectiles and drop either the rof or damage bonus depending on what you want out of it give it 4 turrets 6 highs with the rof bonus left it will have slightly more turret dps  the same as the maelstrom with the damage bonus left it will have the same dps it had a bit less than the maelstroms only with much higher volley damage the mael will still have a tanking bonus and superior slot layout for tanking as well as an extra heavy drone than on the pest so give it a 5 or 10 falloff bonus as its new 2nd bonus and call it a daythere are many ways you can go about fixing artillery but artillery is broken no matter how you look at it and while you can come up with some very circumstantial fits where the tempest isnt flatout bad it certainly doesnt shine the tempest does less damage from guns and has a smaller dronebey has less ehp less room for fittings and no tanking bonus like the maelstom has in return it gets a small speed and agility increase and 2 spare highslots you might say well those highs are great for armor rr  youd be right but armor tanking a pest makes it give up its already poor damage to have near the tank of other ships in its class i dont know that it needs anything drastic but i feel strongly that something like a 25 or 50 falloff bonus would not unbalance this ship that on top of fixing artillery one way or another may be enough
to put it more simply i want artillerys damage mod increased and the tempest to get the vargurs t1 bonusesminmatar battleship skill bonus 5 bonus to large projectile turret rate of fire and 10 bonus to large projectile turret falloff per levelchanging it to a marauderstyle gun layout like the nightmare will allow it to keep its utility highs

multiple solutions have been proposed for taking care of the mess that is mining and expanding it as a careerat the same time t2 materials are still a largely bottlenecked resource and alchemy simply shifted it to another bottlenecked resource both will completely fail to scale as the player base growswhat i see as the best solution to this is to add reactions to convert asteroid ores directly into t2 materials this is preferable to making asteroids contain some t2 materials because by making the reactions destructive players have the choice of converting asteroids to t1 materials or t2 materials allowing the value of asteroids to always be the higher of the two having a second price floor will make asteroids more resistant to market fluctuationsat the same time this will create something that is drastically needed a way to produce t2 materials that scales effectively with individual player effortlets make a hypothetical example of how this could work consider the following reactions1 compressed arkonor  100 impure dysporite composite1 compressed bistot  100 impure prometium composite1 compressed crokite  100 impure ferroflurite composite1 compressed dark ochre  100 impure fluxed mercurite compositerefinables 100 impure dysporite composite  90 dysporite 100 impure prometium composite  100 prometium 100 impure ferroflurite composite  45 ferrofluid  45 hyperflurite 100 impure fluxed mercurite composite  1400 neo mercurite  1400 fluxed condensateswhy not just react directly into materialsrequires new mechanics since the reaction process does not support multiple outputs at the moment not taxable more difficult to scale properly with 5 and 10 ore qualitieswhy compressed oresilo capacity also gives the rorqual a much more integral role in the processwhy those materialsgeography and availability see the followup post link at the bottom of this posthow much isk are we talking aboutthe numbers would need rebalancing but a maxskilled hulk with a tanked fit and t2 crystals would pull something like arkonor 49mhr bistot 40mhr crokite 458mhr dark ochre 35mhris that too much would supply glut send t2 material prices into freefallt2 material prices would fall to match the value of the ore after refinement because once it goes below there people will stop reacting it t1 refinement essentially acts as a marketregulated price floor which will prevent freefallhow does this help flesh out mining as a careerhauling compression reaction tower maintenance and market watching all become factors and feed directly into the t2 production system this creates a lot of room for upward growth and integration instead of relatively boring suck on rock move to station melt sellim not reading all that why is this a good idea improves the value of asteroid mining without causing a glut of t1 minerals makes asteroid mining more resilient to market fluctuations adds a source of t2 material that scales with player activity but has a marketregulated price floor so t2 prices wont just crater allows asteroid mining to have a place in a more complex production operation creates more options at all levels of production leading to more diverse gameplay rewards the expansion of mining operations into lowsecnullsec without forcing it there gives the rorquals ore compression function a major role its fully taxable very easy for ccp to develop as it can be done completely with existing game mechanicssome questions were asked about this their answers have been moved to another post click here

pretty good idea
yes
the cometmoon asteroids idea has merit im not sure how ccp would feel about providing an option that circumvents the current monopoly system but what the hell  balance isnt my problem and im not making any money off of moon mins in my mind limiting these spawns to lowsec00whs would be both more likely to be implemented and would encourage pilots to move below 05 space it would also be nice if these comets function on a different mechanic than current belt roids maybe they should actually move perhaps quickly
at a global level perhaps havent seen any figures on the total amount produced by alchemy there are something like 1000 chrom moons in the game and about 200 prom moonsso the theoretical production of prometium ignoring cadmium as it is the secondary input in both would be about 50000 of which the alchemy would be 20however chromium is needed in other reactions that are needed as well and of course cadmium is also needed which should be about as common as chrommy guess would be that at most 20 of the chrom moons are used for alchemy giving a total addition of 47 prometium and that amount isnt going to make much of an impact to the price and availability of prometium
supported not necessarily your particular ideas but a new scalable source of moon minerals possibly new types of roids that give moon minerals could be available from probed sites and mining missions with good minerals available from lvl 4 missions and 00 sites
add moon mining to wspaceadd more 00 space 4 new npc regions plxadd moon minerals to hauler spawn drop tablestweak the alchemy conversion rates
signed signed signedthe moonmineral bottleneck compared with everrising demand is spiraling prices too high and wont stop until the bottleneck is loosened or eve starts dying population dropthat said the cheaper rigs have made the problem somewhat less urgent than it was before by converging t1 and t2 performance by making riggedout t1 ships worth fitting but its still a serious issue
yes its a good idea
a mining ship that has to use an afterburner i like it  finally a job where minmatar would not be prenerfed for once
someone in another thread brought the idea up to just make every moon in eve drop a certain amount of everything so every moon drops his amount of chromium scandium atmospheric gases and also a small amount of dyspro and prometium the better moons just drop more of the high end mineralsstill i really really like the idea of explorationcomets could imagine comet types like asteroids low sec comets drop some r16 stuff and nullsec up to r64 in a good mix of junk crap and valuable stuffedit please never never ever make moons mineable by players i dont wanna see macros on the moons too
i used to do a bit of moon mining and always wondered why ccp didnt allow moon mining to have random amounts of r6432168gases w the primary type it would help stabilize the pricing a bit and reduce the inflation within eve
this might well be a good idea that would help a lot of things demonopolization for one but im reluctant to suggest changes which continue to depend on moon mining  after all the whole problem is that there are a limited unchanging quantity of moons and thus a limited number of mins however this idea might well deserve its own issue and id likely support iti agree with you that macroers are bad thats why if such a capability were added to a ship i think it would have to be either a capital or super capital ship that needs to enter a sort of siege mode in order to mine moons perhaps sovereignty would also be necessary but it would certainly have to be used outside of a pos shield  the idea would be that these ships are profitable but vulnerable if someone can meet these requirements and wants to macro a multibillion isk ship thats ccps problemthe benefit of either an exploration or shipbased solution is that it makes production scalable as prices increase more people look for the sites or more alliances build the moon mining supercap etc this solves the finite problem inherent in the current system that said id hate to be the poor bastard stuck in a supercap dedicated to mining an object that never moves or disappears frankly some sort of mining but more challenginginterestingdangerous etc solution seems better than adding yet another ship that generates isk by sitting perfectly still
not to be a total wise ass but comets move rather fast id like to see a hulk mine them the picture in my head more points to an inty struggeling to catch the damned thing to mine from itbut supported
or you could try not giving roles to saboteurs or idiots
for once i agree with a goon 
change the current mechanic 2 second delay  which everyone knows is broken  to the followingdscanner produces heat when useddscanner has a specific maxiumum heat capacitydscanner cools down over timeegdscanner heat when used  2 thermsdscanner heat capacity  40 thermsdscanner cooldown rate  1 therm per secondscanner wont work when overheatedoralternativelly scanning when overheated causes 10 structure damage to ship so now i can scan 20 times in rapid succestion enough for grabing targetsi cant abuse the scanner in the long term i can not do any more than 1 scan every 2 secondseveryones a winner
 oh yeah and while your in there fix the goddam angle widget so that the angles are spaced the same distance apart15 degress is a nightmare to selectfiddly ui is not good game design
no it would be the only module then which produces heat by defaultnot supportedi even like
how about if i call it decalibration instead of heat 
i can see some system like this working theyd probably want to test something like this to see how it actually worked in practice maybe make each therm 2 seconds long which essentially is the same delay as it is today but that might be too long for pvpers idk it would probably work and i dont know about calling it heat but id much rather have a system that works like this than just the straight 2 second delay with that god awful error banner in the middle of your screen
you would fire any engineer if you have to decalibrate your scanner every few minutes
just shut up and actually offer some useful input to this thread this fix would completely fix the scanner making each therm or whatever you want to call it have 1 second to cool off you effectively force a bot to only click it once every 2 seconds exactly what they have to do now this is a perfect fix yeah it might need tweaking in the role play area as to why this is happening but its a good idea
no this requires a rewrite or adding to the mechanics that are not originally tied to said functionthe only thing i could see as reasonable is making the cycles longerbut everyone already hates thatflame me all you want but the truth is undeniablethis just makes a simple problem a hell of a lot more complicated than it needs to be
the warp scramblingdisrupting notificaton system needs an overhaul for several reasonsfirst of all the current way you are notified that you are being scrambled is a little 16x16 pixture in your overview which is very easy to miss or be completely unaware of escpeically in a mission with 20rats furthermore when in a pvp engagement here is no way to differentiate a scrambler from a disruptor which is now important because scramblers now stop microwarp drives it is clear this needs to be changeda few solutionsput in a ring around the capacitor on the hudor a bar somewhere it really doesnt matter that showed green when not being disrupted or scrambled yellow when disrupted and red when scrambled if you were being scrambled and disrupted at the same time then it wuld still display redput in something similar to when your being jammed a bar of text saying you are being scrambled or disruptedmore obvious visual effects for something as important as being scrambledalso please make it so that aura says you are being warp scrambled when you are warp scrambled again this was taken out during the apoc patch and i think its rediculous that it was removed and should be reimplemented asapsome of these ideas have been taken from other people i just want this to be implemented asap so not going to bother hunting for links

who here remembers the old blue warp scramble effectothat said theres this little option that moves broadcast entries to the top of the overview maybe this function could be enhancedabusedmodified for ew aswell plzalthough im sure falcon pilots would be against it 
well you already know you are warp scrambled when you try to hit your mwd and it isnt going onnot really sure we need more than the overview iconsnot long ago there was no icon at all to show you ewar
while i tend to agree with the population that says its a bit obviousthe games ui makes it very not so obvious until its too lateyou spend most of your time trying to figure out whether your lagging or notthere should be kind of an indicator aside from the spending 5 to 10 seconds checking sanity solutionif your being warp scrammed your should see an indicator on your ships thrust indicator like a red outlineweb could be yellow anything but what we have now

instead of having a scanner that is nothing more than does target exist within this distance and angleyn that requires many adjustments per second each of which requiring a server call why not have a directional scanner that actually does somethingim thinking of keeping the existing directional scanner range and angle limitations but also to display information of the range and angle of found target with deviation based upon range and angle chosen in the scannerfor example joe pod pilot not the infamous joe the rmter is belt ratting in a secluded nullseclowsec system an ebil piewat jumps in and does a 15 au scan in a 60 angle scanning the innermost planets five seconds later he gets a hit instead of the hit being poorly fit raven  raven navy issue   it would look more along the lines of poorly fit raven  raven navy issue  5768 au  17 scopefurthermore a cone representing the angle and a bar representing the range are displayed on the scanner window the one that was removed with revelations ii  and they intersect to form the area where the target can be the ebil piewat sees that the target is in the planet iii cluster and warps there to do a more focused and localized scan he finds joe pod pilot at planet iii  belt 7 warps and ganks him as joe pod pilot cries help me im under attack in the nearly empty local channelthis change will fill three purposes  fewer server calls abuse from macros eliminated and a scanner that is actually practical for finding ships in spacea solution like this is much better than leaving the 2 second scan interval in place also allowing the directional scan spam is not a viable solution and while i acknowledge many wont enjoy the idea of having their instant scanner taken away this proposal hopes to alienate as few people as possible while not having the network overhead and cpu cycles of what we used to have
so what your saying is to stop ds scan abuse your wanting to buff ds scanners to make them betterhow is this a solution again no im serious not trolling here just curious as to the thinking behind the op
that sort of negates the purpose of expanded probe launchers doesnt it
well the directional scan still cant give you a 100 hit you can warp to unlike probes
there already is little purpose for probe launchers the dscanner gives you everything but a 100 warpable hit
mhmit is a solution because of the five second result delay you cant spam something if its waiting to be resolved the kind of information the new scanning system is akin to what you would get to around five seconds of tweaking and rescanning in the current systemno the new directional scan system is little more than finding out where a target is relative to your present location much like how it is now the only difference is you actually get some information about it though with a pretty high deviation combat probes are for the purpose of finding out the absolute location of a ship in space while allowing you to be anywhere in the system and cloakedfurthermore i pity da foo who uses combat scan probes to find targets in a belt
not supportedyour going to make it worse and your trying to encroach on combat probes
if there was a reason to feasibly mine for anything at all per hour relative to the amount gained from ratting i would be all for it it seems the way it is balanced at the moment mining in general outside of really afking the hell out of it or running bots while youre at work is the only way to make a decent earning at it a change like this would help all players in the game outside of hardcore ratters to have a reason to do this in the first place i wouldnt say mining is the most exciting thing in the game but if you could make it at least more profitable than other ventures it would rationalize having the skills in the game in the first place
looking forward to teambuilding squad mining ops
im generally in favor of anything that reasonably attempts to address mineral and mining imbalances this op idea to address the problem takes it on in a conventional way which is finethat said the simplest conventional approach to adjusting the mineral flows would in fact modify the output of drone alloys ccp has already done this once adjusting plush to spit out a considerable amount of tritanium instead of more zydrine having lived in the drone regions the difference there is that to make money you have to manufacture or haul into empirethats a fine model once youve done the setup and you can make a killing in practical terms however the bottleneck is lowend minerals which do not drop from battleship ratsi would recommend that this be pursued further reducing the amount of highend minerals from certain alloys and increasing lowend minerals from those alloys alternatively incorporating some moonrelated products datacores salvage bits or other rewards for basic done kills to make up the iskdifference while reducing highend mineral supply would worknixing t1 loot drops from mission rats would also be a help for the situation but that would mostly affect the lowend mineral marketin general i think mining needs some serious thinking about where to take it as it has been replaced by hullmining drones and other means of obtaining key mineralsgenerally supportedkrum
ahem
the drone regions seem to mostly influence the middle end minerals
yep but why notits also possible to increase the bonus in the oreexample on the veldspar in the beltsecurity system109  about 100 velspar0807  90  velspar 10  concentred0605  70  velspar 25  concentred 5 dense0403  40  velspar 40  concentred 20 dense0201  10  velspar 50  concentred 40 densebonus on the concentred 15bonus on the dense 30 on stop the drone rUFFFDgion
only increasing yield will push prices down if there isnt a corresponding increase in demandimo first step should be to remove reprocess of mission loot pushes the earnings down for lvl4s but shouldnt be that much and it doesnt make the drone regions useless as they would be without drone poo
removing t1 loot drops from missions wold solve the issueso would this with the added benefit of reducing highend moon stranglehold
this if all mission drops are eliminatedseverely reduced it serves a twofold purpose 1 makes mining a more viable profession and 2 makes 00 a more profitable place as that nerfs the higsec l4 missions so isk farmers have to move out of empire to make the same amount of money it balances out riskreward for 00 vs empire space heck leave the drop rate alone and make refining modules only get 2550 rather than the 100 of the materialswith good skills and that will go a long way to solving the hull mining problemas it stands now l4 mission runners get five things that make them isk bounties mission rewards salvage lp rewards which can be cashed in for faction gear to sell and loot drops to sell or refine most loot that drops has bits of the high end materials that are so valuable so why with all of that would anybody mine in the first place
said a lot of times but it seem not to stickif you remove meta 0 stuff from mission you skewer the iskitems balance inflow in favor of isk enter massive inflationif that is your goal shrug
i dont know about you but meta zero stuff usually gets melted down because the minerals are more profitable to sell than the items themselves so that throws your iskitems balance into a co cked hateditalso it is just missions rats will still drop meta zero stuff mission runners are there for the isk all this does is remove one of the five ways mission runners are so overpowered isk making wise in the eve universe if you want to sell meta zero stuff to pubbies either rat it up or produce it yourself
total mission income reducesmining becomes more worthwhilepeople switch from missioning to miningenter new economy balance

not really a fan of most of the changeswhy would you want the buddy list removed sounds counterproductive to meas for local fixes delayed local would fix these problems way more than your proposal not supported
i dont want buddy list gone i want it to be like eg msn icq skype and other simular programs i take that you know how these softwares work eg i want to see you online i would have to send you a request to be your buddy and you would have to accept and we both see each other if we log in or outand for local a delayed local wont happen so i suggested another way that wont really matter it would still work the same almost you tactics and advantages wont change at all except for smaller gangs because some ppl are really known and suffer badly if their names apear on local chat and besides i really would like to get some privacy
cov ops frigate cant hold extra ammo for the site runners and store all the lovely t3 salvage now can it slap two grav rigs on the prowler and it will find everything you need to find in wh space as long as you have competant probe skillssigned for my prorater alts
signedhonestly all the arguing against doesnt have a solid basisthe op isnt talking about soloing a whplus telling someone to use a cov ops instead of a transport ship is counterproductive since the obvious implications for the use of this ship is as a cov ops cargo ship that has the ability to probe tractor or salvage while still keeping its usual cov ops cloakas has been said before in this post go back under your bridge troll before i use burning hands on that paperlike dry flesh

until that flock of drakes starts running dry then that unarmed transport ship full of juicy missiles comes into its own
shrug sure id like a second high slot on the viator even if it were for moon probing only but unless minmatar get some other boosts they must keep these little advantages

insurance should only be provided by default to members of npc corps at 50 only concord actions should not be insured which was always a oversight in my opinion insurance outside of npc corps should be provided at the corp and alliance level to aid in reimbursement programs only no individual relationship with insurance interface which would motivate corpalliance reimbursement since its another profit center if you have a bunch of miners
the idea behind ccp buying back plex for a small price of five dollars or so to give it a ten dollar profit was based on my own desire to earn real life money playing eve legitly no macro mining just good old isk earning since each gtc is based on membership then ccp is not making extra money by selling them they are just allowing real life money trading to be down in their house one of many ways to keep the rmts at bay but if they bought them back then there is no member using them thus they become extra cash and my believe is that more people would want to buy them with isk thus allowing more people to buy gtcs to sell until the markiet plateaus if you have the time to respond to this among your many responsibilities can someone let me know ccps stand on this
hah no
not supported its a bad idea a game should not be the source of real money profit for the players the savage play is harsh enough alreadyaside from all the negative game impacts there is also the problems with taxes and exchange rates

really i dont know the purpose of why you cant dock motherships and titans but please either create a hanger array or some docking mechanism i shouldnt have to log off with my char in the ship so its not visible etci want to leave my super cap in a hugh hanger and jump in a hac or something i shouldnt be made to have a second account cos i fly a mothership or titan i know directly your not made to but the game mechanics force you to unless you happy say in your super cap doing nothingmake these constructable just like outposts or something
its called a capital ship maintenance array w 155m m3 that can accommodate a titan the only thing required is sov1 for the ability to anchor so something does exist already
i really hope this is part of the any upcoming pos changesseems like a no brainer features to have on the sma at least it wont prevent the thefts but it does allow you to see who did them so they can be dealt with

this is like saying country a declares war against country b so country b joins forces with countries c d and e now country a can no longer shoot country b nor can they shoot country c d or ethere needs to be a permanently temporary timer on wardecs for example lets say alliance a declares war against alliance b on 8202009 2000 from that day until the day the wardec ends every member corp of the alliance at that specific time is affected even if a member corp of alliance b leaves subsequently every new member corp that joins the alliance has instant access to the wardec after 24 hourslets look at a different scenario alliancecorporation a delcares war against corporation b corporation b decides to join an alliance to dodge the dec to solve this no matter where corporation b goes the wardec affects then for the duration of the dec if they do join an alliance after the first week of war goes against corporation b corporation a would then have to wardec the alliance i get extremely ed off when a corporation dodges a wardec
as ive said for years war declarations should flag each and every individual pilot in an alliancecorpcorp jumps alliance war sticks with themplayer jumps corp war sticks with them though does not escalate to their new corp but new corp members can assist after the new member comes under attack by his legitimate war opponentseither way once the initial war duration expires the corpplayer flags terminate and they have to be declared against individually as entities corpalliancenow as for these joinjump exploiters in the short term this can be fixed easily by ccppetition filed gm examines petition examines corps behavior and deems it to be a purposeful alliance dodge and initiates an immediate declaration of war from the original declarer to the jumper no time duration to wait out no need for the petitioning corp to vote againif the corp continues to do this their ceo faces a possible ban or simply enough all of the corps poss are immediately put offline
i am going to be placing all those who sent me ideas into seperate threads so that people can vote and decide which fix would be considered the best for the minmatar i know that some will want to make suggestions but at this point it would be best if of the three and hopefully more that are being put up you choose the one you like the best so here is astrophobics idea on fixing the minmatar situationi believe that the weapon systems should be changed across the board this includes small and medium projectiles now i understand that minmatar are already quite good in small and fairly good in medium sized ships a percentage change across the board means that large projectiles get the most benefit from the changes while still keeping things fairly in line across the board without further ado my proposed changesall autocannons 35 falloff hit quality reduces the damage at optimal  falloff to 386 tracking independent this is a very steep loss of damage and ambits are practically manditory on every ac ship just to get decent damagetiered falloff keep the falloff the same for the middle tiered autocannons reduce the falloff of the lower tier by 10 increase the falloff of the upper tier by 10 this gives incentive to fit the larger tiered autocannons when currently there is little reason to which also addresses the low powergrid usage of low tier autocannonsammo switch fusion damage types with emp new fusion l would be 36 explosive damage 12 kinetic damage new emp l would be 26 em 12 explosive 6 kinetic the change to emp also gives a higher percentage of em damage than is currently done and gives an advantage to those who can switch out ammo before fights currently its spread too evenly between two contrasting damage types which makes it fairly mediocre this would also remedy the 9 dps loss when compared to other high damage ammos carbonized lead and other long range ammo should have their damage reduced to match other races long range ammo normally i would welcome diversity however the t2 long range ammo makes this minmatar trait simply a disadvantageartillery increase the base damage modifier by 50 compensate by increasing the rate of fire by 50 as well this gives artillery a bit of its bite back but not all of it its a midway point between the current state and the prehp boost state increase clip size by 50 as well finally increase optimal by 10 across the board the result is a higher alpha but the same dps and a little bit less pain from reloading the optimal increase is necessary to make minmatar battleships even remotely acceptable in fleet fightsthe tempest increase speed and agility by 15 change the bonuses as following damage bonus to 10 per level 5 falloff per level this gives it a little bit of seperation from the maelstrom which currently overshadows it in nearly every role it makes the tempest a much better pirate boat and gives it a good antisupport role while staying mobile it has the option of sitting nice and close with a large alpha from artillery or being a mobile autocannon and neutralizer machine it will still suffer from a confused midlow slot configuration so it wont be the next ganktank battleship like the mega or geddon it will actually lose dps in favor for some true versatilitythe muninn move a highslot to a midslot utility highslots dont belong on sniper hacs nevermind two of them increase speed and agility by 10 combined with the artillery changes i think it will be just fine it may not reach the dpstracking of the zealot but it will have a seperate damage type and be faster and more agile there is no reason why the amarr hac should be faster than the minmatar hacthe typhoon switch armor and shield give it some more fitting room 1000 pg40 cpu and it would go a long way into becoming the versatile boat it was designed to be

support to this thread even if a month or 2 late ive never personally had a problem with any gms due to the fact that ive only ever petitioned once which was a bug in the modules and the gm that responded handled everything quickly and professionally forget his name but hats off to him ideas i liked were hiring more gms which would lift the load on the overtaxed petition system also i like the idea of testing gm knowledge and competency as it is always nice to have the person able to fix my problems to actually know what im talking about an internal testinginvestigation team of ccp or senior gm personel could help root out a few of the bad apples that people seem to have trouble with
guess what another dissatisfied customer here just for the thrill the case where ccp conclusively lost me was a login issue that took weeks to investigate and involved mocking me with an answer containing instructions if the petition was created ingame tbh i finally dicovered that the cause of problem was a stealth virus in my computer but that does not change the fact that ccp support was outreagous and provided not simple zero but negative helpnow to contribute to the thread if you want to do something about the situation but  understandably  are not willing to assume the burden of taking legal steps against ccp consider what i did1 i decided not to pay a single penny to ccp until the service is considerably improved that means i sustain my subsrciption via gtc and plex purchases want to stress that from legal sources only  if i run out of isk before the customer service issue is solved then byby eve2 i also made sure that my friends who are potential customers are aware of the situation and wont even consider to pay a penny  as long as the problem persists3 i enacted a zero tolerance policy towards petition mishandling in the future any single time my petition is not treated as it should be i post an article on my experience in a game mag or other place on the web where it can reach the gaming community 4 plus i will address the gm in question in as a harsh and degrading way as it is possible within the scope of a civilized conversation
let me add a speculation on what will happen it is entirely true that corporations spend as little on consumer support as possible however ccp probably spends less than possible or just the managers are utterly incompetent andor undermotivated and as a consequence its support department is easily the worst in the industry this already limits costumer acquisition also contributes to erosion of existing customer base but that effect is minimal so far finally nullifying the profitability of eve and thus killing the game my guess is the top management wont notice the scope of the prolem until it is too late and then they will decide to squeeze out as much profit from eve in the little time reamining as possible this will involve finally sacking the current service team only to replace them with an even cheaper and even worse cadreone more note on historical comparison i live in a country that was under unofficial russian occupation and ruled by a puppet goverment during the communist era almost all of the official corpses  army police burocrats etc  developed a very characteristic pattern of behaviour locally called protecting the honour of the uniform that included total denial of any problem uncondicional support of any member of the corp despite the most excessive error or abuse committed and suppression of critical voices when ccp employees only notice forum threads like this one to close them but make a big point not to write even a single reply harrass ppl who dare to voice their dissatisfaction see one reported case in this thread or higher level gms concur with the obviously stupid actions of lower level ones that reeks of the odour of the same behaviour dear gms if you read this learn from history for your own sake this has spectacularly proven to be a selfdestructive attitude

hello assembly halltoday id like to talk to you about an issue that i have noticed more and more in recent weeksitem player character has been petitioning others for perceived threats or harassment but is really just a way to attack them since they cant do jack  in gameexample player a says something innocuous and innocent to player b player a and player b do not like each other player b looks for any way to take what player a said out of context as a threat or as harassment player b then sends multiple petitions for harassment or threats to the gms even though theyre not going to get any result and in the end are just wasting gm time and ruining the customer service for those of us with legitimate petition issuessolution if you make excessive petitions for obviously stupid reasons gms warn you to stop wasting their time or eventually give you a temporary ban until you stop asking like a 5 year oldthoughts with the work load that our beloved gms undergo i feel it is imperative that those wasting gm time be appropriately punished
yes i have seen this many times close to our home system wonderful idea vaden supported
supporting my own idea
supported currently people use harassment threats as ways to get rivals banned in order to cut down on enemy combat ability in addition people shouldnt get banned for cursing this is the internet get used to offensive language the game isnt rated e for a reason
supported i mean why is it that when you cant do anything ingame your best defence is the petition button thats just  silly
mucho support
fully agree also there should be harsher penalties for posting another persons personal info into local chat than calling someone an insult on forums
you have any base for your affirmation beside some guy saying in local i will petition you and maybe not even thatpretty flimsy base for your statistic unless ccp came out and give us a statistic with the different kind of petition sent you are doing exactly what you accuse other people to doaccusing them of something without anything to back up your accusationfrom what i know excessive non motivated petitions can result in a ban so nothing to change there
obviously we have no fear of the im gonna petition you local threat we are refering to the constant mail light up warning warning over absolutly nothing
supported wasting gm time is unnacceptable
abuse of the petitions system in order to effect another players gameplay should be met with a bansubmitting a petition when proper perusal of the eula would serve as a substitute should be met with a 3 strikes and you are out system
so you are getting warnings from someone i see 2 options1 it i the player sending the mail so a no issue like the treat in local unless it become too insistent and a form of harassment2 if a gm is sending the warning he has found something not fully acceptable in your behavior so the problem maybe is that what you find nothing is not acceptable by ccp standards if you feel that the gm is wrong petition and escalate the gm will receive better instruction or you will be informed that your behavior is wrong and probably why editseeing that 5 thumb ups over of total of 8 are from laconian syndicate give more credence to the opinion that your corp has a habit of excessive smacking in local or harassing more than to a problem of excessive petitions from your targets
why dont you petition them crybabyissue supported

not supporting an assumption based proposal
supporting an assumption based proposal
supported because people threatening petitions as a way of getting back at people is idiotic
this is not a troll or a flame or directed at any one person this thread is a legitimate proposal this thread is not the place for paranoia and assumptions this is a topic i feel needed to be proposed and looked at for the greater good of the eve community
if people dont want to get petitioned for something they say perhaps they should just not say it this applies both ingame and on the forumsnot supportedben

some answers to questions asked about thishow is asteroid system coverage are there issues with cartelsarkonor spawns in 151 systems almost exclusively in angel spacecrokite spawns in 228 systems almost exclusively outside of angel spacebistot spawns in 334 systems relatively independent of territorydark ochre spawns in 506 systems relatively independent of territorydue to the complex reaction formulae regions would be capable of producing either fermionic condensates arkonor or ferrogel crokite from asteroids but not both this proporation is also reflected in the demand for those respective materials ie there is a lot more crokite than arkonor and there is a lot more demand for ferrogel than fermionicshow many player hours would it take to match existing supplythe average barge pilot gets 90000 m3hr and ore quality averages 5 that means about 5625 compressed bistot or arkonor per hour or 45 compressed crokite per hourjita moves 434197 fermionic condensates per day requiring 217098 units of prometium and dysporite this would equate to 2297 compressed crimson arkonor and and 2067 compressed triclinic bistot or about 776 player hours of activityjita moves 1612606 ferrogel per day requiring 403152 units of prometium hyperflurite and ferrofluid this would equate to 3840 compressed triclinic bistot and 8532 compressed sharp crokite or about 2579 player hours of activitymatching the activity of both in just jita would require around 3355 player hours per day not counting time spent compressing or reacting and not counting market hubs outside of jita which i am way too lazy to check right nowwhats the deal with fluxed condensates and neo mercuritethese are a sticking point because their value is largely due to imbalances in the complex material reactions dysprosium and promethium are needed at 3 points by two very important reactions while thulium is only needed at 1 and neodymium is only needed at 2 one of which has a ridiculous output quantityaddressing that may put more pressure on thulium and neodymium so they do need to be a part of the solution to prevent them from being strained just like promethium and dysprosium are nowwhat about other ore typesthere are more intermediates than ore types so it would not be infeasible to make all intermediates available through various oreswhat about highsec mining lowsec mining and gravimetric siteshighsec mining could be expanded with a bit of complexity since compressing would require finding a way to get them to lowsec to get the best value out of them it would not remove refining into t1 materials as an optionlowsec is plagued with other issues that are beyond the scope of this discussion but useful reactions for hemorphite hedbergite jaspet and kernite could help give it usefulnesswhile gravimetric sites tie into the mining debate they are more a concern of availability than usefulness so i think they are outside the scope of this discussion as well
moon harvesting array iis arent seeded yet so i dont think the situation calls for changes to precursor harvesting at any point they can seed the t2 harvesting variants which will increase supply in the event they need to increase supply more they will simply modify additional r64s to have additional quantity to make use of the t2 harvesters
he never said nothing would need changing obviously theyre going to need to rewrite the codeif ccp is gonna screw up scanner with the dscanner this bad they might as well make new mechanics for itnot sure what you mean by making the cycles longer if you mean that what ccp already did was the best choice you are obviously wrong it limits actual player skill is very annoying and greatly interferes with scanningthis isnt making the simple problem any worse this is just a way to keep scanner people happy and limiting bots to 1 scan every 2 seconds exactly what ccp should want to doedit whoops talking to the wrong person
thank you for your friendly wordsmy solution reduce the on board scanner time to 02505swhich would be a reasonable timeframe
your welcome i understand we both want the scanner fixed but that doesnt change the fact you contributed nothing to this discussion other than pointing out obvious flaws to only the reasoning behind this perfectly legitimate ideayes i would love to have a 25  5 second delay instead of the 2 second delay and i would prefer it to this idea but that might just not happen and that doesnt change the fact that this is a legitimate alternative to something that may not happen an alternative that actually has the same effect as the original failfix of scanner spammers
thanks for the supporti cant understand lack of support in this threadpvpers can scan rapidlly to find targets as long as they dont try to do it constantlyserver is happy cause you cant do more than 2 sans per second as it is nowi too would prefer the old scanner  scannin as much as possiblebut i dont think ccp will ever go for thati think the game is running a lot less laggy since they introduced the 2 sec rulethis method keeps the 2 second rule while enabling burst scanning to find targets
this
i like the ops idea there may be other good ideas maybe even better ones i didnt see yet but this is one of the betterbut to be honest to fix the scanner we should know exactly what the problem was beforewas it macrorattershunters who spammed the scanner 237 and thus creating constantly heavy db loador was it used like a goontactic sry to mention just goons but like we all now ur evil and used lagcreatingmechanics before like copying bookmarks  that every one was ordered to spam scan in fleet by their fc

look how stupid you are
for you minerals are isk they are still items that enter the game from an outside source and are then turned into ships modules ammunitionsif you remove the modules even without any compensation mission returns instead of being approximatively 35 isk 20 metazero loot 10 other loot 20 salvage 15 lp you will get 45 isk 12 other loot 25 salvage 18 lpsimply removing one part of the material you will shift the balance between isk and non isk faucets and as the part that dont require to spend time looting become proportionally greater people will be pushed toward speed mission running and not looting giving a even greater push toward isk faucets further unbalancing the systemand malcanis can dream as much as he want but this will push a very small number of people toward mining most of them will be pushed toward fast running missions compensating the reduced loot with more isk from outside the system again what you will get is inflation more isk less items
would rather see the drone loot be moon minerals instead of the normal type that drops now
i think the idea holds some merit in particular the bit about moon minerals the rest is a good start but the numbers need a bit more refinementsupported in principle

if you ever stepped foot into low sec 00 or wormhole space then you would be able to shoot them if you wantedhave you guys ever tried those areas of the gameedit on another note it is your own fault anyways you normally have 20 people there for the one kill and alts not in privateers to remote rep you guys so between the 30 people you have there to loot the wreck it is snatched up my some other guy then good for that other guy for actually dragging and dropping faster
why when we can take ships from you guys without having to travel clicky1 year 3 months  17 pages of replies  this thread  funny you didnt have anything constructive to say until our war dec went active btw fail attempt on making this a privateer issue rather than a game mechanic issue 
my appologies on not using kid gloves on this thread i was simply being blunt on the facts let me rephrase in a more loving and less offensive way so no parties that read this do not get hurt over itlike in all games the mechanics of the game have to have a balance to them pros and cons if you willempire war decs have the leasure of being able to eliminate most peoples involvment in your combat because they cant shoot or they will be concorded you see thus for those parties not involved in the war dec are very limited in what they can do outside of just watching the fight they can assist one of the parties and become flagged and be a part of the fight or they can try thier luck and see if they can steal from a wreck of one of the victims of the battle i am sure there are some other ways but back to my pointby stealing they are flagged to the owner of the wreck and the corp the owner is part of provided it is not a npc corp this can be done by simply dragging and dropping the items from the wreck to thier own cargo bay just like the attacker can doby your suggestion they would become flagged not only to the owners corporation but to those involved in killing said person as well this would throw off the balance of high sec war decs your suggestion would gear this mechanic more towards hello kitty style game play or like when two wow players drop a flag and duel extremely boringthe current mechanic works fine if you want the loot simply be faster at stealing after all they are stealing from the owner of the wreck not you there is no major issue if any at allno supportbtw 1 year 3 months  17 pages of replies  this thread  privateers have war deced tri well more than just this one time i promise you it is coincidence that i replied during one of your alliances war decs on us i was compeled to be blunt about the fact of that out of all the people who could have stolen the loot from the privateers side they are complaining about neutral parties stealing before them so enough of the kill mail linking spinning of words desperate attempts to turn attention away from the fact that because someone was able to drag and drop faster than you you want a game mechanic changedi hope this reply was more affectionate and loving and no feelings were hurt in the process if you still feel that you need to link more killboard stuff or discuss your war decs no one is stoping you from starting a thread on coad

as i posted in general discussion this change makes pvp scanning extremely difficult and extra obnoxious with the constant notification that interferes with a game mechanic we have all been using for yearsif significant abuse of the scanner really does affect server performance so severely that this was a necessary change then implement some sort of antispam function to prevent prolonged sessions of updating scanthis is a ridiculous change that makes it even easier for the masses of eve who only want to earn pixel money and never have to fight to escape pvp its hard enough to catch fleeing targets already as ccp gears this game towards new players and punishes long time members and this is just another pvp nerffor those of you who say 2 seconds is not noticeable you obviously dont know how to scan in a pvp scenario please fix thissupported

as the title sayswhen looking at t2 cruisers one gets the impression that all of them come with 375aus hacs both recons hics  until you arrive at logistics which only get the plain t1 speed of 3ausalthough it is nowadays possible to rig for warp speed one isnt enough or would have to be t2 and if you dont your scimitar will slow down any gangwarpin of your snipinghac fleet oi realize this doesnt affect many people nor does it sound like a biggie but thats exactly why i think this has a chancebesides noone gets hurt 
i would think the logistics ship should warp in last and not with the main attacking forcenot supported
alas that still happens when you warp the entire aligned gang to your bookmarkcovops cloakergate cause everybody is bound to the logis bottleneck of 3aus
theres no obvious reason for logistics to warp slower than every other cruiser

this seems the most well thought out set of changes ive seen i would register the following reservations the muninn should lose both of its utility high slots there is no reason to limit the ship at its max range to what an eagle can do with so much more range i believe moving the two utility highs to a mid and a low is the right answertm here the artillery changes is a nerf to minmatar mission runners i think i have not run the numbers while i am ok with this it should be noted a bit more cpu on the cyclone please looks good astro looks like you took my ideas and polished them up nicelyliang

1 either remove entirely or give us an option to disable the animation upon opening the fitting service screen it was cute the first dozen times now its just annoying to have to wait for the sequence to complete2 increase the number of fits that can be saved by a corporation from a paltry 50 to a more practical number such as 250 again this will end up saving on database clutter as it will reduce duplicate fits saved by members of corporations3 create a new category of fits which are available alliancewide many alliances my own included have standard loadouts which are used in fleet operations and it would be a great benefit to be able to post these at the alliance level instead of depending upon individual corporations to keep their lists up to date
i support this idea
this would be pretty awesome
do this tia
please
oh god agreeing with goons
the animation used to be a lot faster for me its a pain nowalso given the number of ships available heck the number commonly used 50 seems a bitstingy
yes please

25 secondsmines less than 5 hell try 3thats both pc and mac

common sense
the fact isnt that people get petitioned for any other reason other than loose connection its more that they peition enough that gms have to say something to shut them up
is anyone here a gmcan anyone tell me the number of petitions that are a waste of timeanyone here have the authority to tell me that they know how muchoh waitnone of you arehows it feel to look like a total idiotthis is why this proposal is stupiduntil a gm speaks up or ccp says something this whole thing is bunk
repeatedly and unwarrantedly petitioning people is harassment and hence is a bannable offense anyway gms technically can already punish people for these frivolous petitionsthat said i wouldnt mind some sterner rules akin to rule 11 in real life us law to penalise offenders
perhaps if they had a proper support structure like proper companies do gms wouldnt get thisits called helpdesk  2nd line support  3rd line support gmsreally its not difficult millions of companies do itreally they doso not supported until ccp create a proper support structure  imo its their own fault cos gms get crap it shouldnt even got them in the first place
simply calling the people answering petitions something different wont help there is a first line at least theyre called gms then you can escalate to a senior gm when the first line fails to even understand what youre petitioning about would you prefer it if the gms were called helpdesk and the senior gms gms
this did happen to me and i did respond in kind with a counterpetitionunderstand this folks being baited to talk and then someone claiming anything threat or not is a real life threat and then threatening to petition you for it is a real life threat as it is now affecting your livelihood even if it is only involving 1495 monetary units of ccps choice a montha small explanation of who i am for a momentconsider me a carebear gone bad ive played on pve games since ac1 if you know the acronym give yourself a cookie and i am very used to the people behind the keyboard being people i ran large guilds knew peoples real names etcetera the usual carebear archetype stuck in a spaceship and due to rl connections with players i ended up in a very pirate yarrbeary corpthe day the incident i was involved in occurred i discovered a friend of mine from another mmo had committed suicide the last two people he had spoken to were from his mmo calllist not professionals not family think about that for a long long moment as this happened there was a candle burning on my desk for the kidsure i was smacktalking at first this is eve and indeed spaceships are serious business but then to have someone tell me they were going to report my account for telling them basically to chill out calm down and not end up like my now very real life and very dead friend was a touch wonky to me  and not just me but other third parties in system who said flat out sorry uh thats not a threat and not reportableand to tell me in such a way as to thank me afterwards for giving them ammo to use against myself and my corporation to get another ship out of spacescreenshots or it didnt happen i have the screenshots 5 years of soe games teaches you to screenshot bull when you see itcounterpetition as i said i did and in fact stated exactly as the op did  that this was an utter waste of the gms time and was in fact a real life threat to me and not the original petitioner my attention was onyl drawn to this thread at this moment as i took time to check my corp forums i do not visit or read these official forums ofteneven if it only involves me real life 15 bucks real life is real lifeand then to find out this person lives in the same city as me okay maybe i am a little rl nervous now to know someone this insanely vindictive is within 20 miles of meregardless i support this not because i am lacon but because it happened to mesheesh i hate posting here for these silly reasons and wish the gms would just respond to me even if it is a form letter to say that they received anything from me in this matter
not to be mean but you really didnt make anyone look like an idiot but im sure your epeen is nice and firm thinking you did thats some blue balls aint ittbh this is more a matter of gms having to cater to people who cant fight thier own battles gms cant voice thier own opinions because they more than likely must be as objective and unopinionated as possible judges cops nurses firefighters people who preform roles as servants for other people have to be the same way should cops complain over the 19th complaint about noise next door no they cant they will go ask the nieghbor to pleasejust do what you can to be quiet even if there is no sound coming from that house thats the point of this thread thats the point of this issue we are baited into retorting in local then randomly petitioned i can post chatlogs first person to start chargin thier keyboard lazers is the same person who petitions us all and we arent doing anything wrong but man if you scream loud enough someone is gonna do something to appease you aka give warnings squelch people its comical i mean its like we are in a nursery and the kid is flickin his nose at us so we throw a lego petition cmon just cause someone sucks and thier corp sucks and thier alliance sucks and their attempt local smack is honestly funnier than carrot top with props doesnt mean you gotta metagame for your best defensethat being said i know making an rl connection to real jobs and someone babysitting in an internet spaceship game is wierd and loose but it is similarsoo yeah about that making us look like an idiot your firing blanks again
shameless self bumpmy proposed changes are similar to astrophobics in a few key ways i feel that my changes are superior in several ways though a combination of both of our ideas may be best my thoughtsammo change swapping fusion and emp  i support swapping fusion with emp as the top damage ammo but upping the base damage to 48 may make the maelstrom a monster especially when combined with additional falloff and my proposed 8 increase to artillery damage mod tiered falloff and  ac falloff  tiered falloff has been long due on minmatar weapons a 35 increase in the base falloff might be a bit too far for autos though when you take my tempest changes into accounttempest change  astrophobics changes would make a mean tempest for taking out with battlecruiser gangs but would leave it as a relatively poor battleship by changing its bonuses to 10 damage per level  5 falloff per level the tempest goes from 10 effective guns to 9  a 10 dps loss on a ship which already has the lowest dps of all battleships with a reallistic fit sans the scorpion i propose instead giving the tempest a 10 falloff bonus and incorporating the alpha increase for artillery into its ship bonuses 4 turrets 100 role  5 dmg per level which would have a secondary effect of increasing the length of time a clip lasts by dropping the rof bonus my changes leave the tempest with the same dps as it started with but with a range bonus much like the apocalypse received astros artillery change  i would rather have the ship bonus dictate how artillery is used too much alpha can be a bad thing in some cases such as running missions and in fleet fights where ships go down in the first 2 volleys already i feel a better change is giving the tempest an effecitve 8 guns  25 damage bonus while leaving the maelstrom with its 8 guns and 25 rof bonus which gives more dps the 10 optimal bonus he proposed would not be necessary with the 8 damage mod increase the slightly increased falloff on 1400s due to their being a higher tier and the falloff bonus on a tempest artillery will still not reach out as far as tachs on an apoc but they will do more dps at their lesser range  which wont be as much less muninn change  i support astros muninn change currently the deimos is both faster and more agile than the muninntyphoon change  the typhoon is already a great boat but i suppose a bit of extra fittings wouldnt hurt in the early days having the grid to fit dual reps in its 7 lows with bonused capless weapons would have been too powerful that probably isnt the case anymore i would like some feedback perhaps an excellent post or 2 pointing out why astros proposals have more merit than mine

this is all back of the napkin but the purpose for dropping the rcu is either for a te or for an eanm my guess is eanm seems like 1400s with tremor and 3 gyros would have an alpha of 3820i do not believe this is sufficient to fix the problems with minmatar and the tempest in particular it is however better than things are now obviously and has the advantage of having taken baby steps unfortunately if ccp has shown us anything its that if they do take baby steps they dont follow up with the second and required stepliang

problemas anyone who has ever mined ice knows this system is unimaginative boring promotes afk gameplay and it promotes use of macro programs this is in my eyes bad game design and could do with a makeover to significantly improve it in this topic i lay out my solution to the process and show several ways how this solution can be reachedsolutionthere are several solutions which can be thought of to improve the current situation and make it a maybe more complex process equivalent to other industry processesthe general idea is to change the system fromlong mining process  onesecond refinery  producttoshort mining process  long refinery  productgenerally this would be balancing the process towards others ingame such as moon material processing which use reactions to form the productexamplesnow of course there are a lot of ways to make this solution work well so ive come up with a few of my owna ice processing structureadd a structure in game which can process ice the structure would require a small amount of fuel for maintenance mechanical parts and robotics and can be anchored around the sun of the solar system making it independent from possespros anchoring means that the invulnerability of starter corps is removed from ice mining as a corp is needed to deploy the structure keeps the process open as affording a pos and getting the standings is not required as it is a civilianindustrial installation could keep the price in check due to the fact that only a certain amount can be processedcons can end up making the process too cheap makes ice mining corps possible griefing targets could create bottlenecks and cause massive inflationsdeflationsb ice processing reaction in stationby using a reaction and other tools the ice is slowly processed inside the station into isotopespros price is still determined by how much people are willing to minecons keeps the starter corp invulnerability provides too much security due to a process which is hidden from any dangers keeps the process so that it can be done by 1 manc ice processing shipadd a ship which can process the ice mined by the miners it has a few production lines which can refine ice has to cost fuel this process should be done outside of a pos to prevent making the process invulnerable rp the radiations which are released within the process cause fluctuations within pos shields this ship can only operate outside starter corps due to certain hazards for which the npc corporations would not like to be responsible try at your own riskpros a new ship for eve making the ships vulnerable by turning them into unmovable reprocessing plants for a certain amount of time making it a target for pvp promotes teamplay and forces players to move out of npc corpscons causes the ice mining sector to collapse if introduced due to the ship not being available from the start makes the ice mining sector harder to get intoconclusion tldrintroduce a new process which refines the ice so that the mining aspect of it becomes less of a mind numbing burden this can be achieved in several ways as seen at examplesthats all so please leave your comments criticism and support
still sounds dull your ideas arent new or out of the box thinkingplus now rather than griefers attacking barges they will have to engage in a pos bashsomeone mentioned i believe ccp that mining was going to get an overhaul with more interactivity in order to mine rocks something similar with ice would be good
i guess it could be like gas cloud mining with the ejected debris that makes up the tail sticking around for a few days before it disperses too much  thats also a semirealistic heh eve and realism explanation for the resource being temporary
that can remedy the problem in the shortterm but not really fix it the problem is that as long as t2 is tied to a rigid generation mechanic which does not allow for players to increase production to meet rising demand then there will always be shortfalls and inflation unless the playerbase shrinks in which case you have the opposite problemalso those solutions will likely result in severe market fluctuations which might potentially destabilize both the market and 00 dramatically for instance if t2 moon miners were introduced tomorrow every alliance would install them asap on all their r64s and r32s the result being a very sudden increase in t2 material supplies and sudden drop in prices the net effect of such a change would be difficult to protect but if it either reduced or increased the profitability of r64s and r32s that could have serious repercussions throughout eve destabilizing massive alliances etcmarkets whether irl or ingame depend on a certain degree of flexibility and dependability the reason that producers of other items ingame are able to consistently meet demand and prices remain largely stable is that the supply can always be increased as long as the ingredients necessary for t2 mods and ships essential items used by the majority of players to some degree or another the market will always be in danger of significant gamealtering fluctuations
a while back i was in a corp called black lancers one day we logged on and discovered that our ticker had been changed to abc and our old ticker z had been given to another corp called sons of viagra our ceo then petitioned about it and a gm told him that our ticker had been taken away and given to another corp i recently reformed the corp and petitioned concerning the ticker situation the petition appears to be being ignored same as the 2 petitions the old ceo sentis this a normal occurrencei wasnt sure where to post this i tried posting it in the forum about corporations but it wont let me until my corp has more than 10 membersi feel that we were wronged and now the gm who did it is ignoring us

it should be possible defer corp level settings to set pos agression at an alliance standing level reasonsetting pos standings per corp is a pain in the ass in a large active and changing coalition let alone alliancethere is always some new guy who warps to the wrong friendly pos and gets popped by iti proposeyou should be able to set a pos based on alliance standings so you can set it to agress if they are ve andor neutral or if you really want to even if they are blue but out of allaince this should not overrule if a pos is shot at by said bluesif you wish you can still use the current corp based system but you can set a pos to overrule this with the alliance level standings if you wishyou should also be able to set it so that there are exceptions to the alliance standings ie neut altsadvantagesmakes alliance coalition ops and logistics much easierdisadvantagesno more wah help me your pos is scrammingshooting at me interwebs spacyship

im a contract dealer and i just wish there was such a skill im losing alot of isk today i did put up a 78b contract and it costed me 78m on taxes wtf

apearantly you can negotiate the tax for market trades so why not contracts personally i dont really care either way though

nonsense  theyre exactly comparable in both cases you have something thats random and that will occasionally make you happy or sad depending on how your luck is running but that in the aggregate regresses to the mean quickly enough that theres no pressing reason to give a damn you take your jams and dont worry you take spare crystals and dont worry this change would make almost zero difference unless youre crazy and fly with breakable crystals and no spares and if you do that you deserve to be in exactly the same boat as anyone else who doesnt bring spare ammo to a fight youre making a mountain out of a molehill
easy for you to support it because your ammo only cost 1000  2k isk per shot and those shots are guaranteed to cause some hurtwith charges like hybrid missiles and projectile youve got a rough idea you can fight for before retreating for some more ammo same with crystal damage with this idea youll have no idea how long your crystals will last or how long youll be able to fight forso no not supported
no idea please assuming 11000 break chance one spare crystal gives you a 99 chance of making 436 shots without breaking two spares 824 shots 10 spares 5431 shots and if youre worried about the other 1 you dont really need to be  you still have a 999 of 4046 shots or a 9999 chance of 3116 shots you have a better chance of losing the fight due to a power outage than you do of getting less than 3000 shots off your 10 spares and remember theres the ones that go for 5000 shots without breaking to compensate you also what fancycrystal fit doesnt fit t1 crystals for backup youll still be able to fight even if every single one breaks thats not literally true of dreads but dreads dont fight solo and when you apply these numbers to fleets theyre indistinguishable from the status quo seriously people regression to the mean is more powerful than youre giving it credit for just because something is random does not make it unpredictable

good to know  thank you nika 
note who i quoted if you feel offended for generalizations dont do the same i do generalizations based on what they write in this thread i take the example i see those here and in other section of this same forum and extrapolate from thereit is fully possible there is a less vocal majority but the post i see give me a very negative opinionthe thread based on the thread title would be worth supporting but not based on the argument and most of the examples usedthis is hardly an argument about useless gm petitions like most of the ship reimbursement requests the whole thread is arguing against people petitioning perceived verbal harassment in game caldinea if this idea was somewhat accepted by ccp you counterpetition would have been labeled as useless by the parameter suggested here

is quoting the second sentence and not the first when everyone else can use the scrollup function to see what i actually wrote a useful tactici did not receive a warningmust i repeat myself for selective readers
and as an addition considering the responses to this thread that are rather abrasive and to be honest useless to my very specific and personal situation i will wait until a gm responds in game the community here save one or two individuals speaking in regards to those not associated with my alliance even seems to simply be using this thread as an excuse to bashyes some of my corpmates and alliancemates can be abrasive well considering what i have seen so far of the public forums this is likely because it is normal behavior so um yes insert scathing comments here sprinked with a disguise of thesaurusbased intelligence here so i fit inthis will be my last statement on the matter save to an actual member of ccp staff volunteer or otherwise
the one getting the warnings was anderson williams

not supported
i think you should stop posting now and back away from the keyboardgoldseriously are you stoned or something
does this proposal provide any advantages that your wallet does not i dont see any and i cant really imagine any that would justify such an odd system and as such i dont support it
why
not needed just like in the real world you can buy various goods  minerals to store your iskit makes no sense but if it makes you feel better buy up all the tritanium you can get your hands onor if you wanna get close to the gold buy platinum
not supported if you need to hide your isk go buy plexcards or transfer it to a banking alt alternativly you can send it to me and ill keep it safe for you
4 axes w magic find  ftw 
the advantage would be that if you somehow got your account hacked all your isk isnt just magically siphoned off as long as you store it in safe place as an item gold would allow you to get back the exact amount of isk that you put into gold when you resell it to the npc banks unlike plexes and faction items whose price is subject to market conditions possibly you could do other things with goldplus pirates love goldditto for you
heres a thought dont be a dumbass when it comes to your account security
whats to stop said hacker from getting your goldgo back to wow where you came fromive never had a problem course i dont buy isk either
doesnt ccp return your stuff if a hacker gets into your account and steals your things besides they can steal the gold just as easily as they can steal the isk  private contracts are wonderful things and no you couldnt do other things with it  an iskequivalent asset has no interesting economic features whatsoever itd be a poor substitute for cash
at this point stop play eve and go play wow they got gold and ty gameplay
there are already precious commodities that you can invest in and store there is no need for thisif you are concerned that your account may be compromised1 do not visit websites that conduct sales of isk or other in game items for real world money it is not only a violation of the eula its plain foolish from a security standpoint2 do not visit external links from the eve forum unless you know and trust the destination site3 do not give out your account information to anyone for any reason 4 do change your password periodicallythese are all things that should be common sense and provide plenty of security for you account without resorting to investment in commodities to shelter your assets from hackersnot supported

i would welcome a new mining system with open arms but as it stands this seems unlikely within a year timespawn the winter expansion will be geared towards a new sovereignty system and thus making the promised industrial expansion more than 1 year later than it should have been released so i believe a total overhaul of the system is still some time awayhowever i still believe that the ice mining process should move away from the macro provoking system its now i have started this thread specifically towards a solution which changes the process of the profession without the need for a complete overhaulmy idea are not really innovative or new and i have seen some excellent suggestions on the boards but most if not all have disappeared under a ton of other topics which is a shame however the main idea is just to change the process around by making mining times short and processing times long i have outlined a few simple options how this could be donethe structure i proposed is not a pos module but more a standalone building which has no defensive structures this will make it vulnerable to attacks meaning you will actually have to defend it and it will keep the ice mining industry open for anyone as you dont need standings or a load of money to place maintain and buy it for anyone who cant afford the structure from the start i think others could see opportunities to exploit this and offer their services

i think it still needs some tweaks to the moon min output numbers but its otherwise a very good suggestion supported
very much supported price stability is a good thing as is a general decrease in t2 costs
i like this not only will it open the t2 production market to smaller scale corporations but it will also give the bigger alliance who own the entire market with their moons some more competition next to adding an actually interesting dimension into the mining profession
this doesnt make mining any more interesting and highend ores have never had a problem with their value getting too low meaning that they dont need the price supports while i appreciate the thought i dont believe that this is the correct solution to either problem
supporting a proposal which both limits moon profitability and decreases t2 prices
not especially alchemy increases the hard cap somewhat but it doesnt remove it or even really delay it in practice the gains from alchemy mostly went towards making the exploit removal not blow up the market entirely and in replacing the cheaters dysporite my goal is to make it so that there is no more of a cap on the games supply of dysprosium than there is of tritanium moons should still exist and they should still be relevant and profitable but the game shouldnt be forced to have a major segment of the market labour under a hard cap that was set in a different era and that is far too low for modern t2 production
of all the solutions alchemy is a deadend and should not be pursued any further it does not fix the scaling issues and is already almost running near maximum capacity the current formulae do not fix the material type issues that made it necessary in the first place dysprosium and promethium were required in excessive amounts by complex reactions the replacements for their outputs require excessive amounts of cadmium and chromium instead moon mining rewards land races much more than it rewards individual effort what effort is spent on it is spent in the most tedious fashion imaginable the less emphasis put on it the betteri proposed my own solution to this which is reacting asteroid ores into t2 materials a solution with many secondary benefits and builtin marketbased controls to the potential negative effects ie oversupplythread here
supporting what hersh said put some moon mins in roids or something maybe in belt rat loot dont care really as long as its not only available from moonsjust say no to static resources in mmos

thats rediculous ccp respond here plz
assembly hall isnt a place for this demand a senior gm response to the petition so you get a reply why this happened if you are still not getting a response contact internal affairs about the issue internal affairs is a division of ccps research and statistics departmentif you have a reasonable suspicion that an employee is abusing hisher position in some way in the game you can contact internal affairs directly by sending an email to internalaffairsccpgamescom please note that petitions are not a tool to contact internal affairskeep in mind that if such matters are to be investigated you will need to include some solid evidence within your mail 
gm shouldnt be fiddeling with corp tickers but do more usefull thingsanother example to support thiscompetence of the gm department revised
yeah thats what i am afraid of i have no evidence except for what they may or may not be able to see if theres any sort of history or records they can look ati got a response to my petition concerning this and it seems like they ignored what i told them and tried telling me that my corp has always had the same ticker so i replied and once again stressed that i reopened my old corp and the old corp was where the wrongdoing took place
thatd pretty much be the status quo yes itd still pretty much be the case even if corporate security were sane for that matter  roles imply trust and always will still thats not an excuse for poor game design trust should not be binary between cant build a hobgoblin and can untraceably kill titans just because workarounds exist for the problem doesnt mean that its not a problem
thats not the pointidiot or saboteur or notits just more options to give or stop access thats all
for the unfamiliar the problem is that installing a job at a pos requires installing it as a corporation job installing a corporation job requires the factory manager role the factory manager role also lets you cancel any corporation job resulting in the loss of all of the construction material in the process it leaves no trail so even if someone screws your entire production line its not possible to know who did itthis make it utterly impossible to run a construction corp without an extreme level of trustthe game already tracks who installed corp jobs which is why you can rightclick on the jobs and it will show you who installed it so the only thing they really need to do is add a factory operator role or something that allows you to install jobs but only cancel ones you installed
this seems to address ccps server concerns while allowing for oldstyle scanning supported
reallylets see the idea againand how it will work on practiceattacker i have 20 quick scan no problem i will get every target way faster gooddefender i need to scan constantly for hostiles and probes ops my scanner has overheated now i cant use it for 20 or 40 seconds while it cool down and it will become even worse if this is the prelude to removing local in 00so instead of everyones a winner we have the attacker get the advantage not supported
the defender doesnt need to scan in quick succession he only wants to know if something is on 360 and log off once he finds ships or probes
seeing how probes with the help of a directional scanner can get a 100 hit in less than 6 seconds the defender need to scan at least every 3 seconds
usually probes need to travel that doesnt happen instantly but agreed one scan every 34 seconds is perfectly fine for the defender so where is the problem againapart from giving the attacker a chance as welledit in case you didnt understand the op idea you would be able to constantly scan every 2 seconds without overheating the thing
using the numbers in the op youd be able to scan once per 2 seconds without worrying but nonuse for 40 seconds would build up a buffer of 20 scans you could use in quick succession if you needed to on the whole itd take off the server spamming that ccp worries about but itd also let players do a flurry to find someone
i can only think of tie fighter game when i see this thread just a circle which represents your range of scan and some dots here and there that represents objects the scan would be automatic the circle would be 360 but would be cut like a pie of course if you turn it down lower let say to 90 or 15 for example since you dont have to scan you might have a feeling that its fasterbut its just an illusion since you dont have to think about it

are you a programmer no then stop trying to post like you know thingsall in all your idea is poorly thought out and generally bad
this has already been proposed and taken to ccp
the ds is already used to do similar things to combat probes theres no obvious reason why it couldnt be made better at it as long as it doesnt give you 100 hits i dont think that this is the solution but its not inherently wrong
the original idea can be found here
